              Maybe wrong spelling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are four kinds of persons
              (Sotapanna,Sakadagami,Anagami,and Arahant) according to their different
              enlightenments.These four persons are called Ariya.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sotapanna </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The person who got the first enlighenment of
              Nibbana  called Sotapanna Magga  is sotapanna person.Sotapanna Megga
              has eliminated the Sakkaya -ditthi (egoistic wrong view) and <em>(sakkaya-ditthi),
              atta-ditthi </em>and doubt <em>(vicikiccha) </em>about Dhamma. Your attention is
              then towards the cessation of suffering. That borderline knowledge is known as <em>Gotrabhu-nana.
              'Gotra' </em>means <em>Puthujjana </em>or descendants. On this border, descendants
              of a <em>Puthujjana </em>are cut off totally. Then there is no more <em>Puthujjana. </em>Once you pass that borderline, you become a Noble One <em>(Ariya) </em>because
              you have cut off the <em>Puthujjana </em>lineage. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When
              a meditator has attained purification of mind, his mind becomes sharp enough to
              penetrate into the true nature of the mind-body processes. Then he
              distinguishes between the mental and physical processes and realises the
              specific characteristics of mental and physical phenomena. This is the first
              stage of insight. When he can realise the specific characteristics of mental
              and physical phenomena and can distinguish between <em>nama </em>and <em>rupa, </em>he
              can destroy <em>sakkaya-ditthi </em>and <em>atta-ditthi </em>for the time being. At
              this stage of insight, he has uprooted <em>sakkaya-ditthi </em>and <em>atta-ditthi. </em>When he is not experiencing this insight, <em>sakkaya ditthi </em>and <em>atta-ditthi </em>will come back to him, although not strongly. <em>Sakkaya-ditthi </em>is only
              uprooted or exterminated by attaining the first stage of enlightenment, <em>Sotapatti-magga-
              nana.</em></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      We
              should understand the concepts of <em>sakkaya-ditthi </em>and <em>atta-ditthi </em>from
              the point of view of Hinduism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      According
              to Hinduism or Brahmanism, the whole world was created by <em>Mahabrahma. </em>This
              <em>Mahabrahma</em>has many names such as, <em>Isvara, Paramatma</em>and <em>Prajapati.
              'Pati' </em>means creator or master. <em>Praja</em>means creatures or living beings.
              So he is the master of living beings because he created them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      <em>Paramatma </em>is a Sanskrit or Hindu term. In Pali it is <em>Paramatta. </em>When wedivide
              this <em>Paramatma </em>into two words, it is <em>Parama </em>and <em>atma. </em>Here
              <em>parama </em>means the noblest, the holiest; <em>'atma' </em>means soul or self.
              So <em>Paramatma </em>means the holiest soul. Some translate this word as the big
              self or big soul. This soul is big enough to create the world and living
              beings. When the condition of the world was good enough for living beings to
              live in, he created all living beings- men, decas, Brahmas,and animals. He even
              created tigers, lions and poisonous snakes, which are a great danger to man.
              When <em>Mahabrahma </em>or <em>Paramatma </em>first created living beings, they
              were like corpses; they could not move, sit or stand. Then <em>Mahabrahma </em>wanted
              to make these creatures come to life. So he put a soul into each creature or
              living being. Then all the creatures got up and moved, stood, sat and so on. In
              this way, that small soul or self existed in every living being according to
              Brahmanism. Even an insect has a small soul in it. That soul is called <em>Jiva-atta. </em>It is everlasting and indestructible and cannot he destroyed by any means,
              even an atomic bomb, because it is supported by <em>Mahabrahma </em>or <em>Prajapati. </em>But when this body is about to disintegrate, that soul knows that the body
              is about to disintegrate - so it has to be prepared to leave that body and
              reincarnate into another body. It has to take existence either in a lower or
              higher world, depending on its <em>kamma </em>in this life. If that soul performs
              meritorious deeds in this life, these meritorious deeds are good <em>kamma </em>so
              they lead the soul to a higher level of existence. When the soul reincarnates
              into another body, we call it reincarnation. But that everlasting soul, <em>jiva-atta </em>or self cannot be destroyed in the next existence either. So the cycle of
              reincarnation continues.. This is what Brahmanism believes about soul. In
              short. according to Brahmanism, there is an everlasting entity in us, the
              so-called self, soul or ego.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      That
              belief or concept of an everlasting entity, soul, self or ego, known as <em>Atta-ditthi, </em>is due to the non-realisation of the true nature of the natural processes.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      We
              are not Hindus but we have the concept of a soul, though the concept is not so
              strong because we follow the doctrine of the Buddha. We understand
              theoretically that there is no soul or self or that there is no everlasting
              entity, yet we believe that when a person dies, the soul comes out of the body
              and stays near his house or his corpse or his coffin. It Is a common belief
              that if we do not make offerings to the monks <em>(bhikkhu ) </em>and have not
              shared our meritorious deeds with the departed ones, the soul has to live
              around us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      Though
              we believe the doctrine of the Buddha, we still have this concept of <em>atta-ditthi, </em>and based on this concept we have another concept of personality,
              individuality, a being, a man or a woman <em>-sakkaya-ditthi (sakkaya </em>here
              means <em>nama </em>and <em>rupa, ditthi </em>means wrong or false view). We have
              this concept because we do not comprehend the specific and common
              characteristics of the mind-body processes; we take them to be everlasting.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      If
              you ask yourself, "Will I die tomorrow?" - you dare not answer the
              question. If I say you are going to die tomorrow, you will get angry with me
              because you have the idea of permanency of mental and physical processes. You
              think your mind-body processes are permanent; at least until tomorrow. Yes, that
              is the idea of permanency. You hold it because you have not realised the
              appearance and disappearance of the process of mental and physical phenomena.
              If you see the constant, instant appearance and disappearance of mental and
              physical phenomena, you will not believe them to be permanent.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      Theoretically
              you understand that none of the mental and physical processes last even a
              second according to the doctrine of the Lord Buddha, but practically you do not
              believe it because you have not realised their impermanent nature. Only if you
              have personal experience of the <em>Dhamma, </em>do you conclude that it is
              impermanent. You can then accept, "I may not even live until tomorrow. I
              may die this very second because every phenomena is subject to impermanence
              Actually, when a man has not realised the arising and passing away of mental
              arid physical phenomena, he takes them to be permanent. The idea of personality
              is based on the belief in a permanent entity within us. So <em>atta-ditthi </em>and
              <em>sakkaya-ditthi </em>are the same.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      If
              we say, "Now I am lifting my hand", then you ask me who is lifting
              the hand. I will say, "I am lifting the hand." Who is that 'I'? A <em>bhikkhu, </em>a man, or a being who is living? If we do not believe in the permanent
              nature of mind-body processes, we do not take them to be a being. But actually,
              the dual process of mentality and physicality which constitutes a so-called
              person is subject to change, arising and passing away but we do not realise it.
              We take this dual process to be a person, a being, a dog or an animal. This
              view is called <em>sakkaya-ditthi. </em>Unless we can rightly comprehend these
              mind and body processes in their true nature we are unable to overcome or
              destroy this false view.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      That
              is why the Buddha teaches us to be mindful of any activity of mind and body, or
              any mental and physical processes as they really are, so that we can realise
              the two processes as natural processes. This insight is called knowledge of <em>Sabhava-lakkhana </em>(right understanding of the specific characteristics or individual
              characteristics of mental and physical phenomena). This insight knowledge
              destroys the concept of soul or self, person or being which is the main cause
              of defilements <em>(kilesas) </em>such as greed, anger, delusion and conceit and
              so on. So we can say that this concept of a soul or a self is the seed of all
              defilements. When we have exterminated the seed there will not arise any
              defilements and we have got rid of suffering. That is:</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">      'Sakkaya-ditthi
              pahanaya' means to overcome this false view of a soul, a self or a person; <em>'sato' </em>means mindful; <em>bhikkhu </em>means monk. A <em>bhikkhu </em>who is mindful
              of phenomena must strive or practise to overcome the false view. When he is
              able to destroy that <em>sakkaya-ditthi, </em>he is sure to deliver himself from
              all kinds of suffering. This <em>sakkaya-ditthi </em>is the cause of all kinds of
              defilements or the seed of all defilements. So we have to try to exterminate it
              through right understanding of mental and physical processes by means of
              mindfulness meditation.</span></p>

              <p>Let me summarize some of characteristics</p>
              <p>1) already eliminated<span> all the cetasikas and defilements</span></p>
              <p>2) already eliminated all kinds of Karma that will cause of next life(rebirth)</p>
              <p>3)No fear( Even when the lightning occur near Arahant,When the very big and frightening sound occur near Arahant, there is no fear in the mind).No fear of death</p>
              <p>4)Must convert to monk form if he get the four enlighenment with human clothes.</p>
              <p>5)No more feeling coming from Six sense of doors(eye,ear,nose,tongue,body and mind)(For example, when he see very beautiful girl, his eye consiousness has neither beautiful nor ugly.When he see the very bad image, his eye consiousness has neither good nor bad .He only has natural eye consciousness on the object.)</p>
              <p>6)No more attachment to name convention coming from six sense of doors(eye,ear,nose,tongue,body and mind)(For example,we can give any name to all the matters and mind to be easy to understand.let say after one invent new electronic deivce, one give the name to it to be called computer.Hence, everyone follow him to use computer term for new device so that everyone can understand it.Actually there is no computer.It is just only name.Anybody can give any name to this new electronic devices. Electronic device is only matter) .Arahant will use name to explain the Dhamma for people to understand.But there is no attachement to name</p>
              <p>7)Before Arahant pass away, he may or may not be determined to let his body becomes relics.Most of Arahant is determined to let his body becomes relics before passed away for the people to pay homage his relics.After we burn the Arahant dead body , his body becomes relics.</p>
              <p>8) No more rebirth after passed away( Already in his Nibbana. Nobody in this world cannot awake or call him to come back because Nibbana has no cause and effect with any Dhamma)</p>

              <p>Magga Appanà Vãthis<br>Those, who undertake insight-meditation, meditate on the three<br>characteristics of existence (ti-lakkhaõa) namely, impermanence<br>(anicca), suffering or misery (dukkha) and not-self (anatta). After<br>developing ten insight-knowledges (vipassanà-¤àõas), the<br>realization of the Path and its Fruition (magga and phala) follows<br>up. There are four levels of magga and phala. The maggaappanà<br>vãthis run as follows.<br>(Manda-pa¤¤à)<br>Na–Da– “Ma–Pa–U–Nu–Go–Mag–Pha–Pha”–Bha–<br>(Tikkha-pa¤¤à)<br>Na–Da– “Ma–U–Nu–Go–Mag–Pha–Pha–Pha”–Bha–Bha–<br>1 When one of the three characteristics of existence enters<br>the avenue of the mind-door of a puthujjana (worldling<br>or one who is bound by all ten fetters), the lifecontinuum<br>vibrates twice and becomes arrested (Na-<br>Da). Then, observing and considering the characteristics<br>of existence, mano-dvàràvajjana (Ma) arises once.<br>Then one of the four ¤àõa-sampayuttaü mahà-kusala cittas,<br>observing the characteristics of existence, functions<br>three times as parikamma (Pa), upacàra (U), anuloma (Nu),<br>and then, observing Nibbàna, functions once more as<br>gotrabhu (Go). Then sotàpatti-magga javana arises once<br>observing Nibbàna. Then, without any lapse in time,<br>the fruition of the magga, i.e., sotàpatti-phala citta,<br>functions twice as appanà-javana. Then bhavaïga cittas<br>sink into life-continuum and the person comes out of<br>magga-vãthis. (If the person is of tikkha-pa¤¤à, parikamma</p>
              <p>is omitted and phala-javana occurs three times.)</p>
              <p>Note:<br>In the above magga-vãthi, parikamma, upacàra, anuloma and<br>gotrabhu signify the following things:<br>Pa: parikamma: preparation of magga,<br>U: upacàra: proximity of magga,<br>Nu: anuloma: adaptation or connection; it harmonies the<br>lower cittas with the upper cittas,<br>Go: gotrabhu the citta that cuts the puthujjana-lineage<br>to form the ariya-lineage (ariya – holy).</p>
              <p><br>Once a person becomes an ariya, he is never reverted back to<br>a puthujjana again. Thus gotrabhu has to cut the puthujjana-lineage<br>only once. So in later magga- and phala-vãthis, Vo – vodàna (meaning<br>purification) is inserted in place of Go – gotrabhu.</p>
              <p><br>2 To realize the second magga and phala, the sotàpanna or<br>sotapan (stream-winner who has realized the first magga<br>and phala) has to meditate on the three characteristics of<br>existence again. When the second magga-vãthi arises, it runs<br>as above—the only changes necessary are: ‘vodàna’ in place<br>of ‘gotrabhu’, ‘sakadàgamà-magga’ in place of ‘sotàpatti-magga’<br>and ‘sakadàgamà-phala’ in place of ‘sotàpatti-phala’.<br>After this second magga-vãthi, the person becomes a<br>sakadàgamà or sakadàgam (once-returner, i.e. he will return<br>to the kàma-abodes just once).</p>
              <p><br>3 If the sakadàgam undertakes insight-meditation further, he<br>may develop the third magga-vãthi which runs as the second<br>magga-vãthi—just change ‘sakadàgamà’ into ‘anàgàmi’.<br>The person now becomes an anàgàmà or anàgam<br>(non-returner, i.e., he will not be reborn in the kàmaabodes<br>again).</p>
              <p>4 If the anàgam undertakes insight-meditation further, he<br>may develop the fourth magga-vãthi. This vãthi again runs<br>as before—just change ‘anàgàmà’ into ‘arahatta’. The<br>person now becomes an arahant (the perfect one).<br>Phala-samàpatti Vãthis</p>
              <p><br>There are four noble individuals (ariya-puggala): the streamwinner<br>(sotàpanna), the once-returner (sakadàgamà), the nonreturner<br>(anàgàmà) and the perfect one (arahat).<br>Each noble individual may enter the meditative absorption<br>corresponding to the fruition of the path he has attained. By<br>doing so, he is enjoying the peace of Nibbàna, and during this<br>absorption phala-samàpatti vãthis occur as follows.<br>(Manda-pa¤¤à)<br>Na–Da– “Ma–Pa–U–Nu–Vo–Pha–Pha– many times” Bha–<br>(Tikkha-pa¤¤à)<br>Na–Da– “Ma–U–Nu–Vo–Pha–Pha– many times” Bha–<br>In developing the phala-samàpatti vãthis, the noble individuals<br>have to meditate on the three characteristics of existence<br>until the phala-samàpatti vãthi arises.</p>
              <p><br>1 When one of the three characteristics of existence enters<br>the avenue of the mind-door of a sotàpanna, the lifecontinuum<br>vibrates twice as bhavaïga-calàna and<br>bhavaïgupaccheda and becomes arrested. The manodvàràvajjana<br>considers the object and decides whether<br>it is good or bad. Then one of the four ¤àõa-sampayuttaü<br>mahà-kusala cittas, observing the tãlakkhaõa object,</p>
              <p>functions three times as parikamma (omit in tikkha-pa¤¤àperson), upacàra and anuloma, and, observing Nibbàna,functions once as vodàna. After that sotàpatti-phala citta,observing Nibbàna, functions as appanà-javana many<br>times as long as the person wishes up to seven days.<br>Then bhavaïga cittas sink into life-continuum and the<br>person arises from phala-samàpatti.</p>
              <p><br>2 When one of the three characteristics of existence enters<br>the avenue of the mind-door of a sakadàgamà, the lifecontinuum<br>vibrates twice as bhavaïga-calàna and<br>bhavangupaccheda and becomes arrested. The manodvàràvajjana<br>considers the object and decides whether<br>it is good or bad. Then one of the four ¤àõa-sampayuttaü<br>mahà-kusala cittas, observing the tãlakkhaõa object,<br>functions three times as parikamma (omit in tikkha-pa¤¤à<br>person), upacàra and anuloma, and, observing Nibbàna,<br>functions once as vodàna. After that sakadàgamà-phala<br>citta, observing Nibbàna, functions as appanà-javana<br>many times as long as the person wishes up to seven<br>days. Then bhavaïga cittas sink into life-continuum and<br>the person arises from phala-samàpatti.<br>3 When one of the three characteristics of existence enters<br>the avenue of the mind-door of anàgàmà, the lifecontinuum<br>vibrates twice as bhavaïga-calàna and<br>bhavaïgupaccheda and becomes arrested. The manodvàràvajjana<br>considers the object and decides whether<br>it is good or bad.

              <p>Then bhavaïga cittas sink into life-continuum and the<br>person arises from phala-samàpatti.</p>
              <p><br>4. When one of the three characteristics of existence enters<br>the avenue of the mind-door of an arahant, the lifecontinuum<br>vibrates twice as bhavaïga-calàna and<br>bhavaïgupaccheda and becomes arrested. The manodvàràvajjana<br>considers the object and decides whether<br>it is good or bad.

After that arahatta-phala citta,<br>observing Nibbàna, functions as appanà-javana many<br>times as long as the person wishes up to seven days.<br>Then bhavaïga cittas sink into life-continuum and the<br>person arises from phala-samàpatti.</p>
              <p>Nirodha-samàpatti Vãthi<br>‘Nirodha-samàpatti’ means ‘attainment of extinction’. This vãthi<br>is developed to suspend temporarily all consciousness and<br>mental activity, following immediately upon the semi-conscious<br>state called ‘sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception’<br>(nevasa¤¤à-n’àsa¤¤à-yatana jhàna).<br>Only anàgàmi or arahant who has mastered all the nine<br>absorption (jhànas) is able to develop the nirodha-samàpatti vãthi.<br>The procedure for developing the nirodha-samàpatti vãthi is as<br>follows.<br>First of all the person enters the råpàvacara first-jhàna, comes<br>out of it and meditates on the jhàna components as to their</p>
              <p>characteristics of impermanence, suffering and non-self. He<br>repeats this procedure with the råpàvacara second-, third-, fourthand<br>fifth-jhànas, and then also with the aråpàvacara first-, secondand<br>third-jhànas.<br>Then he makes four resolutions (adhiññhàna).<br>1 May I remain in nirodha-samàpatti for one hour, two<br>hours…, one day, two days…, or seven days (provided<br>the period does not exceed his life-span which he can<br>know).<br>2 May my body, the things I am using and the building I<br>am living be not harmed nor destroyed by any means<br>(he can demarcate the area as much as he likes).<br>3 May I come out of the nirodha-samàpatti as soon as Lord<br>Buddha wishes to see me (this is at the time when the<br>Buddha is alive).<br>4 May I come out of the nirodha-samàpatti as soon as the<br>congregation of monks wishes my presence (this is done<br>out of respect for the congregation of monks).<br>Now the person develops the aråpàvacara fourth-jhàna and<br>soon after the occurrence of neva-sa¤¤à-n’àsa¤¤à-yatana citta as<br>appanà-javana for two conscious moments, the stream of<br>consciousness is cut off—no cittas, cetasikas and cittaja-råpa<br>(corporeality formed by citta) arise any more.<br>The person will remain in this state of extinction of<br>consciousness, its concomitants and cittaja-råpa till the end of<br>the period he has resolved to remain in nirodha-samàpatti. Though<br>he does not breathe, eat, drink or know anything, he is still alive.<br>When he comes out of the nirodha-samàpatti, anàgàmà-phala citta<br>arises once as appanà-javana if he is an anàgàmi, or arahatta-phala<br>citta arises once as appanà-javana if he is an arahant. Then bhavaïga<br>cittas sink into life-continuum.</p>

              is the inherent nature of an AriyÄ� to be obsessed with a persistent
              desire for escape from the perilous round of rebirths, characterized by
              constant perishing of mental and material phenomena. One such AriyÄ� to
              be, faring in SaÑsarÈ’s innumerable existences, happened to be born as
              a parrot during the time of Kassapa Buddha who appeared in the
              Bhadda-kappa (the present world) which is blessed by Five Buddhas.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> One
              day, the parrot happened to meet Kassapa Buddha. Being endowed with
              innate wisdom, he knew that it was a Noble Personage. He was inspired
              to pay homage to the Buddha. He offered a fruit to the Buddha
              respectfully with his wings touching each other above his head. The
              Buddha out of compassion accepted the bird’s gift and said, “May all
              your wishes come to fulfillment”. The parrot watched the Buddha with
              revered eyes as the Buddha departed, his little heart full of joy,
              uttering “O, what a good deed I have done!” Since the donee was the
              Buddha himself and the donor made his gift with strong conviction, the
              resultant was bound to be fruitful. The parrot was reborn in the good
              destinations of the seven planes of sensual existence under glorious
              circumstances. After faring in a number of Celestial realms, he was
              reborn in the human world as a great Tikicchaka Physician (N.B. The
              Sayadaw once said: “Those who had met me during my existence as a great
              Physician will come to me now and take up the practice of Dhamma under
              me.”) During the time of Gotama Buddha, the great Physician was reborn
              as the famous Barr-mai Sayadaw, mentor to King Man|hÄ� of Thaton,
              Thuwanna Bhumi, the great patron of the Buddha’s Teaching. After
              passing away from that existence, the future Sun Lun Sayadaw was reborn
              as a child of U Thant and Daw Tok of Sun Lun village in the southern
              part of Myingyan Township in Upper Burma. (N.B. During the British
              administration the country was divided into Upper Burma and Lower
              Burma, the upper region being still under Burmese King.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              the time of conception, the father had a dream in which a man of noble
              appearance came to his house and asked for permission to stay in the
              house. U Thant told that man, not to stay with his family because he
              was very poor. Although he refused many times, the stranger insisted to
              stay, and at last had to agree. The family took the dream as
              auspicious. The mother Daw Tok after nine months of pregnancy, in the
              tenth month give birth to the child, the future- Sun Lun Sayadaw, at
              the few minutes before 4 am on the second waning day of Tabaung (March)
              in 1239 ME, which was the year 2421 of the SÄ�sanÄ� Era. The child had a
              particularly bright appearance. At the time of naming him, with the
              usual washing of the hair, in view of the good omens, he was named
              Maung Kyaw Din (Meaning Master Famous).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (U Thant and Daw Tok had  three children; Ma Thinn, Ko Kyaw Din and Ko Aung Khaing).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Ko
              Kyaw Din was placed under the Min-Kyaung Sayadaw of Myingyan for his
              education. He was a dull pupil and did not get far in his studies. So
              his father U Thant found him a menial post like his, in the office of
              the Deputy Commissioner of Myingyan.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> When
              Ko Kyaw Din grew up, he married Ma Shwe Yi of his native village. The
              couple begot four children but three died in infancy and only a son by
              the name of Ko Shein (a) Ko Kan Nyunt survived to this day.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Ko
              Kyaw Din thought that his work as an office-boy in government office
              held no good prospects and resigned the job at the age of thirty. He
              worked as a cultivator in the family estate, a dry patch of land. One
              day, one U San Tin, said to achieved occult powers and was patronized
              by the (four) Great Guardian Kings of CatumahÄ�rÄ�ja DevÈs Realm, came to
              him and recited some strange prophetic words without any context. His
              words roughly might be translated that:</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Amai Bok’s skeins got  tangled, who’s there to clear up this mess? The shuttle moves  along amidst the threads of skeins.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">The ruined stump of the  pagoda emits rays! Ma Khway is</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">dressed
              in the beautiful longyi of ‘Pondaw’ design with a green fringe and a
              checkered blue. The weaver’s gear made of ‘Kyun-bo’ teak puts forth a
              sound that can be heard from a distance of ten thousand Y|janÄ�s.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U San Tin then explained his  words as follows: “The skeins that are tangled get entangled when put to the  loom, isn’t it?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Yes, of course”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> That
              being so, U Kyaw Din, the tangled skein called AvijjÄ� (Ignorance) by
              far more tangled than the skeins, will have to be disentangled by you
              with Sati (Mindfulness). A weaving factory will appear south of Sun Lun
              Village. When it does, you will have to promote the SÄ�sanÄ� at
              Kyun-bo-pin-kone. When you take up the work of promoting the SÄ�sanÄ�,
              there will be two teak pillars there. The meaning of the old stump of
              the pagoda emitting rays fore-tells the emergence of practice of the
              Buddha’s Teaching that has so far been forgotten by the people”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Oh, all humbug, my friend,”  retorted U Kyaw Din. </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Just wait and see” said U  San Tin.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> That
              year, they purchased another plot of cultivable land. At the beginning
              of the raining season U Kyaw Din and Daw Shwe Yi went to their field to
              clear it up to start ploughing. U Kyaw Din said to his wife: “We shall
              sow sessamum in our field this year. If we reap a yield of fifty
              baskets we shall offer a thousand lights at the pagoda”. Daw Shwe Yi
              replied, “Why fifty? If we get forty baskets we will make an offering
              of one thousand lights!” “Good, Ma Shwe Yi,” said the husband, let us
              be true to our word. At our offering we won’t have a procession with
              music as is the custom. In case the girls in the procession got their
              jewellery lost, it would mean botheration for us. Let’s make it a
              simple affair”.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> A
              few days later, they sowed sessamum seeds in the field. When the seeds
              sprouted there was no rain at the beginning of the rainy season and the
              tiny plants withered. Fortunately, they survived till the rains come.
              Other fields were not so fortunate: the plants did not survive. U Kyaw
              Din’s fields yielded forty baskets of sessamum- exactly forty!</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> True
              to their words, they pressed the sessamum into oil. Daw Shwe Yi
              proposed that nine viss of the oil be marked for offering of one
              thousand lights; nine viss would be offered to the SaÑghÈ. U Kyaw Din
              asked her how many bhikkhus would be the donees. Daw Shwe Yi said “four
              Bhikkhus, and two viss to be donated to each. The remaining one viss
              should see to the congregation at the ceremony”. And U Kyaw Din agreed.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              the full moon day of Thadingyut (October) 1281ME, the couple made their
              light offering at the pagoda south east of the village. At the
              congregation where they listened to the sermon of the SaÑghÄ� and poured
              the consecration water. They gave to their guests pickled tea leaves,
              cheroots and betel - as was the custom. Meantime, U Kyaw Din was at the
              pagoda watching the burning little lamps of oil. He observed how the
              tips of the wicks turned black and the oil boiled. The sight moved his
              mind greatly.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> So
              much so that goose-flesh appeared on his skin. He was shaking
              violently. “Oh, it’s very extraordinary,” he thought himself. If I were
              to make a wish now, my wish will become fulfilled.” He felt convinced
              about it. So he made the wish: “May I become a Bhikkhu. May I teach
              Dhamma to the people. May they follow my example in the practice as
              instructed by me.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Having
              made the wish whole heartedly, it occurred to him thus, I am quite
              illiterate: how shall I teach Dhamma as a Bhikkhu?” At that time, he
              was not only illiterate but also had not heard Dhamma taught by others.
              He had no knowledge about the various types of Enlightenment such as
              Pacceka Buddha-hood, the Chief Discipleship, the Great Discipleship and
              Ordinary Discipleship. So he simple wished for Bhikkhu-hood. Anyway, he
              was immensely pleased with himself for having spoken out his wish
              before the Buddha and was anticipating fully of its fulfillment.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> It
              was a decidedly prosperous year for him. He had heard people say that a
              marked prosperity forebodes death. Further, he had heard them says that
              when one’s horoscope happen to fall under the planet Saturn, one is
              liable to meet his death. And he knew that his horoscope was then
              falling under Saturn. Myingyan at that juncture was infected with the
              epidemic of plague (which came every year then). May be I might fell a
              victim to plague. In that case, he felt he had very little store of
              merit while being full of demerit. His good fortune that year
              particularly made him uneasy. He was obsessed with death.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> It
              was during those uneasy days that on a month of Tabaung (March) night U
              Kyaw Din dreamt a dream. In the dream, U Kyaw Din saw a Buddha Image
              come into the temporary pandal in front of his house and was making
              certain movements, smiling. U Kyaw Din said to his wife, “Just hand me
              that rice bowl. I will offer the rice to the Buddha with my hands.” As
              he was in the act of making his rice offering to the Buddha, the Buddha
              Image said to him, “O, what a fuss! I am talking to you only for now. I
              shall not talk to you in future.” At that U Kyaw Din woke up from his
              dream. He found himself trembling violently. He took the dream as an
              omen of his impending death. He roused up his wife from her sleep and
              told her about the dream. He urgently asked for some candles. Daw Shwe
              Yi told him to keep the dream to himself and fetched some candles for
              him. He took the candles and went straight to the Pagoda where he met
              his boyhood friend U Chi Daing. “What brings you here (at this
              unearthly hour),” asked U Chi Daing?</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “I
              come to offer light to the Buddha,” replied U Kyaw Din. “I am terribly
              afraid of death!” U Chi Daing asked him of his date of birth and made
              some calculations. Then he said, “The horoscope says that this year
              your family is liable to lose a two-legged (meaning a human being in
              astrological parlance). U Kyaw Din said, “Dear fellow, don’t try to
              frighten me. I am already dying with fear of death!”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> To this U Chi Daing replied:  “Look here Kyaw Din, I am telling you just what the horoscope says.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din was definitely shaken. He made an earnest request to his
              friend, “Old boy, let me join your daily worshipping sessions. Call me
              every day.” Meanwhile, the two friends were joined by U San Tin. U Kyaw
              Din also begged U San Tin to call him for the daily worshipping
              sessions.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Not
              long afterwards, U Kyaw Din and U San Tin were dozing off while in
              conversation on the floor of the front part of U Kyaw Din’s place. Then
              U San Tin said, “These multitudes (sentient beings) are in as pitiable
              plight. They are suffering in the three kinds of scourge (War, Famine
              and Disease). They are falling off from an abyss after losing their
              way.” U Kyaw Din rejoined him saying, “True it is, we all have lost our
              way and are falling into an abyss. If only we got the right direction,
              I am prepared to take it.” To this U San Tin said: “The Right direction
              is not hard to find. Just wait at the cross-roads. Someone who can show
              the Right Direction will appear.” U Kyaw Din could not understand what
              U San Tin said and asked him what he meant. U San Tin did not answer,
              he was dozing off again. U Kyaw Din shook him and asked again. U San
              Tin said, “Don’t be afraid, there are the Triple Gems for us, the
              Buddha, the Dhamma and the SaÑghÄ� are our refuge.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              San Tin’s words of encouragement did not bring solace to U Kyaw Din who
              was deeply agitated with the prospect of death. He felt that his fear
              would cause him great harm. He thought of curing his mental sickness.
              He confided with his friend, “U San Tin, my mind is sorely agitated, I
              feel that I am heading for a great misfortune. I need to cure my mind
              of this mental sickness. I think of going about it like this; I will
              put up a pandal in front of my house as I saw in my dream. I will have
              a Buddha Image properly arranged there and we shall all gather together
              for regular worshipping sessions. That way I hope I can get happiness.” </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “You please yourself,  friend,” said U San Tin.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Then come early tomorrow  morning. Let us gather some bamboo and put up a pandal.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              the following evening, elderly people of the village gathered at U Kyaw
              Din’s place. Some were discussing about Mind and Mental Concomitants.
              Daw Shwe Yi gave light refreshment to the guests in the customary
              fashion. During the first one or two days, religious discussion that
              took place among the guests did not have any effect on U Kyaw Din’s
              mind. On the third evening, U Ba San, a clerk at the Steel Brothers
              company’s weaving factory came uninvited. He talked about Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na, Ledi
              Sayadaw’s method of VipassanÄ� meditation practice. The word Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na had
              a magic effect on U Kyaw Din’s mind. It stirred his mind so much that
              goose-flesh formed on his skin. “What has become of me?” he wondered.
              “It seems I am going to find the Right way. This man came without
              invitation. Perhaps he came just for my sake. My dream has come true.
              Here I waited at the cross-roads putting up a pandal. And he comes to
              talk about Dhamma, how to go about it. Surely I am going to gain what I
              want, if I try by his method.” Then he thought of his lack of learning.
              This method, he understood, was for literate persons only. He was quite
              illiterate. “How could he gain from his method?” He had his
              doubts. “Anyhow, I will wait till he comes again and ask him about it,”
              he bethought himself. The next evening when the clerk came, he waited
              at the entrance of the pandal and asked him. “Mr. Clerk, Sir, will an
              illiterate person like me be able to practise the way you said the
              other day?” To this the guest replied: “Literate or not, that doesn’t
              matter. Conviction (SadhÈ) and Effort (VÊriya) are the essential
              things.” U Kyaw Din asked again, “Then, how does one go about it?” U Ba
              San simply replied, “In-breaths and out-breaths, that’s Ä€nÄ�pÄ�na,” and
              went into the pandal.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Those
              two words from his guest enervated him. With a glad heart, he went into
              an extension of his house at one side, sat in an easy chair fitted with
              a gunny cloth as seat, and started noting. “Ah, this is in-breath, this
              is out-breath”, “Now he was on the way. He continued the practice of
              in-breathing and out-breathing seriously and zealously. He was full of
              confidence for success. He had great conviction. And he worked
              energetically. One day, a neighbor U Shwe Lok, came and remarked.
              “Awareness must be present.” U Kyaw Din asked, “How is awareness to be
              present?” And U Shwe Lok answered. “Well, it’s that you must be aware
              of what you are doing.” “What’s the benefit of it” asked U Kyaw Din?
              “That is meritorious,” U Shwe Lok replied: “If that is meritorious,”
              said U Kyaw Din, “I will do it.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din practiced awareness in his work. When he chopped dried stalks
              of corn stems for cattle feed, he kept aware of every stroke of his
              cutting blade. In this way, he earned much merit while he finished the
              work more efficiently. His Insight got developed for developing
              awareness. In breathing, he kept aware of the touching of air at the
              tip of the nose. In walking, he kept aware of each touching of the sole
              with the ground. In weeding or in digging or in drawing water at the
              well, he kept aware of every movement.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              every odd moment by day or by night he practiced mindfulness with full
              awareness- at home or on the field or in the Maung Yin Paw ravine, an
              out of the way place. There at the outskirt of the forest, he would
              meditate overnight. He gained concentration, thanks to his conviction
              and energetic effort. He saw multi-colored lights which he thought to
              be the multi-colored hues of the Buddha’s Rays. This give him
              encouragement much impetus. Not long afterwards, he saw a little ball
              hovering around his face. As he watched it with keen interest, it rose
              slowly upwards. He followed it as it rose till he found himself amidst
              the clouds.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> He
              was please with his progress. As he worked earnestly the next day, he
              noticed a little ball the size of a fire-fly emitting light. As he was
              looking it, the little ball rose upwards till he found himself amidst
              an array of pinnacled mansions. He thought those things as the place he
              was destined for. He came back satisfied and joyful, far from being
              afraid.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> As
              he practiced persistently, he observed painful sensations on his body.
              He was aware of the arising of painful sensation noting the fact with
              mindfulness. Touch and awareness are made mindful of at every
              occurrence. He became attuned to awareness at all times. When he
              talked, he talked only about mindfulness of awareness, i.e., about
              natural phenomena and that made him look odd in social dealings.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> People
              said, “this man has his screws loose.” U Kyaw Din preferred to be
              treated as a mentally deranged person, for that freed him of
              unprofitable social engagements and made him pursue his practice more
              fully. He made use of this opportunity by day and by night.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> As
              he advanced in his practice, he saw the people always going after
              sense-objects. He felt consternation about humanity. He had few words
              with his neighbors. When he happened to be speaking to them, he
              reminded them to be mindful. “Hey, you!” he would say, “Remember the
              Buddha, remember the Dhamma, remember the SaÑghÄ�. You are going to die
              in three days, (or) in five days, (or) in seven days.” But alas, those
              spoken to in those terms met their death as foretold by him. U Kyaw Din
              told people how he could see the internal organs of people, the
              denizens (inhabitants) of Niraya, the realm of continuous suffering,
              congested like maggots in a putrid carcass of a dog. When news of U
              Kyaw Din’s Super-human power spread, people came to him to trace their
              lost cattle, or to get prescriptions for sickness. U Kyaw Din became
              fed up. He felt the need for seclusion. So he spent most of his time
              meditating alone at the Maung Yin Paw ravine.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B: The Sayadaw later  said: Mundane powers are quite attractive: I was fortunate to be able to  outgrow them.) </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Touch,
              Awareness, Mindfulness — with these three essential features, the
              practice of VipassanÄ� proceeded for U Kyaw Din in his observance of
              natural breathing. With constant practice, he observed the painful
              sensations as they arise in his body. By constant mindfulness, Insight
              into rise and fall of physical and mental phenomena was attained. This
              in technical parlance is called Udayabbaya ÒÄ�Óa. This Insight enabled
              him to see the details of the inside of his body as though the body
              were cut open to see.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B:
              Seeing the process of arising and perishing of phenomena may be either
              in liquid form or in solid form. If the meditator proceeds with the
              practice, putting forth energetic effort, with a strong conviction and
              resoluteness, uninterruptedly day and night, he will reach a stage
              where he comes to understand the nature of the Mind, the Mental
              Concomitants and the Physical Body, how they arise and how they
              dissolve. The meditator can see these happenings clearly. The Insight
              into rise and fall of phenomena has three categories, the crude type,
              the middle type and the refined type. Only by one’s own practice can
              these fine points become comprehensible. These are the Sayadaw’s
              remarks in this matter.)</p>

              <p class="bodyText style10"> (1).
              After attaining Insight into rise and fall of phenomena, on Thursday
              the 13th waning day of Wasou (July) 1282 ME, at about 10 pm U Kyaw Din
              attained the first Supra-mundane Knowledge, SotÈpana (First Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> U
              Kyaw Din continued with his work. Daw Shwe Yi was fretting all the
              time. She pulled out all the bamboo strips that made the flooring of U
              Kyaw Din cot (bed) and pushed him down. She pulled out all the bamboo
              strips so that no flooring was left, U Kyaw Din did not move away.
              Instead, he squatted on the beam of the cot. At last Daw Shwe Yi gave
              in. She replaced the bamboo strips on the cot (bed). U Kyaw Din said to
              her, “Why are you disturbing my work?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">“I intend to be struck by  you” she replied.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “Dear wife, I shall never  strike you. Try and talk me out of it.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> “You
              good for nothing man, keeping numb all the time like Prince Temiya (of
              the JÄ�taka). If you are so keen to meditate, why won’t you wear the
              yellow robes and stay at the monastery?”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Daw
              Shwe Yi kept up her fretting and fuming every day. U Kyaw Din kept
              patient since he was not still successful, like the aged Upaka of the
              scripture story.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> On
              another occasion, when U Kyaw Din was meditating, Daw Shwe Yi let-loose
              her cow from the tethered post and cried to her husband, “Look! The cow
              has gone loose from her post, U Kyaw Din, you go after the cow,
              quick!” That cow was dangerous one, use to attacking anyone coming near
              her. However, on this occasion she stood still without attacking
              anyone. Daw Shwe Yi got furious. Stamping her foot hard on the floor,
              she railed against her husband who seemed not to notice her and
              continued with his meditating work.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> He
              progressed in his practice. His ability to be mindful on Sensation in
              the body developed. When others used abusive words against him, he felt
              displeasure. His mindfulness told him, “Look, anger has arisen in you.”
              At that same moment, he could choked his anger. He was encouraged by
              his fortitude due to constant mindfulness. He was pleased to remember
              that before he practiced mindfulness, he would certainly have slapped
              that abusive person on the face. Likewise, when he saw a pleasing form
              he felt pleasure. He understood that pleasure as greed. The eye merely
              saw the eye-object. The pleasing form was merely perception. It has
              nothing to feel pleased. Similarly, whenever he heard a sound, he
              understood it as perception of hearing; and whenever he touched some
              tangible objects, he understood it as perception of touch; whenever he
              smelt some odour, he understood it as perception of smell. In any of
              these perceptions he did not allow any pleasure or displeasure to arise
              in his mind. In this way, he had some understanding of the working of
              the mind in regard to sense objects.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> One
              night when U Kyaw Din, keeping mindfulness, fell asleep. He had a dream
              like this. He got into a booking office of a railway station where he
              bought a ticket. The station-master gave him four tickets. He took them
              and put them in his pocket. Soon the train started and he woke up from
              the dream. Not long afterwards, he had another dream. He saw in the
              dream an ox running towards him. He grabbed the tail of the animal. The
              tail broke loose from it and he had the tail left in his hand. Just
              then, he woke up from the dream. U Kyaw Din interpreted the dream. It
              portended, he thought, in that later part of the Buddha’s Teaching, he
              was going to break loose from the woeful world. Greatly encouraged by
              the dream, he put forth his effort.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (2).
              On Saturday, the 13th waning day of Wagaung (August) at about 10 pm he
              won the second Supra-mundane Knowledge, SakadÈgÈmi (Second Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (N.B.-
              Having had the first experience of winning the Supra-mundane Dhamma,
              the Sayadaw told us that the second attainment was not greatly
              different from the first apart from the way unpleasant sensations
              arose.)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> After
              attaining the Supra-mundane Dhammas twice, U Kyaw Din came to use
              bombastic words. He was able to understand the laws of nature. When
              people of the village came to tell him that someone was sick, U Kyaw
              Din might say, “He is going to die,” then that man died. If someone was
              sick and U Kyaw Din said, “He’s not going to die yet,” then that man
              recovered. His words proved so correct that people dared not open any
              conversation with him. U Kyaw Din did not care about what people said,
              but went on zealously with his work.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> (3).
              Then on Monday, the 13th waning day of Taw-tha-lin (September) 1282 ME,
              at about 10 pm, he struggled with extraordinarily severe pains arising
              within him, feeling as if all the sinew broke off and overcoming them,
              won the third Supra-mundane Knowledge, AnÈgÈmi (Third Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">(N.B.:
              The third winning of the Supra-mundane Dhamma was marked by an emission
              of semen, which symbolized the extirpation of sexual interest. A most
              severe attack of painful sensation had to be met with. Overcoming it
              was a sure signal of success. The Sayadaw said that only when a
              meditator has overcome it he would say, “well done!”)</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> The
              next day, he found that he was free from fear so much so that he could
              remain unperturbed even when a thunderbolt fell in front of him. He
              went ahead with his work. He felt very much concerned with the plight
              of humanity. “Ah, these people are so occupied with sensual objects,”
              he felt. He dreaded living amidst the people. He had a strong desire to
              become a recluse i.e, to lead the homeless life of a Bhikkhu.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> He
              reflected on the world to see the enemies that are to be contended
              with. He found Greed, Hatred, Bewilderment and Conceit. Of these, he
              found Greed to be the prime source of trouble. He therefore worked to
              get-rid of Greed. His method was Touch-Awareness-Mindfulness. As one
              touches something, one remains aware of the touch and notices the fact
              with mindfulness. By practising this way earnestly, greed gets less and
              less and becomes weaker and weaker. When he thought of any enemy that
              would still remain, he realized that his wife and children and own
              properties were the closest enemies for him.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> He
              pondered on the state of affairs by way of cause and effect:- “This
              being bridled with impediments such as wife, children and properties
              are the resultants of the cause, and the cause is that I have not
              settled my debts. I must settle my debts now.” These were the thoughts
              that came to his mind.So he said to his wife, “(Ma Shwe Yi) you and I
              became husband and wife due to past Kamma. Do not settle my debts. Let
              me not settle your debts either. Let us agree to break up our wed-lock.
              I will regard you as my own sister and you will regard me as your own
              brother. Give me permission to become a Bhikkhu.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Daw
              Shwe Yi replied, “Don’t settle the debts owing to me. Don’t go away
              anywhere. Don’t turn a Bhikkhu. Stay here at the specially revered
              room. Let me treat you and look after you as an elder brother. It is
              said that a husband makes his wife respectable and that a wife makes
              her husband graceful. Besides, a woman without protection of her
              husband is liable to be abused and persecuted by others. To be my
              protector, don’t go away from here.” She used the best of her feminine
              eloquence to deter him from his plan.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> At
              that time, U Kyaw Din lacking general knowledge, thought that consent
              of wife was necessary to enter Bhikkhu-hood. He felt miserable for not
              being able to get his wife’s consent. His thought ran like this, “O,
              what a misfortune, living as a house-holder is full of faults. Where
              could I find a livelihood that is faultless? People around me are
              leading lives that are not free from blame. The only way to lead a
              faultless life is a choice between two things; turn into a Bhikkhu or
              else wear the rags and live like a mad man. Perhaps the second choice
              alone is open for me. So I shall wear a gunny bag with two holes at the
              upper corners, make a bigger hole at the top for putting the head. The
              gunny bag will serve as my garment as well as my bed-cloth. For my
              food, I will beg from house to house, carrying a cup. People will feed
              me as a beggar and no one will harm a poor beggar. That way I can lead
              a blameless life. What a splendid idea!” Those were the ideas that came
              to his desperate mind.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">U
              Kyaw Din was a very unhappy man then. He could not eat properly. His
              strength waned. He thought he was going to die. He could not adjust
              himself to life around him. So he made a further appeal to his wife.
              But Daw Shwe Yi did not yield. Their neighbors took sympathy for U Kyaw
              Din and pleaded with the wife saying, “Ma Shwe Yi, give your consent
              now or he will surely die. Look at how he had starved himself and how
              run-down he has become – only bone and skin left of the man.” Daw Shwe
              Yi was still adamant. She replied to them, “O, let him die. Death is
              better than separation. I can forget if he was to die but how could I
              live alone seeing him as a total stranger? If I were to give my consent
              I shall be feeling miserable every time I see him.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">The
              friends persisted in their well-intentioned advice until the wife had
              to soften her stance. She told them, “Well, I shall give him permission
              for a fortnight or so.” U Kyaw Din then said, “Let it be so. If I did
              not find suited to Bhikkhu-hood, I shall return home at once but if it
              suits me, which depend on my past store of Kamma, let me stay a Bhikkhu
              for as long as my good Kamma holds.”</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">Even
              then, Daw Shwe Yi had an outstanding task for U Kyaw Din. Their land
              which had been ploughed just recently was waiting the sowing of crops.
              She told him to be so good as sow some peas. “That’s not going to take
              long,” she told him. U Kyaw Din had to oblige. He yoked his pair of
              oxen and went to the fields. Once on the fields, when U Kyaw Din
              mounted the plough and gave his oxen the signal to move, the pair kept
              looking back at him and did not move forward. U Kyaw Din then thought
              thus, “My pair of oxen are usually very obedient. They never needed any
              prodding. Formerly, when ever I mounted the plough, they were always
              very eager to move, as if vying between each other. Now they are
              protesting against me – not wishing me to be working as a plough-man.
              If I were to ignore their protestation, there would be no one more
              stupid than me. Now is the time for me to be firm in my resolve,” so he
              calculated. Bracing himself thus, he dismounted, dissembled the plough,
              took the handling frame in his hand and leaned the plough-shaft against
              a near by tree. Then, unfastening the tether ropes on his bullocks, he
              said; “Now my good help-mates, I set you free. From now onwards you and
              I have parted ways for ever. You may go where ever you wish to go.” He
              then headed towards the monastery of Bhikkhu U Kyauk. On the way, he
              met Daw Tin, who asked him where he was going. He said he was going to
              the monastery to become a SÄ�maÓera (Novice). Daw Tin said, “I’ve got a
              used upper robe. Take it and don’t let Ma Shwe Yi know about it.”
              Taking it, he went and saw Bhikkhu U VÊriya (a) U Kyauk who gave him a
              lower robe and received him into the order of Bhikkhu as a Novice. He
              was named Shin Kavi by the Bhikkhu U VÊriya.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">As
              the Sayadaw U Kavi went forth into Bhikkhu-hood after leaving the
              plough-stock leaning against a nearby tree, he was known as
              “Tun-daung-ko-daw” or the Revered one who left the plough-stock leaning
              against a tree.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10">(The
              Sayadaw U Kavi made his wish to become a member of the Order of Bhikkhu
              offering lights at the Pagoda in Tha-ding-gyut (October) 1281 ME and
              his wish was fulfilled on the 5th waning day of Tha-ding-gyut (October)
              1282 ME, just one year after wishing for it.</p>

              <p class="bodyText style10">Shin
              Kavi lost no time in continuing his meditation practice after becoming
              a SÄ�maÓera. He went alone to Maung Yin Paw ravine and resumed his
              practice. After five days of his joining the Order, he was joined by U
              Shwe Lok as another Novice who came and lived with him. One day, Shin
              Kavi saw a big mushroom by the side of the monastery and pulled it out
              of the earth, when a number of mushroom buds came out along with the
              big mushroom. He took it as a good omen fore-telling his successful
              endeavour, that he was about to free himself from this earthly
              existence which is woeful so he went on orduously with his work.</p>

              On Tuesday, on the 13th waning day of Tha-ding-gyut (October) 1282 ME,
              at about 10 pm, he saw a grand covered approach (to a pagoda) and also
              a flying chariot approaching him making a buzzing sound. He did not pay
              attention to it but just get absorbed in his meditation. However, he
              felt himself lifted up in his sitting, his body seeming to lose weight.
              He found that the chariot lay beneath him. Turning around, he saw at
              the four corners Great DevÈ Kings with Sakka, Lord of the DevÈs on the
              right side. He believed that these celestial personages had come to
              protect him as he was on the point of winning Supra-mundane Knowledge.
              Without making a shift in his posture, he remained engaged in his
              meditation. There upon he gained the fourth Supra-mundane Knowledge,
              Arahanta (Fourth Stage).</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> </p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> After
              that he looked around, Sakka and the four Great DevÈ Kings were gone.
              On winning the Fourth Path Knowledge, he could see the whole universe
              with the topmost realm of BrahmÄ� and the nethermost (bottom most) realm
              of AvÊci, realm of continuous suffering. He saw Sakka and the Four
              Great DevÈ Kings announcing to the world in resounding voices that an
              Arahanta has arisen in the human world and were urging every one to go
              and pay their homage to the Noble-one.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> After
              that, living beings closest to him came into his views. There were
              guardian spirits of the earth, guardian spirits of trees and also DevÈs
              of the celestial realms. An endless stream of resplendent DevÈs coming
              to pay homage to him. He then understood the existence of the three
              worlds that is, the world of Sentient Beings (Satta Loka), the world of
              Volitional Activities (Sa~khÈra Loka) and the world of Physical Base
              (OkÄ�sa Loka). As well as the three kinds of Internal world, the three
              kinds of External world. The world of Sentient Beings (Satta Loka), the
              world of Volitional Activities that condition the life of Beings
              (Sa~khÈra Loka) and the world of Physical Base (OkÄ�sa), he knew as the
              three kinds of External world. The three Internal world are Mind,
              Mental Concomitants and Corporeality he understood as the world of
              Sentient Beings (Satta Loka). The conditioning factors that cause the
              arising and dissolution of Mind, Mental Concomitants and Corporeality
              constitute the second kind of the world of Volitional Activities
              (Sa~khÈra Loka) of the three internal worlds and the Physical Base for
              the two other internal worlds to come into play constitute the third
              kind (OkÄ�sa Loka) of the three internal worlds. Further, he understood
              with discrimination the (Nine) attributes of the Buddha, the (Six)
              attributes of Dhamma and the (Nine) attributes of the SaÑghÄ�.</p>
              <p class="bodyText style10"> Attainment
              of the Four Paths was related by him thus; firstly, he knew this is
              Corporeality (R|pa), this is Mentality (NÄ�ma), this is Mind (Citta),
              these are Mental Concomitants (Cetasika), this is the Truth of

              Woefulness (Magga SaccÄ�), this is Cessation of the Woefulness (Nirodha

              (Path of the Knowledge of the Stream Winner) and SotÈpatti Phala

              Four Ariya Truths is called Arahatta Magga (the Path of Arahatta
              Knowledge) and Arahatta Phala (Fruition of Arahatta Knowledge). He
              reflected on and reviewed each of these Four Stages of his attainment
              and remained in a Blissful state (which is known only to the AriyÄ�s).</p>

              principle, he found that mostly, he had been born as an animal with
              very few existence as a human being. Since his past existences were so
              numerous, he made a wish to see a particular existence that had been
              the cause of his spiritual advancement. Then he saw that during the
              time of Kassapa Buddha, belonging to the Bhadda-kappa (the present
              world) graced by Five Buddhas, he had made a wish before the Kassapa
