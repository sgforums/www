              <p>I'm not too sure about 'afraid of suffering of life'... actually, if a person becomes enlightened, he will overcome his fear of life. He will still seek to attain Nirvana but he will at the same time overcome his fear of life and death.</p>
              <p>But I suppose there might still be a subtle preference there of the state of Nirvana/cessation over samsara.</p>
              <p>Just a guess.. I might be wrong, I'm not where near Anagami or Arhat.. lol</p>

              <p>We did not share such understandings because all the famous

              <p>Because like I said the path of Bodhisattva and the path of personal liberation is different and results in different fruition... one is Sravaka bodhi, i.e. Arhat. Another one is Annutarasamyaksambodhi, i.e. Buddha.</p>
              <p>There are however many experienced Mahayana masters who can comment from personal experience.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... I dunno whether i can be considered anagami or not. Anyway, i will just reply from my understanding. Not definitive ... just a sharing.</p>
              <p>Gradually, the 'afraid of suffering of life' actually subside. (not 100% at my current stage, though). This actually got to do with the egoic mind losing its power to condition. It is the 'sense of self/egoic mind' that is conceptualizing all the possible scenarios and creating the tensions and suffering. Those 'what if's that are projections of possible scenarios are not entertained that much. This got to do with the mind 'smartened up' to the dynamics of the egoic mind which constantly seek to avoid bad things from happening. However, in samsara there simply is no escaping from things that we don't like to experience. When there is no complete escape, a person do not invest too much time escaping.</p>
              <p>That is why, the earlier gathered informations on 'how spiritual knowledge should be' has to be dropped away too. This is because the act of refering to and verifying experiences via gathered knowledge is the activity of the egoic mind/self. If we try to abhere to all the informations that we have read about, we will get even more confused. Many of the informations themselves do not fully aligned with one another.</p>
              <p>All of us can be so-called enlightened and still exhibit pockets of ignorance :)</p>

              <p>Hmmm...</p>
              <p>Please correct me if I am wrong. I think Thusness will have a better understanding.</p>
              <p>For Enlightenment, the cessation can occurs not only in the meditation. It can also be experienced during the waking hours, like sitting or even standing.</p>
              <p>What is described above is the initial awakening resulting from the shutting down of all sensory perceptions including thoughts. This can occur from doing one-point meditation of focusing on breathe.</p>
              <p>Initial awakening can occurs within days or months of constant meditation. After the initial awakening, the challenge is to have progressive realisations that will integrate Presence into the waking hours. This is very challenging.</p>
              <p>The rest and cessation of mind of an enlightened person should be experienced as a daily occurence and not just in meditation. The
                                      rest may not be fully possible without the correct understanding of
                                      non-duality and the working dynamics of the 'sense of self'..</p>

              <p>For Enlightenment, the cessation can occurs not only in the
              meditation. It can also be experienced during the waking hours,
              like sitting or even standing.</p>
              <p>What is described above is the initial awakening resulting from
              the shutting down of all sensory perceptions including thoughts.
              This can occur from doing one-point meditation of focusing on
              breathe.</p>
              <p>Initial awakening can occurs within days or months of constant
              meditation. After the initial awakening, the challenge is to have
              progressive realisations that will integrate Presence into the
              waking hours. This is very challenging.</p>
              <p>The rest and cessation of mind of an enlightened person should
              be experienced as a daily occurence and not just in meditation. The
              rest may not be fully possible without the correct understanding of
              non-duality and the working dynamics of the 'sense of self'..</p>

              <p>Arhat has no more birth because his afflictions and defilements have completely vanished. They also do not have the vows to remain in samsara as a Bodhisattva, so they simply "blow out" into their personal cessation.</p>
              <p>From my understanding, Bodhisattvas of higher bhumis may also completely eradicate those afflictions but still be reborn due to his vows and wish... they can also choose the birth they want to take, they are not reborn due to karmic fruition. Usually we are reborn according to our karma and do not have the ability to choose your rebirth... if you have bad karma you will reborn in hell, if you have good karma, maybe human or deva realm. The birth is due to karmic ripening. The Bodhisattvas of higher bhumis can choose precisely where and when they want to take birth, so it is not karmic birth.</p>

              <p>By Dharma Dan -- see especially the 'Third Path' a.k.a Anagami description, <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/">www.interactivebuddha.com</a><br><br><strong>THE HEART SUTRA MODEL</strong><br><br>This
                  model is based upon the phrase in the Heart Sutra “form is emptiness,
                  emptiness is form.” To my knowledge, this model is not found in quite
                  this presentation anywhere other than here, nor has it ever been
                  related to the Four Path model of the Theravada in the way that
                  follows. The inspiration for using this phrase comes from a wonderful
                  chapter in Chogyam Trungpa’s Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism
                  called “Shunyata.”<br><br>I present this somewhat novel model here
                  because it focuses on real insight directly and treats any emotional
                  benefits of this as side effects. Further, there are often too many
                  cycles of insight before arahatship, making the four path model
                  troublesome. This phenomena of too many cycles (which I will sometimes
                  call “paths” with a lowercase “p”) between each of the Four Paths gets
                  worse as one works towards final awakening. As Bill Hamilton put it,
                  and I have learned the hard way, “The arahat fractal is vast.”<br><br>This
                  model does not reinforce fascination with content, nor with life
                  denying ideals or limited emotional range models in the way that the
                  traditional Four Path Model often does. It does not tempt one to count
                  paths. It keeps the focus on precise inquiry into the truth and one’s
                  experience of it or lack thereof.<br><br>This model basically says that
                  enlightenment is about direct insight that progressively reveals
                  something different in the relationship to the field of experience and
                  gradually allows things in it to be held in their proper proportion.
                  However, as to the specific implications of this increased clarity and
                  more realistic perspective as regards behavior or how emotions
                  manifest, all bets are off.<br><br>We will begin with the obvious
                  statement that “form is form.” By form, I mean all mental and physical
                  phenomena, i.e. the world of sensations as we know it. Saying that
                  “form is form” is like saying that “sensations are sensations” or
                  “experience is experience.” There is nothing all that profound about
                  this understanding, and all living creatures know this. This is the
                  state of understanding before stream entry. It is valid within its
                  scope, and this should not be forgotten. The laws of the world are the
                  laws of the world, and these must be acknowledged and respected, as
                  must the beings that live in that world.<br><br>By clearly
                  investigating form, one eventually comes to the understanding of the
                  stream enterer, that “emptiness is emptiness.” Unlike those that are
                  unenlightened, one who has attained first path, that of stream entry,
                  has directly understood in some completely inexplicable way what is
                  meant by “emptiness” in terms of the non-experience of “ultimate
                  reality” that results from entering Fruition through one of the Three
                  Doors. However, while the stream enterer may have some intellectual
                  clues about the “relationship” between emptiness and form due to the
                  ways the Three Doors present, they have no obvious direct experience of
                  it when experiencing almost all sensations. Correlations between this
                  model and the Four Path model begin to break down during the middle two
                  Paths.<br><br>Thus, the meanings of interdependence, dependent arising
                  and particularly non-duality will still be somewhat mysterious to them,
                  though in some intuitive way they will have a deeper understanding of
                  these than someone who is unenlightened. Second path is a step higher
                  in terms of the Four Path map, but it brings no huge improvements in
                  the understanding of these things from the point of view of this model.
                  The phenomenal world still generally seems perniciously “dual” for both
                  those of the first two paths. <strong>At both first and second path, Nirvana is
                  largely seen as something beyond all of this, an inconceivable
                  discontinuity.</strong> However, it seems to have little to do with most of the
                  sensations of the world except that it is “found” in the attainment of
                  Fruition beyond experience and the sensate universe. It can be
                  frustrating that the refuge seems to be found largely outside the
                  universe in some non-experience, and there is a growing sense that true
                  freedom must somehow be found in the world however it manifests.
                  Precise inquiry into the true nature of sensations continues as before.<br><br>The
                  next understanding that comes is that “form is emptiness.” This might
                  be thought of as the understanding of those of third path, as the
                  attainment of this understanding does some serious damage to the
                  illusion of a separate watcher or self, i.e. to the illusion of
                  duality. However, it is very appropriate here to reiterate the truth of
                  the joke being made by the phrase “Twelfth Path.” There may be a lot of
                  cycles of insight and fascinating stuff that goes on between stream
                  entry and the dawning of the understanding that “form is emptiness.” In
                  exactly the same way, there may also be many new levels at which this
                  may be understood before the work is fully done. Thus, counting paths
                  doesn’t work well when using this model beyond first path.<br><br><strong>That
                  said, the concept of Nirvana now seems to generally apply to the
                  phenomenal world as well as the attainment of Fruition, though there is
                  still something clouding the waters. Those of third path will have a
                  direct understanding of what is meant by non-duality, the “intrinsic
                  luminosity” of phenomena and of “interdependence” that is far more
                  direct and clear than the somewhat intuitive understanding of those of
                  first and second path.</strong> This holds up quite well until they get into
                  another progress cycle.<br><br>The primary
                  benefit of attaining third path is that when <strong>the mind stops laboring
                  under the gross aspects of the illusion of a dualistic split (of a
                  subject and an object, an observer and the observed) the mind does not
                  produce nearly so much noise related to fundamental attraction (trying
                  to get to the other side of the imagined split when the other side
                  seems pleasant) and fundamental aversion (trying to get away from the
                  other side of the imagined split when the other side seems unpleasant).</strong><br><br>Since
                  it is not producing so much useless noise based upon the illusion of
                  duality, this reveals very significant levels of fundamental peace,
                  balance and clarity. It is a bit like the increased performance of a
                  computer that results from stopping useless processes that were running
                  in the background. Thus, we begin to see some hints of the tenuous
                  relationship between the non-duality models and the limited emotional
                  range models. The weird thing is that the more one pays attention, the
                  more the emotional range seems to grow.<br><strong><br>A person of third path,
                  that is, an anagami or “never returner”, (however many insight cycles
                  it took to “get there” and assuming this point can be clearly defined,
                  which is dubious) has eliminated or overcome “fundamental attraction”
                  and “fundamental aversion” (in non-duality terms) to ordinary
                  phenomena. </strong>This is because, when experiencing most sensations,
                  particularly when not in meditative states of high clarity, the sense
                  of a separate self or duality may seem to be largely absent or often
                  exceedingly subtle to those of third path. They simply no longer make
                  this false imputation from most sensations. This is a radical shift in
                  understanding, and is one of the reasons why going from second path to
                  third path is often found to be much more difficult than going from
                  first path to second path. It requires great deal of trust in reality
                  as well as a fairly new realm of understanding. Paths that emphasize
                  “surrender to the will of God” might well have an easier time with this
                  transition. Simply emphasizing the Third Characteristic, that all
                  things simply happen on their own, works just as well.<br><br>Those of
                  “third path” do have gaps in their understanding, and there is still a
                  largely subtle process of the mind creating artificial dualities that
                  may become more obvious during moments of high clarity. There is still
                  a subtle but illusory sense that there is a peaceful and clear “this”
                  or separate self that is not being perturbed most of the time by
                  “that,” i.e. the world.<br><br>Ironically, the benefits of this level
                  of understanding and the subtlety of the remaining illusion of duality
                  can be the primary impediments to further progress. The mind of those
                  of third path may attach to (try to solidify and then pretend it is
                  self, the property of a self, or created by a self) such things as
                  panoramic perspectives, mental silence, peace, clarity, the sometimes
                  seemingly complete sense of non-duality, and that sort of thing. It is
                  still trying to section off a part of reality as separate, realized and
                  in control, and at these higher levels of awakening can do so in
                  increasingly sophisticated and seductive ways. It becomes progressively
                  harder to see what needs more work and easier to rationalize gaps in
                  understanding once they are seen. On the other hand, there are few new
                  tricks left that the process of creating the illusion of duality can
                  throw at an anagami, and what is left to do is basically a question of
                  learning the same old lessons again and again for a new set of subtle
                  sensations and qualities of experience. Clear investigation of the
                  sensations that make up reality is still highly recommended, as always.
                  Did I mention that the large number of full, new and complete progress
                  cycles from this stage to the next might surprise you? I hope so.<br><br>Finally,
                  arahats understand that “emptiness is form.” Nirvana is found in
                  samsara, in the midst of the phenomenal world, as well as in the
                  attainment of Fruition beyond the phenomenal world. This is what is
                  meant by removing the “last veil of unknowing.” They understand that it
                  is form that is empty, that some illusory sense of a split off
                  peacefulness or island of imperturbability was never true or realistic
                  refuge. All of these phenomena are already empty and always have been.
                  This is the great cosmic punch line: all of this transience turns out
                  to have been it all along. Not only was form empty, but emptiness was
                  actually form. The split is gone.</p>

                              impediments to further progress. The mind of those of third path
                              may attach to (try to solidify and then pretend it is self, the
                              property of a self, or created by a self) such things as panoramic
                              perspectives, mental silence, peace, clarity, the sometimes
                              seemingly complete sense of non-duality, and that sort of thing. It
                              is still trying to section off a part of reality as separate,
                              realized and in control, and at these higher levels of awakening
                              can do so in increasingly sophisticated and seductive ways. It
                              becomes progressively harder to see what needs more work and easier
                              to rationalize gaps in understanding once they are seen. On the
                              other hand, there are few new tricks left that the process of
                              creating the illusion of duality can throw at an anagami, and what
                              is left to do is basically a question of learning the same old
                              lessons again and again for a new set of subtle sensations and
                              qualities of experience. Clear investigation of the sensations that
                              make up reality is still highly recommended, as always. Did I
                              mention that the large number of full, new and complete progress
                              cycles from this stage to the next might surprise you? I hope
                              so.<br> <br> Finally, arahats understand that “emptiness is form.” Nirvana is
                              found in samsara, in the midst of the phenomenal world, as well as
                              in the attainment of Fruition beyond the phenomenal world. This is
                              what is meant by removing the “last veil of unknowing.” They
                              understand that it is form that is empty, that some illusory sense
                              of a split off peacefulness or island of imperturbability was never
                              true or realistic refuge. All of these phenomena are already empty
                              and always have been. This is the great cosmic punch line: all of
                              this transience turns out to have been it all along. Not only was
                              form empty, but emptiness was actually form. The split is gone.</p>

              primary model I use when describing awakening, talking about my
              practice, and helping others practice. I think that using the original
              terminology and revising its definitions allows a lot of good material
              in the Pali Canon to be used, thus provides a link to previously done
              work. However, I realize that using terminology that already has such
              deep cultural and dogmatic resonance may be a problem. For those who
              want something new, I will shortly present a rephrasing of this model
              that I call the Simple Model.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> In the Revised Four Path Model, Stream Enterers have discovered the
              complete discontinuity that is called Fruition and sometimes called
              Nirvana or Nibbana (Sanskrit vs. Pali). This is the first of two
              meanings of Nirvana, with the other being Fourth Path. Stream enterers
              cycle through the ñanas, know that awakening or some different
              understanding from the norm is possible, and yet they do not have all
              that different an experience of most sensations from those who are not
              yet stream enterers. They may correctly extrapolate a lot of good
              dharma insights from momentary experiences, particularly high up in
              High Equanimity and the three moments before a Fruition, but this is
              not the same as living there all the time. In fact, most stream
              enterers have a very hard time describing how things have changed in
              terms of their daily life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Those of Second Path have now completed a new insight cycle. They
              understand the process by which enlightened beings make further
              progress and equate progress with further cycles of insight, which is
              partially true. More model-obsessed or intellectual practitioners at
              second path may get very into fractal models, consciousness models,
              enlightenment models, various integrative theories, and that sort of
              thing at this stage of practice. Psychological issues tend to be a bit
              more of a big deal during this phase, and psychological development
              become interesting to them in some way. By this point most people,
              though certainly not everyone, also have a pretty good understanding of
              the basics of the samatha jhanas, and these can be very fascinating.
              What they may be most bothered by is that cycle after cycle of
              practice, duality remains the predominant experience most of the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Those of Third Path have shifted their understanding of what progress
              is from those of Second Path, and have been to see that it is about
              seeing the emptiness, selflessness, impermanence, etc. of sensations in
              daily life and begin to see that they have the ability to do this. This
              can be a long, developmental process from the first time they notice
              this to it becoming a nearly complete experience. Thus, Third Path
              tends to be a long path, though it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> At the beginning of Third Path, most practitioners think: “I’ll just
              complete more cycles of insight, like I did before, and this will do
              the trick.” They don’t tend to understand what it is they have attained
              all that well yet, nor its deeper implications. By the mature stage of
              Third Path, which can take months to years to show up, the practitioner
              is more and more able to see the emptiness, selfless, centerlessness,
              luminosity, etc. of phenomena in real-time, so much so that it can be
              very difficult to notice what artificial dualities remain. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As they cycle, they will enter new territory, possibly causing some
              uncertainty or instability, and with each Review phase they tend to
              really feel that they have done it until they begin to notice the
              limits of their practice. There can be this nagging something in the
              background that things aren’t done, and yet figuring out exactly what
              the problem is can be very slippery. It is a bit like being in the
              stages before stream entry, trying to figure out what exactly needs to
              be done. They need to notice something that has nothing to do with the
              cycles, to finally untangle the knot of perception at its core, but
              doing this can be a real trick. It is a very strange place, as one
              seems to know the dharma all the way to the end and yet somehow it just
              isn’t quite enough. In that vein, it is interesting to note that I
              wrote the vast majority of this book while I was some sort of anagami,
              and on reflection I got just about everything right. My emphases are
              slightly different now, but the basics are all the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As things progress, anagamis begin to tire of the cycles to a small or
              large degree and begin to look to something outside of them or not
              related to them for the answer to the final question. Finally, the
              cycles of insight, the states of concentration, the powers, and all the
              other perks and prerogatives of their stage of awakening or
              concentration abilities (if they developed them) hold no appeal and
              only lead to more unsatisfying cycles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> I completed around 27 full, complete insight cycles with mind-blowing
              A&amp;P Events, Ass-kicking Dark Nights, Equanimity phases, and what
              seemed to be brand new, fresh Fruitions and Review phases between third
              and fourth path. There is nothing special about that number, as I
              mentioned previously in my descriptions of the problem that I call
              Twelfth Path. The later cycles got faster and faster, so that by the
              end it seemed I was whipping one out every few weeks or even every few
              days, but they still seemed to be leading nowhere. It was only when I
              had gotten so sick of the cycles and realized that they were leading
              nowhere that I was able to see what has nothing to do with the cycles,
              which also wasn’t anything except a strange untangling of the knot of
              perception of them. The cycles, for better or worse, have continued
              just the same. Thus, there is not much point in counting cycles or
              paths, as they don’t necessarily correlate well with anything past the
              first two or three, and issues of backsliding can really make things
              complex, as I explained earlier.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Finishing up my Revised Four Path Model, arahats have finally untangled
              the knot of perception, dissolved the sense of the center point
              actually being the center point, no longer fundamentally make a
              separate Self out of the patterns of sensations that they used to, even
              though those same patterns of sensations continue. This is a different
              understanding from those of Third Path in some subtle way, and makes
              this path about something that is beyond the paths. This is also
              poetically called the opening of the Wisdom Eye. What is interesting is
              that I could write about this stage quite well when I was an anagami,
              but that is a whole different world from knowing it like arahats know
              it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The Wisdom Eye may seem to blink initially. It may go through cycles of
              flashing open just after a Fruition and then slowly fading over a few
              hours (at least on retreat) as each round of physical sensations, then
              mental sensations, then complex emotional formations, then lastly
              fundamental formations such as inquiry itself move through and become
              integrated into this new, correct and direct perception of reality as
              it is. Review cycles may occur many times during each flash, but when
              the eye is open they seem rather irrelevant in comparison to keeping
              the level of clarity and acceptance high enough to keep the eye open.
              When the eye fades, the familiar insight cycles may seem like pure
              drudgery, with the focus being of practice initially lost in getting
              through the cycles and then gradually shifting again to getting clear
              enough to get the eye to open again. The themes that occupy center
              stage go through a cycle that is very much like a progress cycle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Finally, the Wisdom Eye cycles and insight cycles all converge, and the
              thing stays open from then on, which is to say that at that point it
              all seems the same whether or not the eye is open, which it actually
              was. That being seen, nothing can erode or disturb the centerlessness
              of perspective. Done is what is to be done, and life goes on. That
              there are arahats who have opened the Wisdom Eye but had it fade and
              those who have opened it and had it stay open is rarely mentioned but
              worth knowing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> For the arahat who has kept the thing open, there is nothing more to be
              gained on the ultimate front from insight practices, as “done is what
              is to be done”. That said, insight practices can still be of great
              benefit to them for a whole host of reasons, there is a ton they can
              learn just like everyone else about everything else there is to learn.
              They can grow, develop, change, work and participate in this strange
              human drama just like everyone else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><strong><span style="color: #2c2608;">A Simple Model</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">In
              earlier versions of this work, I had a model called The Heart Sutra
              Model. The Simple Model is the less mysterious, stripped down version
              of that earlier model, though in its essence it is basically the same.
              While in one sense it is also rephrasing of the Revised Four Path
              Model, as it has no numbers, and is free of the traditional names, it
              has some advantages over that terminology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> I present this somewhat novel model here because it focuses on real
              insight directly and treats any emotional benefits of this as side
              effects. Further, there are often too many cycles of insight before
              arahatship, making the Four Path model troublesome. This phenomena of
              too many cycles (which I will sometimes call “paths” with a lowercase
              “p”) between each of the Four Paths gets worse as one works towards
              final awakening. As Bill Hamilton put it, and I have learned the hard
              way, “The arahat fractal is vast.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The Simple Model does not reinforce fascination with content, nor with
              life denying ideals or limited emotional range models in the way that
              the traditional Four Path Model often does. It does not tempt one to
              count paths. It keeps the focus on precise inquiry into the truth and
              one’s experience of it or lack thereof.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> This model basically says that enlightenment is about direct insight
              that progressively reveals something different in the relationship to
              the field of experience and gradually allows things in it to be held in
              their proper proportion. Thus, it is a Non-Duality Model.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> The first understanding is that sensations are sensations, thoughts are
              thoughts, and this forms the basis of further inquiry. When the
              universal characteristics of these sensations begin to be seen, this
              represents growth in understanding. When the whole sense field is known
              directly and completely as it is, this can cause an entrance into
              Fruition through one of the Three Doors, and represents the first stage
              of awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> When one appreciates the cycles of the process of awakening and has
              completed at least one more cycle, this is the next stage. When one
              begins to appreciate the emptiness, luminosity, centerlessness,
              agentlessness, etc. of phenomena in real-time and this becomes the
              focus of practice rather than Fruition, this is the next stage. When
              the sense of the watcher, observer, subject, controller, doer, etc. is
              seen completely as it is and the knot of perception untangles, that
              simple, fundamental way of perceiving things is the next stage of
              awakening. When that untangling stays untangled, that is the next
              stage. When that understanding is integrated into our lives, that is
              the next phase, though I am not sure it can be defined as a stage
              rather than as a process.</span></p>

              understanding into so much more than it is, such as add ideals of
              emotional perfection onto this. There is some truth in the models
              dealing with emotions, but it has to do with things moving through
              faster and being seen more clearly. It does not have anything to do
              with bad emotions not arising. I hate to even go here, as my goal is to
              give the emotional models the bashing they richly deserve, but I also
              want to not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Thus, here it goes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> As the deep-seated perceptual sense of a separate, continuous,
              permanent, observing Agent stops being extrapolated from the same old
              patterns of sensations that seemed to be those, there is this wider
              inclusive something that can come into the consciousness of the
              enlightened individual, depending on their level of awakening. There is
              also a slowly growing directness of perception that comes as reality is
              not filtered so exclusively through thought. These two can combine to
              give the emotions of enlightened beings less sticking power, so that
              they may move through more quickly than for those that are not
              enlightened, and also may be seen more quickly and clearly as they
              arise and vanish. There may also be less blind contraction into
              thoughts and emotions and a wider perspective, thus giving the other
              parts of the brain more of a chance of creating moderated responses to
              the emotions. That said, even when seen through, there seems to be a
              biological component to how emotions move through that can only be
              expedited so much.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;"> Anyone who thinks these highly qualified statements are anything like a
              vision of emotional perfection or the elimination of all negative
              emotions is not paying attention! That is the last thing I wish to
              imply. I merely wish to say that there is some increased clarity about
              our basic human experience and it can help, but that is all. That said,
              you would be amazed how angry, lustful or ignorant enlightened beings
              can be, and they can still do all sorts of stupid things based on these
              emotions, just like everyone else. The ability to moderate responses to
              emotions can sometimes give the impression that those emotions have
              been attenuated, but that is not the same thing, and there is my nice
              transition to the Action Models.</span></p>

              <p>I do not think an Anagami or Arhat still have aversion to arising and passing. Only ordinary people have aversion to experiences, and an Arhat has completely eradicated such dualistic clinging.</p>
              <p>Also, before an Arhat enters into Nirvana without mind or body, while still in Samsara, he is in Nirvana with mind and body. Since his mind is already in nirvana amidst samsara he does not fear samsara. In fact, he does not separate samsara with nirvana and clearly sees everything in the state of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>What is Nirvana? Nirvana really not a "void" as opposed to phenomena we perceive or the arising and ceasing. It is also not a place or a mental state. Nirvana is simply the absence of the illusion of duality, of "self" versus "world", of the afflictions such as dualistic attraction, aversion, or ignorance. That is why an Arhat can continue living as long as the conditions for his mind and body is still present. Nirvana is not annihilation of a "self", it is simply the absence of conditions for the experience of suffering. In the case of remainderless nirvana (after death of an Arhat), it is the absence of conditions for further birth of the body and mind. This suffering is due to dualistic relationship with phenomena, and once that illusion is seen he is freed from all sufferings and realises the Unborn. What is most important is the Insight, as Buddha explains to Bahiya:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the seen, there is only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, there is only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, there is only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, there is only the cognized.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus you should see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing here;</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">this, Bahiya, is how you should train yourself.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Since, Bahiya, there is for you</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the seen, only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, only the cognized,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">and you see that there is no thing here,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will therefore see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing there.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As you see that there is no thing there,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you are therefore located neither in the world of this,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in the world of that,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in any place</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">betwixt the two.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This alone is the end of suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</span></p>
              <p>An Anagami has also overcome the coarse attraction (desire) and aversion (or hatred) with arising and passing, but the subtler illusion of duality and afflictions remain.</p>
              <p>When the illusion of "you" verses "arising and phenomena" ends, it is seen that in hearing it is simply Sound heard, there is no Hearer and the sound is not I nor mine nor is it "heard by me". It simply arise and pass by itself, and so since there is no "you" "clinging" to "sound", there is no experience of suffering. It only becomes suffering if there is the illusion of a "me" hearing the "sound" -- then "I" become annoyed by the "noise" and try to block off the sound (which is due to the illusion that there is a "me" who is separated from the "sound"). When duality is seen through, dualistic attraction and aversion towards arising and passing ends... suffering ends.</p>

              <p><strong>Nirvana With and Without "Remainder"</strong></p>
              <p>Nirvana is neither a place nor a mental state. It is a fact about us. A 
                                  nirvana is the absence of afflictions in someone whose cultivation of wisdom has 
                                  resulted in the destruction of ignorance, desire, hatred, etc. That mere absence 
                                  is the nirvana.</p>
              <p>On that, all Buddhist schools agree. However, they disagree over the use of 
                                  the term "remainder" used in conjunction with nirvana. Other than Prasangika, it 
                                  is said that after a person attains nirvana, he or she subsequently can be said 
                                  to have a "nirvana with remainder," the "remainder" being the body and mind. 
                                  Death cuts the remainder. However, the nirvana without remainder is a single 
                                  moment, occurring just at the time of death but not after. After death there is 
                                  no person to whom the nirvana can belong!</p>
              <p>Hinayana schools do not recognize any existence after death for an Arhat. The 
                                  Mahayana schools do, and all except Asanga's say that Arhats manifest in 
                                  different forms, no longer helplessly reborn according to karma, and continue to 
                                  cultivate wisdom and merit until they have become Buddhas. Because Asanga and 
                                  his followers say that there are Arhats who do not go on to Buddhahood, they 
                                  must explain that those Arhats are born in the pure lands of Buddhas and abide 
                                  there forever in meditative absorption.</p>
              <p>The Prasangika school uses the term "remainder" in a completely different 
                                  manner. For them, "remainder" has to do with whether or not to an Arhat things 
                                  still appear to have true existence. To explain this, we have to recall what was 
                                  said previously about the obstructions to liberation and obstructions to 
                                  omniscience. What prevents our liberation is our conceptions of inherent 
                                  existence. Things appear to us as though they exist from their own side, 
                                  independently, and we assent to this appearance by conceiving of them in this 
                                  way. Meditation that analyzes the way things exist will destroy this false 
                                  conception, and we can be liberated from it and from the samsara it causes.</p>
              <p>However, because of the way we have been conditioned, which in Buddhism is a 
                                  process without beginning, things still appear to exist inherently. The 
                                  liberated person is someone who no longer assents to this appearance, who is 
                                  always doubtful of the evidence of the senses and resists conceiving of them in 
                                  the wrong way. He or she is like someone who wears sunglasses, well aware that 
                                  the green tint pervading all visible objects is just the effect of the lenses. 
                                  It takes a very long time for the appearance of inherent existence itself to 
                                  fade. Those "taints" of appearances are the obstructions to omniscience.</p>
              <p>From this perspective, then, an Arhat experiences a nirvana with remainder 
                                  most of the time, since most of the time things appear falsely. But then, when 
                                  does a nirvana without remainder occur? It occurs only when that person is 
                                  meditating on emptiness because at that time only emptiness appears to the mind. 
                                  For nonBuddhas, it is impossible for both emptiness and other things to appear 
                                  to the mind simultaneously. (Another way of putting this is to say that the two 
                                  truths cannot appear simultaneously to a non-Buddha's mind.)</p>
              <p>So, both Prasangikas and others could identify an Arhat's usual state, the 
                                  time when he or she is not absorbed in meditation on emptiness, as a nirvana 
                                  with remainder, but they would mean very different things by it. Prasangikas 
                                  would mean that things falsely appear to the mind; others would mean that the 
                                  Arhat is alive. Similarly, both Prasangikas and others would identify the 
                                  nirvana of an Arhat at the time of death as being a nirvana without remainder 
                                  but they would mean something different by it. Prasangikas would mean that at 
                                  that time there is no false appearance to the mind (because, for a short time, 
                                  only a vacuity appears to the mind), whereas others would mean that the body and 
                                  mind are abandoned.</p>
              <p>Other than the purpose of again pressing home their contention about the 
                                  empty nature of things, why do Prasanigikas change this terminology? Jamyang 
                                  Shayba here gives two arguments. First, it makes no sense to say that there is 
                                  any person who experiences a nirvana without remainder if that means that the 
                                  aggregates are abandoned. There is no person once the aggregates are destroyed. 
                                  Second, the language that suggests that Arhats "extinguish" their aggregates 
                                  really just refers to their emptiness. Like all things, our bodies and minds are 
                                  "primordially extinguished" into emptiness because they are, and always have 
                                  been, empty of inherent existence.</p>

              <p>According to Buddha said, Birth is only caused by Karma.No other
                              Dhamma will cause birth of life.Buddha said birth is
                              suffering.Whoeve attain the third or fourth enlightenment don't
                              want suffering.If one still have vow to birth again, the defilement
                              is still remaining in the body and mind.This defilement will cause
                              the vow to birth again.This result lead to Karma.Karma causes birth
                              again.All the Dhamma follow cause and effect theory.The birth of a
                              Bodhisattva which occurred due to his vow not based on defilements
                              is against the cause and effect theory and Karma theory.</p>

              <p>A Bodhisattva does not seek cessation nor fear samsara. So having vows is seen to be not inherently a problem, as this is not due to mundane desires or ignorance but due to his great compassion for sentient beings. He sees great compassion and emptiness as inseparable.</p>
              <p>Also, the appearance of Bodhisattva is due to the condition of his vows. But it is not due to karma, and he is no longer 'helplessly' under the power of karma to take rebirth. His remaining karma may condition his life, but it does not obstruct his liberation or his ability to enter into nirvana as he wishes. Meaning, he can enter nirvana as he wish, but he can also appear anywhere he want to in order to save all sentient beings and continue his path to Buddhahood. And a Bodhisattva does not abide in cessation. He lives in Non-Abiding Nirvana. In Mahayana we also have a similar understanding of the Buddhas.</p>
