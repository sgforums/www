                                          Bing Fen (Book 1), Jen Chen Buddhist Book Publisher</span><br> <br> <strong>Â“Discussing about SharirasÂ”</strong><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">By Venerable
                                          Shen-Kai</span><br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head_02.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> The Sharira is truly a very amazing and miraculous object. Though
                                          it is a material substance, it can also be said to be immaterial.
                                          However, only the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, great Masters, saints and
                                          Bhikshus would have shariras. Some lay Buddhists who are great
                                          practitioners, both males and females, may also have shariras.
                                          Typically, after the practitioner passes away and is cremated,
                                          numerous colourful bead-like objects, known as shariras, would be
                                          retrieved from the ashes. It does not melt under high temperature,
                                          does not dissolve with high humidity, does not spoil under high
                                          pressure, and does not get destroyed over kalpas. Interestingly,
                                          not every Buddhist has shariras. Buddhists who do not practice,
                                          just as other people who do not believe in Buddhism, would not have
                                          shariras. There are plentiful religions in the world. Why is it
                                          that the religious leader, missionaries and believers do not have
                                          shariras? There are also practitioners from religions other than
                                          Buddhism, yet only people who practice the Dharma have shariras.
                                          Besides, one could also tell the level of practice through the
                                          number of shariras produced. Those with deeper level of practice
                                          would have more shariras, while those with a shallow level of
                                          practice would have fewer shariras. If one has practiced for
                                          countless lifetimes, the number of shariras one would have the
                                          beauty of its colour and luster and other miraculous occurrences
                                          would be even more incredible.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-head-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> According to the records of the life story of Buddha, when
                                          Shakyamuni Buddha entered Nirvana, Â“At this moment, the golden
                                          coffin ascended to the height of seven Â“duo luoÂ” trees, moved
                                          around in space, dissolved into the fire of Samadhi,
                                          instantaneously producing ashes and shariras appeared, like
                                          multi-coloured beads, bright and firmÂ”. According to the
                                          explanations, there are as many as 84 Â“dou3Â” shariras. At that
                                          time, the shariras were divided amongst the 8 great Kings and other
                                          BuddhaÂ’s disciples. They built stupas to venerate the shariras.
                                          While the majority of the shariras were left in the human realm,
                                          some were kept in the Naga realm or Heaven realm. There was also
                                          BuddhaÂ’s great disciple, Venerable Ananda. When he entered Nirvana,
                                          his physical body levitated to the space, dissolved into fire and
                                          self-cremated. His shariras rained down from the sky upon the banks
                                          of the Ganges river. All these did not only happen in the ancient
                                          times. <strong>Even as recent as the great Buddhist leader Â– Master
                                          Tai-Hsu, when he passed away, there were more than 400 shariras.
                                          The Pure Land master Â– Venerable Yin Kwang, also produced a few
                                          hundred shariras when he passed away.</strong> There are also other
                                          innumerable great Masters and Teachers who had shariras. There was
                                          especially a <strong>Zhang Jia Rinpoche who passed away in Tai Pei in 1957;
                                          he had as many as 7000 to 8000 shariras.</strong> He even had the most
                                          precious Vajra gem and six-syllable mantra. The shariras could be
                                          as large as beans and as tiny as seeds. They were very colourful,
                                          but the white ones were especially remarkable. Other than these,
                                          there are also uncountable accounts of Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, lay
                                          male and female Buddhists who passed away with shariras.<br> <br> <img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-shakya-head.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Actually, one need not to have shariras only upon oneÂ’s Nirvana.
                                          For example, one of the greatest disciples of the Buddha Â–
                                          Mahakashyapa, his indestructible body sharira is presently
                                          concealed in the Â“ling2 jiu1 shan1Â”. He would await for the descent
                                          of the Maitreya Buddha, when he would appear in the Dharma
                                          assembly, benefit sentient beings and then enter into Nirvana.<strong> Other examples include the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva of the Jiu Hua
                                          Mountain in An Hui; Tang Dynasty 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng of Cao
                                          Xi; the Ming dynasty Great Master Han Shan; ChinaÂ’s Wu Jin Zang
                                          Bhikshuni etc, their body sharira are being venerated at Guang Dong
                                          in the Â‘Nan HuaÂ’ monastery. </strong>There is also a Venerable in Thailand
                                          who entered Nirvana in his middle age, but his body did not decay,
                                          it is situated at Â‘Cheng NiangÂ’ and the Thais venerate his Body
                                          Relic; it is also known that his hair is grew 5 times longer than
                                          when he was alive. <strong>In Taiwan Si Zhi Maitreya Monastery, the Ci Hang
                                          Bodhisattva non-decayed Body Relic was a breaking news,</strong> people from
                                          local and abroad pay homage to it; <strong>in Nan Hai Pu Tuo Mountain Â‘Gu
                                          Fuo DongÂ’, there are many body relics of old monks who passed away
                                          for plenty of years.</strong> Regarding body relics/shariras, there are
                                          plenty of cases in different places and mountains in China. Those
                                          who follow and practice (xiu1 chi2) according to the Buddhadharma,
                                          not only bone marrows, even nails, blood, flesh and teeth, the
                                          entire body can become relics, just like there are lights and
                                          colours on [??]Â’s head.<strong> Venerable Jiu Mo LuoÂ’s tongue did not burn
                                          in cremation, these are Sharira Gems.</strong><br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-relics-blood_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Sharira can also be obtained through Gan3 Ying4
                                          (induction/invocation), in our country (Taiwan) during the era of
                                          Dong Wu Sun Quan, after hearing that Venerable Fan Zeng Kang Zeng
                                          Kai said the merits of paying homage to shariras, thought of
                                          wanting to pay homage to shariras, therefore requested that
                                          Venerable to sincerely pray. After 49 days, he suddenly heard
                                          sounds coming from the empty bottle, and discovered
                                          Â‘Gong-De-She-LiÂ’ (merits sharira). After trying to hit it with a
                                          hammer on a metal zhuan, the sharira remains undamaged. During the
                                          Song dynasty, lay disciple Wang Ri Xi was carving a Pure Land
                                          scripture on the wooden plank and a sharira was carved out. Again
                                          in Song Dynasty, there was a lady who always recited Amitabha
                                          Sutra, in the sutra suddenly a lot of shariras appeared. During Xi
                                          Pu era, there was a monk called Hui Da, in [??], bowed and
                                          sincerely prayed for BuddhaÂ’s relic, suddenly the relic rolled out
                                          from the ground, it is now venerated at Ning Bo Ah Yu Wang
                                          monastery, is known to be the relic that Venerable Hui Da prayed
                                          for. Recently there is a General, once he was at Xi-An Xi-Jiao
                                          Monastery [??] stupa, he sincerely prayed and a huge brick fell out
                                          from the top of the stupa, and realized that two shariras are on
                                          top of it, therefore he renovated the stupa. In Hong Kong,
                                          Venerable Lan Mo went to India for Buddhist pilgrimage, in BuddhaÂ’s
                                          pre-enlightenment Bodhigaya; he met an old practitioner, called
                                          Guang Qing Shi. He was at Jia ? Great Stupa venerating BuddhaÂ’s
                                          relics for 3 years already, once he witnessed sharira dropping by
                                          itself from the top of the stupa, and it even gave him and another
                                          lay disciple 2 shariras; it was very colourful and lovely. During
                                          Ming Guo, Zheng Jue Sheng old lay disciple once venerated two of
                                          Living Buddha Ban ChanÂ’s shariras; it automatically multiplied to 7
                                          of them. When Mr Qu Lao passed away, his wife took 2 shariras and
                                          put onto his mouth. When his funeral was over, it was found that
                                          that 7 shariras remain at home. Later it was given to Li Zi Kuan
                                          old lay disciple who is at Taipei Shan Dao monastery for offering,
                                          but realized the sharira has multiplied to 10. <strong>In Tibetan Vajrayana
                                          Yellow Hat sect leader Lama Tsongkapa dropped a tooth in his latter
                                          years, his disciples treated it as a sharira and venerated it,
                                          shariras grew out from the toothÂ’s root canal. It was distributed
                                          among masses for veneration, after distributing it grew again,
                                          after growing it was distributed again.</strong> <strong>It was known that there is
                                          a Living Buddha, in the early years at China Mainland before his
                                          passing away, often there are disciples praying/requesting his
                                          sharira, he could at any time drop 2 shariras from his nostrils and
                                          gave them for veneration.</strong> It was also heard that there is a
                                          merchant, Da Pu Tuo and Bo Li Jia brothers, they used a jade box
                                          and carried back eight of BuddhaÂ’s hair strands (also BuddhaÂ’s
                                          sharira). They were robbed twice on their way by robbers,
                                          altogether they lost 4 strains. When they arrived back in Myanmar
                                          they asked the king to build a stupa for the veneration of the
                                          shariras, and when they opened the box, they found 8 strains like
                                          it originally was. There are many cases of multiplication of
                                          shariras among those who venerate the shariras; and because
                                          whenever there are hosting of Buddhism activity, often there are
                                          light-flower sharira.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-tooth1_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddha's tooth relic has been

                                          practitioners of their shariras, at Jia Yi Seng saw Zang Ji Hua old
                                          lay disciple, because of his sincere praying and chanting Buddha,
                                          obtained light-flower sharira, at that time liked it a lot,
                                          therefore wished him when he pass away surely have sharira, and it
                                          turned out that a few years ago Zhang Lao in Taipei, fore-knew his
                                          death time, died/liberated without sickness during meditation.
                                          After cremation there are plenty of big and small shariras, there
                                          are sharira-tree and sharira-flower. Once also, visited
                                          Gao-Xiong-Shou mountain monastery Lamp-Burning puja, saw a lot of
                                          lamp-flower sharira. Once more than 10 years ago at Xi Yi, visited
                                          various Venerables recently arrived back from India who brought
                                          back many Buddha Shariras for veneration. They are shaped like
                                          small peanut-grains, I witnessed the colour was white, it was heard
                                          that white was good, some people saw golden-yellow or pale-yellow,
                                          some people saw sky-blue or green colour, some saw red or purple
                                          colour, some saw pearl colour, some saw jade colour, or coral; ????
                                          colour, or if karma is heavy, some saw it as grey or black, or
                                          because of sudden sincere ?, or because of prostrations and sincere
                                          repentance, vowing to be virtuous, the sharira colour turned good;
                                          witnesses found it very mysterious. For example locally in the
                                          present generation, there is a Fa Xue Jia, Mr. Luo Jia Jie,
                                          believed in Buddhism, once he was at Ningbo Ah Yu Wang monastery,
                                          prayed and venerated BuddhaÂ’s shariras, at first it was black
                                          colour, and knew that he had heavy karmic obstructions, therefore
                                          he stayed at the monastery for 7 days 7 nights and kept praying and
                                          repenting. At the 7th day, he visited the sharira again; it turned
                                          totally into white colour, and was satisfied and left. Sharira in
                                          Buddhist disciplesÂ’ minds, it is a great power without pens or ink
                                          or words, yet is able to invoke people to avoid evil and lead them
                                          towards the virtuous path and seek the truth.<br> <br> <img src="http://www.maitreyaproject.org/images/rel-kashyapa.jpg" alt="image"><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Above: sharira of the Buddha
                                          prior to Shakyamuni Buddha, Kassapa Buddha</span><br> <br> Sharira is formed due to the practitionerÂ’s life merits, due to
                                          love, compassion, joy and equanimity (the 4 immeasurable); wisdom;
                                          benefiting others and the worldÂ’s immense merits. It is difficult
                                          to obtain and rare, therefore it is said that shariras are
                                          immaterial, it is beyond-material. Jing Guang Ming Sutra states
                                          Â“Sharira is cultivated out of Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom merits, it
                                          is difficult to obtain and is the highest blessing field." And
                                          also, Â“Persons of shariras, is due to the results of immense
                                          cultivation of Six ParamitasÂ” Prajna sutra also says Â“BuddhaÂ’s body
                                          and She Li Luo (She-Li-Zhi/shariras) is obtained through practice
                                          of Prajna-paramita immense merits, it is venerated, revered,
                                          praised and respected by all Devas and Men.Â” Therefore people of
                                          the world should inspire the heart of veneration towards Buddha and
                                          BodhisattvaÂ’s shariras; it will result in various blessings which
                                          are difficult to comprehend.<br> <br> <img src="http://xs78.xs.to/pics/06175/buddha-flesh-relics_01.jpg" alt="image"><br> <br> Due to the various ways of concrete proof, shariras are not
                                          necessarily made of hair, blood, or marrow, the colours are not of
                                          white, black or 3 types, if the Chinese translate it as Â“body
                                          bonesÂ” or or Â“ling2 bonesÂ”, Â“? bonesÂ”, it is unable to cover the
                                          shariraÂ’s true essence and meaning.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I do not think an Anagami or Arhat still have aversion to
              arising and passing. Only ordinary people have aversion to
              experiences, and an Arhat has completely eradicated such dualistic
              clinging.</p>
              <p>Also, before an Arhat enters into Nirvana without mind or body,
              while still in Samsara, he is in Nirvana with mind and body. Since
              his mind is already in nirvana amidst samsara he does not fear
              samsara. In fact, he does not separate samsara with nirvana and
              clearly sees everything in the state of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>What is Nirvana? Nirvana really not a "void" as opposed to
              phenomena we perceive or the arising and ceasing. It is also not a
              place or a mental state. Nirvana is simply the absence of the
              illusion of duality, of "self" versus "world", of the afflictions
              such as dualistic attraction, aversion, or ignorance. That is why
              an Arhat can continue living as long as the conditions for his mind
              and body is still present. Nirvana is not annihilation of a "self",
              it is simply the absence of conditions for the experience of
              suffering. In the case of remainderless nirvana (after death of an
              Arhat), it is the absence of conditions for further birth of the
              body and mind. This suffering is due to dualistic relationship with
              phenomena, and once that illusion is seen he is freed from all
              sufferings and realises the Unborn. What is most important is the
              Insight, as Buddha explains to Bahiya:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">In the seen, there is only the
              seen,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, there is only the
              heard,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, there is only the
              sensed,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, there is only
              the cognized.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Thus you should see
              that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing
              here;</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">this, Bahiya, is how you should
              train yourself.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Since, Bahiya, there is for
              you</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the seen, only the
              seen,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, only the
              heard,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, only the
              sensed,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, only the
              cognized,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">and you see that there is no
              thing here,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you will therefore see
              that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing
              there.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">As you see that there is no thing
              there,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you will see that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you are therefore located neither
              in the world of this,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">nor in the world of
              that,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">nor in any place</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">betwixt the two.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">This alone is the end of
              suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</span></p>
              <p>An Anagami has also overcome the coarse attraction (desire) and
              aversion (or hatred) with arising and passing, but the subtler
              illusion of duality and afflictions remain.</p>
              <p>When the illusion of "you" verses "arising and phenomena" ends,
              it is seen that in hearing it is simply Sound heard, there is no
              Hearer and the sound is not I nor mine nor is it "heard by me". It
              simply arise and pass by itself, and so since there is no "you"
              "clinging" to "sound", there is no experience of suffering. It only
              becomes suffering if there is the illusion of a "me" hearing the
              "sound" -- then "I" become annoyed by the "noise" and try to block
              off the sound (which is due to the illusion that there is a "me"
              who is separated from the "sound"). When duality is seen through,
              dualistic attraction and aversion towards arising and passing
              ends... suffering ends.</p>

              <p><strong>Nirvana With and Without "Remainder"</strong></p>
              <p>Nirvana is neither a place nor a mental state. It is a fact
              about us. A nirvana is the absence of afflictions in someone whose
              cultivation of wisdom has resulted in the destruction of ignorance,
              desire, hatred, etc. That mere absence is the nirvana.</p>
              <p>On that, all Buddhist schools agree. However, they disagree over
              the use of the term "remainder" used in conjunction with nirvana.
              Other than Prasangika, it is said that after a person attains
              nirvana, he or she subsequently can be said to have a "nirvana with
              remainder," the "remainder" being the body and mind. Death cuts the
              remainder. However, the nirvana without remainder is a single
              moment, occurring just at the time of death but not after. After
              death there is no person to whom the nirvana can belong!</p>
              <p>Hinayana schools do not recognize any existence after death for
              an Arhat. The Mahayana schools do, and all except Asanga's say that
              Arhats manifest in different forms, no longer helplessly reborn
              according to karma, and continue to cultivate wisdom and merit
              until they have become Buddhas. Because Asanga and his followers
              say that there are Arhats who do not go on to Buddhahood, they must
              explain that those Arhats are born in the pure lands of Buddhas and
              abide there forever in meditative absorption.</p>
              <p>The Prasangika school uses the term "remainder" in a completely
              different manner. For them, "remainder" has to do with whether or
              not to an Arhat things still appear to have true existence. To
              explain this, we have to recall what was said previously about the
              obstructions to liberation and obstructions to omniscience. What
              prevents our liberation is our conceptions of inherent existence.
              Things appear to us as though they exist from their own side,
              independently, and we assent to this appearance by conceiving of
              them in this way. Meditation that analyzes the way things exist
              will destroy this false conception, and we can be liberated from it
              and from the samsara it causes.</p>
              <p>However, because of the way we have been conditioned, which in
              Buddhism is a process without beginning, things still appear to
              exist inherently. The liberated person is someone who no longer
              assents to this appearance, who is always doubtful of the evidence
              of the senses and resists conceiving of them in the wrong way. He
              or she is like someone who wears sunglasses, well aware that the
              green tint pervading all visible objects is just the effect of the
              lenses. It takes a very long time for the appearance of inherent
              existence itself to fade. Those "taints" of appearances are the
              obstructions to omniscience.</p>
              <p>From this perspective, then, an Arhat experiences a nirvana with
              remainder most of the time, since most of the time things appear
              falsely. But then, when does a nirvana without remainder occur? It
              occurs only when that person is meditating on emptiness because at
              that time only emptiness appears to the mind. For nonBuddhas, it is
              impossible for both emptiness and other things to appear to the
              mind simultaneously. (Another way of putting this is to say that
              the two truths cannot appear simultaneously to a non-Buddha's
              mind.)</p>
              <p>So, both Prasangikas and others could identify an Arhat's usual
              state, the time when he or she is not absorbed in meditation on
              emptiness, as a nirvana with remainder, but they would mean very
              different things by it. Prasangikas would mean that things falsely
              appear to the mind; others would mean that the Arhat is alive.
              Similarly, both Prasangikas and others would identify the nirvana
              of an Arhat at the time of death as being a nirvana without
              remainder but they would mean something different by it.
              Prasangikas would mean that at that time there is no false
              appearance to the mind (because, for a short time, only a vacuity
              appears to the mind), whereas others would mean that the body and
              mind are abandoned.</p>
              <p>Other than the purpose of again pressing home their contention
              about the empty nature of things, why do Prasanigikas change this
              terminology? Jamyang Shayba here gives two arguments. First, it
              makes no sense to say that there is any person who experiences a
              nirvana without remainder if that means that the aggregates are
              abandoned. There is no person once the aggregates are destroyed.
              Second, the language that suggests that Arhats "extinguish" their
              aggregates really just refers to their emptiness. Like all things,
              our bodies and minds are "primordially extinguished" into emptiness
              because they are, and always have been, empty of inherent
              existence.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your spending time to reply.</p>
              <p>From your statement,</p>
              <p>I do not think an Anagami or Arhat still have aversion to
                                      arising and passing. Only ordinary people have aversion to
                                      experiences, and an Arhat has completely eradicated such dualistic
                                      clinging.</p>
              <p>I did not say Arahart have aversion to arising and passing. I say Anagami person has aversion to arising and passing of fine particles level.We cannot use term aversion or harted for the arising and perishing of fine particles.As you said , the subtler
              illusion of duality and afflictions remain in fine particles level.</p>
              <p>I am pleased you describe the following Dhamma becasue Theinngu Arhart told us the same thing in the audio clip his fourth enlighenment experience. Thanks.</p>
              <p>as Buddha explains to Bahiya:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">In the seen, there is only the
              seen,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, there is only the

              sensed,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, there is only
              the cognized.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Thus you should see
              that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing
              here;</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">this, Bahiya, is how you should
              train yourself.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Since, Bahiya, there is for
              you</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the seen, only the
              seen,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, only the

              sensed,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, only the
              cognized,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">and you see that there is no
              thing here,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you will therefore see
              that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing
              there.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">As you see that there is no thing
              there,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you will see that</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">you are therefore located neither
              in the world of this,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">nor in the world of
              that,</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">nor in any place</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">betwixt the two.</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">This alone is the end of
              suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</span></p>
