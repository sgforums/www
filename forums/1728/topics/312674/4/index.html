              <p>I would like to explain more details on Arahart</p>
              <p>There are two types of meditation:–<br> 1. Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na, and<br> 2. VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na.<br> 1. The practice of Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na will develop the mental
                                      states of<br> eight lokiya-samÄ�patti (mundane attainments) consisting of the four
                                      rÅ«pajhÄ�nas<br> and four rÅ«pa-jhÄ�nas. Repeated exercise of these jhÄ�nic states will
                                      bring<br> forth the following:–<br> a) Iddhividha-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to become manifold from being one,
                                      and<br> from being manifold to become one again. Power to pass without
                                      obstruction<br> through walls and mountains, just as if through the air. Power to
                                      walk on water<br> without sinking, as if on the earth. Power to dive into the earth
                                      and rise up again,<br> just as if in the water. Power to float cross-legged through the
                                      air, just as a<br> winged bird. Power to touch the sun and moon with the hand.<br> b) Dibbasota-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial ear, the power to hear sounds
                                      both<br> heavenly and human, far and near.<br> c) Cetopariya-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to know the mind of others.<br> d) PubbenivÄ�sa-abhiññÄ� â€• Power to recollect the incidents of one's
                                      past<br> existences.<br> e) Dibbacakkhu-abhiññÄ� â€• Celestial eye, the power to see all
                                      material<br> forms and colours, whether far off or near, whether great or
                                      small.</p>
              <p>To obtain the enlighenment from frist stage to four stages, VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na. is the main path to Nibbana or Arahart.</p>
              <p>To obtain the different power , Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na is the main path</p>
              <p>Depending on which meditation method monk practices, the resulf will come out four different kinds of Arahart or Hermit</p>
              <p>Some monk practise only VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na to become Arahart.Since these monks never practice the  Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na, they do not have different power.</p>
              <p>Some monk practise both VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na and VipassanÄ�-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na to become Arahart.So these monks have different power</p>
              <p>Some monk practise only Samatha-kammaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na .These monks cannot get  the enlighenment from frist stage to four stages. This result lead to fine material world.This can be said hermit knowledge.</p>

              <p><br>Of course. So prior to developing wisdom and enlightenment one should avoid it altogether. Other than being a mere distraction, it can prevent lots of problems frm arising.</p>

              <p>e.g 1)SotÄ�patti Magga’ and ‘Phala ñÄ�á¹‡a at first stage</p>
              <p>      2)‘SakadÄ�gÄ�mi Magga and Phala’ (Path of oncereturning and its fruition) and becomes a SakadÄ�gÄ�mi (once-returner) at second stage</p>
              <p>3) AnÄ�gÄ�mi Magga and Phala’ (path of non-returning and its fruition) at third stage</p>
              <p>4) Arahatta Magga and Phala’ (path of Arahantship and its fruition) at fourth stage</p>
              <p>An Arahant is free from the remaining five fetters:–<br>1. RÅ«pa-rÄ�ga (craving for fine-material existence),<br>2. ArÅ«pa-rÄ�ga (craving for immaterial existence),<br>3. MÄ�na (conceit),<br>4. Uddhacca (restlessness), and<br>5. AvijjÄ� (ignorance or delusion) together with all defilements (kilesa). At<br>the end of the span of the present life he will attain nibbÄ�na. As there is no more<br>rebirth for him after the parinibbÄ�na he is absolutely free from suffering the<br>woes of old age, ill-health, death etc</p>

              <p>9) State at Nibbana after Buddha and Arahart passed awayAmong level 1 to level 9 , Level 9 is the highest stage. Level 1

              <p>IMO, it doesn't matter how long it takes to be an arahant.</p>
              <p>Also, how long from the standpoint or reference of what?</p>
              <p>I think it is more important to be a stream-winner or get a first glimpse of pure awareness/presence.</p>
              <p>After the first glimpse, there are many more challenges.</p>
              <p>I think those people who can awake very fast, already have much training in previous lives.</p>

              <p>Youngest arhat in history -- 7 year old. Two such cases in Suttas, possibly other cases after Buddha's parinirvana. Buddha instructed a monk to learn from one of the 7 year old arhat, and the monk too attained Arhatship. So wisdom may not be dependent on age.</p>
              <p>Oldest arhat in history -- almost 2600 years old and still living. Mahakasyapa, one of Buddha's top 10 disciples, vowed to remain in nirodha samapatti until the next Buddha Maitreya attains Buddhahood. Some people who wanted to meet him and paid him a visit was able to see him, others were not able. He was the only top 10 disciple that we do not have his relics today (cos he's still alive). He used his psychic powers to shield himself from the outside world in a mountain.</p>
              <p>Fastest record to attain Arhatship -- 1 day. I think multiple accounts of these can be found in the Suttas, one of them is the case of Bahiya, who the Buddha instructed on the practice of Insight and the nature of non-duality. There are others such as Shariputra who attained enlightenment after hearing a single verse/instruction by the Buddha on Insight/insight practice attained instantaneous awakening.</p>
              <p>The Buddha who instructed his monks to practice the four foundations of mindfulness would often tell us that we should expect no more than 7 years to attain Arhatship. In fact it can be much shorter, 7 years are for those with dull capacities. However I think these generally refer to practitioners on retreat, for most of us we are simply not hardworking enough on our practice. But it is certainly possible for us too, and I know many lay and busy men and women who too attained enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The Buddha:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verily, monks, whosoever practises these four
                      foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven years, then one of
                      these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge
                      (Arahantship) here and now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet
                      present, the state of non-returning. [28]</p>
              <p>O
                      monks, let alone seven years. Should any person practise these four
                      foundations of mindfulness in this manner for six years ... five years
                      ... four years ... three years ... two years ... one year, then one of
                      these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge here and
                      now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet present, the state of
                      non-returning.</p>
              <p>O
                      monks, let alone a year. Should any person practise these four
                      foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven months ... six
                      months ... five months ... four months ... three months ... two months
                      ... a month ... half a month, then one of these two fruits may be
                      expected by him: highest knowledge here and now, or if some remainder
                      of clinging is yet present, the state of non-returning.</p>
              <p>O monks, let alone half a month.
                      Should any person practise these four foundations of mindfulness in
                      this manner for a week, then one of these two fruits may be expected by
                      him: highest knowledge here and now, or if some remainder of clinging
                      is yet present, the state of non-returning.</p>
              <p>Because
                      of this it was said: "This is the only way, monks, for the purification
                      of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the
                      destruction of suffering and grief, for reaching the right path, for
                      the attainment of Nibbana, namely the four foundations of mindfulness."</p>
              <p>Thus spoke the Blessed One. Satisfied, the monks approved of his words.</p>
              <p>Satipatthana Sutta<br> Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 10</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other teachings such as Dzogchen, aspirants are told that those of dull capacities should go on retreat and be able to attain Full Enlightenment in no more than 10 years. That is only dull capacity, still there are those who attain full enlightenment much faster than that.</p>
              <p>Of course, provided you put in the effort and do consistent practice, you will be on a certain path to awakening. Also, an initial awakening is much easier and quicker to come by. It is generally harder to aim for the complete fruition -- i.e. Arhatship or Buddhahood of the Hinayana or Mahayana respectively. That will take a longer time, but again it is possible and the Buddha assures no more than 7 years for full liberation needed if you work on your practice.</p>
              <p>My Master has once told us that if we practiced what he taught us, it will not take more than 4 years to awaken/realise one's true nature.</p>
              <p>So, knowing this possibility, we should practice mindfulness, diligently and consistently and have the right views... an enlightened teacher to guide will also be of great help.</p>

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>There are four kinds of persons to become Arahart</p>
              <p><strong>1) First person to become Arahart after hearing the one line of Dhamma.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2</strong><strong>) Second person to become Arahart after hearing the long topics of Dhamma</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3) Third person to become Arahart after meditation of Dhamma.According to Buddha said;<br></strong></p>
              <p>There are there types of person for third person.</p>
              <p>First person of third type take 7 days to become Arahart by meditation(brilliant person)</p>
              <p>Second person of third type take 7 months to become Arahart by meditation(bright person)</p>
              <p>Third person of third type take 7 years to become Arahart by meditation(dull person)</p>
              <p><strong>4) Fourth person cannot become Arahart at the present life although he is working hard and diligent on meditation</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>s it possible to gradually train like this?</p>

              <p>The above statement is wrong. After the person become Arahart , he is inclined to Nibbana. Never become Bodhisattva and Buddha.</p>
              <p>Arahart, Bodhisattav and Buddha all are inclined to Nibbana.</p>

              <p>No, the path of personal liberation leads to the fruition of Arhatship, while the path of the Bodhisattva finally culminates in Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>While both the common Arhat and a Buddha are liberated and awakened to reality, the difference is in the culmination of wisdom and merits of a Buddha as well as his Bodhicitta and vows and great compassion to save all sentient beings. So the path is different.</p>
              <p>If you are a follower of Mahayana, if you cultivate the dharma and attain awakening you will become a 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva and practice until Buddhahood. A Bodhisattva on the Bhumis are also liberated, are above the cycles of birth and death, but returns to samsara due to Bodhisatta vows. He is free and liberated like an Arhat but gives rise to great compassion for all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>In other words... The difference between the Arhat's cessation/nirvana
                      with the Bodhisattva's nirvana is that Bodhisattvas strives for the
                      non-abiding nirvana rather than just cessation.</p>
              <p>In non-abiding nirvana the Bodhisattva has realized Emptiness (which
                      does not mean 'Void' but the Emptiness of Self and Phenomena as the
                      ultimate nature of reality) and are liberated from the cycles of birth
                      and death of samsara but also be of limitless help to sentient beings,
                      emanating bodies to teach them the Dharma and so forth.They live among
                      us in a state of non-abiding nirvana, they do not separate Samsara and
                      Nirvana and are not attached to the state of Nirvana (and samsara)</p>

              <p>Whoever get the four enlighenement is above the cyles of birth and death. This means no more give birth and death. Why no more give brith and death? They have already kill and eliminated all the defilement from the body and mind.Hence they don't return to Samara for any reasons and conditions.There is no causes (all the causes have been killed) to return to Samsara.If they have not killed all the defilements, they were not Arahart.</p>

              <p>No, the path of personal liberation leads to the fruition of
              Arhatship, while the path of the Bodhisattva finally culminates in
              Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>While both the common Arhat and a Buddha are liberated and
              awakened to reality, the difference is in the culmination of wisdom
              and merits of a Buddha as well as his Bodhicitta and vows and great
              compassion to save all sentient beings. So the path is
              different.</p>
              <p>If you are a follower of Mahayana, if you cultivate the dharma
              and attain awakening you will become a 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva and
              practice until Buddhahood. A Bodhisattva on the Bhumis are also
              liberated, are above the cycles of birth and death, but returns to
              samsara due to Bodhisatta vows. He is free and liberated like an
              Arhat but gives rise to great compassion for all sentient
              beings.</p>
              <p>In other words... The difference between the Arhat's
              cessation/nirvana with the Bodhisattva's nirvana is that
              Bodhisattvas strives for the non-abiding nirvana rather than just
              cessation.</p>
              <p>In non-abiding nirvana the Bodhisattva has realized Emptiness
              (which does not mean 'Void' but the Emptiness of Self and Phenomena
              as the ultimate nature of reality) and are liberated from the
              cycles of birth and death of samsara but also be of limitless help
              to sentient beings, emanating bodies to teach them the Dharma and
              so forth.They live among us in a state of non-abiding nirvana, they
              do not separate Samsara and Nirvana and are not attached to the
              state of Nirvana (and samsara)</p>

              <p>A Bodhisattva may still have past karma, just as a Buddha still has past karma manifesting (sickness, pain, etc) even after enlightenment. But a Bodhisattva is not born due to the power of karma, and he can choose to enter nirvana to his/her liking at any time. But Bodhisattvas do not abide in cessation, but strives for non-abiding nirvana. Note that all these are the perspective of Mahayana, I think Theravadins do not share such understandings.</p>
              <p>The karma of a Bodhisattva cannot obstruct a liberated Bodhisattva (i.e. an Arya Bodhisattva, but in Theravada generally there's no concept of a Bodhisattva who's arya/enlightened), and the karma is so largely cleared that it's described as the stench remaining in the jar after its contents are poured out... these 'remaining stench' cannot obstruct the Arya's state of liberation.</p>

              <p>We did not share such understandings because all the famous sayadaw and Arahart from Therava Buddhism history, never said all these. I have never heard or read about this from thousand of Therava Buddhism book and Pali laguage of Buddha scripture.</p>
