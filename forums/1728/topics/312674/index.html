              <p>First of all, you may need to understand the term Arhat in buddhist context. I do not think anyone of us can tell you, how do see another person who has attain these level, Arhat has already gain enlightenment to a certain level and he does not go through anymore rebirth or reincarnation. There are a few more levels above an Arhat, the highest level is Buddha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you should explain to him the term arhat, and tell him, you are only a human where you cant determind someone who has already left the six releam(reincarnation), as we human still fall in the six releam whereas an Arhat has attain enlightenment and no more in the six releam.</p>

              <p>You're right -- Arhat is one who has attained enlightenment to the true nature of reality and gained personal liberation from Samsara, from Sufferings, from the cycle of rebirth.</p>
              <p>But unlike a Buddha or Bodhisattva he does not have the vow or will to guide all sentient beings or attain Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>It is not necessary that an Arhat will continue to practice the Bodhisattva path after attaining Arhatship -- most of them simply enter into their personal nirvana (cessation), for a very very long time, for aeons, until a Buddha wakes him up from his cessation to continue the Bodhisattva path. But it will take a very very long time.</p>

              <p>If an Arhat has become enlightened, he will know he has become enlightened. Why? Because he has awakened to the ultimate nature of reality, he is not at all deluded anymore by the illusion of a "Self", he perceives reality as it really is without doubts. He becomes freed from all sufferings.</p>
              <p>You may use the analogy that all of us is in a sleep -- we are in a nightmare, we think that there is a "self" and a tiger or murderer chasing us, and we are suffering in this dream. Someone who has awakened/liberated sees that the dream character "self" and the "murderer" is unreal, so he does not suffer, because he no longer perceives the delusion of separation and inherent existence of a "self". When you woke up, you won't doubt whether you are awake or asleep.</p>
              <p>He becomes freed from the 10 fetters, which is roughly this:</p>

              <p>Hi Zarks, in Buddhism we do not believe in a God. We do not believe in a Creator. How do we know becoming Arhat is the right way? I think first of all you must have the right understanding of what an enlightened being is, why we should seek to be enlightened. You may want to learn about what the 4 Noble Truths is, this will give you a better idea of why the path to Liberation is so important. You may want to read this: <a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html">http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html</a></p>
              <p>Regarding God does not exist in Buddhism, I have posted this before regarding Buddhism and God:<br> <br> ------------------<br> <br> First of all Buddhism does not accept the Judeo-Christian or other
              theistic religions' idea that there is a personal Creator, means the
              Old Testament kind of God that has a personality of its own.. and you
              can actually meet him up for coffee Mr. Green. If there is a personal
              Creator it brings a lot of questions into mind. Therefore, Albert
              Einstein supposedly said (though whether he really said it I do not
              know),<br> <br> "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic
              religion for the future: it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas
              and theology; it covers both the natural &amp; spiritual, and it is
              based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things,
              natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity"<br> <br> and..<br> <br> Â“If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism.Â”<br> <br> Regarding the question of Personal God in Buddhism,<br></p>

              <td class="quote"><br> Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br> <br> Slightly edited from the first topic in our forum regarding Creationism: How the Brahma believed He was God?<br> <br> In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one
              popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped
              nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the
              All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
              Chief of All".<br> <br> In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the
              first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above
              where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8
              Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the
              devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God.
              Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of such a notion that the
              Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He
              met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer.
              Eventually he has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br> <br> The Buddha was also known to have said this,<em><br> <br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why does he order such misfortune<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br> And he such inequity and injustice create?<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br> Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</em><br> <br> When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was
              formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent
              brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br> <em><br> 'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to
              himself: " I am Brahmà, the Great Brahmà, the Supreme One, the Mighty,
              the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
              Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the
              Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my
              creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they
              might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1
              2:5</em><br> <br> In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br> <br> The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk
              of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the
              powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states
              that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he
              cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of
              cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can
              use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a
              short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br> <br> from <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm:</a><br> <em><br> When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world
              who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the
              human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha,
              with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked,
              "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the
              universe, is this a fact?"<br> <br> The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br> <br> Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br> <br> The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life
              and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br> <br> Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did
              you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill,
              and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br> <br> Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied

              the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race.
              The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally,

              the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first
              cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by
              other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may
              become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again
              become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called

              importance. Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the
              Buddhist practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the
              Buddha said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get
              enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas
              (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning --
              whether this teaching actually helps us.<br></p>

              <p>A practitioner recognises he or she has become an arhat when every trace of illusion of self as I mentioned earlier.. has been seen through by realisation, removed. This happens when there is a sudden quantum shift in perception of reality, it is like waking up from a dream of separation to perceive reality as it is. There can be no doubts in this, just like there can be no doubts when you woke up that you are awake and no longer asleep.</p>
              <p>Other specific signs may include the removal of the 10 fetters which I mentioned earlier. But the most important factor is the Insight which I mentioned above -- otherwise one may just delude himself to think that he no longer has 'craving', 'ill-will', 'conceit' and so on when in reality he is still pretty much a deluded samsaric person.</p>

              <p>Thanks very much, Eternal Now, for the response on arhats... I
                      will take this answer to my class and share it with them.  I
                      teach about Buddhism but do not practice Buddhism myself, so
                      sometimes I get questions like this that I feel I would be better
                      able to answer if I were a practitioner.  It's nice to have
                      this forum to come to.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Zeke , how do you gauge a person is an arhat ?Throwing aside all the definition as definition by An Eternal Now and Bodhi Hut ,do you think there is something "attainable" in the spiritual dimension ?</p>
              <p>Arhat have already overcome the concept of self, thus no mental sufferings .<br>But his residual habitual action still persist .</p>
              <p>Sariputra still dance in front of the assembly of monks when Deva start playing their heavenly music .Its such an embarassing sight , but Buddha points out its due to his 500 births in the deva as a result</p>
              <p>Maugdylana chided a river goddess to ask her to let him cross ,the river goddess is insulted as he mentioned "little fairy" ,which Buddha pointed out to the assembly he was once a heavenly general ,thus the habitual actions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that helps you in the answer .If Buddhism is a religion that can be gauged ,I am afraid we are all mundane</p>
              <p>Spiritual level is something that cannot be explained with simple scientific formulae ,experiment to replicate or re-enact.</p>
              <p>It must be totally Clarity of Mind and severing the notion of "I"</p>

              <p><br>You remind me of my teacher in my school time ,that guy is westerner as well ,good and knowledgable person.It's a religion course ,but at that time i don't quite know religion well,so cannot communicate so much with the teacher.</p>
              <p>I think there r different thing between eastern and western methedology towards religion ,western is more organised ,systermatic,as westerner r more rational.</p>
              <p>easterner r more irrational ,sentimental.So buddhist never persuade people to believe in buddhism ,it just teach ,help ppl solve the problem ,christian is more enthusiastic engaging in building hospital ,run a charity show.</p>
              <p>westerner r more proactive,assertive, but chinese ,as by the teaching of è€�å­�ã€‚ä¸�æ•¢ä¸ºå¤©ä¸‹å…ˆwhich means don't dare to be the first ,is more humble.</p>
