              <p>Hi, Arhats have removed all Kleshas (afflictions and defilements), but non-afflictive ignorance and habitual tendencies may remain. Only Buddhas have totally removed these.</p>

              <p>Regarding the "cheng ren ji cheng fo" as Bohiruci suggested, is probably refering to something like attaining Buddhahood through a humanistic way and as a human.</p>
              <p>This is also rather similar to my Master's teachings, which emphasize teaching Buddhism in a way that is relevant and applicable for all human beings that might bring true bliss, awareness and liberation in our lives. <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg">http://www.jenchen.org.sg</a></p>
              <p>We practice Buddhism because we want to live as an awakened, blissful, liberated, compassionate, wise human being. You may like to look into how we can practice Buddhism in our daily lives.</p>

              <p>welcome to this forum. :)<br>I agree with what other forummers has said.<br>When one become Arhat, he will know, there is no need to ask around if he has attained arhatship.<br>One way to measure is if one has realised emptiness, then within at most few more life times, he will attain arhatship.<br>It is good that your student ask you this question, there are people who practice alone 1, after attaining some achievement, think that he has attained arhatship then making falsehood by telling people that he is enlightened. That is a very serious bad karma.</p>

              <p>What do you mean by "not in our dimension"?</p>
              <p>Arhats, when they attain arhatship, actually still live among us and appear normally as one of us. In Buddha's times, thousands of his students were recorded to have attained arhatship and people up till today continue to have attained arhatship...</p>
              <p>They all are humans, because only humans can cultivate to attain arhatship... the only other place is the pure abodes in 4th jhana.</p>

              <p>Mahayana Buddhism, on the other hand, regards the Bodhisattva as a person who already has a considerable degree of enlightenment and seeks to use their <a class="mw-redirect" title="Prajna" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/wiki/Prajna"><span style="color: #0066cc;">wisdom</span></a> to help other human beings to become <a title="Moksha" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/wiki/Moksha"><span style="color: #0066cc;">liberated</span></a> themselves. In this understanding of the word the Bodhisattva is an already wise person who uses <a class="mw-redirect" title="Skillful means" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/wiki/Skillful_means"><span style="color: #0066cc;">skillful means</span></a> to lead others to see the benefits of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sila" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/wiki/Sila"><span style="color: #0066cc;">virtue</span></a> and the cultivation of wisdom.</p>

              <p>As far as I know, only humans can attain arhatship. Lower realms are full of sufferings, lower realms cannot practice dharma. Only human and deva realm can practice dharma, but devas have too much pleasurable distractions to really want to learn the dharma. However a minority of them may still practice the dharma, and attain stages like Sotapanna. I have never heard of an arhat deva, however. 4th jhana's pure abodes is different, because in the pure abodes only Anagamis live there, and they take rebirth in that realm before attaining arhatship in that realm.</p>
              <p>As for how do we know whether they are arhat, if you are a Buddha, of course you will know who are arhats, and the Buddha recognised thousands of his students as having achieved Arhatship. If you are a bodhisattva or an arhat yourself, you can also easily recognise who is an arhat. Why? Because they can recognise where the person is at by simply asking that person to describe his current state of insight and experience, and possibly ask a few more questions to confirm that he is truly
              speaking from authentic experience instead of theory and am not
              confused with regards to what he has said. But as for us, it is more difficult, but there is also a possibility of recognising where one or another person is. But in short, though as much as we wanted, there is no single way to judge a person's attainment by just looking at him or even observing his behaviors -- an enlightened person may on the surface and appearance be seemingly ordinary and look just like us.</p>
              <p>Hence the only truly reliable way is to check by the criteria of insight alone, of meditative experience and insight to guage where one is on the path. But it is a little bit complex and complicated if you are not familiar with the maps of awakening and may not be totally helpful. It is however good to be familiar with maps of the stages of meditative experiences/insights/awakening in the sense that one at least has an idea where he is on the path and how to proceed and not be lost or stuck in any place. All these guidance can however only come from the personal experiences of a true enlightened teacher. The ancient maps (the goods ones) do however give some important indications of the path. That said whatever it is, continue to practice hard and that is the essential key to progress.</p>
              <p>As Ven Gunaratana said,</p>
              <p><br>[...]<br><br>Meditation is a living activity, an inherently experiential activity. It <strong>cannot</strong> be taught as a purely scholastic subject. The living heart of the process <strong>must</strong> come from the teacher's own personal experience.<br><br>[...]<br><br>From:<br><strong>Mindfulness in Plain English</strong><br><em>—A Guide to Buddhist Meditation</em><br>by Venerable Henepola Gunaratana<br><a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding recognising the stages of awakening I have previously posted:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I said earlier, the criteria is that you have to be
                                              familiar with the Good maps of enlightenment. Of course, if you are
                                              enlightened yourself, you should be able to tell who is enlightened
                                              and who is not. Or if you are enlightened + familiar with the maps
                                              of enlightenment, that is even better. But if you are not, at least
                                              you must be familiar with what enlightenment is really about and
                                              the maps of enlightenment, then you can distinguish whether someone
                                              is enlightened and to what degree. As I said earlier because I am
                                              familiar with the maps I can sometimes tell whether one is
                                              enlightened or even to what degrees, though not all the time. Of
                                              course the greater benefit (of familiarity with the maps) is that
                                              one is able to tell where one is when we develope certain
                                              experiences.</p>
              <p>But not all maps of enlightenment are good. Some are inaccurate,
                                              some are dogmatic and some are entirely based on assumptions and
                                              also the action and emotional models, such as what behaviors he wld
                                              or wld not do. Enlightened people are definitely not restricted to particular actions -- they are free to do whatever they can do under various circumstances, but due to increased clarity and wisdom it is more unlikely that they will do anything seriously harmful to oneself and others.</p>
              <p>There are other models of enlightenment that says that certain
                                              emotions disappear after each stage of enlightenment, which is
                                              somewhat true (but is actually more like how enlightened people
                                              were able to see the true nature of their emotions that arise so as
                                              to better manage them, then the emotions not really arising) but
                                              then again, normal people may also lack certain emotions (such as
                                              anger) if they are generally calm people or have good anger
                                              management or are strong in shamatha and metta. And also there are
                                              enlightened people who are seemingly angry, whether they are really
                                              angry you don't know. Maybe they are simply showing the wrathful
                                              form of Avalokitesvara. So again, the emotional and action models
                                              fail at this point. They cannot really show you whether a person is
                                              enlightened or not. Unlike what people think, enlightened people do
                                              not *necessarily* need to appear calm and peaceful.</p>
              <p>The only way to really know is, like I said, by the criteria of
                                              their insights. Here comes the 'good maps of enlightenment' that
                                              strictly based on stages of realisation in terms of insights into
                                              ultimate reality, or stages of yogic insights. What are the good
                                              maps of enlightenment? Those that speaks of the 'non-dual' models
                                              -- models that talk about stages of increased perception/insights
                                              of non-duality, luminous-emptiness, etc. I have said previously,
                                              Dharma Dan's stages of the 4 paths is one of them. Others may
                                              include the 10 bhumis as presented in terms of nondual experience
                                              in Lankavatara Sutra, the Tibetan presentation of the 10 bhumis in
                                              terms of yogic experience, the 5 ranks of Tozan, Thusness's six
                                              stages of experience, (you can find some of them in my blog
                                              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/</a>) and many
                                              more that are used in different traditions that actually are very
                                              similar and related to each other. And in fact if you are a
                                              lineaged teacher in the various traditions, that means you are
                                              already enlightened. They don't let you be a real lineaged teacher
                                              until you are enlightened. That is why they often say, seek a
                                              teacher from proper lineages.</p>
              <p>An example of the Tibetan presentation of the 10 bhumis in terms
                                              of 4 stages of yogic experience (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.khandro.net/Buddhism_maha_stages.htm">http://www.khandro.net/Buddhism_maha_stages.htm</a>) and
                                              in this context of the Mahamudra system where the last 3 stages are
                                              stages of an Arya (enlightened being):</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style;">Per
                                              Gampopa</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style;">A lucid, unceasing
                                              awareness of the moment is the one-pointed stage of
                                              yoga.</span></p>
              <p>Understanding the essential state of the awareness as
                                              non-arising, transcending all conceptual modes, is the
                                              free-from-elaboration stage of yoga.</p>
              <p>Understanding the diverse appearances as being one from the
                                              standpoint of their intrinsic nature is the one flavor yoga.</p>
              <p>An unceasing realization of the union of appearance and their
                                              intrinsic emptiness is the great equipoise of the non-meditation
                                              yoga.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So anyway, knowing the various stages one will be able to tell
                                              if someone else is enlightened by his dharma expression. Usually
                                              his words and teachings wld reflect his experience, and if he is
                                              truly enlightened then his understand will be in line with Buddha's
                                              and with the nature of reality. What he say will one way or another
                                              be similar essentially to the truly enlightened sages. If he is
                                              still not that realised then his expression would be different
                                              based on his current insight.</p>
              <p>By the way, you may like to listen to this MP3 by Daniel Ingram
                                              (Dharma Dan), <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.trumix.com/podshows/2100538">http://www.trumix.com/podshows/2100538</a></p>
              <p>It is called 'Enlightened Teachers'.</p>
              <p><em><strong>In our latest podcast with Theravada teacher Daniel
                                              Ingram he breaches the taboo of enlightenment by discussing the
                                              enlightenment of other teachers. Not only that but he argues for a
                                              more transparent approach to enlightenment within certain teaching
                                              circles, in hopes that enlightenment can become more attainable.
                                              Listen and see why he thinks this will help.</strong></em></p>

              <p>Enlightenment is nothing philosophical, it is deeply experiential. You can know nuts about philosophy, practice sincerely under the guidance of the dharma, and similarly achieve enlightenment. You can also learn the entire world's philosophy, and yet not achieve any enlightenment. In my opinion and experience, spiritual experience, insight and practice is far more satisfying and enlightening than any amount of philosophical treatise and knowledge can bring.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment is definitely not beyond any of our capabilities. I know of many enlightened people today, some are even in this forum. Many people are seemingly ordinary people like us, not some high monks or venerable. There is no need to be unconvinced that all of us can likewise achieve the same. Seek an enlightened teacher, follow his/her guidance and practice hard so that you yourself can see.</p>
              <p>Always remember: our Buddha-Nature, like the bright sun is always already ever-present, inseparable from us, no matter where we are -- even while we are in hell or heaven, our Buddha Nature is always shining. It becomes temporarily obscured due to our ignorance and afflictions, we only need to wake up from these clouds of delusion, clear away these defilements and Mind's natural sun-like luminosity reveals itself as pure awareness. Since our Buddha-Nature is already innately perfect and only temporarily obscured, we should purify our minds of these ignorance and afflictions to reveal our original nature. In the end there is nothing attained, it has always been so, always present but missed.</p>

              awakened and then helps others awaken, with bright wisdom of awakening---this

              way is understanding.</span></p>

              <p>No, you misunderstood me. I am not annoyed at all, and there is no inherent problems with philosophy. Philosophy by its very right is a subject that some people may be interested in, some people may not. I myself am quite curious and interested to learn about the various philosophies and do read up on them. But I do not become engrossed or attached in the concepts, otherwise it will be detrimental.</p>
              <p>What I am saying here is that the entire field of philosophy and intellectual approach can never touch the essence of what Buddhism is trying to point at. We can never hope to gain any insight or experience into our very own Presence, our true nature, through the intellectual approach. This defeats the purpose of Buddhism completely, because the purpose of Buddhism is an experiential one -- to discover through insight into our reality, the nature of suffering and the way to the end of suffering. This cannot be approached through a philosophical but through an experiential manner, through awareness and investigation (not intellectual investigation though).</p>
              <p>Philosophy is important and has its place, but if you are going into something spiritual, you can never hope to touch anything spiritual through the intellect. Spiritual is always intuitive and experiential. It involves going beyond our symbolic layer to perceive reality BARE without our usual concepts and mental perceptions. It requires us to discover intuitively who we truly are, not merely through mental analysis.</p>
              <p>I hope you do not treat Buddhism as an academic or philosophical subject, because this completely defeats the purpose of Buddhism. Learning Buddhist Philosophy is completely fine and I am not against philosophy -- but not to become attached to such concepts and lose our intuitiveness, and to look into the practical aspects of Buddhism and develope insights and awakening from there.</p>
              <p>Knowledge cannot help to overcome your birth and death. When you are dying, all your knowledge have come to no use at all. Knowledge cannot help overcome sufferings. Buddha did not attain enlightenment through academic studies and knowledge, neither can anyone. Knowledge cannot help discover your Buddha Nature, or who you truly are. Only the light of awareness and insight can.</p>
              <p>Regarding å”¯è¯†å®—, it is philosophically rich, but one can also never hope to understand the essence of what it is saying without intuitive experiences of the nature of Non-Duality, which is what å”¯è¯† is trying to point to.</p>
              <p>One last thing -- one must never misunderstand that Buddhism is limited to sitting meditation, absolutely not. Buddhism must be implemented in our daily lives as well -- sitting meditation is only a small aspect of our life. Even if you sit half or one hour a day, the next 23 hours in your life you must also practice the dharma, otherwise how can you improve in your cultivation? Cultivation is also in the midst of living. A lot of people have the misunderstanding that cultivating Buddhism means chanting and meditation only. That is because they have never really understood true Buddhist practice and that it can be applied to any time any where...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, regarding "i
                                      don't want to do the practice because to me it seems a bit
                                      dangerous" -- there is absolutely 0 danger in dharma practices. In fact it is dangerous if you don't practice, practice can help avert many problems and disasters in life... and can liberate you from all sufferings and from the agonies of life and death. There is only danger in practice if you cultivate deviantly, practice the wrong methods or follow cults.</p>

                          not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for

                  <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                      Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                      travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                      in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                      temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                      cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                      teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                      In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                      about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                      I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                      Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                      activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                      cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                      mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                      Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                      afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                      of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                      household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                      leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                      could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                      are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                      neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                      these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                      activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                      cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                      neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                      temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                      she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                      acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                      turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                      cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                      the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                      decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                      the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                      place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                      ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                      only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                      very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                      every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                      what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                      into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                      how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                      other activities, but, Buddhism is best practised amid these activities. Should one be

                      all sorts of other problems not related to their work. In short, they may be occupied
                      physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and
                      practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not
                      so. A verse from the "Seven Buddhas" reads: "Avoid all evils; do all that
                      are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". </strong></span></p>

                      Cultivating our mind is better than cultivating our moral conduct. Maintaining
                      non-origination of the mind is better than cultivating it." Cultivation means
                      examining our conduct and eradicating conduct which are undesirable, for example, those
                      that inflict suffering on ourselves or on others. When our conduct is moral and ethical,
                      then our actions are naturally beneficial to ourselves and others. Thus, cultivating our
                      moral conduct is better than cultivating our actions. Unethical or immoral actions,
                      originate from an impure mind. Once these undesirable actions arecommitted, it is too late
                      for cultivation. Thus, it is better to cultivate the mind. To cultivate the mind after the
                      arising of impure thoughts is also too late. Thus, cultivating the mind is still not the
                      ultimate, it is better to spontaneously cease the arising of such thoughts all together.
                      Since there is no arising, then there is no cessation. The verse "Non-origination and
                      non-cessation" as described in the Heart Sutra is really a simple matter!</strong></span></p>

                          and the next it ceases. Now we need to know when these thoughts are arising and ceasing.
                          "To know" here means "awareness". Let me use my hand to illustrate so
                          that you may understand right away. I raise my hand now, and so my hand is "up".
                          When I put my hand down then it is "down". Our mind constantly behaves in the
                          same manner; one moment it gives birth to a thought ( hand is up), and the next moment the
                          thought is dead, it passes away (hand is down). This continuous process of birth and death
                          is called sentient beings. This process of birth and death brings forth boundless
                          sufferings. Sentient being is boundless and therefore suffering is also boundless. When we
                          learn and practise Buddhism it means we are striving to liberate the inner sentient being
                          in us from these sufferings.</strong></span></td>

                      the mind as such is the proper way to cultivate. </strong></span></p>

                      alive our hope of attaining the Supreme Enlightenment or Buddhahood. This is indeed so
                      simple! Yet, so simple that you may not know, you may not believe and you doubt if you can
                      actually do it. Whatever we are doing, be it walking, standing, sitting or sleeping, we
                      only need to cultivate in this manner and maintain an unmoving keenness of our awareness.
                      You may think that this is so simple and feel that you know all these very well. But,
                      human beings are indeed intelligent and it is not easy for others to fool them. Yet, in a

                      control, we follow up by keeping it still. We know that "our mind is not
                      moving", see that "our mind is not moving". The "know" and
                      "see" mentioned here refer to our awareness. It is in this way that we maintain

                      beings and we all have a mind. We are frequently ‘deceived’ by our minds. For an
                      entire lifetime we are ‘deceived’ and ‘misled’ by our minds without
                      ever realizing it! If the mind is good, then of course, it is all very well. Such a mind
                      creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                      deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                      animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                      therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                      "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of
                      enduring sufferings".</strong></span>

                      we all purify our minds, then the world becomes a heaven. Everybody is very happy and
                      there is no suffering. In learning and practising Buddhism, the most important thing is to
                      purify our minds. When we can purify our minds, then naturally there will be happiness in
                      our world.</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>To do that we have to observe the
                      non-arising of the mind. This is called ‘contemplation of the mind’. When the
                      mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                      been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                      way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Observing the mind is very simple.
                      It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                      or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                      ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                      not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                      the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                      on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                      slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                      At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                      mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                      food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                      wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                      practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                      will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that
                      are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". Besides
                      avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                      thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                      Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then
                      our home is pure; if the minds of everyone in this society is pure, then our society is
                      pure; if the minds of everyone in the country is pure, then our land is pure; if the
                      entire human race in the world is pure, then our world is as happy as the Western Pure
                      Land. </strong></span></p>

              <p>No, you misunderstood me. I am not annoyed at all, and there is no inherent problems with philosophy. Philosophy by its very right is a subject that some people may be interested in, some people may not. I myself am quite curious and interested to learn about the various philosophies and do read up on them. But I do not become engrossed or attached in the concepts, otherwise it will be detrimental.</p>
              <p>What I am saying here is that the entire field of philosophy and intellectual approach can never touch the essence of what Buddhism is trying to point at. We can never hope to gain any insight or experience into our very own Presence, our true nature, through the intellectual approach. This defeats the purpose of Buddhism completely, because the purpose of Buddhism is an experiential one -- to discover through insight into our reality, the nature of suffering and the way to the end of suffering. This cannot be approached through a philosophical but through an experiential manner, through awareness and investigation (not intellectual investigation though).</p>
              <p>Philosophy is important and has its place, but if you are going into something spiritual, you can never hope to touch anything spiritual through the intellect. Spiritual is always intuitive and experiential. It involves going beyond our symbolic layer to perceive reality BARE without our usual concepts and mental perceptions. It requires us to discover intuitively who we truly are, not merely through mental analysis.</p>
              <p>I hope you do not treat Buddhism as an academic or philosophical subject, because this completely defeats the purpose of Buddhism. Learning Buddhist Philosophy is completely fine and I am not against philosophy -- but not to become attached to such concepts and lose our intuitiveness, and to look into the practical aspects of Buddhism and develope insights and awakening from there.</p>
              <p>Knowledge cannot help to overcome your birth and death. When you are dying, all your knowledge have come to no use at all. Knowledge cannot help overcome sufferings. Buddha did not attain enlightenment through academic studies and knowledge, neither can anyone. Knowledge cannot help discover your Buddha Nature, or who you truly are. Only the light of awareness and insight can.</p>
              <p>Regarding å”¯è¯†å®—, it is philosophically rich, but one can also never hope to understand the essence of what it is saying without intuitive experiences of the nature of Non-Duality, which is what å”¯è¯† is trying to point to.</p>
              <p>One last thing -- one must never misunderstand that Buddhism is limited to sitting meditation, absolutely not. Buddhism must be implemented in our daily lives as well -- sitting meditation is only a small aspect of our life. Even if you sit half or one hour a day, the next 23 hours in your life you must also practice the dharma, otherwise how can you improve in your cultivation? Cultivation is also in the midst of living. A lot of people have the misunderstanding that cultivating Buddhism means chanting and meditation only. That is because they have never really understood true Buddhist practice and that it can be applied to any time any where...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, regarding "i don't want to do the practice because to me it seems a bit dangerous" -- there is absolutely 0 danger in dharma practices. In fact it is dangerous if you don't practice, practice can help avert many problems and disasters in life... and can liberate you from all sufferings and from the agonies of life and death. There is only danger in practice if you cultivate deviantly, practice the wrong methods or follow cults.</p>

              <p>One should read up on Buddhism, but academic and philosophy knowledge that are overly conceptualized cannot help much. So learn what is helpful and apply them. Suffering is often the turning point for many people. At least they now seek the end of suffering through practicing dharma.</p>
