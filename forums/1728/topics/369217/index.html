              <h3 style="margin: 0pt 0pt 5px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 85%;">by Bhikkhu K. Tanchangya, The Buddhist Channel, July 17,</span></h3>
              <p style="margin: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kandy, Sri Lanka</strong> --The latest attempt to proselytize the Buddhist world comes in the form of a book entitled ‘<em>Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Guide’</em> by Hattaway Paul. Anthropologically speaking, the book deserves credit
              for its excellent well-researched materials as it deals with 238
              distinct people-group profiles, photographs and maps of the Buddhist
              world – something that Buddhists are capable of producing, but are lazy
              to do so.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jbBQEIJ64D4/SmBKzbyzMnI/AAAAAAAAALk/ae7kBJArQIc/s1600-h/people-world.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5359365804065501810" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 268px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jbBQEIJ64D4/SmBKzbyzMnI/AAAAAAAAALk/ae7kBJArQIc/s320/people-world.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Make
              no mistake: this most conspicuous book is enterprisingly well done. But
              it has a hidden agenda: This book serves as a layout and roadmap of
              Christian evangelical interests and zeal. It is a precise blueprint, a
              battle plan drawn to craftily attack the peoples of the Buddhist world.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Educated and affluent Buddhists,
              however, should thank the author, an active evangelic leader for
              producing such an enlightening overview of the peoples of the Buddhist
              world because not many at all know about the majority of these 238
              groups mentioned by him.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed,
              many of these Buddhist communities are little-known and often
              forgotten. They are some of the most neglected peoples of the world.
              Much has been said on the evil intentions of the Christian evangelical
              missionaries for trying to ‘pray and touch the souls of ordinary
              people’ and bringing them into ‘the merciful rescue of God, the ruler
              of heaven’.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">My
              intention here is neither to write a review of the book condemning it
              as anti-Buddhist nor to parrot the accusations labeled against such
              greedy evangelical missionaries but to urge my fellow educated and
              affluent Buddhist brothers and sisters of the civilized world to
              understand that the wisest solution to such proselytization of the
              Buddhist world.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It does not lie on
              how logically and convincingly we criticize such undertakings and how
              many anti-conversion laws we need to enact. The intention is to
              undertake an honest, objective re-examination of our own Buddhist
              system within.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It
              is often proudly claimed by us Buddhists that Buddhism has survived for
              2550 years armed with its teachings of non-violence, tolerance, ability
              for different adaptation, and compassion. Perhaps we have forgotten the
              lost history of Buddhist lands of the entire Indian subcontinent.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">We
              have lost Afghanistan and Pakistan (East and West) to Muslim invaders,
              India and Nepal to Hindus and far eastern regions of the Middle East to
              hard-line Muslims. Having lost so much, how much more are we waiting to
              lose? This is a question that every progressive Buddhist needs an
              answer to.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Despite
              having survived the historic onslaught of Islamic invaders, these
              unknown Buddhist lands face the grim reality of losing their
              communities to the onslaught of Christian evangelism. 20th century
              South Korea is an example of how easy it is indeed for Buddhism to fall
              prey to aggressive evangelism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Historically
              speaking, the strength of Buddhist evolution centered on the members of
              its monastic - the Sangha. The Sangha institution became the backbone
              of the entire Buddhist community in any given social context, be it
              Theravada, Mahayana or Tibetan throughout its 2550 years of history.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The
              success of Buddhism is often measured by the strength of the Sangha.
              The traditional defenders of Buddhism have been and are still, the
              monks and nuns. As a natural consequence, Buddhist adherents tend to
              look up to the monastic Sangha for guidance. Unfortunately, this
              dependency has brought forth a devastating paralysis, especially at a
              time when the monastic priesthood is losing its pristine social and
              spiritual position as moral models and embodiments of love, compassion
              and wisdom.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For
              the last many decades the Buddhist monastic Sangha in every Buddhist
              country have not been faring well enough to retain its followers and
              attract new converts. Some monks have been busy filling up pockets
              while some others are poorly trained to cope with modern challenges.
              And yet some of these monks keep themselves busy by fighting for
              ecclesiastical ranking and power within the monastic system.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">All
              these unsavoury activities leave behind great gaps, neglecting the
              development of promising and creative social and religious leadership
              within Buddhist circles. Christian evangelicals have been quick to fill
              up this "Sangha-lay followers" vacuum.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It
              is believed that private properties owned by the monastic sangha may
              well surpass the private properties owned by the government of any
              given Buddhist country. Enormous public generosity have produced some
              of the richest monks and temples ever seen in Buddhist history, while
              millions of Buddhists unknown to many of us have been left out on their
              own, neglected and forgotten.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Even
              the very existence of the small but distinct minority Buddhist
              communities such as the Chaungtha people of Burma, the Khamiyang tribe
              from India, the Huay tribe of Thailand, the Kutangs of Nepal, the
              Gtsang of Tibet and the Brokkats of Bhutan - to name but a few - are
              hardly ever known to more educated and affluent Buddhists.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The
              Buddhist communities from this part of the globe somehow managed to
              survive with the harshest realities of existence by sticking to their
              Buddhist identities under oppressive and unfriendly governments. Is it
              their karma? How long more do we expect them to continue under the
              banner of Buddhism faced with everyday realities? Can't Buddhism change
              their karma? Can't the call of Buddha give them a hope, and a chance to
              live with less poverty?</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Any
              one claiming that even Buddha cannot alter the course of peoples’
              living standard, say unto him that this is "utter nonsense". In any
              case, if Buddha cannot promise to help these desperate people who have
              been yearning for change and a better life, then why shouldn’t they
              look up to a foreign God who promises them immediate prosperity, wealth
              and change here and eternal heaven hereafter? Indeed, the ‘new God, new
              country’ – a phrase often utilized by missionaries to pinpoint modern
              Korea under Christianity – has been an enticing and eye-catching
              example of change brought about by Christian evangelism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It is time for the progressive Buddhists to meditate on this.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes,
              these Buddhist communities are illiterate and poor. They are easy
              targets for evangelism. But they deserve education and material
              prosperity before they could think of religion. And evangelical
              missionaries are providing just that.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why
              can't the richest monks, richest temples and richest Buddhist
              organizations of the affluent world mobilize work teams to visit and
              look into the grievances of these forgotten fellow Buddhists? Why are
              we just shouting at others who are helping them when we chose not to
              act ourselves?</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The
              Buddhist teachings of karma, rebirth, suffering, selflessness, and
              contentment have all been part and partial of a deeper level of
              misunderstanding of Buddhism even among the most educated and affluent
              civilized Buddhists, and their misunderstanding has been a boon for the
              greedy missionaries to take advantage of these Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe
              somebody is born poor because of his karma. And someone else out there
              is suffering and dying without proper hospice care. So what? He's got
              lots more rebirths coming up next. Somebody is poor but wants to have a
              better life. So instead of providing skills and opportunities, they are
              asked to "practice contentment". This is the unfortunate mentality of
              Buddhists towards those who are at the bottom rung of society.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">No
              matter how openly they deny, sadly this has been proved to be the case
              over and over again. Highly spiritual monks and committed practicing
              lay Buddhists tend to overlook the necessity of material development.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">But
              what these people forget to realize is that there cannot be
              spirituality where there is widespread hunger and poverty; and healthy
              spirituality cannot exist where there is widespread illiteracy,
              ignorance and superstitions. It is only in the very recent time that
              the affluent Buddhist world has felt the need to counter evangelism by
              establishing parallel institutions like schools, colleges, hospitals,
              aged homes and carry out relief works but the fact that this is largely
              to meet the needs of the local community, this is yet to affect the
              millions of forgotten Buddhists in unknown parts of the world.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">And
              this raises the extreme Buddhist need to establish cohesive,
              well-financed, dedicated and inspired international Buddhist
              organizations to safeguard the very existence of the peoples of the
              Buddhist world through active participation on field.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">But
              it is easier said than done. Believe it or not, Buddhists tend to be
              very proud and suspicious of fellow Buddhists. The powerful
              ecclesiastical monastic sangha of Thailand would not allow temples from
              other Buddhist countries to be built on its soil, while the building of
              aTheravada temple in the Korean soil is most likely to be seen as an
              attempt to Theravadize the Mahayanist Koreans. Such is the suspicion
              and pride among Buddhists of different countries.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Some
              other Buddhists yet take pride in promoting so-called inter-religious
              dialogues between Buddhists and Christians, between Buddhists and
              Muslims but the irony is that Buddhists of Theravada, Mahayana and
              Tibetan seldom get along together.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly
              there is hardly any effective contactsbetween and among these three
              major Buddhist dominations. Economically weak Theravada Buddhist
              temples and monks of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia have
              been struggling to cater the needs of their respective native followers
              living in the West. Meanwhile the economically stronger Mahayana
              Buddhist temples and monks of China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan have been
              struggling to expand their influences throughout the rich West. And
              despite having poured millions of dollars for building temples and
              universities there, yet Tibetan monks have been struggling to get fame
              and popularity to draw the attention of the world to their Tibetan
              issue.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">All
              these trends have effectively left millions of native Buddhists
              forgotten and neglected. In their unknown lands, it is they who are in
              dire need of financial investments, education, creative leadership and
              social betterment more than the West.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It
              cannot be denied that the West needs promising monks and Buddhist
              leaders more than anyone else. The Western public is intelligent and
              affluent but it is we, the Asians, who have taught them the Dharma. But
              while we try to meet their spiritual needs with our limited spiritual
              Asian resources, we must also never never forget Buddhists from these
              unknown lands</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">They
              have been, and are our fellow Buddhists for centuries. We share
              identical Buddhist culture and history but are not getting what they
              deserve from their more fortunate and affluent fellow Buddhists.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">So
              this being the case, how ethical correct are we to oppose anyone who
              goes to standby, help and live with these unwanted peoples of the
              Buddhist world? What Buddhist doctrine can we possibly use to justify
              and declare that such an action is immoral?</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Even
              the most fanatic Buddhists among us would have to accept the fact that
              no matter with what ulterior motives the Evangelicals choose to help
              such forgotten and neglected peoples, the intrinsic goodness of their
              action is something that cannot be denied or downplayed.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">And this only questions our inability and unwillingness to help our own fellow Buddhists.<br>Indeed,
              evangelical groups are proving to be very successful with their slogan
              - ‘believe in Jesus, he will be always with you’. Many things would
              change if we Buddhists could learn to say ‘we are your friends in your
              need’ and prove our say with our active social engagement. The kind of
              Humanistic Buddhism promoted by some creative and progressive Buddhists
              or Engaged Buddhism as promoted by some is not inclusive enough because
              it has effectively failed to address and respond to the acute needs of
              these forgotten Buddhist communities who are now the targets of
              Christian evangelism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed,
              the greatest challenge of sectarian Buddhist traditions and
              organizations is the unwillingness and hesitation to help those who are
              not following the form of Buddhism each of them follows.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There
              seems to be the demand of internal evangelization within and among
              various sectarian Buddhists before they could be considered fit for
              help. The most affluent Mahayana Buddhists of Korea and Taiwan, for
              example, might not be willing to go and help those neglected Buddhist
              ethnic groups scattered throughout the border areas of Thailand, Burma,
              Bangladesh and India who are followers of Theravada Buddhism, while the
              able Theravada Buddhists of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Burma might not be
              willing to come out for the ethnic minorities of the Himalayan regions
              who are mostly followers of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This
              is certainly not the kind of mentality the Buddha would very much like
              his followers to have towards fellow Buddhists. The result is that this
              has effectively barred the interaction between and among the various
              sectarian groups of Buddhism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s
              not deny the historical fact that Buddha was the first and a successful
              leader of missionary activities hundreds of years before Christ got the
              smell of this earth. Let’s not pretend that we Buddhists do not convert
              followers. We do but the difference in us is that we love to target the
              most educated, the most affluent, and the most intelligent pundits of
              the world rather than taking advantage of peoples’ poverty and
              illiteracy.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">We
              take peoples’ intelligence and wisdom to our advantage which is the
              uniqueness of Buddhist evangelism. Perhaps this very prospect is
              leading us to the other disadvantage: losing our fellow poor, neglected
              and illiterate Buddhists. And this only calls for the implementation of
              the much acclaimed Buddhist ‘Middle Way’.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The
              well established large monastic sanghas and lay Buddhist organizations
              of the known Buddhist world are effectively failing to perform their
              duties well enough due to unscrupulous remnants of corruption,
              misbehaviors, mismanagement and inefficiency within.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Some
              of these monastic sanghas need internal reformation to cope with modern
              challenges. The high rate of disrobing among the intelligent, educated,
              energetic and promising young clergy is indeed a headache for many of
              us. Yet despite all these weaknesses and shortcomings there are lots
              more that can be done, if we are only willing and are truly selfless –
              ‘for the welfare and happiness of many’, the slogan used by the Buddha
              himself to denote his kind of evangelism.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">So
              how and when will these 238 or so people-groups of the Buddhist world
              fall as victims of Christian evangelism? Is there something that we -
              as informed Buddhists - can do, or should we just fold our arms and
              rant in our chests about these "evil evangelists"?</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It
              is time for Buddhists to get our act together, look out for one another
              and redeem ourselves by rallying to Buddha's call to "go forth... for
              the good of many, for the benefit and well being of many." Failing
              which, predatory Christian groups will only be too happy to forage by
              the wayside, preying on our inaction.</p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">And if we were to let this happen, then the only ones to blame will be us - the indifferent, indolent, complacent Buddhists.</p>

              <p>last time i also recalled attending a masses in the past, where the speaker, forgot his name, quite famous, speak quite good about Buddha/Buddhism but in the end said something like Buddhism no matter how fantastic it may be, it is still base on Human äººæœ¬, but Bible is base on God send ç¥žæœ¬ , with the impression that "God" is still more above than huMan.</p>
              <p>he also sarcastically said Buddha as a prince leave his family, as if Buddha do not care. u can sort of imagine, what people may think.</p>

              <p>From my posts, you should know that my knowledge of buddhism is both pragmatic and practical, not airy-fairy theories. Try chanting something in a language you don't know and you having no knowledge of what you chant, that is how you know whether a teaching is true or false and whether it is a ritual. Try reciting this mantra for peace and goodwill throughout the world:Gan Nee Nah Beh Chao Chee Bye</p>
              <p>You have closed your mind to the truth and hide behind a false teaching from a bygone era. Asking a person to go approach people who will brainwash the person is the dumbest way of enlightening someone, give the person the theory and let them experiment is a better idea.</p>

              <p>buddhism does indeed encourage self-inquiry and analysis that "give the person the theory and let them
                                      experiment" for people who are  scholarly, practical, logical-minded, smarty-pants know-it-all types, that prefers not to take the teachings word-for-word and would like to think for themselves the meaning behind the words. so there are scholarly teachings like the various schools of thoughts, Madhyamaka analysis, philosophies.. etc. well and good.</p>
              <p>but buddhism also caters for people from the other spectrum.  just-tell-me-what-to-do-type of people who don't prefer overly complex teachings where they can just follow the instructions and do prayers, chanting..etc.  *drum roll* just chant xxx-hundred-thousand mantras and you will be the lucky winner to get enlightened.. yay!  in fact, they can't get enough of  "mysticism and rituals", the more the merrier, the more motivation and faith.  well and good too.</p>
              <p>buddha gave so many teachings as skillful means simply for the benefits of people of different capacities. most suitable teachings to the most suitable receipient leads to the most auspicious outcome.  its all about getting the right fit.</p>
              <p>a round peg plugs a round hole and a square peg plugs a square hole. a round peg cannot plug a square hole and a square peg cannot plug a round hole. so a square peg will see a square hole as the only "truth". the square peg will declare a round hole to be "a false
                                      teaching from a bygone era" simply because it cannot fit in. the square peg will also turns around and tells the round peg that "You have closed your mind to the truth".  this is all true from the square peg's perspective.  and interestingly, the round peg will probably think the same way about the square peg too.  ego can  only appreciate its own truth.  relative truth is always so subjective and paradoxical isn't it?</p>
              <p>perhaps one day when all humanity in the world has become exact clones of each other both physically and mentally (i wouldn't want to be there), then we can all finally agree that we only need one version of the "truth" and pat each other happily on the back on a job well done.  but until that day, let's just enjoy the diversity of samsara while you're at it my friends :-)</p>

              <p>No, we do not think during meditation. We observe, we feel, sense, be aware, bring bare attention to this moment of our sensate reality. We observe its true nature, not by concepts but by naked awareness of what is. Practicing this way, insight manifests.</p>

              <p>So what if not everyone is enlightened? The point is people do get enlightened in Buddhism.

However any word will do, and there are indeed Buddhist teachers that teach even if you chant Coca Cola wholeheartedly you can enter samadhi.</p>
              <p>Anyway, chanting alone can result in samadhi, but if one is not aware, one does not practice being naked in awareness then insights still cannot arise.</p>
