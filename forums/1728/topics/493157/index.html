              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">A Himalayan
              high: Tibetan Buddhism is alive and well in Ladakh, and it's easier than
              ever to try a spiritual pilgrimage</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Jeremy Clarke For Daily
              Mail 19 December 2016</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bring on the Buddhist monks, nuns, lamas, prophets and
              oracles, I thought (spiritually) on my way to Ladakh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But arriving at Leh, capital of the Himalayan desert kingdom,
              after a helter-skelter approach and violent landing, and looking around at the
              surreal grandeur of the mountains, I was appalled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Never before had I seen such an arid and inhospitable
              landscape. With the thin air at 3,200 metres, walking from the plane to the bus
              rendered me puffed out. I also felt slightly, though pleasantly, lightheaded.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Situated at the politically sensitive apex of India between
              Pakistan, communist Chinese-run Tibet, and Kashmir, Ladakh is a country of
              lavender and rose-pink-hued mountains; and, when one comes across them,
              surprisingly verdant oases along the rivers, foremost of which is the mighty
              Indus.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since China put the colonial half-nelson on Tibet, Ladakh is
              the last stronghold of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Racially and culturally Tibetan, it is a country of Mongolian
              faces; bleached and tattered prayer flags; long, low mani walls to keep the
              evil spirits away; thousands of white-washed reliquary tombs; oracles, healers
              and astrologers; colossal monasteries perched high up on the mountain crags;
              yaks and marigolds; and scarlet and orange-robed monks calling the shots over a
              peasantry of startling innocence. And all of that under the bluest of blue
              skies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ladakh was closed to the outside world between 1948 and 1974.
              For the next 40 years the trickle of foreigners was largely confined to
              hippies, anthropologists, Himalayan trekkers and pilgrims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The slow pace of change has been accelerated by the 2009
              Bollywood smash-hit The Three Idiots, filmed in Ladakh, and which signalled an
              influx of curious tourists from the Indian sub-continent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">More recently, mobile phones and satellite TV have broadened
              the horizons of the Ladakhi youth, who are beginning to look to the outside
              world for education and employment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The only road into the kingdom has also been improved, though
              it is still impassable between November and May, when the inhabitants gather
              around their dung-fuelled household fires to weave yak hair woollies and sing
              songs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In winter, it is said, a person sitting outside with his face
              in the sun and his feet in shadow will suffer heatstroke and frostbite
              simultaneously.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My week’s stay was divided between three of Shakti’s village
              homes. The company rents the upper stories of these houses from Ladakhis and
              has furnished them to a high standard. I would describe the accommodation as
              Ladakhi peasant vernacular with chrome mixer taps. At each house, I had my own
              chef and waiter-cum-servant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The three houses I stayed in belonged respectively to a
              healer with a hard stare; a carpenter with a shrill, thousand-year-old mother;
              and an antediluvian farming couple with a fairy-tale beautiful daughter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first, called the Medicine House, was spectacularly
              placed beside the confluence of the Zanskar and Indus rivers. Here, I
              acclimatised for a day. I needed it. Even cleaning my teeth made me gasp for
              air. At night, the candle flames were attenuated in the thin air.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On the second day, feeling more aspirated, I began to get out
              more with the help of the excellent local guide and a driver. I’d wanted to see
              monks, and monks was what I got.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I seemed to spend all day, every day, at monasteries, taking
              my shoes off and on, panting and mingling with monks: monks with Ronnie Kray
              spectacles and hearing aids; monks wearing Crocs; barefoot monks; tiny tot
              monks; matinee idol monks; irreverent monks; melancholy monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I talked to monks who were more worldly and well-travelled
              than I will ever be. I sat cross-legged for hours among chanting monks and in a
              hypnotised state slurped rancid butter tea by way of a break. I dreamed of
              monks at night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I went to an old monk doctor about my stiff neck. He took my
              pulse then spooned some dried herb balls from a sweet jar into a little paper
              sack. Take three twice a day with warm water, he said. My neck was better after
              two doses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The next day I visited an oracle at her home. It was arranged
              that she would go into a trance for me and take questions about the future. She
              ran outside and stuck her head in a pail of water and returned possessed by a
              turbulent demon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It made her shriek, gave her hiccups followed by a sneezing
              fit and then threw her to the ground. The demon was called Nyntangla, said the
              interpreter. Did I want to ask Nyntangla a question? No thanks. Afterwards,
              when Nyntangla had vacated possession, the oracle was serene, back in her right
              mind but tired.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ladakh. Amazing place. Back home, I feel like the oracle
              woman post-spirit possession: returned to my right mind, serene, tired; with
              the incense-fragranced memories of extraordinary things seen and done in that
              high thin air.</span></p>
