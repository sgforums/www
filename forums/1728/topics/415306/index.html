              <p>I think just about everyone of you here has asked this question?  How to choose a school of Buddhism?  How to decide on a particular practice?</p>
              <p>The flavours of the Dharma are so varied.  Sometimes, what one school of Buddhism discusses can seem so different from what another espouses.  All are grounded in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, and yet their bent can appear so different.</p>
              <p>Some encourage relying on an Other Power with Faith, besides the Self Effort of chanting/recitation, and yet others seem to require you to be almost totally on your own to attain realizations of the nature of reality.  Some sutras promise worldly successes, and yet others tell you characteristics exist only while there is still Ego-identification. </p>
              <p>I read somewhere on some Chinese website that one should not discriminate among dharmas because all are equally sacred and all lead to liberation.  To discriminate and say that one practice is more "powerful" than another, or that one teaching is of a lower level than another is a form of blasphemy. True/False?</p>
              <p>So my question remains.  How to pick one for myself?</p>

              <p>the different method/school are like different medicine for different kind of illness. hence the medicine in itself do not have high or low. there's no best or bad medicine. which ever cure the person's illness, is the best medicine for that person.</p>
              <p>the key i think is to focus on one method.</p>
              <p>what's your perference or liking? which one do u think u can practice according to ur ability? factor in ur work, famly and time. like when u choose a career. after u has pick one, then concentrate on that method all the way for a certain period of time. don't confuse with other school's teaching within that period. u can only see other's teaching when ur faith and stillness is stable after practice on one particular school. when u are stable already, u shall reach realisation, and then seeing other's teaching will not rock ur faith and realisation. and that realisation will see that all method are actually pointing at the same realisation. without realisation, all method are different.</p>
              <p>FYI,</p>
              <div id="post-body-10030385" class="body">
              <p>Shakyamuni &amp; Ananda, in their past, both started to learn BuddhaDharma at the same time. They both generated Bodhicitta at the same time. however, Shakyamuni became Buddhahood first. the main reason is because, Shakyamuni study one method and practice all the way, while Ananda, like to learn some of this and learn some of that. hence the delay. they set an example in telling us to be more focus in one. like digging a hole for water. keep digging on one and u shall find the water, insteading of digging many holes and delay the process.</p>

              <p>In response to <em>Sinweiy's</em> post above.  Thanks for your thoughtful reply. </p>
              <p>I like your analogy about methods being like medicine for different illnesses.</p>
              <p>I too realised that I must focus on one method, which is why I asked about how to settle on one. I know I don't want to do insight meditation for the time being and have been "experimenting" for about 3 months with different mantras and reading various sutras.  </p>
              <p>Actually, before posing this question on the forum, I'd read Ch'an Master Sheng Yen's advice about choosing a school of Buddhism.  He did say that if one is an elderly person, then he would recommend Buddha recitation.  But if one is a younger person, it's OK to try different methods.  Also, if one has strong resolve and confidence, one may choose to follow the Bodhisattava path wherein results may be attained more quickly.  Otherwise, Pureland practice - although slower and more winding - would be preferable.  One can still come back to save sentient beings after sufficient practise in the pureland.  And in fact, Pureland practice is not limited only to the Amitabha Buddha's practice.  Others that can be considered are the practices of the Medicine Buddha, Akshobya or Maitreya. </p>
              <p>The key is in finding resonance with the vows and main vocations of the Buddha you choose to venerate.  I think hearing you confirm my thoughts about needing to consider 
              lifestyle factors, and the medicine analogy, I'm much closer to making a
               decision.  Thanks!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>At the end of the day, you would enter the category of elderly folk. According to old adage, God of Hell did not sign contract with living beings to confirm their status of longevity in the Saha world :D in fact all methods is called Buddha (enlightened) recitation and Buddha (enlightened) remembrance to assist living beings to come into focus mind. All methods of teachings is non other than from living beings own Buddha nature. Buddha Sakyamuni mere relating the pure nature of all sentience, and is not an invention from him. Therefore, discrimination on Buddha dharma is the blasphemy of your own dharma nature as any methods will lead you to liberation from samsara. However, in all buddha doors, there is this special door called Pureland Buddhism based on Buddha power, like child need their mother's love for nurturing before they can be living on their own. My suggestion is to try the Theravada and Pureland simultaneously. Well! You may wish to choose Esoteric or Zen and Pureland simultaneously. Althernatively, you can choose studying/learing/acquiring the meaning of sutra from venerable master and pureland simultaneously. Or any one method. Probably, you can choose Theravada, studying of sutra from venerable master and pureland / esoteric / zen method (any) simultanously but have faith in pureland.</p></div>

              <p>Amituofo,</p>
              <p>ya, i too think that it's ok for youngsters to "try" out different method in the beginning to get a feel of the practice first. at this age they are still experimenting. if not they would not be satisfy. however, after the experimenting one do need to settle on one, if not too many can be confusing. it's Buddha's teaching of one pointedness.</p>
              <p>i believe all method(84000) follow one rule, that is discipine, concentration and wisdom. discipine on one help the mind settle down, and settling down help the mind clearer and see through our inner nature and open up our wisdom. <br>our mind is like a muddy water, and it's difficult to see the bottom of the water when the water is milky. but when the water is still the water become clear and hence u can see the bottom.</p>
              <p>hope u make a good choice. i listen to Buddha for the choice. He left a secret message in Amitabha Sutra's list of Buddhas. in the Dharma Ending Age, Pureland is better suited for the illness of sentient being of this polluted world. Vajrayana also can. Both are of the Purity Category. There are three Categories - Awakening Category, Rightly-hood Category and Purity Category.</p>
              <p>Pureland leave the pollutants to get Purity. while Vajrayana are more difficult in the sense they can enter pollutants and yet they can be of no pollutions to get the Purity.</p>
              <p>Ch'an is of the (sudden) Awakening Category. Pecept or Learning School are of Rightly-hood Category.</p>
              <p>to me Amitabha's pureland is consider the easiest to get compare to other pureland. Maitreya still need some meditation practice of mind-only school. pureland can also be quite fast if one really have faith, aspiration and letting go. imagine people getting to pureland around 3 years of non stop recitation. recently a guy from china after hearing the examples, decided wholeheartedly and recited for 2 years and 10 months, and knew the time of rebirth. </p>

              <p>Hi Realization</p>
              <p>It is good that you are desiring to embark on this buddhist journey. I believe you have been reading and there are so many various sect with various teaching methodology. At the end of the day, it will still be back to the basic; Understand the 4 noble truth and practice the 8 fold path from this æˆ’ precept. The  å®šsteadfastness which is tranquality in one thought process and allow æ…§wisdom to arise.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: MS Song;">No one can advise you which practice is suitable for you. As it depend on your language,practice method, people and environment . A english educated person may struggle with the Mahanyana Chinese recitation with the bell and gongs but may find comfort in Pali chanting and breathing meditation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: MS Song;">Next, individual's affinity will also influence your choice of practice at different phrase of your life. Some people switch from Vajra to Pureland practice and vice versus. However, since you are young take your time to choose the practice visit the various temple to explore and ask question. That's what, I did<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> .</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: MS Song;">I begin with Theravada basic buddhism course in Kong Meng San. After which I pick up Pureland sutra recitation and simpleTara mantra practice. Finally, I end with Nichiren Shu practice and I have stay put with Lotus Sutra since 2007. What I have learnt is every practice is a building stone. The basic will always be the same

              <div id="sub-banner-body">
              <p>The important thing is one can find courage, strength, wisdom and inspiration in whatever one practice in order to face the daily challenges in our life.</p>

              <p>i think that person's faith not deep enough, the Name already encompass everything. no need to add mantra. the key is just Sincerity. kind of find it surprising to say recitation Amitabha cannot resolve karma.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I also read one Chinese article (sorry lost the link) which says that reciting 'Amituofo' needs to be accompanied by mantra recitation (å¿µå’’).  It stated that the purpose of mantra recitation is to purify karma, so that reciting the Buddha's name can be effective.  Otherwise, if karma is not cleared, reciting the Buddha's name still cannot take one to the Western Paradise.  How true is this?</span></p>

              <p>When reading Amitabha's 
              48 vows, it occurred to me that slandering the Dharma could easily have 
              happened without me knowing.  And also, how would I know if I'd 
              committed the five heinous crimes in previous incarnations, right?  I 
              was thinking, "Yeah, so how can that be resolved?"</p>

              <p>the Contemplation Sutra/Amitayurdhyana Sutra stated that those who attain birth on the highest level of the lowest grade are the sentient beings who commit various evil acts but do not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slander</span> the Mahayana sutras of greater scope. then after that there is no mentioning of slandering in the middle level of the lowest grade and the lowest level of the lowest grade. the lowest level of the lowest grade are sentient beings who commit such evils as the five gravest offenses, the ten evil acts and all kinds of immorality.</p>
              <p>if one learn Pureland deep enough, it's incorrect to say that those who slander the dharma cannot be reborn in pureland. prince Ajatashatru who almost <em>commited the five gravest offenses, the ten evil acts and all kinds of immorality</em> was one example of attaining <strong>the middle level of the highest grade(!)</strong> with sincere remorse, faith and practice.</p>
              <p>Pureland 13th Patriarch Yin Kuang was another example. He used to slander pureland when young. but He set an example that it can be purified with sincere remorse, faith and practice.</p>
              <p>but why the vow say that it excluded those who abused the right Dharma is because of a very simple reason. the reason is we needed faith/believe to reborn in pureland. the right Dharma is pureland method. so if one abuse pureland, this mean they do not have faith in it. so without faith how to reborn there? very simple reason, they don't believe. if they turn around and believe, all is resolve. see Contemplation Sutra/Amitayurdhyana Sutra.</p>

              <p>“The word nien-fo [Buddha Recitation] is originally a Chinese translation of the Sanskrit compound Buddhanusmrti, meaning ‘the recollection or the bearing in mind (anusmrti) of the attributes of a Buddha.’ The practice of Buddhanusmrti itself has a long his tory in India, extending back to well before the rise of Mahayana Buddhism…<br><br>“An early form of Buddhanusmrti (Buddha Remembrance or Buddha Recitation) can be found in the Nikayas of the Pali Canon: ‘In the Nikayas, the Buddha … advised his disciples to think of him and his virtues as if they saw his body before his eyes, whereby they would be enabled to accumulate merit and attain Nirvana or be saved from transmigrating in the evil paths.’ ” D. T. Suzuki, The Eastern Buddhist / Vol. 3, No. 4: 317 #2146 <br><br>When the term and its practical lore were introduced to China, they came as a highly developed meditative system, with ties to a diversity of Buddhist scriptures and deities. Amitabha and the Pure Land sutras represented but one among many such systems. The major Indian sources and early Chinese treatises on Buddhanusmrti treat it as a complex practice involving several different approaches to contemplation. <br><br>At its most basic level, Buddha-mindfulness begins with visual recollection of the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor excellencies of the Buddha’s glorified ‘body of form’ (Skt/rupa-kaya). Progressing to successively deeper levels of practice, one may dispense with recollection of the Buddha’s physical form and instead contemplate his boundless spiritual powers and omniscience until one ultimately arrives at the Buddha’s formless essence of enlightenment itself – a practice known as mindful recollection of the Buddha’s ‘body of truth or reality’ (Skt/Dharma-kaya). Thus, although Buddhanusmrti may take a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva (such as Amitabha) as its starting point, it ultimately grounds itself in universal Mahayana truths.</p>
              <p>This feature plants Buddhanusmrti firmly within the mainstream of Mahayana Buddhist practice, connecting it with the meditations on emptiness that we more often associate with the Perfection of Wisdom and other less devotional traditions of Buddhist scriptures.”Lopez / 95: 360-361</p>

              <p>In response to <em>Sinweiy's</em> post above.  Thanks for
                  your thoughtful reply. </p>
              <p>I like your analogy about methods being like medicine for
                  different illnesses.</p>
              <p>I too realised that I must focus on one method, which is why I
                  asked about how to settle on one. I know I don't want to do insight
                  meditation for the time being and have been "experimenting" for
                  about 3 months with different mantras and reading various
                  sutras.  </p>
              <p>Actually, before posing this question on the forum, I'd read
                  Ch'an Master Sheng Yen's advice about choosing a school of
                  Buddhism.  He did say that if one is an elderly person, then
                  he would recommend Buddha recitation.  But if one is a younger
                  person, it's OK to try different methods.  Also, if one has
                  strong resolve and confidence, one may choose to follow the
                  Bodhisattava path wherein results may be attained more
                  quickly.  Otherwise, Pureland practice - although slower and
                  more winding - would be preferable.  One can still come back
                  to save sentient beings after sufficient practise in the
                  pureland.  And in fact, Pureland practice is not limited only
                  to the Amitabha Buddha's practice.  Others that can be
                  considered are the practices of the Medicine Buddha, Akshobya or
                  Maitreya. </p>
              <p>The key is in finding resonance with the vows and main vocations
                  of the Buddha you choose to venerate.  I think hearing you
                  confirm my thoughts about needing to consider lifestyle factors,
                  and the medicine analogy, I'm much closer to making a
                  decision.  Thanks!</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree with Master Sheng Yen's advice.</p>
              <p>If it is an old ah mah... I will just suggest her to chant and aim for pure land.</p>
              <p>For others... I say, go for what resonates! Whatever resonates will naturally draw you towards that path.</p>

              <p>“The word nien-fo [Buddha Recitation] is originally a Chinese
              translation of the Sanskrit compound Buddhanusmrti, meaning ‘the
              recollection or the bearing in mind (anusmrti) of the attributes of
              a Buddha.’ The practice of Buddhanusmrti itself has a long his tory
              in India, extending back to well before the rise of Mahayana
              Buddhism…<br> <br> “An early form of Buddhanusmrti (Buddha Remembrance or Buddha
              Recitation) can be found in the Nikayas of the Pali Canon: ‘In the
              Nikayas, the Buddha … advised his disciples to think of him and his
              virtues as if they saw his body before his eyes, whereby they would
              be enabled to accumulate merit and attain Nirvana or be saved from
              transmigrating in the evil paths.’ ” D. T. Suzuki, The Eastern
              Buddhist / Vol. 3, No. 4: 317 #2146<br> <br> When the term and its practical lore were introduced to China, they
              came as a highly developed meditative system, with ties to a
              diversity of Buddhist scriptures and deities. Amitabha and the Pure
              Land sutras represented but one among many such systems. The major
              Indian sources and early Chinese treatises on Buddhanusmrti treat
              it as a complex practice involving several different approaches to
              contemplation.<br> <br> At its most basic level, Buddha-mindfulness begins with visual
              recollection of the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor
              excellencies of the Buddha’s glorified ‘body of form’
              (Skt/rupa-kaya). Progressing to successively deeper levels of
              practice, one may dispense with recollection of the Buddha’s
              physical form and instead contemplate his boundless spiritual
              powers and omniscience until one ultimately arrives at the Buddha’s
              formless essence of enlightenment itself – a practice known as
              mindful recollection of the Buddha’s ‘body of truth or reality’
              (Skt/Dharma-kaya). Thus, although Buddhanusmrti may take a
              particular Buddha or Bodhisattva (such as Amitabha) as its starting
              point, it ultimately grounds itself in universal Mahayana
              truths.</p>
              <p>This feature plants Buddhanusmrti firmly within the mainstream
              of Mahayana Buddhist practice, connecting it with the meditations
              on emptiness that we more often associate with the Perfection of
              Wisdom and other less devotional traditions of Buddhist
              scriptures.”Lopez / 95: 360-361</p>

              <p>The excerpts you provided regarding Buddhanusmrti were very useful for me. I actually found another resource on the Internet that further clarified the concept.</p>

              <p>Together with being mindful about what Ch'an Master Sheng Yen said about needing to align oneself with the vows and attributes of the particular buddha you choose to contemplate on, it has helped me figure out which practice to take up.</p>
              <p>Just a beginning step, but knowing which direction to head in is quite a relief.</p>

              <p>Nice, indeed, even Hui Neng approves of the complexity of Buddhanusmrti(nien fo).</p>
              <p>so said å‡€åœŸå¿µä½›æ³•é—¨·ä¸‰æ ¹æ™®è¢«·åˆ©é’�å…¨æ”¶  it doesn't matter if u are a sharp person or a dull person, it'll work without discrimination. young also can do, old also can do. even for those working and not have many time, best to do. it's Buddha's compassion and knowing. that say only an 8th ground stage pusa and above can truely understand such complexity.</p>
              <p>when Hui Neng came forward to seek dharma from 5th patriarch Ch'an master, Ch'an master ask Hui Neng what are you here for. Hui Neng replied, " I come here to be a Buddha!" Wow, His mind is already Buddha. The mind is Buddha, the mind shall become Buddha. æ˜¯å¿ƒæ˜¯ä½›, æ˜¯å¿ƒå�šä½›.</p>

              <p>Agreed.  That's why I said, "Just a beginning step..."</p>
              <p>However, I also know I cannot indefinitely be changing my practice æ³•é—¨ once a fortnight, or once a month.  I previously experimented only because I was so new and everything looked fresh and inviting. *lol* </p>
              <p>The Dharma legacy that the Buddha left behind for us is so vast that I couldn't possibly try everything.  I would end up getting nowhere!!</p>

              <p><br>Hi Dawnfirstlight and Realisation,</p>
              <p>If i'm not wrong, and i may be wrong here, the article referred to is referring to the short Vajrasattva mantra.</p>
              <p>It is said that one may have created the karmas of slandering the dharma unknowingly as it is a very easy karma to create or the five uninterrupted karmas from past (lives) etc which will stop you from taking rebirth in pureland. So it is impt to recite the short vajrasattva mantra 400,000 with the four powers to purify this negative karma.</p>
              <p>His Holiness Jigme Phuntsok revealed a practice that one can use to recite this 400,000 mantras. </p>

              <p>If you want the whole practice and so forth, pm me. If you feel you just want to recite this mantra, then it is ok, but best to get a transmission from a Vajrayana teacher to obtain the lineage blessings.</p>
