            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Note: this article is not intended to suggest that the Mahabrahma is linked to whatsoever in other religions.</strong><br><br>In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of All".<br><br>In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha did not suscribed to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has took refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborned. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were to be reborned.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: " I am BrahmÃ , the Great BrahmÃ , the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so ? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.</span><br><br>from <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br>When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html</a><br><br>"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency."<br><br>However, Buddhism is largely Agnostic rather than Atheist. We believe that it is not important to our spiritual practise, enlightenment, and liberation from samsara.<br><br>"Malunkhyaputta Sutta stresses that whether the universe was created or uncreated, finite or infinite, is irrelevant to our main spiritual concerns: the cause and cessation of suffering:<br><br>"Therefore Malunkhyaputta, bear the undeclared as undeclared. Malunkhyaputta, what are the not declared? The world is eternal, is not declared by me. The world is not eternal, is not declared by me. They are not essential for the principles of the holy life, they do not lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, what are the declared by me? This, is unpleasant, is declared. This, is its arising, is delcared. This, is its cessation is declared. This is the path to its cessation, is declared. Malunkhyaputta, why are these declared by me? These are the essentials for the principles of the holy life, they lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, I declare them." MN 64"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add,<br><br>In Plane 14)Great Brahmas (Maha brahma)<br>Two of this realm's more famous inhabitants are the Great Brahma, a deity whose delusion leads him to regard himself as the all-powerful, all-seeing creator of the universe (DN 11), and Brahma Sahampati, who begs the Buddha to teach Dhamma to the world (SNVI.1).<br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/loka.html<br><br>Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta<br><br><blockquote>..."Then it was not long before Brahma appeared.<br><br>"So the monk approached the Great Brahma and, on arrival,<br>said, 'Friend, where do these four great elements -- the earth<br>property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind<br>property -- cease without remainder?'<br><br>"When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am<br>Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-<br>Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief,<br>Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'<br><br>A second time, ....<br><br>"A third time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't<br>ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the<br>Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the<br>Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have<br>Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements --<br>the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the<br>wind property -- cease without remainder.'<br><br>"Then the Great Brahma, taking the monk by the arm and leading him<br>off to one side, said to him, 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma<br>believe, "There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know.<br>There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see. There is<br>nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware. There is nothing that<br>the Great Brahma has not realized." That is why I did not say in<br>their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great<br>elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly,<br>acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One (Buddha) in search<br>of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the<br>Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he<br>answers it, you should take it to heart.'<br><br>"Then -- just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex<br>his extended arm -- the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and<br>immediately appeared in front of me. Having bowed down to me, he sat<br>to one side. As he was sitting there he said to me, 'Lord, where do<br>these four great elements -- the earth property, the liquid<br>property, the fire property, and the wind property -- cease without<br>remainder?'</blockquote>cont.<br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/digha/dn-11-tb0.html<br><br>i can't deny also that Hindism still taught Brahmanism in their doctrines.<br>and Buddhism's Deva Vehicle equivalent for the god/Lord in other religions is Issara (Sanskrit-Isvara) of Trayastrimsa.<br><br><blockquote>(7)The Thirty-three Gods (tavatimsa deva) Sakka, a devotee of the Buddha, presides over this realm. Many devas dwelling here live in mansions in the air.</blockquote>/\<br>Amituofo!<br><br></div>
