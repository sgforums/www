              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li Gotami: The Woman Who Dedicated Her Life to the Arts</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">NOV 6, 2017 Biography</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Born into a wealthy Parsi family on 22 April 1906 in Mumbai,
              Ratti Petit, more commonly known as Li Gotami, was a talented painter,
              photographer and writer. Her family owned the Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit Parsee
              General Hospital located in Cumbala Hill, Mumbai. She attended a school in
              Harrow on the Hill (an area northwest of London) in England and later studied
              at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1924.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li Gotami was a passionate traveller and journeyed all over Europe
              before returning to India in the 1930s. She was regarded as someone very
              unusual during her time and was one of the very few women from traditional
              Indian society who took the extraordinary step of breaking away from the norms
              of how Indian women, or women in general, should live their lives. According to
              her niece, Dr. Sylla Malvi, Li Gotami “was her own person.” She also spoke of
              Li Gotami’s resolve,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Unlike my obedient mother, my aunt was head-strong, and
              nobody could tell her what to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Also, Li Gotami was part of a larger cultural movement of
              seekers discovering Eastern spirituality, long before the Beatles in the 1950s
              and the hippies in the 1960s.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Later in India, she worked with artist Manishi Dey who
              introduced her to the Bengal School of Art, an influential art movement and a
              style of Indian painting that originated in Bengal, Shantiniketan and Kolkata.
              This genre would eventually have a significant influence on her life and works.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the 1930s, Li Gotami married art collector Karl Khandalavala
              but their marriage was brief. In 1934, she travelled to Rabindranath Tagore’s
              ashram in Shantiniketan to study under the artist Nandalal Bose and to learn
              the art of Manipuri dance. According to Dr Malvi,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Her parents were not happy about her going away. In fact, my
              grandfather even sent her brother [Maneckji Petit] to check on her.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dr Malvi also fondly recollected a time when all the children
              in the neighbourhood in Juhu were playing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“She was like a magician. And she told us to bring her any
              object — twigs, stones, paper — and she would make something out of it. To
              challenge her, I took a raw coconut that had fallen down. I knew she wouldn’t
              be able to make anything out of it. But she turned it around, drew two eyes and
              made a little mouse. She was like that; so imaginative. She could see things in
              the ordinary.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li Gotami spent a total of 12 years at Shantiniketan, where
              she excelled in her studies and received a number of diplomas from the various
              Arts and Music Schools there. Later she met Abanindranath Tagore, the nephew of
              Rabindranath Tagore, a significant painter of that time who also taught at the
              arts school. Abanindranath Tagore was very impressed by Li Gotami’s work and
              would later become her mentor. According to Malvi,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“She absolutely worshipped Abanindranath Tagore. It was he
              who told her that she would excel in religious and children’s paintings.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During her time at Shantiniketan, Li Gotami also met Lama
              Anagarika Govinda for the first time. The encounter took place when she was
              making her way to the hostel where Lama Govinda was staying at the time. The
              encounter is described as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“A door opened and out strolled this handsome, smiling
              foreigner dressed in the burgundy robes of a monk. She recalled asking herself
              who this “bright merry person” might be, and in retrospect (at least on her
              part) remembered the incident as very romantic.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Source: Kovács, Iván. Lama Govinda’s Quest for the Truth: A
              Summary of His Life – Part I; The Esoteric Quarterly. 2015</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She proceeded to study under Lama Govinda, a Bolivian-German
              Professor of Vishwa Bharati University and a prominent teacher to notable
              students such as Indira Nehru, who would later become the first female Prime
              Minister of India. Under his guidance, Li Gotami’s interest in Buddhism grew
              very quickly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He also brought her to meet his teacher, Domo Geshe Rinpoche.
              Lama Govinda’s book, “The Way of the White Clouds”, records how Domo Geshe
              Rinpoche had predicted that Li Gotami would become Lama Govinda’s wife.
              However, Domo Geshe Rinpoche had kept that information secret until the day of
              their marriage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li Gotami married Lama Govinda in four separate ceremonies in
              1947. Lama Govinda performed one of the ceremonies himself, in the role of a
              lama. Two other ceremonies were held in Darjeeling and Mumbai, and the fourth
              was held in Tse-Choling Monastery in the Chumbi Valley, presided over Tibet by
              Ajorepa Rinpoche.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Prior to meeting Ajorepa Rinpoche, Lama Govinda had been
              working very hard to obtain permits to enter Tsaparang, the capital of the
              ancient kingdom of Guge in the Garuda Valley, and the newly married couple were
              full of anticipation at the prospect of visiting the beautiful city. When they
              arrived at Tse-Choling Monastery, then under the leadership of Ajorepa
              Rinpoche, the incarnation of the 8th century Mahasiddha Dombi-Heruka, Ajorepa
              Rinpoche inducted both Lama Govinda and Li Gotami into the Kagyu tradition of
              Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After spending some time in Tse-Choling Monastery, they
              continued their journey to the city of Gyantse. During their four-month stay in
              Gyantse, they explored various monasteries and retreat places, attended
              festivals and religious ceremonies, and Li Gotami took many pictures of
              everything that grabbed her fancy. Finally, they received the necessary permits
              in January 1948 and Li Gotami and Lama Govinda returned to India to prepare for
              their expedition to Tsaparang.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A Long Awaited Journey</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From Kasar Devi, the couple embarked on a number of
              expeditions to central and western Tibet between 1947 and 1949. The two-year
              expedition was fully sponsored by the “Illustrated Weekly of India” in exchange
              for a written account of the trip. The pictures taken during this particular
              expedition would later be featured in their books, “The Way of the White
              Clouds”, “Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism” and “Tibet in Pictures”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the expedition, Li Gotami and Lama Govinda often had
              to endure harsh and dangerous living conditions in the arid landscape. They
              also had to put up with extreme cold weather, and their diet mostly consisted
              of porridge and chapatis, cooked slowly over a brushwood and yak dung fire.
              Temperatures were so low that they literally had to drink their tea immediately
              after boiling, otherwise it would freeze inside their cups! Li Gotami recalled,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“A storm then broke. The rain nearly froze us while the wind
              howled like hungry wolves around us. Oh, those winds! They are Tibet’s worst
              enemy, and if I were ever asked to picture them, I would draw a hundred
              thousand ice-bound daggers with the head of a howling wolf for every hilt.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Kovács, Iván. Lama Govinda’s Quest for the Truth: A Summary
              of His Life – Part II; The Esoteric Quarterly. 2015</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As part of the expedition, Li Gotami and Lama Govinda also
              visited the beautiful Mount Kailash and spent a few days circumambulating the
              sacred mountain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When they finally arrived in Tsaparang, Li Gotami and Lama
              Govinda lived in a hut in front of a cave, where a shepherd named Wangdu lived
              with his family. Wangdu would bring them the basic necessities – brushwood,
              water and milk – as there were no other families living in the area.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The couple always began their day with prayers and pujas, and
              then would work from morning to evening, tracing, sketching and photographing
              the remains of frescoes, statues, temples and other surviving artworks in the
              area.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Their stay in Tsaparang was marked by many challenges,
              including difficulties caused by the local Tibetans and authorities who were
              suspicious of their work. Although conditions were difficult, they did not give
              up and remained buoyant in the face of these obstacles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After completing their work, the couple planned to return to
              India but found that the Himalayan passes were closed for three months until
              spring time. While waiting for the passes to reopen, they lived in a rest-house
              run by a kind Nyingma Lama named Namgyal. Around this period, they also met the
              Nyingma Abbot of Phiyang Monastery, an extremely learned master who taught them
              the method of yoga practices and Tantric sadhana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When the passes were finally accessible, Li Gotami and Lama
              Govinda returned to northern India where they stayed in a house rented from the
              famed writer Walter Evans-Wentz at Kasar Devi. Otherwise known as “Crank’s
              Ridge”, Kasar Devi was a bohemian home to various artists, writers and
              spiritual seekers such as John Blofeld, Earl Brewster, Alfred Sorensen and many
              others. Li Gotami busied herself with the practical matters of running the
              household and sketching, while Lama Govinda occupied himself by writing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dr Malvi, whose home is dotted with several of Li Gotami’s
              paintings, says,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“My aunt travelled extensively with him, but never really
              earned a reputation as an artist.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1955, Li Gotami and Lama Govinda moved to a 40-acre estate
              in Almora, located in north-west India. They maintained an ashram there and
              studied painting, Buddhist philosophy and meditation. Although their living
              conditions were ‘difficult’ – the area was completely barren and they had no
              access to running water and electricity – they enjoyed themselves very much as
              it was exactly the kind of life they were looking for – one that was simple,
              peaceful and quiet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li Gotami’s niece Roshan Cooper says,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It was absolutely in the wilderness. There was no
              electricity, no running water. And our mother would take us two youngsters to
              spend time with them. She would always say her happiest years were in Almora.
              Her happiness was in the soul.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dr Malvi adds,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“She would also play the piano wonderfully and we would all
              sing.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Death</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Towards the end of her life, Li Gotami and Lama Govinda were
              invited to live in the United States. Initially, they lived in California and
              later settled down in the San Francisco Bay Area due to health issues they were
              both facing at that time. She had Parkinson’s disease while Lama Govinda had
              suffered from several strokes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A Zen centre that belonged to Alan Watts and Suzuki Roshi
              provided them with comfortable lodging in Mill Valley, California. In return
              for their assistance and care, Lama Govinda gave lectures in the centre. They
              later became permanent residents of the United States and were eligible for
              government health benefits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lama Govinda suffered a sudden heart attack and passed away
              peacefully on 14 January 1985 while having a conversation with Li Gotami. His
              ashes were interred in the Nirvana Stupa in Samten Choeling Monastery in
              Darjeeling, India. A few months after her husband’s death, Li Gotami returned
              to India and lived with her family. She passed away on 18 August 1988 in Pune,
              Maharashtra.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Numerous pieces of Li Gotami’s art and fresco tracings from
              Tibet are still kept in the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in
              Mumbai, which hosted an exhibition showcasing her work on 2 February 2008
              titled “Tibet through the eyes of Li Gotami”. Her books including “Tibet in
              Pictures” and “Tibetan Fantasies: Paintings, Poems, and Music” have become some
              of the most sought-after today and her life-long contribution to the arts has
              left a strong imprint in the modern world. Her incredible life and works will
              not be forgotten any time soon.</span></p>
