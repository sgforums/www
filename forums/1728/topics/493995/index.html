              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">April 30, 2017 Daniel P.
              (Danny) Coleman Patheos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I’m
              going to write a few posts to attempt to explain what Buddhist-Christian-Quaker
              means to me.  In this post I’ll focus primarily on the Buddhist part of
              that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Let
              me begin by clarifying that I have been a Christian for 30+ years.  I
              became a follower of Jesus as a young adult in the mid-1980’s (while traveling
              through Texas as the bassist for a heavy metal band–but that’s a story for
              another post).  I prayed the “Sinner’s Prayer” to become “born again” in a
              church parking lot in Beaumont, Texas.  For many years after that I
              attended fundamentalist non-denominational charismatic evangelical
              churches.  I met my wife at church.  We raised our son within the
              evangelical culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              about two decades in the fundamentalist Christian world, my wife and I left to
              start a house-church and then, over the course of a few years, became
              Quakers.  Our son, by that time a young adult off at college, had already
              joined the growing ranks of “the Nones” (people who describe their religious
              affiliation as “none”).  Being a Quaker Christian enabled me to gain some
              distance from my fundamentalist past and opened the door to contemplative
              spirituality.  I began learning about other forms of Christianity and also
              about other religions (not just for the purpose of winning theological debates,
              but rather to simply learn and appreciate the wisdom they had to offer). 
              I had spent most of my Christian years fairly ignorant (and, frankly, somewhat
              fearful) of other faiths, while simultaneously smug and sure in the correctness
              of my provincial fundamentalist ghetto.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Among
              the many world-religions I studied, one of them unexpectedly “clicked” with me
              in a big way: Buddhism.  That scared me a bit at first.  I didn’t
              want to become one of those cautionary tales I had heard so many times at
              church: “Daniel went to seminary and lost his faith in Jesus and became an
              apostate and now he is hopelessly lost.”  But then I read (and re-read,
              and re-read again) Paul Knitter’s book Without Buddha I Could Not Be a
              Christian.  Knitter had been a Catholic priest, a student of the eminent
              theologian Karl Rahner, and then an esteemed professor of theology
              himself–first at Xavier University in Cincinnati and now as emeritus at Union
              Theological Seminary in New York City.  “Buddhism has helped me take another
              and deeper look at what I believe as a Christian,” he wrote. “Many of the words
              that I had repeated or read throughout my life started to glow with new
              meaning.”  This was the experience I was having as I was drawn toward the
              teachings and practices (the Dharma) of the Buddha.  I could not embrace
              certain ideas such as reincarnation and karmic reward/punishment in future
              lives, but I discovered that these ideas were not intrinsic to the Buddha’s
              core teachings.  Stephen Batchelor’s books, especially Buddhism Without
              Beliefs helped me sort this out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So,
              does that make me a Buddhist?  Let me hedge a little further: Some
              Buddhists would say that there is really no such thing as Buddhism. 
              “Buddhism” is a term, an “ism”, invented by Western scholars in the 19th
              century to categorize the 2,500 year-old movement of people practicing the
              Dharma.  We Western scholars love to categorize, and so “Buddhism” was
              placed alongside Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Taoism and other
              world-religions for the sake of comparison and contrast.  Many highly
              regarded Buddhist teachers today, such as Thich Nhat Hanh, although they will
              use the de facto descriptor of “Buddhism,” prefer to speak of “practicing the
              Dharma.”  That seems to align more closely with the way Buddhists
              described themselves throughout history.  I like how that descriptor
              places the emphasis on practice–what one does–rather than on merely subscribing
              to a set of beliefs or doctrines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              this stage in the game the descriptors “Buddhism” and “Buddhist” have become
              established nomenclature and are unlikely to disappear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhante
              Gunaratana, in his book Mindfulness in Plain English, wrote:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Buddhism
              does not advocate faith in the sense of believing something because it is
              written in a book, attributed to a prophet, or taught to you by some authority
              figure. The meaning of faith here is closer to confidence. It is knowing that
              something is true because you have seen it work, because you have observed that
              very thing within yourself. In the same way, morality is not a ritualistic
              obedience to a code of behavior imposed by an external authority. It is rather
              a healthy habit pattern that you have consciously and voluntarily chosen to
              impose upon yourself because you recognize its superiority to your present
              behavior.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Can
              being a Buddhist coexist with being something else, such as a Christian? 
              From the Buddhist perspective it certainly can.  Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki
              wrote, “If you’re not a Buddhist you think there are Buddhists and
              non-Buddhists, but if you’re a Buddhist you realize everybody’s a Buddhist–even
              the bugs.”  In a future post I’ll explore this same question from a
              Christian perspective.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              word Buddha is a title which means “awakened one.”  The goal of practicing
              the Dharma is to become awakened, just like the man Gautama did 2,500 years ago
              and like many men and women purportedly have since.  Therefore to be a
              Buddhist means to be an “awake-ist” and Buddhism is literally
              “awake-ism.”  Through mindful practices–particularly meditation–one becomes
              awake to aspects of reality such as impermanence, dependent origination,
              emptiness, non-self, interbeing, etc.  The experiential awareness of these
              things leads to greater peace and contentment and integrity in this life–here
              and now.  “The buddha-dharma is about examining our lives, our behavior,
              our speech, and the means by which we earn our keep on this planet–and how all
              these activities connect with everything else,” writes Steve Hagen in Buddhism
              Plain and Simple, “We have only one choice.  Either we awaken, or we do
              not.”  In other words, reality is what it is.  Buddhism is about
              becoming experientially aware of reality and living one’s life accordingly.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So,
              do I practice the Dharma?  Yes.  Do I love and follow Jesus? 
              Yes.  Am I a Christian?  I believe so.  Am I a Buddhist?  I
              believe so.</span></p>
