I will feel happy for you too.<br><br>Chanting amitabha alone will not give you the admission ticket.<br>It does benefit us, but if you want it to really guarantee a seat for you, the chanting must be done without wondering thoughts. Meaning no evil thought as well as good thought.<br>Some people can attain samadhi during chanting, they didn't study a lot of buddhism books, but with the samadhi chanting, he has cleared a lot of demerits and fulfill the criteria to go to western pureland.<br><br>Nowadays people like to take shortcut, they go and buy the small chanting device and turn it on 24hrs everyday, hoping it to do chanting on their behalf. I think the chanting device will go to pure land first before them.<br>Anyway, joke aside. I am sure if going to pure land is so easy, some of us wouldn't be here anymore, right?</div>

So you might still be back on earth while reborn in the Western Pure Land.</div></blockquote>itÂ’s more profound than that, itÂ’s neither physical non not physical. when thereÂ’s duality, big/small, long/short, good/evil, high/low...thatÂ’s still within samsara state.<br>Ananda, a disciple of Buddha asked Buddha if He could show everyone, where is His Pureland . Buddha pressed His toe on the ground and the dimension of PL, same as Western PL, golden flooring, crystal surrounding, very beautify surrounding, was right in front of them. ThatÂ’s to say, when you are sitting together with Buddha, Buddha reside in Pureland, while we reside in samsara, concreat floor, dirty surrounding.<br>till we purify our mind, the Land/surrounding will naturally be Pure!<br><br>/\<br></div>
