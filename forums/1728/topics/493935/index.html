              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Alcohol, drugs and
              recovery</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Jason Jellison March 2017,
              The Phuket News  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              day, a man was interviewing the Dalai Lama. He asked him, “What is your biggest
              concern about man?” The Dalai Lama wisely replied with but a word. “Man,” he
              said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Dalai Lama went on to explain that he was speaking of misplaced priorities. He
              observed that man goes about life in a rather fruitless pattern.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">First,
              he sacrifices his health in the pursuit of money. Then, he spends money in the
              effort to repair his ruined health.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Next,
              he worries about the future so much that he ignores the present. As a result,
              he never really lives in either the present or the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              simply treads water adrift a river of chaos, all the while totally oblivious to
              the fact that he will someday die. Finally, he dies – never having really lived
              at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              words from the Dalai Lama are succinct and wise. However, I would observe that
              man tends to facilitate this tautology through the vice of alcohol or, more
              recently, drugs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              use it to distract ourselves from the truth observed by the Dalai Lama.
              Intoxicants make us forget about all of our problems... at least for a while.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our
              biggest vice is probably alcohol. We glorify it. We joke about it. We write
              songs about it. Yet, we hardly ever confront it. We gloss over it rather than
              dress it down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              even is a publication entitled The Alcoholmanac that is circulated in my
              hometown. I was recently reading a copy of it when I stumbled upon an
              advertisement for a featured bar that is called the Karma Bar &amp; Grill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yes,
              most of us know that Buddhist Karma refers to the sum of a person’s experiences
              as it totals in the measure of the suffering in their current life but, alas,
              most Westerners are oblivious to the fact that the Fifth Precept of Buddha says
              “Do not use intoxicants.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sadly,
              this tavern unwittingly insults Buddhism by leading people down the wrong road.
              America has not historically been a Buddhist country, so I am rather forgiving
              when it comes to their ignorance of Buddhist matters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              these insults to the Teachings of Buddha do more than simply injure the
              religion. They also facilitate people into using alcohol and drugs and, as one
              my readers recently observed, many of those people readily fall into
              addiction. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Last
              month, one of my readers wrote me to find out what could be done to help Thai
              people who fell into drugs and alcohol. I thought that was an intriguing
              question and I, too, wanted to find out more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thanks
              to my translators, I was able to find some very good answers for the vexing
              addictions that inevitably follow failure to recognise the value of Buddha’s
              Fifth Precept.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is a monastery up in Lopburi called Wat Tham Krabok and it is open to not just
              Thai addicts, but also Westerners. While I have never personally been there, I
              found many pictures on the Internet of both Thai and Westerners who were in
              recovery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wat
              Tham Krabok is often called Thailand’s “Buddhist Detox Centre” and many
              celebrities have been there such as musicians Tim Arnold and Pete Doherty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              100,000 addicts have walked through the temple doors since it began treating
              alcohol and drug problems some 60 years ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              temple is famous nowadays for treating yaba addiction, which is more commonly
              known in the West as speed, or more technically, methamphetamine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Its
              healing monks have even won awards such as the esteemed Magsaysay Award for
              Public Service. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">People
              from every walk of life have found peace at the temple. Ancient words are
              chanted and a secret herbal purgative, yaa dtat, is given in the shadow of two
              dozen stone Buddha figures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Surrounded
              by the warmth of sun-drenched mountain-stone and the dignity of soaring trees,
              healing wafts through the steam that emanates from the daily afternoon steam
              baths that addicts take.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Golden
              Buddhas and oil lanterns are perched near important buildings, and the healing
              steam baths are created from a local grass, yaa kah, as well as morning glory,
              castor leaves and citronella.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Amid
              quieter times, men can be seen tending to chores underneath golden Buddha
              statues that easily stand six-times their own height.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Unlike
              many Buddhist temples, Wat Tham Krabok does not seem to be making much of an
              effort to remain out of the sight of non-Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              temple has an English-language website that has been translated into five
              additional languages and its Abbot, Phra Atikarn Gitiwanno, has several decades
              of service.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              there is no charge and any drug addict can come, the temple has a charitable
              foundation which is called the Tham Krabok Foundation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sajja
              teaching principals are used. Patients and monks wear dark brown robes at this
              temple and you must be willing to stay at least two weeks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Patients
              take sacred vows before a monk whereupon they vow to give-up smoking, injecting
              drugs and drinking alcohol forever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              patients have found even more peace by tending to the temple’s garden and
              chopping wood. One can find the spirit of teamwork as men use simple tools to
              acquire new skills.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              of the bricks have actually been made on the land and many men learn ceramics.
              Patients often play sports once they start to recover and others get involved
              in music during their off time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              the experience will be somewhat different for most foreigners in one key
              aspect. Westerners usually don’t know the teachings of Buddha, which is called
              the Dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              though most Thai people will attend more intense Dharma sessions, Dharma
              instruction is only once a week for Westerners so there is no pressure there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation,
              however, is every morning and so is evening chanting. Some patients even have
              recovered so much that they became monks themselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you or someone that you know is struggling with alcohol or drug addiction, Wat
              Tham Krabok is could offer them path to recovery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
