Pain can only be get rid off by physical means - healing, medicine, or anaesthetic, etc. Suffering due to pain should be liberated through dharma practise.<br><br>Only a person with certain of cultivation can withstand very extreme physical pain I guess... only when one completely fuse into the pure sensation of the pain and no one 'feeling' the pain, just the pure sensation as it is.. it is impermanent, ever changing, it is not self, there is no self experiencing pain.. in short even this pain is empty in nature.. but the sensation of pain is present, just that no one is suffering the pain... the pain itself 'pains'. Of course I am far from such... so am only deducing from knowledge and might be wrong.<br><br>My taiwanese teacher went for operation last time... doctors gave him two dose of anaesthetic. Usually one dose is enough to make a person completely unconscious... first dose doesnt work, he is still completely awake. Second dose still the same... the nurse ask whether should give another dose, the doctor say... nope, like that will kill him. Then my teacher said... go ahead with the procedures, no amount of anaesthetic can numb my senses/make me unconscious.<br><br>He observed the entire medical procedure and operation, very lucidly, very clearly, without any sound much less screaming and shouting at all, just calming watching it... The doctors are completely shocked and couldn't believe he could withstand this.<br><br>Another person I know with rather similar experience.... is the 16th Karmapa.<br><br><a href="http://www.simhas.org/karma16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simhas.org/karma16.html</a><br><br><blockquote>...In 1981, the Karmapa began to manifest signs of cancer, and his life was known to be near its end.  His Holiness went through various recurrences and remissions.  He was soon brought to the Clinic Hospital in Zion, Illinois.<br><br>His Holiness began contracting various harmful illnesses, all taken upon by himself to rid the suffering of others, and he allowed the doctors to experiment on him.  <strong>They found that no matter how much sedatives were given to the Karmapa, these medicines had completely no affect on his mental clarity.</strong> One day an illness was cured, and the next a new one would be found. The doctors were baffled at how the machines would somehow be turned on and off automatically.<br><br>Through all this, they were amazed at the serene atmosphere the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa created.<br><br>In the evening on November 5th, 1981, His Holiness passed away.  For three days, the heart region of the KarmapaÂ’s body remained warm to the amazement of the medical staff, and as the medical physician put it, Â“I have no medical explanation for this.Â”  His body was left in the room for these days and remained in meditation position.  The Karmapa's disciples, such as Tai Situ Rinpoche, attended his body after his death. Then, on November 9th, his remains were flown back to Sikkim....</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not very related to buddhism but just for sharing of interesting information, there was a documentary of a woman who used self-hypothesis, instead of  anaesthetic during a surgert as she is allergic to the chemical. Thus during the operation, this patient is widely-awaked and awared of what is going and yet they don't feel the pain. Personally, i don't know how and why self-hypothesis could work and why she don't feel pain but it does show some insight of how the mind works. [ Disclaimer: pls don't practise this at home for the young kids reading this cos this auntie is trained <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">]<br><br>Just to share another interesting account of mine: I have been hypothesised once. In this case, i was told to close my eyes and listen to the voice of another person who says to my ear " that im a steel bar blah blah ( can't really rem the content as it is a long time ago ). True enough, my body was as taunt as a steel bar as what she has said. As they place my head and feet on 2 chairs, i was like a beam, my body didnt buckled down.. i was fully awared of bodily sensation of my muscle and sounds from the surrounding, though my eyes are closed.. usually, for a normal person.. the gravity will therefore be the pulling force and cause the mid-part ( butt ) of the body to fall...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The title "overcoming the pain"... also reminds me..<br><br>For example when our skin is healing from a cut and becomes itchy.... if i'm bothered/getting attached to it, the itchness will be there constantly bugging me. But if i don't think about it and focus my thinking away from it, the funny thing is that the itchness disappear and it appears as if it wasn't there in the first place...<br><br>so what does this say?<br><br>there is this common-street saying (as mention by fireice ).. don't think about it and you will not feel pain too..<br><br></div>
