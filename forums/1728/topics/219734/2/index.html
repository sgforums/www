            <div class='col-md body'>To me, pain should be categorized into meaningful pain and meaningless pain, meaningful pain is something that benefits us although it make us painful in a way, study hard, beginning stage of learning meditation. It may be painful but is worth it.<br><br>If it is meaningless pain like something due to mistake or bad habit, and you want to solve the problem right away before thinking about the long term solution, then you can do chanting of any mantra or name of buddha / bodhisatva that you prefer.<br>or you can use it as an opportunity for spiritual practise, think about all sentient beings that has similar pain as you, how pity they are, have a vow to lessen their pain.<br>or to think about the compassion that bodhisatva in saving the sentient beings<br>or thinking of the animal being slaughtered, do they not feel pain? and slowly you will become less addicted to meat.<br><br>We should make use of the environment and the ever changing condition for our own practise instead of evading from it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this works for me.<br>u see, every person can stand pain. lets say im holding this 55degree celcius plate. and i can stand the heat from lets say 10-60 degree celcius. 55 degree celcius is hot, but since u can take the amount of heat pain, just tell urself that it isnt pain and it can work, u will be able to hold it. for normal pain, just think of some thing else. for me, when ever i think of some thing, anything, like the person standing in front of me, i will forget what i am thinking for a few 0.01 seconds. and that period of time, u wont be feeling any pain. its like thinking of something else. for me, mi mind can onli process 1 thing at a time, so if im thinking of something else, the pain wont be process. but not too pain though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just browse through the meaning of right concentration in some website...<br><br>Right concentration is one of the eight element in the Noble eightfold path.<br><br>Right concentration (samyak-samadhi Â· samma-samadhi), together with right mindfulness, is concerned broadly with the practice of Buddhist meditation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>And what, monks, is right concentration?<br><br>(i) Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unwholesome states, a monk enters in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from detachment, accompanied by movement of the mind onto the object and retention of the mind on the object.<br><br>(ii) With the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, (he/she) enters and remains in the second jhana;na: rapture and pleasure born of concentration; fixed single-pointed awareness free from movement of the mind onto the object and retention of the mind on the object; assurance.<br><br>(iii) With the fading of rapture, (he/she) remains in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, and physically sensitive of pleasure. (He/She) enters and remains in the third jhana which the Noble Ones declare to be "Equanimous and mindful, (he/she) has a pleasurable abiding."<br><br>(iv) With the abandoning of pleasure and pain...as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress...(he/she) enters and remains in the fourth jhana;na: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither in pleasure nor in pain.<br><br>This, monks, is called right concentration[17].<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>1) And what does it mean by movement of mind onto object?<br><br>Vitakka (Pali) or Vitarka (Sanskrit), both in Hinduist yoga and Buddhist meditation, means the action of taking care of any object : God, one's body, the Self, a color, any sensation, any things...<br><br>It refers to attention in a different way than cognitive neuroscience, implying a very strong leading of attention, as it leads to more mental process : Vicara piti, sukha and ekaggata.<br><br>Vitakka is the first element to appear in meditation's process, still present in the first Jhana, but absent of any further Jhana.<br><br>2 )And what does it mean by retention of the mind on the object:<br><br>Vicara is a term of buddhist psychology. This term is mostly used to describe the internal feeling of the yogi who practices samatha bhavana, that is the meditation technique consisting in focusing the mind to one single point. Nevertheless, this term can be used to describe the practice of vipassana or even, outside of any meditation context, the simple fact to maintain awareness on any object.<br><br>In the meditation practices, the mind catches a mental object (see: vitakka), which means the meditator try to notice a feeling and to stay aware of it. He cultivates consciousness of this object - and the term object is understood as a psychological object, a perception.<br><br>Vicara is focusing on an object, and holding it in consciousness, to meditate on it - Like meditating over a candle flame. You meditate on the flame, watch it move, so eventually you are no longer yourself, but you can "become" the flame. The meditator focusses all his attention on the object but not on the self image, or the distinction between himself and his environment.<br><br>Vicara eventually become one of the five factors of the first jhana.<br><br></div>

Let the focusing/reciting mind return back to the mind itself. let the reflecting mind return back to the mind itself. Like a light bulb shining outward and yet shining onto itself. Let the focusing/reciting mind and the reflecting mind fuse into One. But we have not reached the core.<br>One should work on. Penetrated into the deepest most profound meaning of 'Namo Amitabha'. but such penetration of the meaning is different from that of koan analysis. the more one penetrated, the more complete it is and the more one is intimate with Amitabha. when such "Thusness" is reached, suddenly everything just detached away. Luminousity and non-dual state is reached. there's a stopped to the 6 senses and 6 sense objects. The Inner Buddha nature is without defilements, complete in itself.<br>when one reached neinfo samathi in such a manner, it's sort of entered stream entry/non-retrogression state, ready to work all the way. but now one have not escape samsara, yet one's already within the 'heart' of All Buddhas. when one's life ends, one's sure to achieve the highest grade of PL and swiftly Enlighten to the Buddha vehicle. </span><br><a href="http://www.kangzheng.com/longyuan/fxtx/tx57/T5772.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kangzheng.com/longyuan/fxtx/tx57/T5772.htm</a><br><br>ps:<br>we do have a sutra called Bodhisattva 'remembrance of the Buddha' samathi sutra or Amitayur-buddhanusmriti-sutra(?)<br><br>/\<br></div></blockquote>Thank you<br><br>/\<br><br></div>
