            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some extracts from his book "The Impact of Awakening".<br><br><blockquote>Introduction<br><br>When you come to the point in life where you are ready to inquire directly into the unknown core of your being, you are ripe to awaken from the dream of separation.  The direct path of spiritual inquiry begins not with seeking something that you yearn for, but with seeking the seeker, the essential "I".<br><br>In order for inquiry to be powerful and liberating, it needs to be understood that spiritual inquiry is not something to be performed by the mind.  Inquiry is a tool that points you directly back to your own being, to experience before the mind.  If you read this book with your mind only, you are wasting your time.  But if you read it with your whole being - if you listen to it, feel it, sense it, resonate with it, and digest it slowly, you may find that it is worthwhile after all.<br><br>I am not speaking to who you think you are, I am speaking to You, the Awareness behind the mask called "me".  This book is for You.  You will see your Self celebrated in every page.</blockquote><blockquote>WHO ARE YOU?<br><br>You are...<br><br>beyond the body-mind and personality,<br><br>beyond all experience and the experiencer thereof,<br><br>beyond the world and its perceiver,<br><br>beyond existence and its absence,<br><br>beyond all assertions and denials.<br><br>Be still and awaken to the realization of who you Are.<br><br>In this realization of no separate self,<br><br>the Supreme Reality which you Are shines unobscured<br><br>in all things, as all things, and beyond all things.<br><br>Having returned to the formless Source<br>and transcended all separateness,<br>do not stop or cling even to this Source,<br>but go beyond the Supreme Realization<br>which transcends all dualities,<br>yet does not deny even a speck of dust.<br><br>Having abandoned all concepts and ideas,<br>the enlightened sage lives as ever-present consciousness,<br>manifested and manifesting in the world of time and space<br>That which is eternal, ever new, and whole.</blockquote><blockquote>Chapter One<br><br>The Evolutionary Impulse to be Free<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do not seek after what you yearn for,<br><br>seek the source of the yearning itself.</span><br><br>The impulse to be free is an evolutionary spark within consciousness which originates from beyond the ego.  It is an impulse toward the divine, unity, and wholeness.  It is an impulse originating from the Truth itself.  This impulse to evolve is often co-opted by the ego, which then creates the illusion of the spiritual seeker.  This impulse which is inherently innocent, is something that, in and of itself, has nothing to do with seeking to attain.  It is only when the ego co-opts the impulse and then tries to attain something, that the seeker is born.  This impulse, this spark of evolution, becomes almost instantly corrupted by a wanting which gives birth to the seeker.<br><br>Quest:  So then how does one not move away from that impulse, into striving and seeking?  How do you stay in the impulse?<br><br>Answer:  You stay in the impulse by seeing it as an impulse and not interpreting it as coming from a lack.  A sense of lack is the ego's interpretation of the impulse which intantly gives rise to the separate, lost seeker.  The impulse is an inner pressure to evolve, to become whole, to be free.  It comes from your true nature, your already present divinity.<br><br>Quest:  So the pressure to evolve is interpreted as a lack.<br><br>Answer:  Yes.  Actually the impulse comes not from a lack, but from the spark of evolution.  In that sense it comes from fullness.  It comes from that which already is.  The impulse to be free is actually coming directly from a freedom that is already starting to break into consciousness.  The evolution is going from misunderstanding, which is ignorance, to Wisdom, which is Self realization.  The impulse to be free comes from Wisdom.<br><br>Quest:  I would like clarification.  Isn't the spiritual seeker just an innocent expression of the impulse to be free?<br><br>Answer:  It starts out as an innocent seeking, curiosity, or yearning, then the ego quickly corrupts it into a form of seeking for something outside of oneself.  This is the birth of the seeker.  There is only seeking without a seeker.  Ask yourself: From where does the impulse, the yearning to be free, arise?  Go to it's source, to the fullness before the yearning.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Thusness and AnEternalNow,<br><br>The inner dimension has been opening up at the center of my being for about 18 months now, but the quality of the experience is changing now.<br><br>It is no longer so much an opening up anymore, because the egoic structures are not as firmly present as they were before, now it feels more like an expansion or a pressure from within.<br><br>I truly feel very close to what Adyashanti says about this impulse, especially this line:<br><br><blockquote>The impulse is an inner pressure to evolve, to become whole, to be free.</blockquote>Adyashanti's explanations are bringing a great deal of clarity to the human experience.</div>

Ignorance is a very very very deep form of "knowing" but dualistic knowing.  "Knowingness" has all implications to Consciousness.
