When He saw fellow beings sufferings, He contemplated ,"May I share the suffering of all hell beings who are suffering the same punishment as me and remove the suffering of others .Instantly, with this noble thoughts ,He was expiated from his sufferings and die immediately to reborn in the Heaven .<br><br>Thats the beginning of Lojong practice in Tibetan Buddhism<br><br>According to scriptures , a block of wood 1 "zhang" [probably 3metre] fell into the burning hell, within 1 minutes turn to ashes<br><br>there in a abode in the most darkest corner ,a light shine upon the hell beings , if they remembered and repent at the minute of thoughts abt their misdeeds<br><br>Ksheetigarbha Bodhisattva is always there to remind them to remember to undo the misdeed in their saha life before reborn as human once their punishment in hell exhausted<br><br>More will be discussed about the Buddhist Hell ,just stay tuned<br><br>I personally feel that taboos in chinese society must be demystified ,like mentioning of Hell to many people<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find this more platable.<br>Its from the book <span style="font-style: italic;">'Be a Lamp Upon Yourself'</span> that I "borrowed" from outside one of the shops in Bedok Reservoir Road.<br><br>Here is the excerpt from the book (p.124):<br><br>WHAT IS THE REALM OF HELL?<br><br>Hell is a horible dimension of intense constant pain and torment where its beings are subjected to the most excruciating tortures inflicted by vengeful demons and beasts. The firey heat of the hot Hells corresponds to the passionate intensity of hatred and fear while the freezing coldness of the cold hells corresponds to the cold cruelty of hard heartedness and apathy. Hell consists of subplanes, each of which "specialises" in a particular kind of karmic punishment appropriate to a certain kind of unwholesome action. Beings in Hell either burn with rage or are tortured by anxiety. They do not see that their torturers are manifestations of their own guilty Minds. The duratiion of life in Hell also feels unberably long.<br><br>HELL IN OUR WORLD<br><br>A World War can be the eqivalent of Hell where violence, hatred and fear is every where. Being forced to face strong personal phobias such as flying in a plane or entering an unkown place can also be hellish experiences.<br><br>AM I A HELL-BEING?<br><br>The "Human Hell Being" live life habitually seeing the world full of dangerous strangers out to get even or take advantage - everyone seems to be constantly threatening. Their prime moltivation is to eliminate or evade their menaces, and are in a state of open emnity with everyone they encounter. They suffer agonies of insecurity and feel the pain and humilation of imagined wrongs. Because of how they behave towards others, they bring into being the enemies they imagine. Hell Beings are dominated by the mental state of Hatred (Aversion), fear and/or even voilence. They live in Hell in the world as they make every situation a place of torment for themselves. If one is to die tuned to this mindstate, one is likely to be reborn in Hell.<br><br>Hell is also right here.<br>As one of the realms of existence.</div>
