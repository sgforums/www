            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, i happen to flip a dharma book on the Four Noble Truth and find this page may be able to answer some of your questions about desire.<br><br><strong>Grasping is suffering</strong><br><br>Usually we equate suffering with feeling, but the feeling is not suffering. It is the grasping of desire that is suffering. Desire does not cause suffering; the cause of suffering is the <span style="font-style: italic;">grasping</span> of desire. This statement is for reflection and contemplation in terms of your individual experience.<br><br>You really have to investigate desire and know it for what it is. You have to know what is natural and necessary for survival and what is not necessary survival. We can ve very idealistic in thinking that even the need for food is some kind of desire we should not have. Once can be quite ridiculous about it. But the Buddha was not an idealist and he was not a moralist. He was not trying to condemn anything. He was trying to awaken us to the truth so that we could see things clearly.<br><br>Once there is that clarity and seeing in the right way, then there is no suffering. You can still feel hunger. You can still need food without it becoming a desire. Food is a natural need of the body. The body is not a self; it needs food otherwise it will get very weak and die. That is the nature of the body - there is nothing wrong with that. If we get very moralistic and high-minded and believe that we <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> our bodies, that hunger is our own problem, and that we should not even eat - that is not wisdom; it is foolishness.<br><br>When you really see the origin of suffering, you realise that the problem is the grasping of desire not desire itself. Grasping means being deluded by it, thinking it's really 'me' and 'mine'. 'These desire are me and there is something wrong with me for having them'; or, 'I have to get rid of something before i can become what i want to be.' All this is deisre. So you can listen to it with bare attention not saying it's good or bad, but merely recognising it for what it is.<br><br>By Venerable Ajahn Sumedho</div>

It is really easy to help someone. It all in your heart. You don't really need to understand yourself to help others as i have said. You just need to have a bit of generousity and compassionate.<br><br>You can help your mother to do her house chores. You can help some old lady to carry their heavy groceries. You can donate some money ( $1 or less.. it all adds up ) to charity or a poor beggar on the roadside. You can give a smile to a stranger. You can give a simple gift to your friend to thank them. You can always do something to help others, no matter whether it is big or small.

By 'accepting' everything including the contraction, shrinking and flinching, you are no longer creating more aversion/resistance to that moment of experience... no longer 'fixated' on being hit by someone, no longer holding on tightly (for 'self' defense) to the 'shrinking away' (i.e. 'contraction'), not further reacting or following the content, but simply allow whatever thoughts and physical sensations to arise and pass by itself. This is also related to the 'leaving no trace' I was talking about earlier. It is linked with non-fixation.<br><br>As Aaron said -- contraction is not the problem, but the fixation that brings us out of the state of pure awareness. Fixation have different expressions but all stems from our egoic identification, in this case, the (perceived) 'need' to 'defend' a (perceived) 'separate self'. Do look carefully and try to understand the differences between contraction and fixation from the article.<br><br>As long as there is still 'reacting' it means the fixation is still there, just observe with acceptance. This acceptance is a non-fixated open awareness that is aware of whatever mental states, physical sensations that is arising, and also the space of pure awareness.<br><br>This is similar to what Aaron explained: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=285164" rel="nofollow">Choiceless Awareness and Non-Fixation</a><br><br>...When there is an arising, the lawnmower going by, and there is a momentary contraction around the lawnmower, if there is mindfulness, you note that contraction almost immediately, as it arises. The contraction around the hearing is not the hearing itself. <strong>That contraction, also, does not pull you out. Now this is a tough one. I'm going to be more specific. What really pulls you out is fixation on the contraction. Here is the delusion.</strong> The hearing was not "other-than," but the arising of contraction, like or do not like, and the energy contractions therein, are judged and experienced as "other-than." I want you to think about the difference between contraction itself and fixation on the contraction. I'm going to ask Barbara to make a loud noise. I want you to watch any contraction around that noise, and then, whether you simply note the contraction around it and let it go, or whether there's judgment or wanting to hold on to the contraction for defense Let's just observe. (There's a long pause, and then Barbara gives a sudden, loud shout. And again.)<br><br>Could you feel that shift? <strong>Of course the body startled from the surprise of hearing and there was a contraction of energy. The energy contraction is simply a conditioned arising, just as was the physical sensation of hearing. Fixation on any conditioned arising pulls you out of that state of pure awareness. By "fixation" I mean a self-identity with, a move to change, prolong or control it which is movement of the small ego-self.<br><br>What if you see the fixation after a time, and then release it? Then, yes, you do come back to that state of pure awareness again.</strong> The body may still be reverberating from that contraction. There is a distortion, a warp of sorts, in the energy field. In my book, Path of Natural Light, I have delineated practices with which you can work with that distortion and release it. I'm not going to speak to that here. What I want you to begin to see is how easily you can come back home. As soon as you catch it, whether it's a fraction of a second or ten minutes later, as soon as you catch it and re-open, you are home.<br><br><strong>You are not denying the arising of fear, anger, desire or any mind state. If those arise, then you work with them skillfully, simply being aware that they are present until they begin to soften or dissolve. To be aware of a mind state is not to fixate on it. It is not to hold the anger, not to have aversion to the anger. It's simply to be aware of it. It is not the mind state, any more than it is the arising of any thought, that pulls you out of that state of pure awareness.</strong> Anger is just another cloud, another arising of conditioned mind. It is harder to make space for the anger than simply for a thought like "planning," but it certainly can be done. You are not denying anything in your experience but observing the fixation around each contraction that follows the thought or sensation. Observe how that contraction seems to have an "other-than" quality....</div>

For not all monks or nuns can achieve such a complete state of non-attachment. If we were to speak in terms of Cause and Effect, your teacher has practised deep meditation during many of his past lives and has achieved some form of deep samadhi. Only that can explain how he experienced surgery in full consciousness during this lifetime. Or in addition your teacher is a Bodhisattva or Arahant in manifestation or has been practising the Bodhisattva way for many lifetimes. To most layman, they would think that he is not very human, even if he is able to feel pain.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder if we encounter people who has attained such high levels of non-attachment, should we even bother to help them? For they can at any time, control how the pain affects them.<br><br>I have opted out of the body organs donation scheme and my mum did the same. Master Chin Kung has advised that we need not force ourselves to walk the Bodhisattva path of donating organs in this life. All we need to do is to concentrate on strengthening our vows to be reborn in Pureland during every hour of being alive and during our last few breaths. When we are reborn into Pureland, we will be Bodhisattvas who have great wisdom and deep samadhi to withstand without fear nor attachment to all types of physical pain and any type of humiliation when we come down as human beings.<br><br>We need to be very clear and yet flexible on such practical issues. I feel there is an important need to discuss such matters on a consistent basis. Concerns about chronic or terminal illnesses and death and dealing with them in accordance with the best and most flexible Buddhist guidelines should not be neglected in our daily discussion and cultivation of Buddhist teachings, especially when world trends point to a fast ageing world population and resultant strains can be observed for each country's healthcare system.<br><br></div>

It is the grasping of desire that is suffering. Desire does not cause suffering; the cause of suffering is the <span style="font-style: italic;">grasping</span> of desire. This statement is for reflection and contemplation in terms of your individual experience.<br><br>You really have to investigate desire and know it for what it is. You have to know what is natural and necessary for survival and what is not necessary survival. We can ve very idealistic in thinking that even the need for food is some kind of desire we should not have. Once can be quite ridiculous about it. But the Buddha was not an idealist and he was not a moralist. He was not trying to condemn anything. He was trying to awaken us to the truth so that we could see things clearly.<br><br>Once there is that clarity and seeing in the right way, then there is no suffering. You can still feel hunger. You can still need food without it becoming a desire. Food is a natural need of the body. The body is not a self; it needs food otherwise it will get very weak and die. That is the nature of the body - there is nothing wrong with that. If we get very moralistic and high-minded and believe that we <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> our bodies, that hunger is our own problem, and that we should not even eat - that is not wisdom; it is foolishness.<br><br>When you really see the origin of suffering, you realise that the problem is the grasping of desire not desire itself. Grasping means being deluded by it, thinking it's really 'me' and 'mine'. 'These desire are me and there is something wrong with me for having them'; or, 'I have to get rid of something before i can become what i want to be.' All this is deisre. So you can listen to it with bare attention not saying it's good or bad, but merely recognising it for what it is.<br><br>By Venerable Ajahn Sumedho[/b]</blockquote>Good one.

You are also cultivating in action. Through helping others, you are helping yourself too.<br><br>How to help others? You can join volunteerism to help the needy and cultivate the four immeasurables. You can also try practise the six perfection.<br><br>Buddhism deals with the mental affliction.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Hihi,<br><br>btw i'm not there wise.<br><br>I'm still learning.<br><br>Just to add. It is really easy to help someone. It all in your heart. You don't really need to understand yourself to help others as i have said. You just need to have a bit of generousity and compassionate.<br><br>You can help your mother to do her house chores. You can help some old lady to carry their heavy groceries. You can donate some money ( $1 or less.. it all adds up ) to charity or a poor beggar on the roadside. You can give a smile to a stranger. You can give a simple gift to your friend to thank them. You can always do something to help others, no matter whether it is big or small. It isn't there difficult. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Well, I think you are wise enough to help beginner Buddhists like me and I'm sure you will progress in time to come. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Frankly speaking, I am very worried about my intentions when helping people in any way.

Occasionally, i could have some unhealthly thought that come into my mind. There is a cause of it.<br><br>One can practise repentence when one face this problem I used to fear eye contact with venerable. If i have done/think nothing wrong, i could have nothing to fear. For me, I could silently repent to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha for any aversion/any unwholesome thought that arise.<br><br>When one has <strong>right thought</strong>, one's consciousness/liang zhi could be  upright and at ease and one could not have <span style="font-style: italic;">worry</span>.<br><br>You simply accept these unwholesome thought and let it go. It is when "it" becomes me and u react on it, believing that i am evil or good blah.<br>This is a delusion. No one is truly evil or good or not so good or bad.<br><br>U can try &gt; Metta meditation to purify any mental and emotional uneasiness.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Monks, for one whose awareness-release through good will is cultivated, developed, pursued, handed the reins and taken as a basis, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, and well-undertaken, eleven benefits can be expected. Which eleven?<br><br>"One sleeps easily, wakes easily, dreams no evil dreams. One is dear to human beings, dear to non-human beings. The devas protect one. Neither fire, poison, nor weapons can touch one. One's mind gains concentration quickly. One's complexion is bright. One dies unconfused and Â— if penetrating no higher Â— is headed for the Brahma worlds.<br><br>"These are the eleven benefits that can be expected for one whose awareness-release through good will is cultivated, developed, pursued, handed the reins and taken as a basis, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, and well-undertaken."</span><br><br>Refer to the green highlight: Greed isn't our nature. They are merely defilement that comes and goes. Thus we do not need to fear as they are not permanent.<br><br>What does it means by comes and goes? Observe the emotion: anger or any other feeling. This feeling come and drop away. No one can feel constantly angry.<br><br>And if you look at your worries, probably 90% does not come true in reality.<br><br></div>
