              <p>boycott all burberry products!!! their products stink with blood.. tell this to your friends and relatives too..</p>
              <p>i guess i probably posted in the wrong section, but reason i chose to post in the buddhism section is because i know this is probably
              the place where i get most supports from.. as buddhists, we must
              cultivate compassion(and i know that's a trait you people possess),
              just as how buddha teaches us to.. so read on to see how you can help..</p>
              <p><a title="BLOODY BURBERRY" href="http://www.bloodyburberry.com/feature.asp">http://www.bloodyburberry.com/feature.asp</a></p>
              <p>"Burberry continues to use fur in its designs despite the fact that
              leading clothing retailers like J.Crew, Ann Taylor, Polo Ralph Lauren,
              and others have pulled fur from their stores forever.</p>
              <p>Burberry knows about the suffering that goes into every fur-trimmed
              coat, hat, and bag, yet the company continues to use fur in its
              designs. With so many fashionable, comfortable alternatives available,
              there is no excuse for Burberry to continue using dead, tortured
              animals in its designs."</p>
              <p><a title="Petition" href="http://www.bloodyburberry.com/features/chavs/index.asp">http://www.bloodyburberry.com/features/chavs/index.asp</a></p>
              <p>i guess some people might have signed this petition already, anyway if you haven't, don't hesitate, do it now! we must unite and fight for animal peace, guess some might think that it'd probably be futile.. ya if you don't do it then it'd be 100% futile.. this is the least that we can do for the animals.. besides it doesn't take you long..</p>
              <p>i really admire how some of the westerners are doing protests to fight for animal peace.. some of them have been doing protests for the past 3 years or more, yet bloody burberry is still ignoring it! if the demand doesn't stop, the killing will continue! the thing is to get more and more people involved! educate them to go against animal cruelty!</p>
              <p>besides signing this petition, you can write to it's ceo, telling her how disapoointed you are with their barbaric acts, urge them to stop using fur, you can find the ceo's email add here: <a title="ceo email" href="http://www.bloodyburberry.com/takeaction.asp">http://www.bloodyburberry.com/takeaction.asp</a> you can contribute more here: <a title="Contribute more" href="http://www.bloodyburberry.com/wycd.asp">http://www.bloodyburberry.com/wycd.asp</a> you can even write to the newspaper editors!</p>
              <p>Besides Burberry, we should also boycott these 2:</p>
              <p><a title="KFC" href="http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/">http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/</a></p>
              <p><a title="Mars" href="http://www.marscandykills.com/">http://www.marscandykills.com/</a></p>
              <p>these 2 are in the peta campaign list, there are many more of cos.. if you wanna help, go to the PETA website: <a title="Peta" href="http://www.peta.org/">http://www.peta.org/</a> to find out more.</p>
              <p>we must also not purchase animal tested products! this website lists those companies which do or not do animal testings:<a title="Against animal testing" href="http://www.caringconsumer.com/resources_companies.asp"> http://www.caringconsumer.com/resources_companies.asp</a> if your can, write to those companies which still carry out their animal tests!</p>
              <p>I hope everyone could help and promote cruelty-free! thank you! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I don't think it is misplaced at all. Of course there are a lot of
                  other people deserving compassion, but animals getting tortured to
                  death (literally) also deserves compassion. If we cannot do much to
                  help the animals, then at least small things like signing petition, not
                  supporting the shops, asking your friends not to support the shops.</p>
              <h1 style="margin: 0pt; font-size: 12px;">“We cannot do great things on this Earth, only small things with great love.” - Mother Theresa</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of
                  course, you should not just stop at animals but help whoever and
                  whatever you can, whether africans, christians, indian, or anybody. Compassion has no boundaries, does not choose or take sides.</p>

              <p>LOL</p>
              <p>interesting how my honest thoughts about hypocrisy can provoke such strong passionate retorts.</p>
              <p>indeed, where is the love?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, let me clarify. while i made my statement pointing out the obviously misplaced attention on animal rights while humans are suffering as well. i do not advocate that animals should be trodden upon and every kitten should have its ears stapled and drowned and every puppy be rammed by a car.</p>
              <p>i'm just pointing out (without sugarcoating my words) that, if you have so much love to give. i suggest you start by greeting the person you get into the lift with (i'm sure you don't do that), instead of shedding crocodile tears while you watch uppity ladies buying burberry. heck, if i don't put you down now, you'd probably start recruiting suicide bombers to take out macdonald's and kfc tomorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: having a lousy day, sorry guys. and yes. i'm a meat eater, i enjoy eating my chicken and duck and char siew rice, i enjoy burgers, and i enjoy kfc (i actually stopped eating kfc already), i don't enjoy watching animals being abused, and i have stopped kids from doing so when i see it in the street. i don't support burberry, simply because they're expensive and impractical.</p>
              <p>so i won't be throwing anyone's face today, thank you very much. you can dislodge your swollen head from your arse now, TS, its affecting your spelling.</p>

              <p>why do you keep accusing me of not caring for human beings? i care for animals as well as human beings! i dunno what are you talking about? your not talking sense, what does greeting people gotta do with this topic? are you on some drugs or something? or the "love" you mentioned is greeting everybody you see? your just not smart!</p>
              <p>and if you have so much love to give, what have you done to those suffering people you mentioned? the fact that you are gorging on meat is one of the main reasons why africa is starving in the first place.. why don't you f**king do something about this and not come here messing with other people's business?? shut up and get lost!!!!!!</p>

              <p>i'm a girl and i don't get provoked easily, but these kinda vermins just piss me off man.. showing no respects for the animals at all! thinking that he's got a more advanced brain than the animals, he can look down on them!</p>

              <p>What is the point of signing those petitions?</p>
              <p>Do you think you can stop Burberry from using fur? Burberry has established itself and leather and fur are symbols of luxury for europeans and americans and now it has transcended to Asians. Many fashion houses use furs too and they are expensive. in the first place, how many people in the world can afford US$14,000 mink fur bag from LV; how many people can afford US$100,000 Hermes alligator birkins; how many people can afford chinchilla fur coat?</p>
              <p>And since very few people can afford those lucury items, do you think those fashion houses will produce them in bulk?</p>
              <p>before you take your extreme actions, I suggest you analyze it carefully. The one you should fight against is those who make counterfeit lucury goods in China. They used more fur and leather than those fashion houses. And they sell it at very cheap price so people can afford those products.</p>
              <p>I guess you should not take PETA views blindly. PETA views are too extreme. There is even one quote from PETA activists: I would rather use my daughter to replace those mouses in drug experiments. I don't know how naive a person can be. so if you love animals, one thing you should do is to stop using all products that contain or make used of animals in the process including most cosmetics, drugs, leather and furs.</p>
              <p>So now my questions will be: Will you use those drugs that have been experimented on mice and in the course of experiment, hundreds of mice suffered terribly and died? You have this diseases and can only be cured with this drugs.</p>

              <p> and no, i'm not looking down on animals. i'm just looking down on stupid zealots. basically you. and you'd better wash your hands before giving me those slaps. goodness knows how many animals you've gratified with those hands in your cause for "freedom and justice"</p>

              <p>finally. someone who isn't blind to her raving lunancy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>good question. the drugs you use when you're sick are tested on animals. if the drugs don't work, the rat dies. anyone crying for that poor rat yet? i'm sure TS here isn't.</p>
              <p>how about her makeup kit? i heard that they use aborted fetuses to make those beauty powders. for all my barbaric flaws, at least i don't use make up.</p>
              <p>how about her careless usage of paper. DANG! she only loves animals. so who cares about those trees being chopped down for her to wipe her big fat arse when she's done pooping her vegetarian meals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh by the way. just because you're too blind from the sparkles from those baby cows' eyes. let me explain. how can you say you "care" about so many things, yet not greet your neighbour in the lift? if you're truly a real avatar of love. you'd have no problem loving everyone. your neighbour, the blind beggar playing at orchard road tunnel, even disgusting "vermins" like myself.</p>
              <p>don't delusionize your "love" la, you're just a hypocrite. it disgust me that you see propaganda in the form of an edited video, and immediately, you're a soldier of love and freedom for all animals alike.</p>
              <p>sure, love those animals, knock yourself out, just don't choke me with your self righteousness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>by the way. my family donate money to some tribes in africa to help out with food, and basic needs (because we see it as a worthy cause and we know that it won't help anyone if we stop gorging on meat, but we can help at least one person with the money we send). what have you done beside condemn burberry and rave like a psychopath, oh and using emotional blackmail on us little girl? (buddha frowns on those who uses burberry because they stink of the blood of innocent animals *rawr!!*)</p>
              <p>oh by the way, the rice you eat is probably tilled by a water buffalo who rather lived as a free citizen of china (or thailand, or whatever). how?</p>

              vermins? or do you only love those fuzzy wuzzy ones?</p>
              <p>here, grab a burger, the lack of iron's probably causing the
              hormonal imbalance resulting in your TOTALLY STUPID myopical
              obsession with oppressed chickens.</p>
              <p> and no, i'm not looking down on animals. i'm just looking
              down on stupid zealots. basically you. and you'd better wash your
              hands before giving me those slaps. goodness knows how many animals
              you've gratified with those hands in your cause for "freedom and
              justice"</p>

              <p>i acknowledge that you are trying to discourage us from using abusing animals or using products that involve abuse of animals. But you should not be too extreme. your tone sounds like PETA activists who can go extra mile to violence in order to bring their views.</p>
              <p>By signing those petitions, how legal will it be? You can sign 1000000 times and no one cares. your ID can be flasified in online community. And that is the reason why KFC and mars are still here. they don't even care about this emails. they have filter and regard those emails as scam. So why bother?</p>
              <p>Second, if we do not test it on animals, how do we know that the products are safe for our consumptions? Industries need to know the level of tolerance of certain foods or drugs in mice because mice have almost similar genetic compositions as humans. so whatever effects on mice may be similar on human. Almost all chemicals are tested using mice to determine the LD50 (lethal dose 50% = the minimum amount which can cause 50% chance of death). And those chemiclas are used in most of our household products from ammonia to vitamin C, table salt and botox.</p>
              <p>The best way is to boycott. but how many people can survive without meat? Most of us are blinded by luxury goods, so how many people have no lust on leather products (fur is not suitable in Singapore)?</p>
              <p>I guess we can just pray for those animals and hope that they can be reincarnated to human beings in the next life since they have face their bad karma now (by being tortured and killed, probably in the past life they had done something bad and now the bad karma is ripe)</p>
