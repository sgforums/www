              <p>i acknowledge that you are trying to discourage us from using
              abusing animals or using products that involve abuse of animals.
              But you should not be too extreme. your tone sounds like PETA
              activists who can go extra mile to violence in order to bring their
              views.</p>
              <p>By signing those petitions, how legal will it be? You can sign
              1000000 times and no one cares. your ID can be flasified in online
              community. And that is the reason why KFC and mars are still here.
              they don't even care about this emails. they have filter and regard
              those emails as scam. So why bother?</p>
              <p>Second, if we do not test it on animals, how do we know that the
              products are safe for our consumptions? Industries need to know the
              level of tolerance of certain foods or drugs in mice because mice
              have almost similar genetic compositions as humans. so whatever
              effects on mice may be similar on human. Almost all chemicals are
              tested using mice to determine the LD50 (lethal dose 50% = the
              minimum amount which can cause 50% chance of death). And those
              chemiclas are used in most of our household products from ammonia
              to vitamin C, table salt and botox.</p>
              <p>The best way is to boycott. but how many people can survive
              without meat? Most of us are blinded by luxury goods, so how many
              people have no lust on leather products (fur is not suitable in
              Singapore)?</p>
              <p>I guess we can just pray for those animals and hope that they
              can be reincarnated to human beings in the next life since they
              have face their bad karma now (by being tortured and killed,
              probably in the past life they had done something bad and now the
              bad karma is ripe)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i dun understand.. what wrong have i done? i'm just trying to help those poor souls out, can or cannot work, i don't wanna think so much, i just want to give it a try, and since there are so many successful cases, why not, right now that's all i can do to contribute, animals, they are all adorable! well if you want to pray, go ahead, give me a break.. i've already said, sign or dun, it's up to you, i'm not forcing you anyway.. if we don't think alike, no matter what i say or do, you won't care.. my aim here is not to argue.. thanks! grr..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>So in the end, your 'compassion' is only limited to animals, to be exact, animals that you can see. If you seriously care about animals, you shouldn't only care about them getting killed for their fur. You should also care about them in other areas, for example, their homes getting detroyed.</p>
              <p>So instead of saying boycott products with fur (which obviously you have to, you don't even have money for it currently) or being a vegetarian, you can also do the following to help those animals:</p>
              <p>1) Stop using electricity - As you know, we burn coal to produce electricity and this produce gases that destroy ozone layer and thus, changing the climate. Any changes in climate may destroy the natural habitat for the animals to survive.</p>
              <p>2) Boycott papers - As you should know papers come from trees and trees come from forest and forest is a necessity for the animals to survive. So, boycott it.</p>
              <p>3) Boycott vegetables and rices - As you know, some vegetables or rices come from farmers who burn the forest to grow their vegetables/rices, however, you do not know where do this vegetables/rices that are you eating comes from, so the only way to play safe is to boycott them all. Stop eating it for the love of animals.</p>
              <p>4) Don't buy or use anything that is made of plastic (yes, including your computer) - Plastic, as we all know, is one of the major pollutants of our time and it damages environment. Boycott it for the sake of animals.</p>
              <p>5) As you should have figure it by now, no matter what we do, we will harm the animals (and the earth's climate), the only way to save those poor animals is to stop living on earth. For the sake of those poor animals, please kill yourself now. Can you do it?</p>
              <p>Face it, your love is nothing but pretty words laced with hypocrisy (as dumbdumb have said). Your love for animals is limited to only those animals tortured in front of your eyes. In the end, it is just like passing by a beggar, thinking "Aww, poor thing", throw a few coins and think "I've done something good", it is only just to please your heart and make you feel good.</p>
              <p>One last thing - You asked us to email those company you claimed to boycott to voice out our opinion, so let me ask you, how many email have you sent to those companies you have claimed to boycott till now? 1 or 2 emails? or actually it is 0?</p>
              <p>In the end, it is not us who are childish or naive. If you think sending email/signing those online petition can stop animal cruelty. then the one who is acting childish/naive is you.</p>
              <p>P.S - Why should we feel ashame quarrelling with girl? Afterall, woman have been demanding for equal rights for a long time, didn't they? And also, please don't kill yourself because of no. 5.</p>

              <p>too bad chicky, i'm entitled to my opinion, and my opinion is that you only have 24 hours a day. helping out humans seems more important than crying over a beef steak.</p>
              <p>if you think that your "love" is so great. please. you're just a hypocrite. funny how you're not crying at people trapping pigeons, or killing rats, or culling chickens because of bird flu.</p>
              <p>your so-called "love" is fanatical, without solid grounding, without substance, and totally stink of hypocrisy. it's probably a product of eating too much chocolates and reading too much romance novels, easily fired up, and bored with. who knows? a month from now, you might start purchasing fur products or some other products which endanger animal lives. you want to know who really loves animals? one fine example is steve irwin (he eats meat too, yet he respect nature, he headed many projects in saving wildlives, he brings so much wildlife education and brings it to our attention in his own unique way). you? you're just an ugly shadow of a wannabe clamouring for attention to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i don't really give a flying hoot if you're a girl or a guy in this forum. if you're stupid, you're stupid, regardless of gender. why? you think just because you've got 2 jiggly bits, you fart sunshine and rainbow or something? pui!</p>

              <p>I think some of the things that TS said are practical.</p>
              <p>I certainly don't agree we cannot do anything about it, we can.</p>
              <p>Like I said previously "If we cannot do much
                                      to help the animals, then at least small things like signing
                                      petition, not supporting the shops, asking your friends not to
                                      support the shops." That's just an example.</p>

              <p>yes i totally agree with you, it's fair, some people are trying to fight for animal rights, some fighting for human rights.. all trying hard to make this world a better place to live in.. the reason i chose to help animals is because they are the most vulnerable, most easily exploited, yet they don't have a voice, don't even have a chance to voice out.. then there are those who love to fight and challenge people, for no reason at all, they just fight for the sake of fighting! it's a little similar to what i've learnt from my management classes on stakeholders, those of low power and low interest(in this case, high interest in fighting), we should tell them, but in this case, we should ignore them altogether!</p>
              <p>can you help to diable the commentbox please? this channel should be a very peaceful one, yet i had brought so much arguments and unhappiness.. my apologies! and it's gone way way off topic. my intention is clear, to raise awareness, sign or don't sign up to you, just hope that you can spread the message.. arguing is never my intention.</p>
              <p>well even tho i don't agree with those who are here just for the sole purpose of picking up a fight, have to thank them for indirectly increasing the number of viewers, of these viewers, i hope there are some like minds, even if it's just one single person, there is hope..</p>
