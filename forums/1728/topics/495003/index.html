              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Philip Deslippe Winter 2017</span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> </span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">tricycle</span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The story of how an Italian immigrant from Brooklyn helped to
              bring the dharma back to India</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhist history is full of tales of unusual converts, people
              who somehow connected with the dharma and dedicated their lives to it against
              all odds. But many of those remarkable biographies are all but lost in the
              vault of the past. One such figure was an Italian-born Brooklynite named
              Salvatore Cioffi, who grew up in a fervently Catholic household at the turn of
              the 20th century. Cioffi converted to Buddhism as a young man and later became
              the Venerable Lokanatha, a passionate missionary who spent decades traveling
              throughout Asia and around the world, preaching and converting followers.
              Lokanatha stood just five feet tall, but he cast a long shadow: he wielded
              influence over some of the most prominent and influential Buddhist leaders of
              modern Asia and was a catalyst of what may have been the largest mass religious
              conversion in human history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The future Buddhist monk was born on the day after Christmas
              in 1897 in the town of Carvinara, in the southern Italian province of Campania.
              In 1901, when Salvatore was 4 years old, his family immigrated to America and
              settled in Brooklyn. Even as new arrivals, the Cioffis were relatively
              affluent. Salvatore grew up speaking French as well as English and Italian, and
              he became an accomplished violinist who once performed a 45-minute recital for
              national radio. (In a 1947 interview, a quarter century after renouncing the
              world, he still recalled how difficult it had been to part with his violin.) A
              cousin, the sculptor Onorio Ruotolo, who counted Isamu Noguchi as a proteÌ�geÌ�
              and was known as “the Rodin of Little Italy,” introduced Cioffi to the world of
              art and ideas; later in life, he would credit Ruotolo for igniting his love of
              philosophy and his search for truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even as a young child, Cioffi was repulsed by meat, one of
              several qualities he later saw as proof that he had been a Buddhist in previous
              lives. At the age of 5, he found a pigeon with a broken wing and nursed it back
              to health. When his mother killed the bird and put it into a stew, the child
              refused to eat for several days until she swore never to kill a pigeon again.
              As a young man, Cioffi briefly enrolled in the College of Physicians and
              Surgeons at Columbia University, but withdrew because he refused to kill and
              dissect frogs and cats, a requirement of the program. After ordaining, he
              conducted lengthier hunger strikes, and he often fasted to draw attention to
              the cause of world peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For a short time after the First World War, Cioffi considered
              becoming a Franciscan monk. But his religious devotion had not yet gelled, and
              science had captured his attention. He earned a degree in chemistry from Cooper
              Union in Manhattan and went on to hold jobs as a chemist with companies such as
              Procter &amp; Gamble and Crucible Steel.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I READ THE BOOK. I
              BECAME A BUDDHIST.”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One day, a coworker lent him a large volume of Buddhist
              texts. Cioffi was enthralled, particularly by the Dhammapada, and he later
              remarked simply, “I read the book. I became a Buddhist.” Like other American
              sympathizers and converts to Buddhism of the period such as Paul Carus and
              Eleanor Hiestand-Moore, Cioffi found that the Buddha’s teaching made moral and
              philosophical sense, while it also fit comfortably into a modern scientific framework.
              “Self-research is the highest research,” he noted decades after his conversion.
              “From chemistry, the science of analysis, I passed on to Buddhism, the religion
              of analysis.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Embracing what he saw as the democratic and rational nature
              of Buddhism, Cioffi saw how it ran counter to the hierarchy and ritualism he
              perceived in the Roman Catholicism of his childhood. But his burgeoning
              interest in the dharma strained his relationship with his devoutly religious
              family (including his brother Raphael, a priest who eventually became an
              influential monsignor). Cioffi moved into an apartment of his own and began to
              spend all of his free time at the New York Public Library reading anything he
              could find about Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the time he was in his mid-20s, Cioffi had chosen his
              fate. He wrote a note to his family and boarded a steamer ship, traveling first
              to England, then to India. After visiting the Buddhist pilgrimage sites of
              Bodghaya and Sarnath, he went to Sri Lanka, where he lived as a novitiate
              before taking formal Buddhist monastic vows in 1925 and receiving the name
              Javana Tikkha. He then went to Rangoon, but (according to his letters) a
              combination of missionary longing and some degree of cultural discomfort in
              Burma led him to return to the land of his birth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Once back in Italy, the newly ordained monk tried to live as
              a traditional bhikkhu, meditating in solitude and going door to door for alms.
              But the Italians he encountered were not prepared for a mendicant Buddhist
              monastic in their midst, and he was repeatedly arrested for vagrancy and deemed
              a “harmless religious maniac.” Eventually, authorities took him to Naples,
              where he was placed under the care of relatives and forced to wear Western
              clothes instead of robes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Naples, Cioffi turned to one of the only locals who might
              understand his aspirations—a professor of geology named Giuseppe De Lorenzo,
              who was also an Orientalist scholar and early popularizer of Buddhism in Italy.
              Cioffi arrived unannounced at De Lorenzo’s office and, in his American-accented
              Italian, presented himself as a Buddhist monk. De Lorenzo listened to the story
              of Cioffi’s conversion, travels, and current dilemma, and in the end advised
              him to go back to India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cioffi’s relatives in Italy, as well as his family in
              Brooklyn, hoped he might channel his religious impulses back to the Catholic
              Church and join a Franciscan monastery. In an attempt to prevent his departure
              for India, they convinced local authorities to deny Cioffi the official pass
              required to leave Naples. But after several months of dispute, culminating in a
              weeklong hunger strike during which Cioffi threatened to starve himself to
              death, the family relented and he left Naples.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With a convert’s zeal, the young monk resolved to travel in
              the manner of the historical Buddha, returning to India on foot with little
              more than his robes and begging bowl. His letters to De Lorenzo describe an
              astounding journey of 14 months and more than 5,000 miles, from Italy through
              Switzerland, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria,
              Iraq, and Iran. Along the way, in addition to making pilgrimage stops in Assisi
              and Jerusalem, Cioffi underwent numerous hardships: hospitalizations for
              illness, arrests by French police and Syrian soldiers, and many assaults and
              robberies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On one occasion as he walked south through Turkey, a pair of
              thieves, convinced he was a spy, abducted him and threatened to slit his
              throat. He described the event to De Lorenzo in a letter: “My only weapon was
              metta, lovingkindness, given to me by Buddha Gotama. I sat down therefore on
              the ground cross-legged, plunging myself in meditation on Metta and beaming out
              all my compassion toward the two robbers. They continued to howl furiously, but
              I remained in silence.” The thieves let Cioffi go, but the event stayed with
              him for decades as a dramatic example of how Buddhist compassion could
              transform even the direst of circumstances.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the time Cioffi arrived in India in 1928, he may have
              known he was not yet up to the task of a global missionary. Instead, he
              undertook several years of practice and study in Sri Lankan monasteries and at
              Buddhist holy sites near the Himalayas. He spent long periods in silence and
              followed some of the ascetic practices known as the dhutangas, including
              sleeping upright in a seated position.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During a stay in Rangoon, a monk reordained Cioffi and gave
              him the name Lokanatha. According to his own and others’ observations,
              Lokanatha emerged a different person in both name and spirit. Acquaintances
              alluded to his “spiritual radiance” and several accounts from travelogues to
              Burma mention a popular consensus that after this time Lokanatha had psychic
              powers. (Lokanatha himself mentioned in a speech that he had the ability to
              read another’s thoughts.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A MISSIONARY EMERGES</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the next three years, Lokanatha organized and led
              missionary expeditions. His ambitious plan was the same for each: to arouse
              interest and gather together enthusiastic monks in different locations, then
              travel on foot to northern India, where they would be trained so that they
              could ultimately fan out across the world and spread Buddhism to humanity. In
              two pamphlets, “Celestial India” and “Establishing the Sangha in the West,”
              Lokanatha described the missions in dramatic terms: his monks were
              “lion-hearted,” living out the motto “Victory or Death!” They would take the
              dharma across the globe and thereby abolish war forever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first expedition to northern India began in Burma in
              1933, the next in Thailand the following year (with the patronage of the king);
              the third and final expedition left from Sri Lanka in 1935. In interviews with
              the press, Lokanatha described lofty and sometimes absurd goals for his
              missions, predicting, for example, that he himself would convert the Italian
              dictator Mussolini to the dharma. But while Lokanatha had zeal and faith, he
              did not have the organizational skill to carry out such massive endeavors. On
              each of the three expeditions, the group’s numbers rapidly dwindled once they
              encountered the harsh realities of illness, bad weather, physical discomfort,
              and internal disagreements.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although Lokanatha’s “lion-hearted monks” did not accomplish
              their goals, nevertheless his missions sparked considerable interest, and in
              the context of anticolonial Buddhist revivalism that had been active since the
              19th century, a Western convert who publicly extolled the dharma was viewed by
              many Asians as a sign of victory. Participants and admirers of Lokanatha’s
              tours went on to become prominent religious and political figures including
              Aung San, widely considered the creator of the modern Burmese state (and father
              of Myanmar’s state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi); the in influential Thai
              jurist and politician Sanya Dharmasakti; and the Welsh-born Thai Buddhist
              teacher known as Ajahn Panya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After the three unfinished tours, Lokanatha continued
              traveling in Asia, preaching, publishing, attempting to convert non-Buddhists,
              and encouraging the revitalization of Buddhist practice. In Burma, he helped
              revive the traditional practice of meditating in cremation grounds and
              converted a large group of tribal Karen people to Buddhism. Lokanatha was also
              a committed vegetarian, and spent considerable time dissuading people from
              killing or eating animals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1939, as Lokanatha was finishing an account of his Asian
              travels and planning a major missionary trip to the West, the Second World War
              broke out. Almost immediately, British authorities in India confined him to a
              prisoner-of-war camp. True to form, Lokanatha managed to convert some of his
              fellow prisoners to Buddhism. He also staged a dramatic 96-day hunger strike
              over his religious rights as a Buddhist and was force-fed by his jailers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is not known exactly why Lokanatha was imprisoned. Some
              speculate that his agitation on behalf of Buddhist monks in Burma made him a
              target for British colonial authorities. More likely, his Italian background
              provoked suspicion that he was a Mussolini sympathizer, loyal to the Axis
              powers. He pleaded with three of his siblings in New York to send an affidavit
              that would prove his American citizenship and enable him to return to the
              United States. When they all insisted that he convert back to Catholicism
              first, however, he remained a prisoner for the remainder of the war—a long and
              grueling six years that nearly killed him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">WORLD TOUR</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The horrors of war and the threat of nuclear destruction in
              its aftermath left a deep impression on Lokanatha. He became convinced that
              faith in science alone would only bring more suffering to the world, and that
              humanity needed Buddhism more desperately than ever. In the fall of 1946, just
              a year after the war’s end, one of Lokanatha’s converts, a Punjabi doctor based
              in Burma named R. L. Soni, helped organize a large public meeting for the
              dissemination of Buddhism. Shortly after, Soni formed the Buddhist Foreign
              Mission, nominating Lokanatha to be its “Dhamma-Ambassador” on a world tour.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In many ways, Lokanatha was an ideal candidate to represent
              Buddhism on the world stage. Though a Theravada monk, he embraced all Buddhist
              traditions, and between his conversion and his frequent travels, he belonged to
              no single country or sect but was nonetheless unquestionably Buddhist. As a
              Westerner by birth and education, he was adept at describing Buddhism as a
              modern, scientific, and rational religion. Moreover, he was profoundly
              enthusiastic about his mission. He frequently told Asian supporters that
              instead of exporting such “worthless material” as rubber and tin, they were now
              entering the “Truth-exporting” business of their “most valued possession”: Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lokanatha’s missionary vision was rooted in two core ideas.
              The first was that humanity was poised to make a shift toward Buddhism; the
              second, that large-scale religious conversion could happen through small
              strategic efforts, like catalysts in a chemical chain reaction. He was
              convinced that “once intellectual people accept Buddhism, the masses will
              follow.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At first Lokanatha set his sights on Europe as the site for
              mass conversion, but as time went on he pinned his hopes on the United States.
              “My target is America,” he said in the Philippines at the onset of his world
              tour. “By converting America the whole world will become Buddhist.” He had
              unwavering confidence in the role that he himself would play in that spiritual
              renaissance. He had been named Salvatore Natale—“savior is born”—in honor of
              his birth the day after Christmas. When he received his final ordination name,
              Lokanatha, which translates roughly as “lord” or “savior,” he noted with
              satisfaction how its meaning echoed that of his birth name.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On the “Lightning Preaching Tour,” as the first stage of this
              global mission trip was called, Lokanatha visited several Asian countries
              before traveling to northern California, where he was hosted by Japanese
              American Buddhist groups. From there, he went to Los Angeles, where a
              well-known socialite named Gypsy Buys and her husband, Jerry, invited him to
              stay at their Beverly Hills estate, Falcon Lair. Lokanatha believed this would
              be the ideal base from which to launch an American Buddhist mission.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But his stay in Los Angeles quickly turned into a public
              farce. Gypsy and Jerry were as eccentric as they were rich. Falcon Lair was the
              former home of Rudolph Valentino, and Lokanatha was drafted to participate in
              an elaborate seÌ�ance to contact the dead screen idol’s spirit. Surrounded by
              some 30 mystics and mediums, Lokanatha was the guest of honor during the event,
              at which attendees claimed to smell Valentino’s perfume and see his dog. After
              hearing about a traditional Burmese custom of showing respect to Buddhist
              monks, Jerry staged a photo-op of Lokanatha walking across the hair of women as
              they knelt before him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The less sensational newspaper clippings that Lokanatha sent
              to sympathetic relatives show him keeping up a frantic schedule in the United
              States, where he spoke to over five thousand people at colleges, civic
              organizations, and churches in less than three weeks. In the March 5, 1949
              issue of The New Yorker, a “Talk of the Town” article described a visit to
              Lokanatha as he led a dozen people in meditation at the Cornish Arms Hotel in
              Manhattan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Before he left America, Lokanatha gave an emphatically upbeat
              report to newspapers of his 18 months there. The trip was a “great success,”
              and after obtaining “quite a number of converts,” he declared that the United
              States was “ripe for conversion to Buddhism.” One reporter wryly noted that the
              monk’s hyperbole sounded like Soviet propaganda proclaiming the imminent
              collapse of the West.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">THE DALIT BUDDHIST
              CONVERSION</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although Lokanatha did not yet know it, India, not the United
              States, would offer the fertile ground for the large-scale conversion he longed
              for. In 1935, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the Indian jurist, social reformer, and
              advocate for the Dalit, or “untouchable,” caste, had caused a stir throughout
              the subcontinent when he announced that Dalits could be free only if they
              severed their connections with Hinduism. “Though I have been born a Hindu,”
              said Ambedkar, “I will not die a Hindu.” In the wake of his pronouncement,
              representatives of many faiths, including Sikhs, Christians, and Muslims, made
              direct appeals to Ambedkar to convert to their tradition (whereby they would
              gain the legions of his Dalit admirers).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lokanatha saw a golden opportunity. He made vigorous attempts
              to bring Ambedkar into the Buddhist fold and twice traveled to speak with
              Ambedkar personally, in 1935 and 1936. He even published a pamphlet entitled
              “Buddhism Will Make You Free!!!” in which he positioned Buddhism as a casteless
              alternative to “Brahmanism.” Lokanatha’s lobbying continued by proxy through
              his converts, including Dr. Soni, one of Ambedkar’s close associates. Finally,
              in 1956, after two decades of deliberation, Ambedkar chose to become a Buddhist
              during a visit to Dr. Soni’s home in Burma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Back in India, in what may have been the largest mass
              conversion in history, Ambedkar proceeded to convert hundreds of thousands of
              his Dalit followers. At the time it was believed that Buddhism had largely
              vanished from its birthplace, surviving only in other parts of the world. The
              conversion of Ambedkar and his followers dramatically reintroduced Buddhism to
              India. Lokanatha played such a central role in the event that Ambedkar looked
              to him as a potential teacher and catechist for the predicted half-million new
              Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lokanatha kept up with his feverish activity for nearly
              another decade, but in late 1965, a sore on his forehead became cancerous, and
              he died the following year in the Burmese hill station town of Maymyo at the
              age of 69. His body was given an elaborate state funeral at the Shwedagon
              Pagoda in Rangoon, attended by military and government leaders as well as a
              crowd of lay admirers.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although he is almost entirely absent from historical
              accounts, the Venerable Lokanatha was one of the most significant Buddhists of
              the 20th century, and his missionary efforts helped shape the practice and
              demographics of Buddhism into the 21st century. A photograph of the short
              Italian American monk still hangs in a temple in Maymyo, and because of him,
              there are an estimated eight million Ambedkarite Buddhists in India today.</span></p>
