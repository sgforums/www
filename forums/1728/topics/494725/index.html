              <p> Sorry for replying to this topic with a question. I've been quite bothered by this. Basically, I've read teachings from <span style='background-color: #e1ebf2; color: #333333; font-family: "Lucida Grande", "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;'>Master Hsuan Hua who said that a person would go through rebirth as multiple animals or plants simultaneously due to his 'soul' being fragmented (see below). In some other articles I read, he mentioned that these fragmented souls would need to join together again to take rebirth at a higher forms (e.g. multiple roosters' souls need to be integrated together to reborn as a horse, then multiple horse's souls then integrate to be a human.)</span></p>

These organisms are fragments of what was once an animal.<strong> The soul of a human being at death may split up to become many animals. One person can become about ten animals. That's why animals are so stupid. The soul of an animal can split up and become, in its smallest division, an organism or plant. </strong>The feelings which plants have, then, are what separated from the animals's soul when it split up at death. Although the life force of a large number of plants may appear sizeable, it is not as great as that of a single animal or a single mouthful of meat. Take, for example, rice: tens of billions of grains of rice do not contain as much life force as a single piece of meat. If you open your Five Eyes you can know this at a glance. If you haven't opened your eyes, no matter how one tries to explain it to you, you won't understand. No matter how it's explained, you won't believe it, because you haven't been a plant!</span></p>

Thus, there is a difference between eating plants and eating animals. What is more, plants have very short lifespans. The grass, for example, is born in the spring and dies within months. Animals live a long time. If you don't kill them, they will live for many years. Rice, regardless of conditions, will only live a short time. And so, if you really look into it, there are many factors to consider, and even science hasn't got it all straight." (Buddha Root Farm, 64)</span></p>

              Harrell (1979:521) concludes, "Almost every number from one to a dozen has
              at one time or another been proposed as the correct one." The most
              commonly believed numbers of "souls" in a person are one, two, three,

              the cemetery, they think of it in the grave; and when they go on shamanistic
              trips, they think of it in the yin world. Because the contexts are separate,
