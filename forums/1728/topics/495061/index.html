              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Washington Post hints at big changes afoot for Tibetan
              Buddhism. Is there a local story in that? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ira Rifkin November 14, 2017 GetReligion</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibet ceased to be an independent nation nearly six decades
              ago. Moreover, the likelihood is that Tibet — birthplace of the Dalai Lama and
              home to a unique and dramatic form of Buddhist practice — will remain under
              Chinese domination for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In short, the Dalai Lama’s immense international popularity
              (primarily in Western democracies) and the good deal of advocacy on behalf of
              Tibet by Western supporters over the decades has, politically speaking,
              achieved virtually nothing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why’s that? Because China’s massive economic and military
              power trumps, on the international stage, any sympathy for Tibet in Western
              capitals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If that’s not enough, there’s now a new – and surprising –
              threat to Tibetan nationalism. The Washington Post wrote about it last month.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That threat is Indian citizenship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">India, home to some 122,000 Tibetan exiles, earlier this year
              decided to grant many of them Indian citizenship. Until now officially
              stateless, the Tibetans who accept Indian citizenship will gain a slew of
              government perks withheld from non-citizens. That includes an Indian passport,
              allowing them to leave India and travel the world with far greater ease than
              previously.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That raises at least three questions. One’s political, one’s
              religious and one’s journalistic. As usual, the three are interrelated. To
              begin:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">* What does accepting Indian citizenship mean for the Tibetan
              national movement?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">* What impact will this have on Tibetan Buddhism?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">* Three, why did the Post story not address question two –
              given how central Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism is to Tibetan cultural and
              political identity?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yes, we're talking about the possibility of a slow but
              eventual assimilation into Indian cultural identity. (Tibetan exiles living in
              other nations, primarily in Europe and North America, can already get
              citizenship.) Here’s a pertinent extract from the Post story:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For years, the Tibetan movement has hung its hopes on
              international support for its exiles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Heart-rending stories of Tibetans walking through icy
              mountain passes to reach India — their land seized, their monasteries razed,
              their prayers silenced — buttressed U.S. efforts to isolate China during the
              Cold War and have continued to rake up support on college campuses and outside
              Chinese embassies worldwide. “Free Tibet” long ago became a familiar cry.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But without a stateless population to [fuel] the sympathies
              of Western democracies, some fear that the Tibetan struggle could crumble.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“What’s happened is that an entire nationality, so to speak,
              has given up on its nation,” said Giriraj Subramanium, a lawyer in Delhi who
              has argued more than a dozen Tibetans’ cases for passports in the Delhi High
              Court. “Tibet is over” is a common refrain among his clients, he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The piece goes on to explain that the citizenship issue has
              divided the Indian Tibetan community between hardcore nationalists and those
              opting for what they see as a more pragmatic solution to their statelessness;
              often younger Tibetans. It also notes that so far relatively few exiles have
              actually opted for citizenship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That’s likely to change, I believe. Here’s why.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lama, now 82, has already relinquished his status
              as Tibet’s political leader (he remains Tibetan Buddhism’s spiritual leader)
              and has even said he very well could be the last in his lineage because
              Tibetans may no longer need a figure such as himself in the modern world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">(Dalai Lama is a title; the current Dalai Lama, Tenzin
              Gyatso, is the 14th in the lineage, dating from 1578. Tibetan Buddhist beliefs
              regard the Dalai Lama as a reincarnation of his predecessor.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Impermanence – the belief that nothing is static in the
              material universe, that change is the only constant – is a key philosophical
              and religious principle in Buddhism, including the Tibet form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Barred from their homeland and absent their traditional
              religious and cultural moorings, will exiled Tibetans, now citizens of India
              and other democracies, assimilate at increasingly faster rates? Their doing so
              makes perfect sense if constant change is a cornerstone of your traditional
              world view, after all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To be clear, It’s not about forgetting Tibet so much as it is
              accepting — understanding on a deep level – that everything in this world is in
              constant flux; the past is gone and the future is unknown. There’s only today –
              this moment, actually -- so make the best of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Post piece ignored this angle, focusing, as it did,
              solely on the story’s political side. But it's key and can't be overlooked when
              discussing Tibet and its people, for whom religion is culture and culture is
              all about centuries of religious practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Stories about the possibility of Tibetans receiving Indian
              citizenship have been kicking around for years. Here’s a piece from 2013 that
              ran in Tricycle, a leading American Buddhist publication. It advocated for
              citizenship as a realistic solution to the Indian exile problem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This Times of India story from earlier this year sums up how
              the citizenship issue has been handled by the Indian government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here’s one more question. This one’s for journalists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If the practice of Tibetan Buddhism is changed by changes in
              Tibetan culture, what might that mean for the many Western practitioners of
              Tibetan Buddhism? Will their focus on Tibetan culture lessen?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Will Tibetan Buddhism in the West transform similarly to
              Mindfulness meditation, drawn from South Asian Buddhist practice, by dropping
              its ethnic flavor?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If you cover an area with Tibetan Buddhist centers – here’s
              one list (others are also available on the web) of U.S. Tibetan centers to get
              you started – why not drop by and ask about this?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If you're fortunate, you may even find an ethnic Tibetan
              there. He’ll (yeah, they're generally men) be the one teaching the Westerners
              Vajrayana meditation practices.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the way, other than the Post story cited above, my online
              search turned up nothing recently published on this topic by an American news
              outlet. Might this be the time to change that?</span></p>

              <p>Tibet to China is akin to a buffer state against India. Moreover, the Dalai Lama is hosted by India. Remember, China and India fought wars against each other. Sikkim, Mustang is firmly under India.</p>
              <p>And Bhutan is toeing the line between the two giants now. There are currently border tension over China building a highway.</p>
              <p>Also explains why China and Pakistan are staunch allies.</p>
              <p>Two large Tibetan communities, both subsisting on their predominant culture. One Indian, the other Chinese. Which, then will be the "real" Tibetan identity gew generation's later.</p>
              <p>As for Tibetan Buddhism, as long there are lineage holdersand tulku system, the face of Tibetan Buddhism will stay quite a while. While context of dharma talks maybe different, owing to current and future mindsets. </p>
