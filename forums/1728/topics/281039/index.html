Nevertheless conventional language is grossly inadequate to describe a world void of a subject-object dicthomy.  Essentially the world of 'what is' is a world of spontaneous happening, it is a world of vivid clear happening that never remains.  Words like 'rebirth' instead of 'reincarnation', 'karma' and 'emptiness' are invented for such purpose.  Religion like Buddhism is more equiped with words to describe such a world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The entire concept of 'Self' is learnt, live as if 'we' never existed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
