              one of the country's oldest and most cherished traditions – Thanksgiving. 
              VOA Senior Analyst Victor Morales examines the history of this quintessential
              American holiday and what it means in the 21st century.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Four centuries ago, bands of dissenters set
              sail from England to the New World in search of religious freedom.  One
              group of Protestant worshipers arrived in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts
              in late-1620. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">They suffered great hardships during their
              first winter in America.  Nearly half of them starved or froze to
              death.  But with help from the Native Americans, the Pilgrim colonists learned
              what foods to eat and how to build homes to withstand the elements.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thanksgiving Confusion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That first "thanksgiving" was a
              harvest festival in the autumn of 1621 – less than a year after the colonists
              arrived.  It's thought that some 50 Pilgrims and 90 Indians attended the
              celebration, and ate many of the same foods Americans now consider traditional
              Thanksgiving fare – including native vegetables and roasted turkey.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But for the colonists, that first celebration
              was more secular than it was religious.  For the most part, the three-day
              event was one of feasting and games.  And it was never repeated. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A party to give special thanks to God would
              have been unthinkable for the strictly religious colonists, or Puritans, as
              they were often called, who focused their energies on the Christian Sabbath,
              not on “man-made” days of worship.  In fact, the first thanksgiving
              observance to be declared by the Pilgrims occurred in the summer of 1623 to
              give specific thanks to God for ending a drought, and it was a relatively
              somber event.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pilgrims picked as 'original
              Americans'</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So what accounts for the Thanksgiving
              confusion?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"We need a history that's going to
              represent the righteousness of the American way,” said historian John Kemp,
              colonial training specialist at</span><a href="https://www.plimoth.org/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #132fbe;'>Plimoth Plantation</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">in
              Plymouth, Massachusetts.   Intellectuals of the mid-to-late 19th and
              early 20th centuries “picked out the Pilgrims because they seemed a little more
              'American' than anyone else.  And they seemed better than others,” said
              Kemp.  “If you look at Jamestown [Virginia], which, in fact, was the first
              English colony – well, those guys had slaves.  And in the Victorian period
              [beginning in the mid-1800s], the slave states in the U.S. were seceding [from
              the Union just prior to the Civil War] and stirring-up nasty things.  So
              you didn't want your 'original' Americans to be Jamestown settlers. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"And then when you looked at New
              England, the people up in Boston had persecuted Quakers and actually put some
              of them to death and burned people they accused of being witches.  The
              Plymouth people had never done that.  Therefore, people such as Henry
              Wadsworth Longfellow, Daniel Webster, people who were writing school books, and
              artists, but mainly people in the Boston area – a lot of historians at that
              time had a Harvard University pedigree – built-up this whole notion that
              America came from the Mayflower [the Pilgrim's ship] and the Pilgrims,"
              Kemp said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The meaning of Thanksgiving</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Victorian image of Thanksgiving served
              not only as a mirror on the nation's past, but also as a window through which
              Americans viewed their destiny.  But many historians are quick to point
              out that by the end of the 19th century, most of America's Indians had been
              forced to live on reservations, and that religious tolerance and racial
              equality were still decades away. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And critics argue that today, Thanksgiving
              often means little more than watching football games, over eating and the
              beginning of the Christmas shopping season.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Boston-based historian and cultural education
              consultant Solomon Davidoff, whose Jewish ancestors emigrated to the United
              States from Eastern Europe, said Thanksgiving, nonetheless, remains an
              important part of American culture. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"If you look at the influx of immigrants
              to the U.S., especially in the late-1800s and early-1900s, when Thanksgiving as
              a national holiday was really getting its start – along with July 4th [U.S.
              Independence Day] – it was seen as the quintessential American holiday,” said
              Davidoff. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“So definitely, you can see that there is
              more of an observance of Thanksgiving in being a day for those who have
              emigrated to the United States to give particular thanks for the United States'
              existence," he said.  "When I was a child, I had friends who wondered,
              'Do you celebrate Thanksgiving?'  And we would say, 'Yes,' because we are
              Americans and we have pride in this country and in what this country is and in
              what this country has done for us."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Special meaning for immigrants</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Because Thanksgiving was first observed by
              immigrants, I wanted to get a better idea of what it means to people from other
              lands who have settled in America.  I asked some of my colleagues here at
              the Voice of America what Thanksgiving means to them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“I come from a Buddhist tradition.  We
              don't have 'God' and we don't have 'God' to thank,” said Nittaya Maphungphong
              of VOA’s Thai Service.  “But having been in this country for so long,
              Thanksgiving gives me a chance to pause and reflect and to be really thankful
              for all of the things that I have right now – my friends, my job, my family, my
              dogs.   What else can I say?" said Maphungphong.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“To me, Thanksgiving is the first opportunity
              to celebrate family and friends outside of religion,” said Maria de los Angeles
              Franco of VOA’s Spanish Branch.  “It is a chance to say 'thank you' to
              them for their existence, for what they do for you, and for what they mean to
              you," said Franco.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As for me, Thanksgiving has several
              meanings.  I take pause to thank God for my family and friends, and for
              all that I have received during the past year.  But I also remember the
              Pilgrims who had the courage to come to this land to practice their faith
              freely, and the millions of people from all over the world who have come to the
              United States since that time and made our nation strong.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Like most people born here in the United
              States, my ancestors are from somewhere else – in my case, from Europe and
              Latin America.  And today, I'm thankful that I can wish all of you the
              peace, prosperity and freedom that this Thanksgiving Day has come to represent
              for so many Americans.</span></p>
