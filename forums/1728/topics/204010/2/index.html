            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">A person will only get angry when he identifies someone else supposed stupidness with who they are. But who they are has nothing got to do with stupidness, just like if someone hits you with the stick, you shouldn't get angry with the stick. Whatever things they say or behave, the nature of it is "as-it-is", it is merely a form of conditioning, it is conditioned arising. But due to the ignorance of the mind we label them as "stupid" and such and react egoically at that.<br><br>And due to the ego and mind's limitation they will certainly identify something with the person and pass conceptual judgements upon them. Why? Because we are attached to the 3 minds and 4 forms. In Diamond Sutra, sentient beings are always attached to the 3 minds and 4 forms, what are the 4 forms and 3 times?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">[1] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped. (ii) After this moment, the present becomes past and also cannot be grasped. (iii) The future is not here yet and therefore cannot be grasped too.<br><br>[2] The four forms: Form - Characteristics; (i) Everybody has an ego, this is the ego form. (ii) When we see another person, we perceive the human form. (iii) When thoughts arise in our mind, we perceive the sentient being form. (iv) The continuity of these thoughts through time gives rise to the age form.</span><br><br>The four forms is rooted in Subject/Object dualism, based on identification, and based on time. It grasps at the 'form' and appearance of other persons, and thus react egoically. The reason for this is ignorance, the 7th consciousness (of self and dualism) at work.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How quick we are to form an opinion of a person, to come to a conclusion about them. It is satisfying to the egoic mind to label another human being, to give them a conceptual identity, to pronounce righteous judgment upon them.<br><br>Every human being has been conditioned to think and behave in certain ways - conditioned genetically as well as by their childhood experiences and their cultural environment.<br><br>That is not who they are, but that is who they appear to be. When you pronounce judgment upon someone, you confuse those conditioned mind patterns with who they are. To do that is in itself a deeply conditioned and unconscious pattern. You give them a conceptual identitiy, and that false identity becomes a prison not only for the other person but also for you.<br><br>To let go of judgment does not mean that you don't see what they do. It means that you recognise their behavior as a form of conditioning, and you see it and accept it as that. You don't construct an identitiy out of it for that person.<br><br>That liberates you as well as the other person from identification with conditioning, with form, with mind. The ego then no longer runs your relationships.<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, Stillness Speaks</span><br><br>If we can see 'all sentient beings are Equal', then we see all sentient being's buddha nature and sees them as future Buddhas. Then we ourselves have transcended the ego, whereas sentient beings are still caught up in the dream of situations, people and ego, caught up in notions of right or wrong (ren2 wo3 shi4 fei1). Meaning caught up in samsara.<br><br></div></blockquote>u shouldnt post such a complicated post to reply his question. guess his just too stupid to understand wad u wrote. for some reasons, evry1 is angry now because we see the threadstarted name.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
