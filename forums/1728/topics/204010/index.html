This is, that is, there is no thingness in things, all things are empty.<br><br>And I don't quite understand what you mean by 'seeing people as things'. You need to explain what you mean by this.</div>

Anger doesn't solve any problem, but will bring yourself down to their level.<br><br>Buddha is far more clever and more wisdom than his disciple, but he never get angry with any of them.<br>Having say that, some enlightened master sometimes have the angry look when scolding his disciple, although deep down in their heart, they are very compassionate. They know in certain situation to certain people, they need to be strict in order to teach them well.<br><br>A clever person can see other's mistake more easily, that is when you need compassion to control yourself. If you are able to do so, you will gain wisdom very soon.<br><br>Imagine how ksitigarbha bodhisatva will feel, after he save the hell beings and teach them dharma, they reborn into human realm or other better realms. Many lifes later, the same batch of people go down to hell again. Will he get angry, no, because he is bodhisatva, has great compassion.<br>If want to practise bodhisatva path, you must have compassion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">i think i meant not taking them personally</div></blockquote>I see. Ok as to your first question whether we should see people as 'things', you seem to imply seeing them as 'inanimate things'. Sentient beings are "things", but unlike things like tables, or keyboard, they are not inanimate things, meaning they have feelings, emotions, etc.<br><br>Therefore knowing this, it is only appropriate that when we talk to them we must be mindful not to hurt their feelings, or make them angry, or etc. We should have have compassion for them, their sufferings, and say things that will give them calmness.<br><br>What is 'Pu2 Sa4' (Bodhisattva)? It is 'Jue, You Qing'. Having compassion but also aware. Bodhisattvas have compassion towards all sentient beings, but they are not caught forms and appearances and emotions, notions of self and others, notions of right and wrong, because they are 'Aware'. So naturally when we are mindful/aware we will not take things 'personally', if it means having egoic reaction to people and situations.</div>
