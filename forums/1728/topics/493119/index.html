              Did We Learn? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Lt. Colonel James G.
              Zumwalt, USMC (Ret.) December 12, 2016 Accuracy In Media</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In endeavoring to identify a scintilla of logic related to
              events emerging from the Ohio State University attack in which Somali refugee
              Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, tried to kill pedestrians, first attempting mass
              slaughter by running over them with his car and then by jumping out to attack
              them with a butcher knife purchased for this purpose, a thread of logic
              emerges. To best discern it, one need consider the following:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1  According to his own Facebook entry, Artan acted out
              of anger his fellow Muslims were being killed in Buddhist-majority Burma,
              writing, “I can’t take it anymore.” So, since fellow Muslims were dying at the
              hands of Buddhists, Artan felt compelled to kill Americans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2  Former Republican presidential candidate and Ohio
              Gov. John Kasich proferred, despite Artan’s declaration, “We may never totally
              find out why this person did what they did or why they snapped … we may never
              find out.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3  While several victims were wounded during the attack,
              the only reason none was killed was the quick action of a campus police officer
              who shot Artan dead before he could inflict any fatalities. Yet, despite her
              son’s murderous rampage, Artan’s mother, just before her son’s funeral,
              lamented he had been killed “for no reason.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">4  Despite the Muslim attacker’s declared motivation for
              his actions, despite a declaration by ISIS he was acting in the name of his
              religion and despite an established track record of Muslims attacking
              non-Muslims, both in the U.S. and Europe, the White House urges us not to
              “increase our suspicion of people who practice a particular religion.”
              Accordingly, President Barack Obama refused to link Artan’s acts to radical
              Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For anyone unable to grasp the common thread of logic in all
              this, it is the following: No one has used it to link Artan’s terrorist attack
              to Islam!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We can actually take this lack of logic further.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After the attack, Fox news correspondent Tucker Carlson
              interviewed Georgetown University’s Muslim professor Engy Abdelkader, asking
              her how one goes “from refugee to ISIS sympathizer in two years.” As a college
              professor and as a Muslim, Abdelkader’s answer was not surprising: Islamophobes
              are a driving force behind terrorism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Carlson queried whether a peaceful Muslim community should
              do some soul-searching on the issue, the professor would have none of it.
              Again, unsurprisingly, she sought to take the spotlight off Islam, claiming the
              anti-Muslim bias known as Islamophobia causes Muslims to suffer “cultural
              homelessness” so that they do not identify with their host country. Furthermore,
              she suggested, the greater terrorist threat was not posed by Muslims but by
              “white supremist groups and right-wing extremists.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Carlson disputed a terrorist threat Abdelkader falsely
              offered as fact – pointing out we have “had an awful lot of Americans killed
              and injured by Islamic terror in the last eight years” – and, thus, whether it
              was unfair to blame Artan’s violence on his victims, the professor responded,
              “Absolutely not!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She credited the majority of Muslims as not only being
              peaceful but also contributing to society in a positive manner. When pressed by
              Carlson on whether there might be issues of violence within the Muslim
              community, the professor adamantly rejected such thoughts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">All of Abdelkader’s responses to Carlson’s questions were
              clearly designed to hold Islam blameless. They also were offered in accordance
              with Islam’s age-old principle of imposing a duty upon Muslims, known as
              “taqiyya,” to lie to non-Muslims on behalf of Allah in order to further Islam’s
              advance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are certain realities and facts, however, the professor
              simply cannot ignore about “peaceful” Islam:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why are the world’s 27 most violent cities, experiencing the
              worst quality of life, all dominated by Islam?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why do Muslims who criticize Christianity not have to live in
              fear for their lives while non-Muslims daring to criticize Islam do? A list of
              the latter includes the likes of Somali and former Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
              British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, Danish cartoonist Fleming Rose, who
              drew Muhammad, and the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why did a Moroccan television program on women’s beauty aides
              feel it necessary to air a segment on how best to hide domestic-violence
              bruises?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why, as Abelkader claims, if Muslim Americans are the group
              most responsible for reporting tips to law enforcement about terrorist plots,
              is that not a telling indictment against her community that so many such plots
              are being hatched there?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A refrain from a song written by English singer Steven
              Patrick Morrissey repeatedly laments, “I’ll never learn.” In the wake of yet
              another terrorist attack by a Muslim in the U.S. and our continuing reluctance
              to link the attacker to his religious motivation, Morrissey’s refrain seems
              most appropriate.</span></p>
