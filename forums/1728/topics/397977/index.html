            <div class='col-md body'><p>The wheel of Sharp weapons Effectively Striking the Heart of the foe' has been composed by the great Yogi Dharmaraksita in his retreat in the jungle where many fierce animals prey. What this great Yogi, the possessor of vast scriptural knowledge, the full powers of logic and deep profound insight, has written here is the essence of the teachings of all his holy Gurus. He always practised in accordance with this essence in his fearsome jungle retreat during the degenerate age in which he lived.<br><br>From among his many disciples, Dharmaraksita transmitted these teachings to Atisa (982--1054); and Atisa practised them wherever he traveled in order to tame those who ware most wild. When Atisa developed true insight into the two Bodhicittas through these teachings, he composed the following verses:<br><br>I went through much hardship abandoning royalty,<br>But by collecting much virtuous merit,<br>I met my true Guru, Dharmaraksita,<br>By showing me these supreme nectar like teachings,<br>He has granted me sovereignty over my mind;<br>So that now I have attained all the forceful opponents,<br>Having memorised fully these words he has taught.<br><br>Although I do not favour a partisan viewpoint-<br>Whenever I study the various teachings<br>I always make effort to broaden my wisdom<br>To see boundless wonders in every tradition-<br>Yet I have to admit that these teachings especially<br>Have been of great help in this age of decay.<br><br>From among his many unimaginably great disciples in both India and Tibet, Atisa transmitted these teachings to Upasaka hBrom-ston-pa,  who had been prophesied to be his most fitting disciple by many of Atisa's meditational deities such as Tara. Atisa transmitted these teachings to hBrom-ston-pa in order to pacify the minds of the disciples of remote Tibet who were difficult to tame. <br><br>Wheel of Sharp Weapons<br><br>The name of this work is 'The Wheel of Sharp Weapons<br>Effectively Striking the Heart of the Foe'.<br>I pray heartfelt homage to you, Yamantaka;<br>Your wrath is opposed to the Great Lord of Death.<br><br>In jungles of poisonous plants strut the peacocks,<br>Though medicine gardens of beauty lie near.<br>The masses of peacocks do not find gardens pleasant,<br>But thrive on the essence of poisonous plants.<br><br> In similar fashion the brave Bodhisattvas<br>Remain in the jungle of worldly concern.<br>No matter how joyful this world's pleasure gardens,<br>These Brave Ones are never attracted to pleasures,<br>But thrive in the jungle of suffering and pain.<br><br> We spend our whole life in the march for enjoyment,<br>Yet tremble with fear at the mere thought pain;<br>Thus since we are cowards, we are miserable still.<br>But the brave Bodhisattvas accept suffering gladly<br>And gain from their courage a true lasting joy.<br><br> Now desire is the jungle of poisonous plants here.<br>Only Brave Ones, like peacocks, can thrive on such fare,<br>If cowardly beings, like crows, were to try it,<br>Because they are greedy they might lose their lives.<br><br> How can someone who cherishes self more than others<br>Take lust and such dangerous poisons for food?<br>If he tried like a crow to use other delusions,<br>He would probably forfeit his chance for release.<br><br> And thus Bodhisattvas are likened to peacocks:<br>They live on delusions poisonous plants.<br>Transforming them into the essence of practice,<br>They thrive the jungle of everyday life.<br>Whatever is presented they always accept<br>While destroying the poison of clinging desire.<br><br> Uncontrollable wandering through rounds of existence<br>Is concern by our grasping at egos as real.<br>This ignorant attitude heralds the demon<br>Of selfish concern for our welfare alone:<br>We seek some security for our own egos;<br>We want only pleasure and shun any pain.<br>But now we must banish all selfish compulsion<br>And gladly take hardship for all other's sake.<br><br> All of our sufferings derive from our habits<br>Of selfish delusions we heed and act out<br>As all of us share in this tragic misfortune,<br>Which stems from our narrow and self-centred ways,<br>We must take all our sufferings and the miseries of others<br>And smother our wishes of selfish concern.<br><br> Should the impulse arise now to seek our own pleasure,<br>We must turn it aside to please others instead;<br>For even if loved ones should rise up against us,<br>We must blame our self-interest and feel it's our due.<br><br> When our bodies are aching and racked with great torment<br>Of dreadful diseases we cannot endure,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have injured the bodies of others;<br>Hereafter let's take on what sickness is theirs.<br><br> Depressed and forlorn, when we feel mental anguish,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we how deeply disturbed minds of others;<br>Hereafter let's take on this suffering ourselves.<br><br> When hunger or violent thirst overwhelms us,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have kept what we had without sharing;<br>We have plundered end stolen and lured people on.<br>Hereafter let's take from them hunger and thirst.<br><br> When we lack any freedom, but must obey others,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have looked down upon them who were lowly<br>And used them as servants for our own selfish needs;<br>Hereafter let's offer our service to others<br>With humble devotion of body and life.<br><br> When we hear only language that is foul and abusive,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have said many things without thinking;<br>We have slandered and caused many friendships to and.<br>Hereafter let's censure all thoughtless remarks.<br><br> When we are born in oppressive and wretched condition,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have always had a negative outlook<br>We have criticized others, seeing only their flaws<br>Hereafter let's cultivate positive feelings<br>And view our surroundings as stainless and pure.<br><br> When we are parted from friends and from those who can help us,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have taken the friends and good servants<br>Of others away, wanting them for ourselves;<br>Hereafter let's never cause close friends to part.<br><br>When supreme holy Gurus find us displeasing,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have turned from the Gurus and teachings,<br>preferring the counsel of misleading friends;<br>Hereafter let's end our dependent relations<br>With those who would turn us away from the path.<br><br>When unjustly we are blamed for the misdeeds of others,<br>And are falsely accused of flaws that we lack,<br>And are always the object of verbal abuse,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have despised and belittled our Gurus;<br>Hereafter let's never accuse others falsely,<br>But give them full credit for virtues they have.<br><br>When the things we require for daily consumption<br>And use, fall apart or are wasted or spoil,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have been careless with others' possessions;<br>Hereafter let's give them whatever they need.<br><br>When our minds are unclear and our hearts are unhappy,<br>We are bored doing virtue but excited by vice,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have led others to acts of non-virtue;<br>Hereafter let's never provide the conditions<br>That rouse them to follow their negative traits.<br><br> When our minds are disturbed and we feel great frustration<br>That things never happen the may that we wish,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have caused interfering disturbance<br>When others were focused on virtuous acts;<br>Hereafter let's stop causing such interruption.<br><br> When nothing we do ever pleases our Gurus,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now with our Gurus we have feigned pious manners,<br>But out of their presence have reverted to sin.<br>Hereafter let's try to be less hypocritical<br>And take all the teachings sincerely to heart.<br><br> When others find fault with whatever we are doing<br>And people seem eager to blame only us,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have been shameless, not cared about others,<br>We have thought that our deeds did not matter at all,<br>Hereafter let's stop our offensive behavior.<br><br> When our servants and friends are annoyed by our habits,<br>And after a while cannot stay in our homes,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done<br>Till now we have imposed our bad habits on others;<br>Hereafter let's change and show only hind ways.<br><br>When all who are close turn against us as enemies,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have held grudges inside us with anger<br>With thoughts of sly methods to cause others pain;<br>Hereafter let's try to have less affectation,<br>Not pretend to be kind while we harbour base aims.<br><br> When we suffer from sickness and such interference<br>Especially when gout has swollen our legs,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now without shame and with no self-control<br>We have stolen or misused what others have given;<br>Hereafter let's never take anything offered<br>To the Three Jewels of Refuge as if it were ours.<br><br> When strokes and diseases strike without warning,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have broken our vowed words of honour;<br>Hereafter let's shun such non-virtuous deeds.<br><br> When our mind becomes clouded whenever we study,<br>This is the wheal of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have thought that the study of Dharma<br>Lacked prime importance and could be ignored;<br>Hereafter let's build up the habits of wisdom<br>To hear and to think about whet Buddha taught.<br><br>When sleep overwhelms us while practising virtue,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have gathered the causes for obstacles<br>Hindering our practice of virtuous acts.<br>(We have lacked all respect for the scriptural teachings;<br>We have sat on our books and left texts on the ground.<br>We have also looked down upon those with deep insight.)<br>Hereafter for the sake of our practice of Dharma<br>Let's gladly endure all the hardships we meet.<br><br> When our mind wanders greatly and runs towards delusion,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have neglected to meditate fully<br>On defects pervading this transient world;<br>Hereafter let's work to renounce this existence<br>(And see the impermanent nature of things).<br><br> When all our affairs, both religious and worldly,<br>Run into trouble and fall into ruin,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have felt cause and effect {9} could be slighted;<br>Hereafter let's practise with patience and strength.<br><br> When rites we perform never seem to be fruitful,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have relied on the gods of this world<br>Or on unskillful actions to bring us relief;<br>Hereafter let's turn in another direction<br>And leave our non-virtuous actions behind.<br><br> When none of the wishes we make reach fulfillment,<br>Although we have made prayers to the Three Precious Gems,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have had an imperfect commitment<br>To Buddha whose teachings deserve complete trust;<br>Hereafter let's place our exclusive reliance<br>On Buddha, his teachings and those in his fold.<br><br> When prejudice, polio or strokes have us crippled<br>And external forces or harm rise against us,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have collected vast stores of non-virtue<br>By breaking, our vows and offending protectors<br>In our practice from Guru-devotion to tantra; {10}<br>Hereafter let's banish all prejudiced views.<br><br> When we lack all control over where we must travel<br>And always must wander like waifs with no home,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have disturbed holy Gurus and others<br>And forced them to move from their homer or their seats;<br>Hereafter let's never cause others disturbance<br>By evicting them cruelly from where they reside.<br><br> When the crops in our fields are continually plagued<br>By drought floods and hailstones, insects and frost,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have failed to honour our pledges;<br>Hereafter let's keep all our moral vows pure,<br><br> When we are poor, yet are filled with much greed and desire,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done,<br>Till now we have been misers, reluctant to share.<br>The offerings we have made to the Three Jewels were<br>meager;<br>Hereafter let's give with a generous hart.<br><br> When our bodies are ugly and others torment us<br>By mocking our flaws, never showing aspect<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have made images lacking in beauty,<br>By venting our anger we have made ugly scenes;<br>Hereafter let's print books and make pleasing statues,<br>And not be short-tempered but be of good cheer.<br><br> When attachment and anger disturb and upset us<br>No matter how much we may try to suppress them,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have held on to the improper outlook:<br>Stubbornly cherishing only ourselves,<br>Hereafter let's uproot self-interest completely.<br><br> When success in our practices always eludes us,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now, deep within, we have clung to our ego,<br>Fully immersed in self-cherishing ways;<br>Hereafter let's dedicate all of the virtuous<br>Actions we do, so that others may thrive.<br><br>When our mind is untamed though we act with great virtue,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have engaged in those worldly ambitions<br>That aim at success for ourselves in this life;<br>Hereafter let's work with pure one-pointed effort<br>To nourish the wish to gain freedom's far shore.<br><br> When after we do any virtuous action<br>We feel deep regret or we doubt its effect,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have been fickle and, stirred by base motives,<br>Have courted only those who had power or wealth;<br>Hereafter let's act with complete self-awareness,<br>Exerting great care in the way we make friends.<br><br> When those with ambition repay trusting friendship<br>By luring us on with their devious schemes,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now from ambition we have acted with arrogance,<br>Hereafter let's dampen our self-centred pride.<br><br> When the force of attraction or that of repulsion<br>Colours whatever we hear or we say,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have ignored what has caused all our troubles:<br>The mass of delusion that dwells in our heart;<br>Hereafter let's try to abandon all hindrances<br>Note their arisal, examine them wed.<br><br> When no matter how well-meant our actions towards others,<br>They always elicit a hostile response,<br>This is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br>Till now we have repaid loving-kindness with malice;<br>Hereafter let's always accept others' favours<br>Both graciously and with most humble respect.<br><br>(46) In short then, whenever unfortunate suffering<br>We haven't desired crash upon us like thunder,<br>This is the same as the smith who had taken<br>His life with a sword he had fashioned himself<br>Our suffering is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrong we have done.<br>Hereafter let's always have care and awareness<br>Never to act in non-virtuous ways.<br><br> All of the sufferings that we have endured<br>In the lives we have led in the three lower states,<br>As well as our pains of the present and future,<br>Are the same as the case of the forger of arrows<br>Who later was killed by an arrow he had made.<br>Our suffering is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrong we have done.<br>Hereafter let's always have care and awareness<br>Never to act in non-virtuous ways.<br><br> When the troubles and worries of family life grieve us,<br>This is the same as the case of a child<br>Who was cared for with love later killing his parents.<br>Our suffering is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br>Full circle upon us from wrong we have done.<br>Hereafter it is fitting in all of our lifetimes<br>For us to live purely as monks or as nuns.<br><br> As it's true what I have said about self-centred interest,<br>I recognise clearly my enemy now.<br>I recognise clearly the bandit who plunders,<br>The liar who lures by pretending he is part of me;<br>Oh what relief that I have conquered this doubt!<br><br> And so Yamantaka spin round with great power<br>The wheel of sharp weapons of good actions now.<br>Three times turn it round, in your wrathful-like aspect-<br>Your legs set apart for the two grader of truth,<br>With your eyes blazing open for wisdom and means.<br><br> Baring your fangs of the four great opponents,<br>Devour the foe-our cruel selfish concern!<br>With your powerful mantra of cherishing others,<br>Demolish this enemy lurking within!<br><br> Frantically running through life's tangled jungle,<br>We are chased by sharp weapons of wrongs we have done<br>Returning upon us; we are out of control<br>This sly, deadly villain-the selfishness in us,<br>Deceiving ourselves and all others a well-<br>Capture him, capture him, fierce Yamantaka,<br>Summon this enemy, bring him forth now!<br><br> Batter him, batter him, rip out the heart<br>Of our grasping for ego, our love for ourselves!<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern!<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release!<br><br> Hum! Ham! Show all your powers, O mighty protector.<br>Dza! Dza! Tie up this enemy; do not let him loose.<br>P'a! P'a! {17} Set us free by your might, O great Lord over Death<br>Cut! Cut! Break the knot of self-interest that binds us inside.<br><br> Appear Yamantaka, O wrathful protector;<br>I have further entreaties to make of you still.<br>This sack of five poisons, mistakes and delusions,<br>Drags us down in the quicksand of life's daily toil-<br>Cut it off, cut it off, rip it to shreds!<br><br> We are drawn to the sufferings of miserable rebirths,<br>Yet mindless of pain, we go after its cause.<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br>We have high expectations of speedy attainments,<br>Yet do not wish to work at the practice involved.<br>We have many fine projects we plan to accomplish,<br>Yet none of them ever are done in the end.<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br> Our wish to be happy is strong at all times,<br>Yet we do not gather merit to yield this result.<br>We have little endurance for hardship and suffering,<br>Yet ruthlessly push for the things we desire.<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br>With comparative ease, we develop new friendships,<br>Yet since we are callous, not one of them lasts.<br>We are filled with desire for food and fine clothing,<br>Yet failing to earn them, we steal and we scheme.<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br>We are experts as flattering others for favours,<br>Yet always complaining, we are sad and depressed.<br>The

concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br> We have done very little to benefit someone,<br>Yet always remind him how much we have done.<br>We have never accomplished a thing in our lifetime,<br>Yet boasting and bragging, we are filled with conceit.<br>Trample him, trample him, dance on the head<br>Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br>We have many great masters and teachers to guide us<br>Yet

treacherous concept of selfish concern,<br>Tear out the heart of this self-centred butcher<br>Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br><br> We promise to do many glorious dads,<br>Yet In practice we give others minimal help.<br>Our spiritual fame has been spread far and wide,<br>Yet inwardly all of our thoughts are repulsive<br>Not only to gods, but to demons and ghosts.<br>Trample

have read very little, heard only few teachings,<br>Yet talk with authority pertly on Voidness.<br>Our knowledge of scriptures is pitifully lacking,<br>Yet glibly we make up and say what we

beings<br>Take it to smother delusions self.<br><br> Through we have not a doubt, for we recognise fully<br>The cause and the root of mistakes we all make,<br>If there is still left a part of our minds that would tend<br>To support this delusion of self that we have,<br>Then destroy the firm hold of this part of our minds<br>That, against or true wishes, makes fools of us still.<br><br>As all that is wrong can be traced to one source:<br>Our concern for ourselves, whom we cherish the most,<br>We must meditate now on the kindness of others.<br>Accepting the suffering that they never wished for,<br>We must dedicate fully our virtues to all.<br><br> Thus accepting ourselves all deluded non-virtuous<br>Actions that others have done in the past,<br>In the present and future with mind, speech and body,<br>May delusions of others as well as our own<br>Be the favoured conditions to gain our Enlightenment<br>Just as the peacocks eat poison and thrive.<br><br> As crows may be cured after swallowing poison<br>By a powerful antidote given in time,<br>Let's direct to all others our virtuous merit,<br>That this may replenish their chances for freedom<br>May all sentient beings reach Buddhahood soon!<br><br> Till the time when all motherly beings and I<br>Gain the perfect conditions for us to be Buddhas,<br>Though the force of our actions may cause us to wander<br>Through various realms in the six rebirth states<br>May we always be able to help one another<br>To keep our aim find on Enlightenment's shore.<br><br>Then for even the sake of but one sentient being<br>May we gladly take birth in the three lower states.<br>With Enlightening Conduct that never grows weak<br>May we lead al the beings in miserable rebirths<br>Out of their sufferings and causes for pain.<br><br> As soon as we have placed ourselves into their realm<br>May the guards of the hells come to see us as Gurus,<br>May the weapons of torture they hold turn to flowers;<br>May all harm be stilled-peace and

way may they realise the non-self-existence<br>Of worldly involvement and freedom as well.<br>May they place concentration on both of these equally,<br>Seeing their natures as equally void.<br><br> If we practise these methods we shall soon overcome<br>Our true enemies: selfish concern and self-love.<br>If we practise there methods we shall overcome also<br>false concepts of ego we hold to be real<br>Thus by joint meditation on Egolessness<br>And on non-dual wisdom of Voidness and Bliss,<br>How can anyone not gain the causes to win<br>A Buddha's Physical Body and its fruit, Buddhahood<br><br> O mind, understand that the topics discussed here<br>Are interdependent phenomena all;<br>For things must rely on dependent-arising<br>To have an existence-they cannot stand alone,<br>The process of change is alluring like magic,<br>For physical form is but mental appearance,<br>As a torch whirling round seems a circle of flame.<br><br> There is nothing substantial to anyone's life-force<br>It crumbles apart like a water-soaked log<br>And there is nothing substantial to anyone's life-span<br>It bursts in an instant like bubbles of foam.<br>All the things of this world are but fog-like appearance;<br>When closely examined, they out of sight.<br>Like mirages these things at a distance seem lovely<br>But when we come closer, they are not to be found.<br><br> All things are like images found in a mirror,<br>And yet we imagine they are real, very real;<br>All things are like mist or like clouds on a mountain,<br>And yet we imagine they are stable and firm.<br>Our foe: our insistence on ego-identities<br>Truly our own, which we wish were secure,<br>And our butcher: the selfish concern for ourselves<br>Like all things there appear to be truly existent,<br>Though they never have been truly existent at all.<br><br> Although they appear to be concrete and real,<br>They have never been real, any time, anywhere.<br>They are not things we should burden with ultimate value,<br>Nor should we deny them their relative truth.<br>As our grasping for egos and love for ourselves<br>Lack substantial foundations with true independence,<br>How can they yield acts that exist by themselves?<br>And then how can this cruel vicious circle of suffering,<br>The fruit of these actions, be real from its core?<br><br> Although all things thus lack inherent existence,<br>Yet just as the face of the moon can be seen<br>In a cup of clear water reflecting its image,<br>The various aspects of cause and effect<br>Appear in this relative world as reflections.<br>So please, in this world of appearances only,<br>Let's always be sure what we do is of virtue<br>And shun all those acts that would cause us great pain.<br><br> When our bodies are charred in a horrible nightmare<br>By the world-ending flames of a stellar explosion,<br>Although this ordeal is not actually happening<br>We nevertheless feel great terror and scream.<br>In similar fashion unfortunate rebirths<br>In hells or as ghosts are not actually real,<br>And yet we can fully experience their pain.<br>Thus fearing such suffering as burning alive,<br>We must cease all these actions that yield this result.<br><br> When our mind are delirious, burning with fever,<br>Although there is no darkness, we feel we are plummeting<br>Further and further inside a black pit<br>With the walls pressing closer the deeper we fall.<br>In similar fashion, although our dark ignorance<br>Lacks self-existence, we nevertheless<br>Must by all means break out of its strangling construction<br>By putting the three kinds of wisdom to use.<br><br> When musicians are playing a beautiful melody,<br>Should we examine the sound they are making<br>We would see that it does not exist by itself.<br>But when we are not making our formal analysis,<br>Still there is a beautiful tune to be heard,<br>Which is merely a label on notes and on players<br>That is why lovely music can lighten sad hearts.<br><br> When we closely examine effects and their causes,<br>We see that they both lack inherent existence<br>They cannot stand alone, either whole or apart<br>Yet there seem to exist independently rising<br>And falling events, which, in fact, are conditioned<br>By various forces, components and parts,<br>It is this very level on which we experience<br>Birth and our death and whatever life brings.<br>So please, in this world of appearances only,<br>Let's always be sure what we do is of virtue<br>And shun all their acts that would cause ns great pain.<br><br> When a vase has been filled by the dripping of water,<br>The first drops themselves did not fill it alone;<br>Nor was it made full by the last several drops.<br>It was filled by an interdependent collection<br>Of causes and forces that came all together<br>The water, the pourer, the vase and such things.<br><br> It is precisely the same when we come to experience<br>Pleasure and pain: the results of our past<br>Effects never come from the first causal actions,<br>Nor do they arise from the last several acts.<br>Both pleasure and pain come from interdependent<br>Collections of forces and causes combined.<br>So please, in this world of appearances only,<br>Let's always be sure what we do is of virtue<br>And shun all their acts that would cause us great pain.<br><br> When not making formal dissections with logic,<br>Merely letting life's happening flow freely on,<br>Although we experience feelings of pleasure,<br>In ultimate truth the appearance of happiness<br>Lacks self-existence inherently real.<br>And yet on the everyday operative level<br>This seeming appearance has relative truth.<br>To understand fully this deep profound meaning<br>For slow-minded persons, alas, will be hard.<br><br> And now when we try to do close contemplation<br>On Voidness, how can we have even a feeling<br>Of conventional truth at the very same time?<br>Yet what can there be that has true self-existence;<br>And what can there be that lacks relative truth?<br>How can anyone anywhere believe in such things?<br><br> Just as objects of Voidness are non-self-existent,<br>The Voidness of objects itself is the same.<br>The shunning of vice and the practice of virtue<br>Are like wise devoid of all mantel constructions<br>That they are independent, self-contained acts<br>In fact, on the whole, they are lacking completely<br>All mental projections and an pre-conceptions.<br>Thus if we can focus our clear concentration<br>On Voidness without our mind wandering astray,<br>Then truly we shall come to be wondrous beings<br>With a deep understanding of the most profound Void.<br><br> By practising this way the two Bodhicittas,<br>Of the ultimate and the conventional truth,<br>And thus by completing without interference<br>Collections of insight and merit as wall,<br>May all of us quickly attain Full Enlightenment<br>Granting what we and all others have wished.</p></div>
