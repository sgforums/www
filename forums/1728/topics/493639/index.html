              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Which part of the Chinese
              Hardliners’ brains are missing?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Reuters
              reports recently that the Dalai Lama when speaking to U.S. comedian John Oliver
              in Dharamsala, commented that Chinese hardliners have parts of their brains
              missing. He is also quoted to cast doubt on his reincarnation by saying he
              might be the last in line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              reply, the Chinese spokesman Mr Geng noted that as the conversation appeared in
              an entertainment programme, the Dalai Lama’s comments in the interview perhaps
              appeared humorous and funny. Certainly very accommodating and friendly of him
              indeed!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              the catch here is that, Name calling has become the usual norm with the Chinese
              government when any talks and reference is made of the Dalai Lama.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They seem to have a total dislike of him. One
              would not miss such term as liar, separatist and now, ‘political exile in
              religious clothing’ labelled on him. I am waiting for the Chinese to call him
              ‘a wolf in sheep skin’ soon. And oh, no forgetting such term as splitist which
              at time would make me spit out my saliva unconsciously when pronouncing the
              word. Luckily for the Dalai Lama, the Chinese have no wish to negotiated with
              him, otherwise he might just have to physically keep an arm length from them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sure
              as expected, Mr Geng hit back and take a swipe at the Dalai Lama by adding
              that, quote, ‘these words are all lies that do not accord with the facts’. (What
              a spoilsport after calling him funny!) By the way, what facts is he referring
              to? The Dalai Lama in jest, could be just referring to the missing folds on the
              Grey matter of these Hardliners’ brains.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Well,
              the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government have been bickering for decades on
              the fate of Tibet with the unfortunate Tibetans people sandwiched between both
              parties’ squabbles and disagreements on the issues of autonomy, language,
              culture, traditions. Unfortunately, as the Tibetan way of life is so intertwined
              with the Buddhist faith, the religion too has been drag in and become such an
              important and necessary tool for the control of Tibet and its inhabitants for
              the Chinese government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since
              both sides are unable to come to any agreement, it has now boil down to the
              Chinese government trying to isolate the Dalai Lama presents in the
              international arena by using retaliatory measures against countries that dares
              to invite him to their countries. Also, it is making use of student bodies in
              Universities and the Shugden Society to disrupt the Dalai Lama wherever he
              appears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              the Dalai Lama is now in his 80’s, it is just a matter of time before he passed
              away even though he has said that he intent to live to be a centenarian. It
              certainly did give the Chinese some anxious moment with that statement though.
              When he passed on, it is going to a sad day for many, but it is certainly going
              to be a red-letter day for the Chinese government. (Time to break out the
              champagne bottle or rather the Mao Tai baijiu to celebrate, I presume!) It
              would also not be too long after that before the search and confirmation of the
              next reincarnation Dalai Lama would take place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Beside
              the facts that the Dalai Lama had said he might not reincarnate again, he has
              also pointed out earlier that he might come back as a female or that he might
              reincarnate outside of Tibet itself. I suggest he might like to add another
              option and tell the Chinese he is going to be reincarnated into three separate
              physical bodies representing his body, speech and mind. One of this body to be
              born in Tibet, one outside Tibet and one other for all Vajrayana followers to
              decide. Let’s add a little bit of ‘spices and pepper’ and some confusion to the
              whole issue of reincarnation and raise the blood pressure of these hardliners a
              few millimetres in the process. It would be interesting to see how they will
              react.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Afterall,
              it is a foregone conclusion that after his demise, that there will certainly be
              two Dalai Lama for the believers to choose from. One appointed by the Chinese
              authority using the Golden Urn method and the other by the Tibetans living in
              exile presently. Which Dalai Lama is going to be the more popular one will eventually
              depend on who have more charisma and intelligence. Of course, if one turns out
              to be mentally handicap or becomes a womaniser, drunkard or refused to be
              ordained as a monk like the sixth Dalai Lama, the advantage will certainly go
              to the other party. In any case, there are now two competing Kamapas and
              Panchen Lamas to choose from. It has certainly not done much damage to the
              religion as a whole.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Seriously,
              I believe the Chinese government is pragmatic enough to realised that their
              future selected Dalai Lama will not be accepted by the majority of the Tibetan
              people and will not be able to galvanise them to their side and be assimilate into
              the Chinese society. As it is now, and if time is not a problem for the present
              Chinese government, it will still require a few more generations down the road
              before the Tibetans can accept and be proud to be identified as Chinese.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              in order to hasten this process of assimilation, it would certainly be an advantage
              to take control of the religion itself since Buddhism is a way of life that is
              intertwined into every facet of the Tibetan way of living. The religion to the
              Communist government, is a ‘pain in the neck’ if it cannot serve their
              objectives. The government will try to weakened Buddhism as it has a strong
              hold on the Tibetans. It will try to cause chaos, confusion, disputes within
              the religion and undermining it until the people lost faith in it and look elsewhere
              to satisfied their needs and aspiration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              the Chinese, it is then hope, from this chaos of the weakened state of the
              religion, to push through its own reforms to meet with their own objectives.
              But ironically, as a government with a communist ideology, it chooses materialism
              and consumerism as a substitute for the religion to uplift and improve the
              Tibetans standard of living. Most commendable indeed. They hope, when lives are
              improved, the Tibetans would show their appreciation and thus win over their
              heart and minds. But what the communists does not seems to believe or forget is
              that, there is also a spiritual dimension in an individual’s life that needs to
              be satisfied in most of us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That
              in most case, can only be fulfilled by the believes in a religion. Until and
              unless there is Freedom and Rights not just in allowing people the right to
              believe in a religion but also allowing them the right to practice it without
              control and interference. Without that happening, there will always be
              struggles from the Tibetans people and certainly no peace of mind for the
              Chinese government.</span></p>
