              <p>Buddhist books by themselves are not harmful.</p>
              <p>But if one keeps imagining things about it, then it (the imaginations, not the books) becomes harmful.</p>
              <p>This doesn't just apply to Buddhism it applies to lives in general. Anything in life that you worry and imagine too much, that becomes your problem. Try not to worry yourselves over things.</p>
              <p>Those problems are created by the "mind", not Buddhism nor any of your life situations. But is the "mind" even real? No, those problems, the mind itself, they're just projections -- they're not real and can't be found. But someone who is totally identified with his mind and doesn't know his true identity as pure awareness, he doesn't realise that and continue being lost in imaginations. Buddhism ask you to tame your mind, be liberated and freed from the mind.</p>
              <p>Nobody else has the same problems as you with Buddhism... so you can be assured the problems come from your own mind alone. On the contrary lots of people I know are finding immense liberation, clarity, bliss and insights from their practice of Buddhism. Many Buddhists are living much of their lives in a thoughtless state of pure awareness. BTW you should read The Power of Now, it will be very helpful. It's not religious and many Christians in the U.S. are finding it immensely helpful, Eckhart Tolle books are bestsellers there.</p>
              <p>The important thing about Buddhist practice is to stop imaginations. Just stop right there. That's why the 6 kai shi lu cds I feel are important.</p>
              <p>But as you're going to be Christian now, just practice "let go and let God", totally surrender yourself to God so that you can directly experience this:</p>
              <p><em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20)</p>
              <p>If you can experience that then your mind problems will dissolve.</p>

              <p>His problem has nothing to do with jen chen. He was already into Buddhism for many years before going into Jen Chen (which he only came about 2 times), and used to be involved in a Buddhist society. However he only went to a few activities and wasn't active, and didn't read Buddhist books, so he don't have any deep understanding of dharma.</p>
              <p>And he has a lot of misconceptions about karma that has nothing to do with Buddhism. He had these misconceptions long before he came to Jen Chen so it has nothing to do with Jen Chen either. He kept imagining things about karma and other stuff. And as you know, his mental illness is more severe than yours, which he had a long history of. He has not read a single Jen Chen book either, and since he only came like 2-3 times I dun think he understands much about our teachings.</p>
              <p>Your problems are the result of existing psychological issues which I would advise seeking treatment from a psychiatrist (hope your mom allows), those problems are the result of imagination and not the problem with Buddhism. Buddhism basically teaches the way to transcend identification with the mind. Nobody else have such problems -- there are hundreds of millions of Buddhists in the world and I have not heard of such cases. I have only heard of lots of people, more than I can count, who have experienced total liberation, emancipation, and the highest bliss of knowing their true nature. If practiced rightly this is the way to full liberation.</p>
              <p>And no need to talk about your mother since she is a Tian Dao-ist and not a Buddhist, and have confused understanding of Buddhism mixed with Tian Dao.</p>
              <p>BTW regarding your hell dreams, that's because you think of hell too much. If you keep thinking of hell you dream of hell, if you keep thinking of heaven you dream of heaven. Buddhism teach us don't think of anything. Just sustain awareness. Our presence-awareness is like a stillpoint... totally outside the stream of time and movements. Just drop our imaginations and return to this stillpoint. Only those who have experienced this for himself knows the liberation and bliss in cutting through all the crap (imaginations) and resting in your original nature... which I am only having glimpses now.</p>
              <p>I don't think I have nightmares more than 2-3 times a year, and even those nightmares aren't scary but just a bit unpleasant. Most of my dreams are pleasant. Sometimes I don't remember any dreams.</p>
