              <p>I think it is very superficial to go to church just to 'play'. Religion isn't for 'playing'. It is about spirituality, and discovering your spiritual nature.</p>
              <p>As li zhu lao shi said before, those friends you have in church, they are only temporary in the sense that they will be married in the future, etc, and will not have much time for you in the future. Furthermore, it's not like you will not have a lack of friends when you get into poly soon.</p>
              <p>You should try to learn how to apply Buddhism in your lives and practice. Otherwise whatever you learn is only superficial on the surface level and you won't see benefits.</p>
              <p>When you practice Buddhism and start to experience the freedom, bliss, and clarity from practice, then such experience will naturally draw you towards practice. When we have not experienced these qualities, then we will not know that there is a mode of being that is much more blissful, clear, liberating. Without such qualities the mind cannot rest in 'not knowing', it will inquire, it will wander into discursive thoughts.</p>

              <p>Without glimpses and direct experience of your own nature, one will lose himself in various theories and concepts and continue searching through these concepts. There will not be utter conviction through direct experience. There will a lot of confusion. Of course, whether to search endlessly in theories and concepts or to settle this through direct looking of our own experience is up to us.</p>
              <p>If one is a serious truth seeker, we should go by direct experience. But whether we are or we are not is up to us.</p>
              <p><strong>Kalama Sutra</strong></p>
              <p><em>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on
                  the words of the teaching, but on the</em> <br><em>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not
                  believe in anything simply because you</em> <br><em>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been
                  handed down for many generations. Do</em> <br><em>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do
                  not believe in anything because it is</em> <br><em>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely
                  on the authority of your teachers and</em> <br><em>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything
                  agrees with reason and is</em> <br><em>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept
                  it and live up to it."</em></p>

              <p>Don't just believe because of what you're told, what you read, what you heard, by authority, etc. But of course if you find Christianity suits you more upon reflection on the teachings and not by blind faith, by direct experience instead of simply what you read then go for it. Even when you become a Christian, go by direct experience.</p>

              <p><em>...mysticism is not only  a vital part of the Christian heritage as well, but  it is actually the <em>core</em> of Christian spirituality. Mysticism simply means the <strong>spirituality of the direct experience of God.</strong> It is the adventure of "the wild things of God."</em></p>
              <p><em>The direct experience of God is a kind of knowing, which goes beyond intellectual understanding. <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/belief.html">It is not a matter of "belief."</a> It is  marked by love and joy, but it is not "emotional experience." In many ways, it is better <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticalheart.html">described by what it is not</a>.
              To describe what it is, we must use metaphors—the marriage of the soul
              to Christ, the death of the "old man" and birth of the "new man," being
              the "body of Christ."</em></p>
              <p><em>Jesus proclaimed "<strong>I and the Father are one,</strong>" (<cite>Jn. 10.30</cite>) showing the world what the union of God and man can be. <strong>Christian mysticism is about nothing else but this transforming union....</strong></em></p>

              <p>my mom and i dont get one thing . the first day we go to a particular buddhism centre.</p>
              <p>we had a talk with the teacher.</p>
              <p>my mom disclosed my mental history and even being downpesed to PES F before coming to NS. it's not my mom din disclose.</p>
              <p>and the teacher could tell i am quite inferior and worried and yet she recommened reading books from dharma centre.</p>
              <p>Then at night i got illusion of hell and sucidal thoughts and impulses. dreams of animal and hell dreams.</p>
              <p>and she asked me chant i will remember i am pushed down from stairs , beaten up in army camp , dropping into cesspit in field camp. like that will feel sad or not.</p>
              <p>now i felt unwell.</p>
              <p>i decided to turn back to my original faith.</p>
              <p>no <strong>insult </strong>meant on buddhism just speaking the truth. buddhism centre emphasizes alot on<strong> karma</strong> also. the tone got up when talking abt<strong> karma .</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then like this i go church play better right gt frenz gt games gt nice air con . friendly ppl.</p>
              <p>all i have said is based on <strong>facts </strong>and <strong>truth. </strong>no offense taken but dharma centre should take a more careful stance on mental patients.</p>
              <p> everyone got religious freedom.           </p>
              <p>and noone at buddhism centre asked me if i accept karma theory and let me guiyi. I tot no need one. they asked me how i feel. first few visits i din read books i felt OK  .</p>
              <p>so i told them i guiyi. subsequent visits, i flipped a few pages and unfortunatley gt karma stuff then i have sucidals thoughts and impulses.  they told me to guiyi to jie yuan.        </p>
              <p>i have sucidal thoughts and impulses after i guiyi and read books.</p>

              <p>for me i have dreams of hell and other realms in my dreams. (nightmares)</p>
              <p>six realms of rebirth theory will confuse us and leave scary imprint in our minds.</p>
              <p>I dun really understand y ppl with anxiety disorder was allowed to read buddhism books. my mom against this also. and we tell the teacher at dharma centre was just discharged from NS from anxiety disorder</p>
              <p>she could tell i was quite inferior and think/worry too much. and yet she recommend buddhist books with karmic content in it.she even chose some for me.</p>
              <p>chanting recommended was not effective and caused more problems and yet i was still instructed to chant.</p>
              <p>i not saying xing yun fashi is not good. I respect him. I am not saying the dharma centre teacher not good also . no offense. but my mom gotten quite angry now .</p>
              <p>my mom banned me from going buddhist centre and allowed church now.</p>
              <p>the only book i am allowed to read is bible for now. my expiriences of dharma centre which i wanted to say.</p>

              <p>my mom and i dont get one thing . the first day we go to a
              particular buddhism centre.</p>
              <p>we had a talk with the teacher.</p>
              <p>my mom disclosed my mental history and even being downpesed to
              PES F before coming to NS. it's not my mom din disclose.</p>
              <p>and the teacher could tell i am quite inferior and worried and
              yet she recommened reading books from dharma centre.</p>
              <p>Then at night i got illusion of hell and sucidal thoughts and
              impulses. dreams of animal and hell dreams.</p>
              <p>and she asked me chant i will remember i am pushed down from
              stairs , beaten up in army camp , dropping into cesspit in field
              camp. like that will feel sad or not.</p>
              <p>now i felt unwell.</p>
              <p>i decided to turn back to my original faith.</p>
              <p>no <strong>insult</strong> meant on buddhism just speaking the
              truth. buddhism centre emphasizes alot on <strong>karma</strong> also. the tone got up when talking abt <strong>karma .</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>then like this i go church play better right gt frenz gt games
              gt nice air con . friendly ppl.</p>
              <p>all i have said is based on <strong>facts</strong> and
              <strong>truth.</strong> no offense taken but dharma centre should
              take a more careful stance on mental patients.</p>
              <p> everyone got religious
              freedom.           </p>
              <p>and noone at buddhism centre asked me if i accept karma theory
              and let me guiyi. I tot no need one. they asked me how i feel.
              first few visits i din read books i felt OK  .</p>
              <p>so i told them i guiyi. subsequent visits, i flipped a few pages
              and unfortunatley gt karma stuff then i have sucidals thoughts and
              impulses.  they told me to guiyi to jie
              yuan.        </p>
              <p>i have sucidal thoughts and impulses after i guiyi and read
              books.</p>

              <p>I can't see any links between your dreams of hell and animal with Buddhism. Unless you have been thinking too much about them. I have never had such dreams before. In any case, not to take the dreams too seriously.</p>
              <p>Also, if you have suicidal thoughts and impulses after reading karma things, then perhaps you have fear and misunderstanding of karma.</p>

              <p>The confusion is yours only. I have never experienced, and nobody else I know have experienced any psychological difficulties arising due to karma and six realms.</p>
              <p>I believe some of the things you experienced is due to unnecessary fears. There's no need to think too much about these things. Buddhism focus on the Now, we don't fear the afterlife if we practice well in this life. Why think so much about it? Buddhists don't worry themselves with past, present and future.</p>

              <p>No, speaking in tongues has nothing to do with Christian mysticism. As far as I know, mysticism isn't emphasized in most churches, but there are mystics in various denominations. You can read the link I gave you to understand more.</p>
