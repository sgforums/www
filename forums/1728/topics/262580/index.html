Of course if theres a way out that's good. Oh and.. even if she committed suicide, they'll still capture the daughters and kill them perhaps? So it's a very difficult situation. But I think in such cases we must weigh the possibilities of how many people will die as a result of one choice and see it from there. It's just a matter of wisdom.</div>
