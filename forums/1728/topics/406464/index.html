              Hi Pricey369
              
              Sorry to hear about your unpleasant childhood, I empathise with your circumstances. However, I do want to applaud you for your courage to acknowledge to the past. It was the past, that resulted in the present. What the future will hold for you is dependent on your present. I believe you are taking a significant step to reconcile your past and change the future by opening your heart to the teaching of Buddha. 
              
              Do rest assured that you can be safe by seeking refuge in the Shakyamuni Buddha, His teaching and the spiritual community. 
              
              Lotus Sutra Chpter 16 mentioned that Shakyamuni Buddha is the father of this world, saving those who suffer and are afflicted.
              
              You can take your time to explore the various tradition of Buddhism (http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/country.php?country_id=50) to see which tradition is your preference. 
              
              As for me, I am a Nichiren Shu practitioner  (http://www.nichiren-shu.org/) and through the practice of chanting,"Namu Myo Ho Renge Kyo". It has given me hope and strength to overcame personal conflicts in my own life. I pray that someday down the road you too will be healed of your past and become a overcomer in your own life. I shall end this with Nichiren writing on, "Happiness In This World"
              
              "... and chant Namu-myoho-renge-kyo. Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Namu-myoho-renge-kyo. No matter what happens."

              <p>I think you may need to find a qualified Buddhist teacher or someone who is knowledgeable enough to know more about Dharma. I myself start by looking through  the internet and good Buddhist books. I think the reason why you may feel depressed/stress is because the abuse you got from your parent leaves a painful scar in your memory. Parent to a child is a like a pillar to depend on when young.</p>
              <p>For me its a bit similar , I was often bullied and cane/lashed by my siblings for no reason. And my parent was often not at home. I kind of understand how you are feeling. Must have felt very lousy/sad/lost...etc...</p>
              <p>Why don't you search youtube for Ajahn Brahm's dharma talk, I think his dharma talk answer many questions/problems modern people like us face. There is quite a variety of videos in the channel, you can take your time to browse around. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/user/BuddhistSocietyWA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A very good idea Ajahn Brahm had come out with is the AFL code. A: acknowledge F:forgive L:learn. </p>
              <p>Now you had already A: acknowledge your problem, the next is to F and L. Forgive your past and learn from it. </p>
              <p>Buddha means The awaken one. Being able to address your problem is a
                  good beginning. You are on the track to wake up from the past.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you should also go research on what Buddhism is really about. Take your time to find out before going into any practice.</p>
              <p>This is about all I could share with you, I got to know the Dharma not too long ago.</p>

              <p>hello, </p>
              <p>think there's already some good advice and links given to you, should well be able to give you some headstart.</p>
              <p>from my experience as a new practitioner, the right teachings will appear to me to guide me in the most suitable way at that moment, so long as i keep my heart open. do not rush into things, take your time to learn the Buddha's teachings, and allow some space for your mind and body to heal.</p>
              <p>i guess at this point in time, the healing is the most important thing for you, and you will need a teacher to help guide you through the difficult phases in healing. </p>
              <p>if you are interested in learning vipassana under the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition can pm me, i practice at vmc. </p>
              <p>also i will highly recommend the book 'a path with heart' by Jack Kornfield for starters.</p>

              <p>Please find a qualified teacher whom you are comfortable with, you'll need it.</p>
              <p>Because once you've settled down to the business of meditation, you'll find your suppressed anger memories and unhappiness rising to the surface.  Is is better that you have someone whom you have good rapport to guide through it.</p>

              <p>Hi Pricey,</p>
              <p>Welcome to the forum... it's good that you are looking into Buddhism to solve your problems..</p>
              <p>VexTeen92 mentioned Ajahn Brahm... he's a video you might want to listen (it's 10 minutes): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4s7n5ZXWM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4s7n5ZXWM</a></p>
              <p>Also... you might want to check out Eckhart Tolle's books (The Power of Now, A New Earth) which I think is inspirational and transformative.</p>
              <p>Here's an excerpt from A New Earth:</p>
              <div class="blogSubject"><strong>Carrying the Past </strong></div>
              <p></p>
              <div id="pBlogBody_419944619" class="blogContent">The inability or rather unwillingness of the human mind to let
               go of the past is beautifully illustrated in the story of two Zen 
              monks, Tanzan and Ekido, who were walking along a country road that had 
              become extremely muddy after heavy rains. Near a village they came 
              across a young woman who was trying to cross the road, but the mud was 
              so deep it would have ruined the silk kimono she was wearing. Tanzan at 
              once picked her up and carried her to the other side.</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>The monks 
              walked on in silence. Five hours later, as they approached the lodging 
              temple, Ekido couldn't restrain himself any longer. "Why did you carry 
              that girl across the road?" he asked. "We monks are not supposed to do 
              things like that."<br>"I put the girl down hours ago," said Tanzan. "Are you still carrying her?"<br>Now
               imagine what life would be like for someone who lived like Ekido all 
              the time, unable or unwilling to let go internally of situations, 
              accumulating more and more "stuff" inside, and you get a sense of what 
              life is like for most people on our planet. What a heavy burden of past 
              they carry around with them in their minds.</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>The past lives in you as 
              memories, but memories in themselves are not a problem. In fact, it is 
              through memory that we learn from the past and past mistakes. It is only
               when memories, that is to say, thoughts about the past, take you over 
              completely that they turn into a burden, turn problematic, and become 
              part of your sense of self. Your personality, which is conditioned by 
              the past, then becomes your prison. Your memories are invested with a 
              sense of self, and your story becomes who your perceive yourself to be. 
              This "little me" is an illusion that obscures your true identity as 
              timeless and formless Presence.</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>Your story, however, consists of not 
              only mental but also emotional memory - old emotion that is being 
              revived continuously. As in the case of the monk who carried his burden 
              of resentment for five hours by feeding it with his thoughts, most 
              people carry a large amount of unnecessary baggage, both mental and 
              emotional, throughout their lives. They limit themselves through 
              grievences, regret, hostility, guilt. Their emotional thinking has 
              become their self, and so they hang on to the old emotion because it 
              strengthens their identity.</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>Because of the human tendency to 
              perpetuate old emotion, almost everyone carries in his or her energy 
              field an accumulation of old energy pain, which I call "the pain-body."</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>We
               can, however, stop adding to the pain-body that we already have. We can
               learn to break the habit of accumulating and perpetuating old emotions 
              by flapping our wings, metaphorically speaking, and refrain from 
              mentally dwelling on the past, regardless if something happened 
              yesterday or thirty years ago. We can learn not to keep situations or 
              events alive in our minds, but to return our attention continuously to 
              the pristine, timeless present moment rather than be caught up in mental
               movie-making. Our very presence then becomes our identity, rather than 
              our thoughts and emotions.</div>
              <div class="blogContent"><br>Nothing ever happened in the past that can
               prevent your from being present now; and if the past cannot prevent you
               from being present now, what power does it have?</div>

I am a very emotional person and it stems from way back.<br> <br>A friend of mine has reccomended that Buddhism may be able to help me find myself to assist in forgiving others for my past and help me move forward to a better life for me, allowing me to feel like a person and help others which I love doing.<br> <br>I do hope you will be able to assist me as I would like to take a diferent path and find some hapiness for a change instead of blaming my past life for my current mistakes now. I need some guidance and I'm hoping this may be the place for me to really find inner peace and hapiness which I havent for many years.<br> <br>I thank you for your time.</p>

              <p>Your friend is correct. Buddhism teaches no attachment and teaches how to let go (of your past). Buddhism will not just help you in this life, it will also help you in afterlife. You need time to find out more about Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Meditation will help you to find inner peace and overcome alcoholism . You just need to find a qualified teacher to teach you meditation.</p>

              <p>When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations we tend to regard the situation itself as the problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the mind. If we were to respond to difficulties with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us; indeed we may even come to regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems arise only if we respond to situations with a negative state of mind. Therefore, if we want to transform our life and be free from problems we must learn to transform our mind. Sufferings, problems, worries, unhappiness, and pain all exist within our mind; they are all unpleasant feelings, which are part of the mind. Through controlling and purifying our mind we can stop them once and for all.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I get what you mean. I think now you should just spend some
                          more time when you are free listening to dharma talk online. Browse around the web. It will make more
                          sense to you gradually. Meanwhile, you could also go to Buddhist monasteries or
                          bookshops to pick up some good books to further know more of what you would
                          like to know. Take your time to choose your books. Start simple. Here is one
                          book I can recommend you: “I wonder why by Thubten chodron”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> The reason why I think you
                          should start simple is because you are new to Buddhism. There are many
                          fundamentals of Buddhism you may not understand. Topics like rebirth,
                          reincarnation, karma, the realms beings and etc etc.. Plus the sutras and
                          mantras some fellow forummer shared with you…etc.. all this seem just
                          overflowing and hard to digest in such short period of time. <span> </span>Even I myself sometimes get no idea what the people
                          are trying to say. xD xD xD!!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Buddhism is a realized
                          religion. On the surface, it seemed so normal. You see people in temples
                          offering fruits and other stuffs to the Buddha statues, monks and nuns chanting
                          and chanting… One can never understand what meaning/purpose it hold just by
                          seeing the surface. So to understand and to know how to apply it in your life, <strong>you can never leave the dharma and reliable
                          texts</strong>(The historical Buddha shakyamuni) <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <span> </span>Honestly, nowadays there are many misleading
                          practice/group/temples around. So when you explore around, go with an open
                          mind. Don’t immediately go into it. Observe the organization you visit. You may
                          also check the locked topics at the heading of this forum. The one on rules and
                          regulation, there it stated some groups that we don’t recognize. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Be as simple as possible. If
                          its too complicated how can you know what is it you are looking for? When the
                          time you think you are ready to go into practice, choose the organization which
                          you think suits you best. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Here is a link which I think
                          you might need it in future if you are really keen to go into Buddhism. This
                          site listed out the fundamentals of Buddhism in order.</span></p>

                          how can you know if those Buddhist organization are reliable. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hi Pricey,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Buddhism is for everyone, so anyone can learn. I remember when I really got started with Buddhism, I begin by reading a lot of Buddhist books - and got several free distribution books from kong meng san monastery. I also signed up for the Basic Buddhism course in Kong Meng San,although I did not complete it, it helped me understand better what Buddhism is all about. Slowly from there, I moved on to the Sutras (Buddha's teachings).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You are not alone in these problems, each and everyone of us too have our own set of frustrations and problems - and in Buddhism, we learn these about these sufferings in life and how to walk the path to the end of these sufferings. Learning Buddhism is not going to be an overnight thing where after we graduate with a degree we stop, but an ongoing process of learning, applying, and understanding.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Buddhism is a lot about letting go. The past is over like a dream, and the present as we speak, is also becoming the past the next moment, and the future is yet to come. So we learn to let go of them all. <br><br>You may be interested to start from some e-book reading... <br><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188;" href="http://www.kmspks.org/download/index.htm">http://www.kmspks.org/download/index.htm</a><br><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188;" href="http://www.kmspks.org/download/ebook.htm">http://www.kmspks.org/download/ebook.htm</a><br>Their book "Buddhism for beginners" is pretty good - but no soft copy available.<br><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188;" href="http://www.kmspks.org/kmspks/publishedbooks2.htm">http://www.kmspks.org/kmspks/publishedbooks2.htm</a><br><br>You can also sign up for the Buddhism course at kong meng san when the next one is available.<br><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188;" href="http://www.kmspks.org/education/index.htm">http://www.kmspks.org/education/index.htm</a><br><br>The last time I attended the course at kong meng san, it was conducted by Richard Chia.

              <p>Hi Pricey369,</p>
              <p>Is a about enlightening on everyone's unconditional happiness, loving-kindness and serenity at its present moment. There are affinity that resulted in your foreseen circumstances which Buddhism provided you the answer and help you to let go. Your emotional discharge is due to lack of understanding on your unconditional bliss and serenity as well as the loving nature of others. What you grasped on was the deluded emotional memory of yourself reacted / arises negatively from external environment or living beings,  that is not real self. Buddhism helps you in recovering your true loving self and live happily and calmly. </p>
              <p>You would find love, joys and peace in exploring Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Amitabha</p>

              <p>This is a hard thing to admit but I am in need of genuine help. I will explain a little but in true essense is Buddhism worth a try for a person for me and if so where do I start?</p>
              <p>I am an expat living in Singapore for 3-4 months. To cut a very long story short I have been abused as a child by my parents and by the catholic church when placed in their care as a boy. I suffer from alcoholism although I have managed to fight this and stay dry for a month. I am a very emotional person and it stems from way back.<br> <br>A friend of mine has reccomended that Buddhism may be able to help me find myself to assist in forgiving others for my past and help me move forward to a better life for me, allowing me to feel like a person and help others which I love doing.<br> <br>I do hope you will be able to assist me as I would like to take a diferent path and find some hapiness for a change instead of blaming my past life for my current mistakes now. I need some guidance and I'm hoping this may be the place for me to really find inner peace and hapiness which I havent for many years.<br> <br>I thank you for your time.</p>
