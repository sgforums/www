            <div class='col-md body'>Everything seems to be your fault because you choose to see it as your fault, is that so? If thats so it is only your own perception. Practising Buddhism isn't only about chanting, it is about clearing all the garbage in our mind. Including our own attachment to perceptions of things/yourself because they are rooted in ignorance, and start to see things as it is without your own thoughts. There is also no need to feel bad about being at fault, we can learn from our mistakes.<br><br>Also, life does not become meaningful just by being clever, talented, hard working. Even the thought 'clever', 'talented', is also PERCEPTIONS. Throw them away - 'clever', 'talented', 'stupid', 'smart'. I believe everyone at one point will feel the same way as you... that life is meaningless, because things dont go his way, or he feel inadequate. But the true purpose of living is to live happily and help others.. to be a Bodhisattva who liberates himself and others. And that is by cultivating the dharma in our lives. So what if someone is clever and talented? Doesn't mean he dont have his own problems and is very happy.<br><br>Do see what I posted today - <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=185572" rel="nofollow">Awareness without analysis</a></div>
