              <p>I've been pondering reality for a long time and had been doing quite a lot of reading, with my main interest in physics, philosophy, psychology, various religions etc.</p>
              <p>My findings is as follows:</p>
              <p>1) There is no soul, no self, no free will, all that is an illusion.</p>
              <p>People might thought of buddhism from the above statement, but it is very true that our perception of self is just an illusion brought about by our various sensory receptors, such as eyes, ears, mind. When each sense are doing their job and our human instinct kicks in, a self develops. The notion of self disappears when we sleep and our sensory receptors shut down.</p>
              <p>From a scientific point of view, the universal law is that every effect is the result of a cause. That is the cause and effect theory. To put it plainly, every thoughts that go through your head right now is the resultant effect of the configuration of hormones, DNA coding, personal experience and it'll obey the rules of physics.</p>
              <p>In theory, a person who had the exact genetics coding with you and who happens to lead a life experience identical to you in every aspect will think exactly like you everytime. There is no water who can choose not to be composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and there is no wood that refuse to be a conductor of fire. Likewise, we as a being make up of physical atoms and molecules, has no control of our own self.</p>
              <p>By saying we have a free will, a soul, capable of making our own decision is a joke! It's the same as suggesting a water or wood has a mind of its own, which we know is not possible. The difference here is we're a complex biological being, which lead to the illusion that we've our own soul, free will etc, which in reality is really an illusion caused by the various cells in our body doing its own work.</p>
              <p>2) We're eternal, ever changing(reborning) from one state to another, never truely born and never truely die either.</p>
              <p>Buddhist believe in reincarnation, but the real reincarnation might be not what they think it is to be. The scientific community had given a really good answer to that.</p>
              <p>According to quantum theory, reality is in an ever continuing state of flux, nothing stays in the same state for a long time, they are constantly moving from one realm to another, from one state to another. It is impossible to have a stationery singularity, since it will move through the fabric of time anyway.</p>
              <p> When we die, all the atoms we have will be returned back to nature, some of the atoms will be remake into plants. some into another living creature, some into the air. I believe this is the reincarnation in reality. In another words, we're make up of all the atoms which are previously from other creature, state and which all combined to make up our temporary body for the time being.</p>
              <p>Another pillar of modern physics, E = mc(square), states that matter is convertable to energy, matter and energy is essential the same thing, they're the same thing in different state and convertable. Since we know energy can never die, but can only be convert from one type to another, so is it hard to see that our own very essence, the very thing that we're make up of, is eternal?</p>

              <p>Hmmm what I know is Buddhism does not have concept of reincarnation but rebirth. But sometimes these terms are used interchangeablely</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel that Buddha is like a social scientist, philosopher, psychologist, jungle surivor, doctor, teacher, debater, explorer.... multi-roles</p>

              <p>if one been following old Masters Chin Kung's talks, u'll know that He's been updated by the recent finding of scientists about the vastness of universe to the smallest particles of matter and energy. since He's been commentary on Hua Yen Sutra, which talk about how the worlds can exist within dust motes, and how a Mount Sumeru can be contained in a mustard seed.</p>
              <p>Scientists already found Quark, the smallest particle in the universe.  </p>

              <p>in Buddhism, equal to æž�å¾®ä¹‹å¾®, or é‚»è™šç©º neighbour of vaccum. but still not yet found that there's infinite universes within them. and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas can enter them.</p>
              <p>Scientists also found that they ONLY discovered 10% of the universe! 90% just simply disappeared!</p>
              <p>MCK said this is already very close to Alaya. and that Buddha know where the 90% is. they return back to Dharamkaya.</p>
              <p>so to MCK, Buddhadharma is also the highest science, apart from the highest philosophy. Buddha is all knowing.</p>

              <p>According to the diamond sutra chapter 31 that simply revealed - ä¸€å�ˆç›¸, where energy and mass are both convertible, mass to energy and energy into mass, is the inherent nature of all beings. It is nothing new in Buddhism as it was discovered about 2500 years ago recorded in sutra vs E = mc(square) which was the recent discovery of science.

              <p>1) There is no soul? I strongly disagree.<br> <br> When you begin to see ghosts/spirits/soul-fragments, you will know for 
              certain they exists. Even the soul of a live human being is visible if 
              you pay attention to its energetic aura/chakra.</p>
              <p>2) There is no self? I somewhat agree/disagree.<br> <br> Concept of self or no-self is quite meaningless to me. But I do know 
              that:  As a 3D being incarnated on Earth in the past, you were 
              automatically disconnected with the rest of the universe and you are 
              suppose to develop a sense of self and thus a self-centered orientation.
               As you mature and ascend to higher densities, you will have higher 
              awareness/conciousness and you will automatically lose the sense of 
              "self" or "seperation" as you will know that everything is connected.<br> <br> 3) There is no free-will? I strongly disagree.</p>
              <p>There is the Law of Free Will set by God/Creation. (Very serious, no joke)</p>

                      Every things we experienced is conditional, even so when we sense an apparition, the key word is "sense" or through our sensory organs. We sense something but we speculate of what we percieve. Hauntings are typically associated to certain locality. Often localised apparitions are "percieved" in a anomalous electromagnetic field, some may be residual imprints,while others with apparent ability to interact. "Seeing" are triggered by the body's reaction, usually in a hair raising moment and our speculative nature takes over. Usually, some may see ghosts while most of us may not in the same situation, so everything is dependent on various factors.  More often than not, haunted places has a reputation preceding them. 
                      
                       
                          
                      Most of us clings to our own existence, thinking of ourselves as an independent entity, apart from our body,and that why, clinging  to the notion of an entity as if it were previously a person, then an apparition is with human characteristics. However, if ghosts really have an independent nature,then  they  would to be more apparent, easily discernable . Also,  the aura of the dead is not the same as that of a living one, they have different luminosity.  However, that is not so,conditions need to be right for the apparition to be sensed. Often there is element of fear or uneasiness is present in sighthings. so I speculate that most ghost sightings are energies, triggered with various factors present. The visions we percieve are our interpretation of what the apparition should be.  Just our consciousness imprints are created when we are alive, we(our body) lose them when we die. And recieves them when we are born and combined with our birth and living new conditions recreate a new condition of awareness. Some traits will be dominant with condition prevailing whilst others will recede.
                          Our "self " is never independent of us, we only assume so.
