I also want to react and behave in the right way should I happen to be a live witness of such events.<br><br>Officially, Hari Raya Haji has ended with prayers and sacrificial slaughtering of sheep and distribution of fresh meat to needy people.<br><br>We all know that every sheep, on the day of Hari Raya Haji, are slaughtered in a halal manner, with prayers and a very quick slash of the animal's windpipe. This is as decreed by their God and accepted as a profound act of Allah's mercy and grace for those who are loyal and obedient to him.<br><br>However, now that I'm a Buddhist, it is not easy for me to understand and accept as readily as I would like to - even though I know that prayers are said prior to or during the slaughtering, that such customs can be considered to be without negative karma effects for all those involved, directly or indirectly.<br><br>In the Shurangama sutra (leng4 yan2 jing1), there is a verse that says:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>"Suppose a person eats a sheep. The sheep dies and becomes a person; the person dies and becomes a sheep, the same applies in all rebirths among the ten categories. Through death after death and birth after birth, they eat each other. The evil karma one is born with continues to the bounds of the future. The basis for all that is stealing and greed.<br><br>"Â‘You owe me a life; I must repay my debt to you.Â’ Due to such causes and conditions we pass through hundreds of thousands of eons in sustained cycle of birth and death."</strong></span><br><br>So it is correct or appropriate to consider in the context of Buddhist teachings that, the above verse applies to those who slaughters animals as part of their customs or religious practices, even if they had sincerely chanted prayers prior to and during the slaughtering?<br><br>Again I must emphasise here that I'm not trying to establish what is right or wrong about the religious or customary practices of others. I just want to know how to look upon such matters in right way as a Buddhist.<br><br>It is taught in scriptures that we as Buddha's disciples, should not only avoid killing or harming of any life, we should also try to save lives.<br><br>My question is: If you happen to be able to attend and witness the live  slaughtering as a Buddhist, what can you or how should you react from within?<br><br>First and foremost, you definitely cannot and must not stop them, either physically or verbally. That I'm pretty clear of.<br><br>But the Buddha has said that saving a life that is in imminent or immediate danger, takes priority over any kind of prayer or any event that you might have to attend to at the moment.<br><br>So personally for me, I think it would be rather uneasy for me to witness the live slaughter, both as a person and a Buddhist. And to ease my uneasiness and helplessness, I would most probably recite the Buddha's name in my heart and dedicate any merit to all those about to be slaughtered.<br><br>How or what would you think, feel or do if you happen to be invited to witness such events as a Buddhist?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Shurangama sutra should be taken in terms of principle than being a tit-for-tat sort of 'retribution', and never meant to mean that way. It is merely using that as an example to show something. Karma does not necessarily work in such a way. But the principle behind it does -- that suffering from karmic consequences will be resulted if you do acts such as animal slaughter. And that your victim may 'seek revenge' in a future life, cld be your enemy in a war, etc (just an example).<br><br>In Buddhism, killing is a bad karma regardless of what prayer, chanting, you did, even if you had repented, the karma is not easily cleared off completely.<br><br>Like you said there is little we can do except than to chant and dedicate merits for the beings. It is important that we be tolerant of others' religious beliefs and customs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first, we have to know that there a thousands of sheeps slaughtered as lamb everyday. And this celebration will not in any sense increase lamb slaughter number. And I think the demand in CNY for roast pork, chicken n roast duck is even more than for this.<br><br>Second, prayers are said for the lamb before they slaughter them, in fact even more elaborate prayers and thanksgiving for the meat of the lamb during this season than other normal days. Thus, the lamb is "gived" with more prays or "hui xiang". Also, people have the "gan en" or appreciative feeling for the meat.<br><br>Third, as normally people do not witness the slaughtering of the lambs, so they just eat without feeling the pain and suffering by the lambs when they were being slaughtered. By having people themselves slaughter the lambs and the witnesses, the people, seeing the lamb get killed. They will feel more "gan en" to the lamb and that will also feel sinful, that they "participated" in killing the lamb. Thus, next time, when they eat the lamb, they will feel something. This in buddhism is the idea of "fang sheng". Maybe they may even abstain from lamb meat, or eat less.</div>

And this celebration will not in any sense increase lamb slaughter number. And I think the demand in CNY for roast pork, chicken n roast duck is even more than for this.<br><br>Second, prayers are said for the lamb before they slaughter them, in fact even more elaborate prayers and thanksgiving for the meat of the lamb during this season than other normal days. Thus, the lamb is "gived" with more prays or "hui xiang". Also, people have the "gan en" or appreciative feeling for the meat.<br><br>Third, as normally people do not witness the slaughtering of the lambs, so they just eat without feeling the pain and suffering by the lambs when they were being slaughtered. By having people themselves slaughter the lambs and the witnesses, the people, seeing the lamb get killed. They will feel more "gan en" to the lamb and that will also feel sinful, that they "participated" in killing the lamb. Thus, next time, when they eat the lamb, they will feel something. This in buddhism is the idea of "fang sheng". Maybe they may even abstain from lamb meat, or eat less. </div></blockquote>I think your understanding of "fang Sheng" needs correction.
