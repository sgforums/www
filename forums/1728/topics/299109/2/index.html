            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by nightzip:<br>Second, prayers are said for the lamb before they slaughter them, in fact even more elaborate prayers and thanksgiving for the meat of the lamb during this season than other normal days. Thus, the lamb is "gived" with more prays or "hui xiang". Also, people have the "gan en" or appreciative feeling for the meat.</blockquote>No amount of prayers can stop the pain and suffering of the animals being slaughtered, so we should avoid participating in any slaughterings.<br><blockquote>Third, as normally people do not witness the slaughtering of the lambs, so they just eat without feeling the pain and suffering by the lambs when they were being slaughtered. By having people themselves slaughter the lambs and the witnesses, the people, seeing the lamb get killed. They will feel more "gan en" to the lamb and that will also feel sinful, that they "participated" in killing the lamb. Thus, next time, when they eat the lamb, they will feel something. This in buddhism is the idea of "fang sheng". Maybe they may even abstain from lamb meat, or eat less.</blockquote>Actually, in Buddhism, we should avoid eating the meat that have been slaughtered for us, or was slaughtered by us, or was demanded to be slaughtered by us.<br><br>Please read:<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">Five Clean Sources of Meat</a><br><br>The Buddha-dharma is infinite and there are in reality more than 84,000 Dharma doors, or methods by which we can embark to learn and practise Buddhism. Vegetarianism is just one of the many methods. To refrain from killing is merely a means of assisting us to progress in our cultivation. As a medicine, meat is permitted in the Buddhist precepts if it is required to cure a particular sickness. Buddhism cherishes compassion. However, killing and causing harm to life have their retributions. The world has no peace as victims and villains engage in a vicious cycle of vengeance and revenge, culminating in calamities and disasters, and inflicting suffering and misery across the world.<br><br><strong>Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter<br><br>To refrain from killing is fundamental to Buddhism. Regardless of life forms, we must not kill, we must not instruct others to kill, and it must not be killed for our sake, for example, to celebrate our birthday or because we were coming to dinner. These are three sources of clean meat.</strong><br><br>In Confucianism, benevolence also means to refrain from killing. It is said that heaven has the virtue of loving life. It cannot bear to witness the loss of life, let alone eat the flesh of those whose cries in death we have heard. Buddhism advocates compassion and loving-kindness to all sentient beings, regardless of their relation to you. It is only appropriate that we do not kill for our livelihood or for the purpose of celebrating occasions, such as births, birthdays, funerals or weddings. Meats are no different from the other foodstuffs purchased from the market if people do not witness the killing or hear the cries of the animal that is being slaughtered. If a differentiation between the two kinds of purchases and the taste of the meat do not exist in the mind, then the guilt is lighter. Together with the three mentioned earlier, these constitute the five sources of clean meat.<br><br>Meat eating however is a pre-condition to killing. If people refrain from eating meat, there will be no killing of animals for meat. Sadly, the human race has committed killings for aeons and is engaged in an endless cycle of vengeance and revenge over their past lives. For one who is slaughtered for meat in this life, it is probably because he had done the same to others in the past. The score is even, no more and no less.<br><br>People who eat meat from the five clean sources are advised to learn to chant the Buddha's name and the Buddhist mantras, so as to transfer the merits to those whose meat they are eating. They should also wish them an early rebirth in the human realm, to eliminate any thoughts of vengeance, to nurture their virtuous roots to benefit all sentient beings and together build a peaceful, caring and blissful pure land in this world. Only when this is promoted across the entire world, will we be able to eliminate hatred and vengeance, and enhance a mind of compassion and loving kindness. In this way we will be able to transform this Saha world into a pure land.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the intentions of my post have been made clear to all at the start.<br><br>My intentions were never to imply negatively of or judge any religious or customary practice. But rather, I was asking, in the context of Buddhist teachings of cause and effect, whether such acts would still bring about negative karma, even if sincere prayers are said prior or during the slaughtering. This applies to the general population too, of which some still frequent seafood restaurants or buy live sea animals to slaughter at home.<br><br>I asked this not only about a particular religion, I ask this of other folk practices as well. I ask not because I feel like judging or criticising, I ask because I want to affirm within myself that the concepts of cause and effect explained in Buddhism apply universally to all, regardless of who and what they are, and what measures they have taken to mitigate the known consequences of their act.<br><br>I do respect the law and the religious and cultural sensitivities of all in my country. that is why, I took pains to explain the intentions of my post. I too have the same anxiousness as any one who have read or are reading my post. I'm sorry if I have caused anyone to feel uneasy or troubled as a result of reading my post.<br><br>There's no place, no person whom I can pose this question to, for all would avoid answering or give very vague answers as most of you would. But yet it is my nature to want to see for myself that what I learn is not restricted or applicable to my small circle (Buddhists), it should be the truth for all if we believe what the Buddha said to be true.<br><br>Surely the Buddha would not have done what I have done, however that's because he clearly knows the truth within. Whereas for me, it's just reading from related books, listening to the views of fellow Buddhist and venerables, with no way to really test, and experience personally whether the concept of cause and effect does indeed apply to all, regardless of race, religion or nationality.<br><br>Moderators, thank you for not deleting my post from the start. Thank you for being understanding and tolerant of my ignorance and stubborness.<br><br></div>

I mean it's quite uncomfortable reading this from a Buddhist.<br><br>You see, a killing is a killing, there's no real or fake killing. Many cults love to use this theory ( and also of karma, souls changing body, souls flying to somewhere whatever etc) to justify many of their deviant thoughts and actions in killing people. All these have nothing to do with Buddhadharma.<br><br>One eg I can remember is a Cult in Japan ( still in operation tdy, although their leader who calls himself Buddha sometimes is in jail now with death sentence) had instructed his followers, ( which included a medical doctor, a scientist,  a lawyer, and some graduates from pretisgious universities) to kill "traitors" or "trouble makers" as well as ex-followers, by telling them that they were doing these people a favour by ending their bad karma; or that it was some kind of "testing" to see how well the ( to be killed)followers had achieved in their "practice"( so in a way they have no yuan chi ?). They are killing with "love and compassion" so " just follow my orders n do it."<br><br>Please don't misunderstand that I'm saying the place where nightzip went is a cult or something, definitely not, but maybe nightzip has misinterpreted Buddhadharma. Maybe AEN can help to clarify. Of cos I hope I was wrong in interpreting nightzip's post, of which I must appologise! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
