            <div class='col-md body'>Slaughtering of animals is a ruthless act. Rather, i will speak of sacrificing of animals here. In many religions, sacrificing animals are for appeasing deities and gods so that they will be happy and bless people. However, i wonder how far is this the truth. If they have imprinted bad karma and thus receiving its result, will it change if animals sacrifices are being made? It is also a very selfish thing. Sacrificing of animals also promotes selfishness. If others have to suffer just for one's happiness, isnt that one person very selfish to enjoy all by himself but instead an animal's percious life is sacrificed for him?<br><br>If one sacrifices animal and gain blessings, that may only signify that demons are at work.</div>

Rather, i will speak of sacrificing of animals here. In many religions, sacrificing animals are for appeasing deities and gods so that they will be happy and bless people. However, i wonder how far is this the truth. If they have imprinted bad karma and thus receiving its result, will it change if animals sacrifices are being made? It is also a very selfish thing. Sacrificing of animals also promotes selfishness. If others have to suffer just for one's happiness, isnt that one person very selfish to enjoy all by himself but instead an animal's percious life is sacrificed for him?<br><br>If one sacrifices animal and gain blessings, that may only signify that demons are at work. </div></blockquote>Well you are coming from a buddhist's perspective, however not everyone is a buddhist.<br><br>The slaughtering of animals would have definitely a different meaning in other religions.<br><br>What to do?<br><br>=)</div>
