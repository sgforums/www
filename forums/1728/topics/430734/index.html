              <p>The example in this article is superb...</p>
              <p><a href="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2010/12/did-the-universe-have-a-creator/">http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2010/12/did-the-universe-have-a-creator/</a></p>
              <p>From “Why ‘Intelligent Design’ Lacks Intelligence (The Daily Enlightenment Book 3)” – “Ironically, if it is a rule that ‘there must be a creator’, it means that this uncreated rule precedes the ‘creator’. This rule, being a law of nature, implies that nature precedes the ‘creator’, that no ‘creator’ can precede nature. Since nature precedes the ‘creator’, the ‘creator’ is of course not the ‘creator’ of nature. This simple proof shows that no one can create nature, and that there can be no ‘creator’.” Nature thus naturally ‘is’, while it allows for natural and willed (d)evolution of its inhabitants and the universe itself.</p>
              <p>A ‘creator’ by definition is not the created. But what if there is a ‘creator’ who is part of nature? If ‘he’ is part of nature, how can ‘he’ create it? For instance, a painted character in a painting cannot paint the whole painting, that includes ‘himself’. The painter cannot be (part of) that painted. The painter must precede the painting, just as the ‘creator’ before nature. Yet, there cannot be a ‘creator’ who precedes nature, as shown by the proof in the excerpt. And if a ‘creator’ is already part of nature, there will be no need (or ability) to create nature. This again proves there can be no ‘creator’.</p>
              <p>Also, to say a ‘creator’ is part of nature means ‘his’ essence is (omnipresent) within nature. The immeasurable suffering due to countless natural disasters in history however implies that if such a ‘creator’ exists, ‘he’ is not omnipotent, omni-benevolent or omniscient, as ‘he’ fails (to know how) to prevent any disaster with ‘his’ power, compassion and wisdom. Are we, if we are the created, instead to blame for such suffering? Surely, the inherent faults or fallibility of a ‘creator’s creation’ arise from the ‘maker’, and not from the created. So it seems, as the Buddha suggested, such a ‘creator’ idea was created from the lack of enlightenment.</p>

              Not going to the chicken and egg story direction.

              <p>I don't find the analogy 2009novice makes sense to why God cannot be the creator of the universe or such a "creator" idea is lack of enlightment by the argument you mention the article.  I am sorry to say so, but I think you too into Buddhism that you can't ....  also many also can't ..... Having said so, my position is that there is no loving God create the world.  There are much better rational arguments err.. than a play of twist of logic.</p>

              <p>sinwely mentioned that extreme view of determinism or no indeterminism is contrary to law of karma.  At least, I have to say law of karma is effected by past-life determinism, whether all, many or some, since you believe in karma.  I don't believe in karma becos karma does not make sense.</p>
              <p>Most scientific-based people of the mainstream science (not the religious-affliated science) do ask ourselves "who am i?" "where i come from?" " why am i here alive?" "how the universe come about?" etc.   But the answer we say is we accept humility to acknowledge we don't know, rather than boasting that we know the truth from some guru. Even though we may have our own sophisticated guesswork, we don't really make a fuss about it becos we do need evidences to prove.  Why does mainstream scientific-based people reject reincarnation as a fairy tale but accept evolution as a theory and a fact.?  Do we believe in science as infallible, of course not.. science can be flawed, becos man can be flawed .. but we can &amp; have to trust science to find our way out. </p>

                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">It was this important 
                              text, which states the belief that all physical circumstances and 
                              mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted. 
                              If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by 
                              our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism or 
                              determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will would 
                              be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much different 
                              from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our 
                              destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by an irresistible 
                              Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our life’s 
                              course, independent of any free action on our part, is essentially 
                              the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and Karma. 
                              One could easily be substituted for the other, because the ultimate 
                              operation of both forces would be identical. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Such a fatalistic 
                              doctrine is not the Buddhist law of Karma. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> According to 
                              Buddhism, there are five orders or processes<em> (niyama) </em>which 
                              operate in the physical and mental realms. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> They are: </span></p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Utu 
                                Niyama </strong>- physical inorganic order, e.g. seasonal phenomena 
                                of winds and </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">rains. 
                                The unerring order of seasons, characteristic seasonal changes and 
                                events, causes of winds and rains, nature of heat, etc., all belong 
                                to this group. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Bija 
                                Niyama</strong> - order of germs and seeds (physical organic order), 
                                e.g. rice produced from rice-seed, sugary taste from sugar-cane 
                                or honey, peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific 
                                theory of cells and genes and the physical similarity of twins may 
                                be ascribed to this order. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Karma 
                                Niyama</strong> - order of act and result, e.g., desirable and undesirable 
                                acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely as water 
                                seeks its own level so does Karma, given opportunity, produce its 
                                inevitable result, not in the form of a reward or punishment but 
                                as an innate sequence. This sequence of deed and effect is as natural 
                                and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Dhamma 
                                Niyama</strong> - order of the norm, e.g., the natural phenomena 
                                occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth. Gravitation 
                                and other similar laws of nature. The natural reason for being good 
                                and so forth, my be included in this group. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <strong>Citta 
                                Niyama</strong> - order or mind or psychic law, e.g., processes 
                                of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness, constituents 
                                of consciousness, power of mind, etc., including telepathy, telaesthesia, 
                                retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, thought-reading 
                                and such other psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern 
                                science. </span></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Every mental 
                              or physical phenomenon could be explained by these all-embracing five 
                              orders or processes which are laws in themselves. Karma as such is 
                              only one of these five orders. Like all other natural laws they demand 
                              no lawgiver. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Of these five, 
                              the physical inorganic order and the order of the norm are more or 
                              less mechanistic, though they can be controlled to some extent by 
                              human ingenuity and the power of mind. For example, fire normally 
                              burns, and extreme cold freezes, but man has walked scatheless over 
                              fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows; horticulturists have 
                              worked marvels with flowers and fruits; Yogis have performed levitation. 
                              Psychic law is equally mechanistic, but Buddhist training aims at 
                              control of mind, which is possible by right understanding and skilful 
                              volition. Karma law operates quite automatically and, when the Karma 
                              is powerful, man cannot interfere with its inexorable result though 
                              he may desire to do so; but here also right understanding and skilful 
                              volition can accomplish much and mould the future. Good Karma, persisted 
                              in, can thwart the reaping of bad Karma, or as some Western scholars 
                              prefer to say ‘action influence’, is certainly an intricate 
                              law whose working is fully comprehended only by a Buddha. The Buddhist 
                              aims at the final destruction of all Karma. </span></p>

                        have talked a lot about rebirth but is there any proof that we will be reborn 
                        when we die? </strong></span></strong></span></dt><dd> </dd><dd><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Not only is 
                        there scientific evidence to support Buddhist belief in rebirth, it is the 
                        only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it. There is not 
                        a scrap of evidence to prove the existence of heaven and of course evidence 
                        of annihilation at death must be lacking. But during the last 30 years parapsychologists 
                        have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their 
                        former lives. For example, in England, a 5 year old girl said she could 
                        remember her other mother and father and she talked vividly about what sounded 
                        like the events in the life of another person. Parapsychologists were called 
                        in and asked her hundreds of questions to which she gave answers. She spoke 
                        of living in a particular village, in what appeared to be Spain. She gave 
                        the name of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her neighbours’ 
                        names and details about her everyday life there. she also tearfully spoke 
                        of how she had been struck by a car and died of her injuries two days later. 
                        When these details were checked, they were found to be accurate. There was 
                        a village in Spain with the name the child had given. There was a house 
                        of the type she had described in the street she had named. What is more, 
                        it was found that a 23 year old woman living in the house had been killed 
                        in a car accident five years before.</span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Now how is 
                          it possible for a five year old living in England who had never been to 
                          Spain to know all these details? And of course, this is not the only case 
                          of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia’s 
                          Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this type in 
                          his books. He is an accredited scientist whose 25 year study of people 
                          who remember former lives is very strong evidence for the Buddhist teaching 
                          of rebirth. </span></p>

                        say that talk about devils is superstitious. Isn't talk about rebirth a 
                        bit superstitious too? </strong></span></strong></span></dt><dd> </dd><dd><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The dictionary 
                        defines superstition as a belief which is not based on reason or fact but 
                        on an association of ideas, as in magic. If you can show me a careful study 
                        of the existence of devils written by a scientist I will concede that belief 
                        in devils is not superstition. But I have never heard of any research into 
                        devils; scientists simply wouldn’t bother to study such things, so 
                        I say there is no evidence for the existence of devils. But as we have just 
                        seen, there is evidence which seems to suggest that rebirth does take place. 
                        So if belief in rebirth is based on at least some facts, it cannot be a 
                        superstition. </span>

                        Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced into the 19th 
                        century British school system and who was the first scientist to defend 
                        Darwin’s theories, believed that reincarnation was a very plausible 
                        idea. In his famous book "Evolution and Ethics and other Essays", 
                        he says: </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"In the 
                          doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical and Buddhist 
                          speculation found, ready to hand, the means of constructing a plausible 
                          vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man....yet this plea of justification 
                          is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty thinkers will 
                          reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution 
                          itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality; 
                          and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy is capable 
                          of supplying". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Then, Professor 
                          Gust Stromberg, the famous Swedish astronomer, physicist and friend of 
                          Einstein also found the idea of rebirth appealing: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"Opinions 
                          differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or not. In 
                          1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and reported 
                          by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from Deli) 
                          could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five hundred miles 
                          from Deli) which ended about a year before her 'second birth'. She gave 
                          the name of her husband and child and described her home and life history. 
                          The investigating commission brought her to her former relatives, who 
                          verified all her statements. Among the people of India reincarnations 
                          are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this case 
                          was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and similar cases 
                          can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory of the indestructibility 
                          of memory". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Professor Julian 
                          Huxley, the distinguished British scientist who was Director General of 
                          UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony with scientific thinking: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"There 
                          is nothing against a permanently surviving spirit-individuality being 
                          in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message is given 
                          off by a sending apparatus working in a particular ways. But it must be 
                          remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when 
                          it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the receiver. So 
                          with our possible spirit-emanation. It would never think or feel unless 
                          again "embodied" in some way. our personalities are so based 
                          on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would 
                          be in any true sense personal without a body of sorts. I can think of 
                          something being given off which could bear the same relation to men and 
                          women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus for mind". </span></p>

                          and down-to-earth people like the American industrialist Henry Ford found 
                          the idea of rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted to the idea of rebirth 
                          because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea, rebirth gives 
                          you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: </span></p>

                          to the point. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction. Work 
                          is futile if we cannot utilise the experience we collect in one life in 
                          the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal 
                          plan I realised that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was 
                          no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the clock. 
                          Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, 
                          but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls 
                          than others, and so they know more. The discovery of Reincarnation put 
                          my mind at ease. If you preserve a record of this conversation, write 
                          it so that it puts men’s minds at ease. I would like to communicate 
                          to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">So the Buddhist 
                          teachings of rebirth does have some scientific evidence to support it. 
                          It is logically consistent and it goes a long way in answering questions 
                          what the theistic and the materialistic theories fail to . It is also 
                          very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that gives you 
                          no second chance, no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in 
                          this life and no time to further develop the skills and abilities you 
                          have nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you fail to 
                          attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try again 
                          next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be able to 
                          correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to learn from 
                          your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or achieve in this life may 
                          well become possible in the next life. What a wonderful teaching! </span></p>

              <p>There aren’t that many fundamental, or root, principles of dharma. The Buddha said that his teaching is “a single handful.” A passage in the Samyutta-nikaya makes that clear. While walking through the forest, the Buddha picked up a handful of fallen leaves and asked the monks who were present to decide which was the greater amount, the leaves in his hand or all the leaves in the forest. Of course, they all said that there were more leaves in the forest, that the difference was beyond comparison. Try to imagine the truth of this scene; clearly see how huge the difference is. The Buddha then said that, similarly, those things that he had realized were a great amount, equal to all the leaves in the forest. However, that which was necessary to know, those things that should be taught and practiced, were equal to the number of leaves in his hand.<br><br>-Buddhadasa Bhikkhu</p>

              <p>I don't find the analogy 2009novice makes sense to why God
              cannot be the creator of the universe or such a "creator" idea is
              lack of enlightment by the argument you mention the article. 
              I am sorry to say so, but I think you too into Buddhism that you
              can't ....  also many also can't ..... Having said so, my
              position is that there is no loving God create the world. 
              There are much better rational arguments err.. than a play of twist
              of logic.</p>
              <p>Just you mention correctly that the immeasurable suffering due
              to countless natural disasters in history however implies that if
              such a ‘creator’ exists, ‘he’ is not omnipotent, omni-benevolent or
              omniscient, as ‘he’ fails (to know how) to prevent any disaster
              with ‘his’ power, compassion and wisdom.  this implies as well
              to Buddha, as well to be fair.</p>
              <p>sinwely mentioned that extreme view of determinism or no
              indeterminism is contrary to law of karma.  At least, I have
              to say law of karma is effected by past-life determinism, whether
              all, many or some, since you believe in karma.  I don't
              believe in karma becos karma does not make sense.</p>
              <p>Most scientific-based people of the mainstream science (not the
              religious-affliated science) do ask ourselves "who am i?" "where i
              come from?" " why am i here alive?" "how the universe come about?"
              etc.   But the answer we say is we accept humility to
              acknowledge we don't know, rather than boasting that we know the
              truth from some guru. Even though we may have our own
              sophisticated guesswork, we don't really make a fuss about it becos
              we do need evidences to prove.  Why does mainstream
              scientific-based people reject reincarnation as a fairy tale but
              accept evolution as a theory and a fact.?  Do we believe in
              science as infallible, of course not.. science can be flawed, becos
              man can be flawed .. but we can &amp; have to trust science to find
              our way out. </p>

              <p>We sit still, and examine our assumptions:-</p>
              <p>This is a contemplative process, we contemplate, we investigate on process, and then on I,  what is self,or rather, no self.</p>
              <p>Not based on hearsay, but us actually contemplately, personally investigating, results will vary!  </p>
              <p>Is creation a process, what becomes of creation before the process; namely what exist before creation and what are conditions necessary for creation to occur. Can creator, of independant will, be independent of process? Or is creation just an expression of a principle of impermanence and change? </p>
              <p> Just like  the expression of Nataraja,  as a new cosmos is being created, the previous one is destroyed. Before this existence, there was another , and another one before that.</p>
              <p>Or the Taoist point of creation, before there was one all is Chaos. So was is it before Chaos? Or should i just settle at that? </p>
              <p>What was it before the first Big Bang?Once you  established a point in chronology, there will always something present before it!</p>
