              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Power Behind the Robe</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aung Zaw 12 September 2017 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In this cover story first published in the October, 2007
              print issue of The Irrawaddy magazine, the editor explained why Burma’s general
              fear the influence of the Sangha. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This month marks the 10th anniversary of the Saffron
              Revolution, a series of mass protests led by Buddhist monks against the
              military government. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many social critics and political monks have long said the
              generals who kneel down before images of Buddha are the real threat to Buddhism
              and the Dhamma. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In this cover story first published in the October, 2007
              print issue of The Irrawaddy magazine, founding editor-in-chief Aung Zaw
              explains why Myanmar’s generals fear the influence of the Sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Lord Buddha shunned worldly affairs, but in his teachings
              he stressed the need for good governance and good rulers in the practice of
              politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha said: “When the ruler of a country is just and
              good, the ministers become just and good; when the ministers are just and good,
              the higher officials become just and good; when the higher officials are just
              and good, the rank and file become just and good; when the rank and file become
              just and good, the people become just and good.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If these admonitions are followed by the large community of
              monks—the Sangha—in predominantly Buddhist Burma, the lingering “love lost”
              relationship between the country’s military rulers and its monks should be no
              surprise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Over the last two decades, Burma’s Sangha community,
              officially estimated to number around 400,000, has had an uneasy relationship
              with the ruling generals, who have imprisoned several prominent, politically
              active monks or pongyis. It is estimated that since the present military regime
              came to power in 1988, about 300 monks have been defrocked and sentenced to
              long terms of imprisonment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Monks, considered “sons of Buddha,” are the biggest
              institution in Burma after the armed forces, which number more than 400,000
              soldiers and police.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In their close contacts with the common people and during
              their morning alms rounds of local households, the monks witness firsthand the
              suffering and poverty of ordinary Burmese citizens. They have a very clear
              picture of the deteriorating situation in Burma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">More importantly, they probably have a better network,
              connections and influence than politically active students, who are constantly
              watched, imprisoned or forced into exile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Who could imagine that these monks, living quietly in
              monasteries and studying Dhamma, would ever plan to rebel against the
              repressive regime? Yet history has shown that monks have long played a pivotal
              role in politics and that they would indeed dare such a bold and dangerous
              undertaking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The role of political pongyis is controversial and
              potentially threatening to the ruling elite, although there has been a
              continuing debate on whether monks really should involve themselves in
              politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Early Rebellion</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Monks were involved in early outbreaks of resistance against
              British colonization, joining lay people in taking up arms against the British
              after seeing King Thibaw sent into exile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Monks have their resistance martyrs—U Ottama, for instance,
              who led 3,000 rebels in the Salin area a year after the invasion of Mandalay.
              The rebel monk, also known as Bo Ottama, was captured and hanged by the British
              in 1889.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Interestingly, historians noted that monks who took up arms
              voluntarily defrocked themselves first, following the precept forbidding monks
              to take lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Another martyr, Saya San, who was an ex-monk, led a peasant
              uprising in Tharrawaddy opposing the tax system imposed by the British. Burma’s
              colonial masters sent 10,000 troops to quell the rebellion, capturing Saya San
              and sending him, too, to the gallows.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the top Burmese lawyers who defended Saya San at his
              trial was Dr. Ba Maw, who later became head of state in Burma’s Japanese-backed
              government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Not all monks advocated armed struggle. Two who preached
              nonviolent resistance, U Wisara and another monk named U Ottama, spent many
              years in prison for their opposition to colonialism and their names have joined
              the list of independence heroes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">U Ottama, a globe-trotting, well-respected monk from Arakan
              State, was a powerful speaker whose calls for independence were featured in the
              national newspaper Thuriya. He once famously told the British Governor Sir
              Reginald Craddock to go home to Britain, in a speech that landed him in prison.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Like U Ottama, U Wisara was imprisoned several times for his
              public speeches and died in jail in 1929 after 166 days of a hunger strike. His
              prison sentences included terms of hard labor, and he was also defrocked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Both monks became an inspiration to activists and students
              involved in the independence movement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Scholar Michael Mendelson wrote in his “Sangha and State in
              Burma,” that all politically active monks tended to be labeled by the colonial
              authorities as “political agitators in the yellow robes.” Interestingly, a
              similar term is used by Burma’s current leaders to describe protesting monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Historians wrote that the British authorities were surprised
              to learn the influential role of the Sangha community, and soon after the
              invasion of 1885 they abolished the position of “Supreme Patriarch,”
              or Thathana-baing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In former times, Burmese kings
              appointed Thathana-baing to govern the Sangha community and made them
              responsible for doctrinal instruction and discipline of all monks. But the
              position wasn’t accepted by the entire Sangha. The progressive Shwegin sect was
              one group that rejected it. Sectarianism created controversy and bitter rivalry
              among monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the Kon-Baung period in the 18th century, conflicts
              arose within the Sangha over how the monastic robes were supposed to be worn,
              and two conflicting sects arose—the so-called Ton Gaing and Yon Gaing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Burmese scholar Tin Maung Maung Than records that the
              Toun-goo and early Kon-Baung dynasties were drawn into the rivalry by their
              royal patronage of one party or the other. In 1782, King Bodawphaya intervened
              in the controversy by siding with Ton Gaing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One experienced colonial political officer, Col Edward
              Sladen, conversant with the power of the Sangha, advised British authorities to
              maintain the Thathana-baingsystem in order to head off conflicts in
              governing the predominately Buddhist country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The role of Thathana-baing was undoubtedly a
              complicated one, involving a direct link between the monarchy and the Sangha.
              The Thathana-baing wielded influence and could even intervene in
              state affairs. One respected abbot even persuaded King Mindon to abandon corvée
              labor for his irrigation projects. It’s ironic that the current regime argues
              that forced labor is a feature of Burmese tradition and a means of making
              merit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After independence, however, the influence of Buddhism and
              the Sangha went into decline, except for a period under the late prime minister
              U Nu, a devout Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">U Nu himself was ordained as a monk several times and rarely
              exploited Buddhism for his own political ends. Under his government, the Sixth
              Great Buddhist World Council was held in 1954, and he also created the Buddha
              Sasana Council.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tin Maung Maung Than noted in his book, “Sangha Reforms and
              Renewal of Sasana in Myanmar: Historical trends and Contemporary Practice”:
              “Because of various Gaing and sectarianism U Nu failed to take effective
              reforms in spite of institutionalization of Buddhism within the state
              superstructure and notwithstanding the holding of the Sixth Buddhist Synod in
              1954.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">U Nu also attempted to legalize Buddhism as the state
              religion in 1961. The attempt was considered to be a misguided policy, and it
              anyway failed to materialize as U Nu was ousted by Gen Ne Win one year later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ne Win regarded monks as a potential opposition and he
              developed a different strategy to control them. In the mid-1960s, his regime
              called a Sangha conference to issue monks with identification cards. Young
              monks and abbots stayed away from the gathering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It wasn’t until 1980 that Ne Win succeeded in containing the
              monks by establishing a “State Sangha Nayaka Committee,” after a carefully
              orchestrated campaign to discredit the Sangha. Part of the campaign was to
              discredit a famous monk, Thein Phyu Sayadaw, who was accused of romantic
              involvement with a woman. He was defrocked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Before the campaign, intelligence officers and informants of
              the government infiltrated the temples as monks and gathered information about
              monks and abbots.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Some well-known abbots, including Mahasi Sayadaw, an
              internationally respected monk who was invited by U Nu in 1947 to teach
              Vipassana meditation, were also targeted in the campaign.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Anthropologist Gustaaf Houtmann wrote in his paper “Mental
              Culture in Burmese Crisis Politics” that the regime had “distributed leaflets
              accusing Mahasi of talking with the nat spirits, and it was claimed that the
              Tipitaka Mingun Sayadaw, Burma’s top Buddhist scholar, had been involved in
              some unsavory incident two years after entering the monkhood.” Both monks were
              victims of their refusal to cooperate with the regime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A number of scholars and historians noted, however, that some
              abbots accused and charged by the government were indeed involved in scandals
              and had romantic relationship with women or nuns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The regime’s campaign sometimes took bizarre forms. Rumors
              were circulated, for instance, suggesting that one Rangoon monk, U Laba, was a
              cannibal. Several famous abbots were implicated in scandals and were either
              defrocked or fled to neighboring Thailand. Ne Win successfully launched a
              “Sangha reform”—also known as “Cleaning Up the Sangha.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The government managed to get some recognition from elderly
              Buddhists by forming the Sangha Committee. But Ne Win did not pretend to be a
              devout Buddhist. He rarely participated in Sangha meetings and held few
              religious ceremonies during the 26 years of his rule. Unlike current leaders,
              he was rarely seen with monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the 1988 uprising, however, his government asked the
              Sangha Committee to help restore order, and senior monks appeared in live
              television broadcasts appealing to the public for calm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In August, 1988, days after the massacre in Rangoon, monks
              expressed sorrow for the loss of life, but—to the surprise of many—they also
              appealed to the regime to govern in accordance with the 10 duties prescribed
              for rulers of the people. The appeal failed to calm the public mood, but the
              message did remind many Burmese of the “10 duties of rulers”—the monks were
              telling Ne Win to be a good ruler.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On August 30, the Working People’s Daily reported: “1,500
              members of the Sangha marched in procession through the Rangoon streets and
              gathered in front of the Rangoon General Hospital emergency ward, where they recited
              “Metta Sutta” in memory of rahans [monks], workers and students who fell in the
              struggle for democracy.” Many young monks were among the demonstrators.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For many Burmese, the struggle for democracy is not yet over
              and the discord between the Sangha and the ruling generals remains strong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Unlike Ne Win and U Nu, the generals who came to power in
              1988 openly and audaciously schemed to buy off the Sangha community. They have
              also claimed to be protectors of the Sangha, although their motive is to gain political
              legitimacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aside from holding numerous merit-making ceremonies, offering
              hsoon and valuable gifts to monks, the military leaders are launching
              well-publicized pagoda restoration projects throughout Burma. Nevertheless,
              confrontations between rebellious monks and the authorities continue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Mandalay in 1990, troops fired on the crowds, killing
              several people, including monks. Angered by the military’s brutality, Mandalay
              monks began a patta ni kozana kan, refusing to accept alms from members of the
              armed forces and their families.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The same action has now been taken by monks in several
              provinces after authorities beat protesting monks in Pakokka, central Burma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Patta ni kozana kan” can be called in response to any one of
              eight offences, including vilifying or making insidious comparisons between
              monks, inciting dissension among monks or defaming Buddha, the Dhamma or the
              Sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A “patta ni kozana kan” campaign can be called off if the
              offended monks receive what they accept as a proper apology from the
              individuals or authorities involved. This procedure involves a ceremony held by
              at least four monks inside the Buddhist ordination hall, at which the boycott
              would be canceled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Some monks in Burma may believe that the “patta ni kozana
              kan” of 1990 is still in effect, since they haven’t yet received any proper
              apology—only a harsh crackdown. At that time, monks refused to attend religious
              ceremonies held by military officials and family members.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In one incident, the Mandalay Division commander at the time,
              Maj-Gen Tun Kyi, who later became trade minister, invited senior monks and
              abbots to attend a religious ceremony but no one showed up. Military leaders
              realized the seriousness of the boycott and decided to launch a crackdown.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Mandalay alone, more than 130 monasteries were raided and
              monks were defrocked and imprisoned. As many as 300 monks nationwide were
              defrocked and arrested.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Former political prisoners recalled that monks who shared
              prison quarters with them continued to practice their faith despite being
              forced to wear prison uniforms and being officially stripped of their
              membership of the Sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Several monks, including the highly respected Thu Mingala, a
              Buddhist literature laureate, and at least eight other respected senior abbots,
              were arrested. Thu Mingala was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Apart from being stripped of their robes, imprisoned monks in
              Mandalay were forced to wear white prison uniforms and were taunted with
              nicknames instead of being addressed with their true titles, according to
              former political prisoners.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One year later, in 1991, the then head of the military junta,
              Snr-Gen Saw Maung, suffered a nervous breakdown and retired for health reasons.
              Buddhist Burmese still say this was punishment for his maltreatment of the
              monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The 1990 crackdown divided the Sangha community. The
              late Mingun Sayadaw, who was secretary of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka
              Committee, was ridiculed by young monks for not supporting the boycott
              campaign. He was at one time called “senior general Mingun Sayadaw,” and when
              he visited one temple in Mandalay young monks reportedly saluted him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Today, while rebellious monks are prepared to go to prison,
              many senior monks and abbots are allowing themselves to become government tools
              by accepting gifts and large donations from the generals. By cuddling up to the
              ruling generals, these elderly abbots can no longer speak for the Sangha
              community at large, let alone comment on the suffering of the Burmese people.
              The divisions between abbots and young monks have inevitably widened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The generals, on the other hand, won’t give up easily. In one
              spectacular bid to win the hearts and minds of the people, they borrowed a
              Buddha tooth relic from China and toured the country with it and also held a
              World Buddhist Summit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1999, military leaders renovated Shwedagon Pagoda, after
              the Htidaw, the sacred umbrella, had been removed amid reports of minor
              local earthquakes. Local people said the spirits of Shwedagon had been upset
              with the removal of the Htidaw. Restoration of the pagoda complex did nothing
              to help the generals’ image, though.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The generals have also applied “divide and rule” strategies
              in dealing with the Sangha community and the opposition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1996, the regime accused the National League for Democracy
              of infiltrating the Sangha with the aim of committing subversive acts against
              the authorities. The generals obviously did not want to see opposition leader
              Aung San Suu Kyi developing too close a relationship with the monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In an attempt to neutralize the political role of Suu Kyi,
              the government sent a famous, London-based monk, Dr. Rewatta Dhamma, to
              visit the detained opposition leader in 1995. Claiming to be a peace-broker
              between Suu Kyi and the generals, the monk shuttled between her and top leaders.
              But his mission failed and he returned to London. Skeptics believe the generals
              had merely used U Rewatta in a bid to persuade Suu Kyi to relinquish politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ironically, the regime leaders publicly accused Suu Kyi of
              being a communist and of sacrilege because she had said in a campaign speech
              that “any human being can become a Buddha in this life.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Soon after her release from her first term of house arrest in
              1995, Suu Kyi immediately traveled to Karen State, followed by infuriated
              intelligence officers. She went there to make an offering to “Thamanya
              Sayadaw.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Traditionally, temples have provided hiding places for
              activists, and in 1988 monks offered shelter to fugitives from the intelligence
              authorities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At one time, the regime even placed restrictions on
              opposition members, preventing them from ordaining as monks. Like universities
              and schools, politically active monasteries are under heavy surveillance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The widely respected abbot Bhaddanta Vinaya, known as
              Thamanya Sayadaw because he lived on Thamanya Hill, was involved in projects to
              help villagers in the area, work that was shunned by the generals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He was revered not only for the mystical powers he was said
              to possess, but also because of his refusal to kowtow to the regime leaders. He
              once famously refused to accept the gift of a luxury vehicle from the then
              powerful intelligence chief Gen Khin Nyunt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Khin Nyunt could not buy Thamanya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It may indeed be wrong to assume that Burma’s regime leaders
              are devout Buddhists. The generals and their families seem to place more trust
              in astrology and numerology than in Buddhist ritual. They treasure white
              elephants and lucky charms and are constantly seeking advice from astrologers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Birds of a feather, such as the generals and their chief
              astrologers, not only flock together but fall together, too. Ne Win’s family
              astrologer, Aung Pwint Khaung, was arrested in 2002 when the former dictator
              and his family were charged with high treason.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Khin Nyunt’s chief astrologer, Bodaw Than Hla, was imprisoned
              after the former Prime Minister and Military Intelligence chief was toppled in
              2004.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many Burmese may find it hard to believe that their military
              leaders are actually preserving Buddhism. Even when they are building pagodas
              and erecting Buddha images, the projects are based on astrological predictions
              and readings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Who, for instance, advised Ne Win to ride a wooden horse on
              his aircraft and to ask the pilot to circle his birthplace nine times? Who
              advised him to issue banknotes in denominations of 45 and 90 kyat?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Who advised Khin Nyunt to dress up in women’s clothing,
              complete with the signature flower that Suu Kyi wears, in order to steal power
              from “the Lady”? Who told Than Shwe to move his capital to central Burma?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It certainly wasn’t a belief in Buddhist tenets. Nor does
              Buddhism permit the military to beat, defrock, imprison and kill monks.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The decline of Buddhism and the rise of militarism in Burma
              are a source of concern for the people of Burma. Thus, it is no surprise to
              hear social critics and political pongyismaintain that the generals who
              kneel down before images of Buddha are the real threat to Buddhism
              and Dhamma.</span></p>
