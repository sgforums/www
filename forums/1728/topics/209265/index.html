            <div class='col-md body'>First of all is your father a buddhist or from some other religion? Does he know the dharma and has he taken refuge? You should ask your father to chant amitabha himself. You may want to buy those amitabha players and play for your father. And how ill is he? If it is possible find a buddhist venerable to speak to your father.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are already an extraordinary individual.<br><br>Just simply chanting may not serve any purpose. A certain level of sincerity, mindfullness and a still-mind are needed. It will be very effective, if you can do these. It will be also very helpful, if more family members can participate. They are all equally great, whether it is the Great Compassion Mantra, or the Earth Store Sutra, or .....<br>What is more important, which I suggest, is to choose one which you have the affinity with. A good choice will probably be just recitation of "NaMoAMiTuoFo" or "NaMoDiZhangWangPuSa" or "NaMoGuanShiYinPuSa". Remember, the most important thing still is about the state of your mind, during the recitation.<br><br>The most immediate action which you can consider doing, to mitigate bad karma is by going vegetarian and to dedicate merits to your father, the more family members the merrier. Avoid all unwholesome deeds and cultivate all good deeds using the name of your father. Volunteer for something etc.<br><br>If you come from a Chinese background, you may be interested to get the "DiZhangPuSa BenYuanJing" - 101 VCDs by Master Chin Kung. It will be very helpful.<br><br>NaMo AMiTuoFo.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by depth09:<br><strong>Hi all,<br><br>I'm pretty much a novice in buddhism and am opening my doors in learning and practising the teaching of the great one, buddha.

Always stay positive and never give up.</div>

Hard to imagine what one's state of mind is when hitting the john... Similarly, the individual mind might drift when lying down, (that position is hard to sustain as well)...

I hope that he will get better soon or have an auspicious rebirth.<br><br>What you can try to do for your father is take a clean cup and fill it with clean water and recite the great compassion dharani 7 times, and then recite the medicine master dharani 108 times while leaving the clean up of water on the altar. You may want to continue this for 49 days and hopefully during that time he will be healed.<br><br>You may also want to recite to Amitabha Buddha for your father, as well as heart sutra.<br><br>May your father regain his health and may his sickness come to an end.<br><br>Namo Medicine Master Vaidurya Light Tathagata _/\_</div>

I can give you the number of the person in charge if you want to know.<br>It is usually fully booked very fast so be quick.<br><br>Whatever good things you do, try not to think about the merit, the less you think about it, the more merit you will get. You should mention "merit" only when you want to convince a non-buddhist or novice to practise.<br><br>Di Zhang Wang suttra is very powerful, you can chant it at any place including your home.<br>I remember my late uncle who passed away years ago, when he is in coma state, suddendly he waked up and tear off all the medical instruments on his body and started to talk with different style &amp; tone, everyone is so scared, my mum saw it then go in and do chanting of Di Zhang Wang suttra at the same time placing some chanting book on his bed, he immediately turns back to normal.<br><br>When one do chanting, nearby dharma protector or even ghosts will politely come and listen, they will feel happy and grateful of you, because you give them chance to listen to dharma. But if you chant with a disrespect attitude towards the sutra, they will get very angry.<br><br>Whatever effects the above will help to achieve, I hope it will make you more dedicated in your spiritual path.</div>
