              <p>other than chanting you can try practicing vipassana:</p>
              <p> </p><p>Recently had a MSN discussion with two forummers about dharma practice. Conversation took place on 31st March 2011 (Fri),</p>
              <p>Here is an edited version of the conversation:</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> If there is no self, then who and what is restraining the mind, following the virtues (i.e. practicing the dharma)?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>That's
                                                                     like asking who or what is hearing, who or what is seeing, who or what 
                                                                    is acting. This is actually a falsely put question as never was there a 
                                                                    doer, perceiver, or agent in the first place. Seeing, action, all arise 
                                                                    according to inter-dependent origination. No agent or source is 
                                                                    necessary as such.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> Where does volition come from?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Volition
                                                                     does not come from anywhere, just as burning fire does not come from 
                                                                    north, south, east, or west. Neither does fire go to north, south, east,
                                                                     west, up, down, or anywhere in-between after blowing out. Rather, it is
                                                                     by the requisite/supporting conditions that fire burns: in this case, 
                                                                    by virtue of candle and oil, fire manifests. By the cessation of those 
                                                                    conditions, the fire ceases as well. This is the principle of dependent 
                                                                    origination:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>When there is this, that is.<br> With the arising of this, that arises.<br> When this is not, neither is that.<br> With the cessation of this, that ceases.</strong></blockquote>
              <p>Everything functions in the way of dependent origination, neither coming from somewhere nor going somewhere.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> So, restraining the mind and following the virtues come from the conditions of hearing the dharma and self-discipline?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>You can say so.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> What about those who hear the dharma, have self-discipline, yet have 
                                                                    conditions that prevent them from following Buddhism such as karmic 
                                                                    obstruction?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Karma only becomes obstruction if you 
                                                                    allow karma to obstruct you. If you are obstructed by karma, it is 
                                                                    termed karmic obstruction.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What is the condition that allows their karma to obstruct them from dharma?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Difficult
                                                                     to say as situations differ so you need to provide concrete cases. Just
                                                                     an example: If a person doesn't live near a dharma center, then he 
                                                                    reasons to himself that he does not have a karmic affinity with dharma, 
                                                                    then that becomes a karmic obstruction. If nonetheless, regardless of 
                                                                    distance, that person is earnest, he will be willing to go an extra mile
                                                                     in search of right guidance. This is just an example I made up.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>So does it <em>become </em>karmic obstruction or is it <em>because </em>of karmic obstruction (that the person does not come to practice the dharma)?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>In this case, it becomes a karmic obstruction, partly due to his personal attitude, intention, decisions.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>Ah okay. I found a good link for what I need answered: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/mahasi-anat/anat03.htm"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic; color: #000000;">http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/mahasi-anat/anat03.htm</span></a></p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Good
                                                                     link. Mahasi Sayadaw is likely a fully liberated arahant. That said I 
                                                                    don't practice his method of noting, even though it is a very efficient 
                                                                    practice (countless practitioners have reported swift progress using 
                                                                    that method). In my own opinion, Thusness's method of Vipassana is a 
                                                                    little more direct and closer to the method laid out in Mahasatipatthana
                                                                     Sutta, and I personally prefer that method. Noting is sort of noting 
                                                                    and labelling sensations quickly in order to perceive it's three 
                                                                    characteristics (impermanency, unsatisfactoriness, non-self), however 
                                                                    it is not the direct experience of luminous clarity like what Thusness's
                                                                     method result in. At some point (when the noting practitioner 
                                                                    progresses to a more advanced phase of his practice), the practitioner 
                                                                    will have to drop it's noting and resort to a direct method such as that
                                                                     elucidated by Thusness and Mahasatipatthana Sutta.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What is Thusness's method?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>As elucidated in his conversation with Ck/truthz: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1</a></p>

                                                                     sense the luminous clarity in every vivid arising. You have to be

              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What is luminous clarity exactly?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Pause

              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>Hmmm...</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Don't 'Hmmm', just the obvious sensate reality shining fully in its immediacy!</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>I

                                                                    is apperception: you no longer feel like 'I' look at the world through

                                                                    perceiving them. When this 'I' is seen through and dropped, the vivid, 
                                                                    luminous, alive quality of the sensate universe is revealed... when 'I' 
                                                                    go into abeyance, it is as if everything 'stands out' bursting forth in

              <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> But how do I practice this "technique"? To be able to sense luminous 
                                                                    clarity, you have to remove the concept of a self through direct

                                                                    what Thusness said to Truthz: this is one type of gradual path. In that 
                                                                    practice you basically have to pay attention to every felt sensation, 
                                                                    feeling, perception, until apperception arises (where it is no longer 
                                                                    'I' seeing, but perception sees itself). A direct way of contemplating 
                                                                    Anatta is like Bahiya Sutta style contemplation (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html</a>). Or contemplating on Ven Buddhaghosa verses on Anatta (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/05/no-self-no-doer-conditionality.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/05/no-self-no-doer-conditionality.html</a>), or the two stanzas of Anatta by Thusness (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html</a>)</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What
                                                                     is the difference between Thusness's method of Vipassana and Mahasi 
                                                                    Sayadaw's method of Vipassana? Both involves noting and observing 
                                                                    sensations.</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>No. Thusness's method does not involve 
                                                                    noting. Noting is like labeling, noting things that arise. It is like within a cycle, how many sensations you can note, within 1 second, you note 'thinking, sound, taste, bird chirping, anger, gone, heart-beat, sound'... note every single arising as fast as possible, but through the noting you missed the immediate luminosity. Wheareas, Thusness's 
                                                                    way is to deeply sense and penetrate into the minutest details of every 
                                                                    point of luminous clarity.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>So you stop labelling things and just observe?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>In Thusness's Vipassana method, yes. 
                                                                    Just fully sense the minutest detail of this breath, the sensation of 
                                                                    your feet, the cool breeze carressing your skin, the colours and shapes 
                                                                    of your room. Everything sort of stands out in a pristine clarity you 
                                                                    never noticed before. You might also experience details of the things 
                                                                    you are seeing that you have missed out before. It can become very 
                                                                    blissful.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>What about the more direct ways like 
                                                                    contemplation of Bahiya Sutta? In a way, I already know the intellectual
                                                                     "answer". What is there to ponder? Isn't following a train of thought 
                                                                    in meditation discouraged?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>This is not just about an 
                                                                    intellectual agreement. The contemplation is about finding out what 'in 
                                                                    seeing just the seen', 'no hearer only hearing', etc actually mean or 
                                                                    how it applies to direct experience. You have to experientially deconstruct the perception of an agent, perceiver, by contemplating those verses, then you realize that perception/sensation/sight itself is the seeing - there is no other seer. The seeing/seen happens of itself, all are self-luminous activities happening on their own accord. And there is, in seeing, only the seen, the self-luminous activity. I do not want to overcomplicate this and it appears I have been repeating myself... but you will come to see what this all is in direct experience.</p>

              <p><strong>Me: </strong>Good.

              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>I thought you said that (NDNCDIMOP/PCE) wasn't possible without having realized no-self directly?</p>

              <p>However the insight of Anatta is different: 
                                                                    it is the realization that 'in seeing always just the seen', 'in hearing
                                                                     always just the heard' - always already so! By nature so! Seeing IS the
                                                                     seen. There can be no doubt about this. This is the realization that 
                                                                    results in a permanent shift of perception and isn't merely a temporary 
                                                                    experience of apperception/NDNCDIMOP/PCE.</p>
              <p>Now it should be noted 
                                                                    that there are two paths that lead to realization of Anatta. The gradual
                                                                     path may develop and lengthen the NDNCDIMOP/PCE until a point of utter 
                                                                    stability, then the realization follows/occurs. Whereas the direct path 
                                                                    investigates and arises the insight much earlier, while stability only 
                                                                    comes some time after the realization.</p>
              <p>As an analogy, the gradual path is like polishing the mirror to reveal the luminosity. While the direct path aims for direct realization straight away.</p>
              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>At which stage will you know that you are freed from samsara?</p>
              <p><strong>Me: </strong>When
                                                                     you clear all ten fetters (which occurs progressively via the four

                                                                    is their ultimate aim. Whereas for Mahayana practitioners, they aim

              <p><strong>Participant 2: </strong>If you have not cleared the 10 fetters, what happens?</p>

                                                                     (non returner) enlightenment, your liberation is assured at most in 1

              <p>In short, as long as you have even the initial realization of Anatta and clears the first 3 fetters, you have attained 
                                                                    Stream Entry (Sotapanna), and your Nirvana is assured as you have already

              <p><strong>Participant 1: </strong>The assurance of a pre-determined Nirvana is so attractive.</p>

              <p>not sure. as the rinpoche that they learned from, said, he's returning to his country for a longer retreat in the mountain. he had a very good disciple who had learn from him and had very good memory, bit like Ananda. heard there's a very tough 7 day meditation retreat where student cannot eat! or perhaps had very very little food. and it's in a very small enclosed dark room where all the walls are black. that said in such an extreme circumstances of suffering, one is able to see the nature of the mind. but this one really need a guru to guide.</p>

              <p>not sure. as the rinpoche that they learned from, said, he's returning to his country for a longer retreat in the mountain. if u notice, there's this person (<a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:ZrQ#@rX">ZrQ#@rX</a>) , recently changed, who once in a while will post information regarding tibetan buddhism.  </p>

              <p><br>Singapore no mountain. What about those people with hindrances going to mountain for longer retreat? Esoteric Buddhism is supposed to be extremely high and there ought to have no restriction on site, places, ambience etc dwelling in meditation insight  as it has merged with everything like lotus flower, like a family, like oneself. Purely non-dualistic.</p>

              <p>true. Esoteric Buddhism is like a white cloth dip in colored dye yet still remain white. eventually it's to practice purity amidst impurity. it's an advance method in purification.  i guess it's a bit contradicing that Esoteric Buddhism is more established in a rural Tibet. perhaps to get to such level, need a calmer place to practice first. like we purelanders also go to pureland first to practice before returning to samsara.</p>
