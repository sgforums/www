              difficult to carry out in Japan</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">12.12.2016 Julian Ryall
              Deutsche Welle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Restrictive laws, religious
              concerns and a lack of knowledge about donating organs mean that
              medically-sophisticated Japan lags well behind other nations in life-saving
              operations. Julian Ryall reports from Tokyo.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Across Japan, an estimated 40,000
              people are waiting to hear that a suitable donor organ has been found for them
              and that they can undergo the operation required for them to once again lead a
              normal life. Most, however, will not receive the call before their medical
              complaints claim their lives.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">According to the Japan Organ
              Transplant Network, some 5,000 people are on the national list for a heart
              transplant operation, a further 13,000 require a new kidney and 350 need
              replacement livers. Hundreds more need to undergo lung or pancreas transplant
              operations and other procedures that require a donor.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Of the total, hundreds are
              children, including 120 who require new kidneys and 50 who are awaiting a heart
              operation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Falling short</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">However, the organ donation rate
              in Japan falls far short of what is required to meet patients' needs, with only
              0.7 donations for every million people who die.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">That figure pales against
              donation rates in other advanced nations. The figure for the US is 28.5 per
              million people and 27.5 per million in France, although the highest figure is
              in Spain, where the rate has reached 39.7 million people.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence, there were a
              mere 58 organ transplants in Japan in 2015. In the same year in the US, more
              than 30,000 people received life-saving new organs. In Spain, there were 4,360
              transplant operations.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"It is very difficult in
              Japan for legal and cultural reasons," admits Naoko Manabe, a coordinator
              for the Tokyo-based Japan Organ Transplant Network.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"The requirements for confirming
              brain death are very stringent," she said, pointing to the 1997 Organ
              Transplant Law. Under the law, donations are only permitted if brain death is
              confirmed and with prior written consent of both the donor and the family,
              although recent amendments to the law have dropped the requirement for written
              consent.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"Also, it can be difficult
              to obtain consent from families and Japan is primarily a Buddhist nation, so
              there is a sense among many people here that the body should not be divided
              after death," she said. "Many families say they do not want their
              relative's organs to be removed, even if they can be used for someone
              else."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Doctors' reluctance</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">There is also a degree of
              reluctance on the part of some in the medical community here - even though
              Japanese medicine is renown around the world as amongst the most advanced. That
              reluctance dates back to 1968, when Professor Juro Wada carried out what is
              accepted as Japan's first transplant from a brain-dead donor. After the heart
              transplant, carried out at Sapporo Medical University, the recipient died and
              Prof. Wada was charged with murder.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The case triggered a long-running
              controversy over the definition of brain death and, for the following three
              decades, no transplants from brain-dead donors were carried out in Japan.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"We are working hard to
              promote the idea of organ donation, such as through leaflets that we distribute
              to junior high schools each year," Manabe said. "We want to encourage
              families to talk about this issue among themselves and, through education, to
              get more people to carry donor cards."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Makoto Watanabe, a lecturer in
              communications and media at Hokkaido Bunkyo University, fears that any changes
              in society towards acceptance of the concept of donating organs will be slow
              and incremental.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"Doctors and scientists are
              being very careful not to take risks in the operations that they carry out,
              such as organ transplants, and that means they are conservative in their
              work," he told DW. "Japan is known for having some of the best
              medical technology in the world and some excellent doctors, so I have the same
              questions as many people awaiting a transplant; why can't these operations be
              carried out?"</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Connection to the body</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Watanabe also believes that in
              Japan there is a stronger sense of connection to the body, even after death,
              than in other parts of the world.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"The reasons may be
              philosophical or religious, but there is a sense that the body is sacrosanct,
              that life is given by our parents and that the person should remain whole, even
              in death."</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">And while Watanabe says he has
              seen promotional campaigns on television encouraging people to carry donor
              cards, he worries that younger generations of Japanese - the age group that has
              most enthusiastically embraced organ donations in other countries - are not sufficiently
              responsive.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"My fear is that they are
              still too self-centered and do not think very hard about how they might help or
              contribute to society," he said. "I see young Japanese as being
              rather closed off and conservative, yet at the same time freer of many of
              Japan's traditional values.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">"If these age groups can be
              targeted with facts and information on how they could help, that might have a
              positive impact, but I am not convinced they can be reached in sufficient
              numbers," he added.</p>
