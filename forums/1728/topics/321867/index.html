              <p>It just means there is no self-entity or atman that passes on from one life to the next. No fixed, permanent entity called 'Self' can be found.</p>

                                      such a question was to reject it as an improper question. Having
                                      rejected the question he would then inform the questioner of what
                                      he ought to have asked: "With what as condition is there

                                      taught as the continuation of a process, and not as the passing on
                                      of any sort of entity. For a more complete exposition of the

              <p><em> -----------------------------<br><br> The point is that the question is phrased wrong requiring at best
                                      an ambigious answer that will confuse more than edify.<br><br> Buddha in fact discussed this with Sharputra saying that if he
                                      answers the question "yes there is something that undergoes birth"
                                      people will become confused and assuem there is a permanent self
                                      that undergoes retribution of action and so on. Likewise, if he
                                      answers the question "no, there is nothing which undergoes rebirth"
                                      likewise there are those who will assume there are no consequences
                                      of action and so on and will therefore feel no compelling need
                                      observe the principles of karma and so on.<br><br> Therefore when asked the question "what takes rebirth" he points
                                      out that question itself is flawed.<br><br> The question should be "Why is there birth?" The answere to that
                                      question is easy. There is birth, i.e. suffering, because of
                                      affliction and action.<br><br> As long as the aggregates are afflicted, afflicted aggregates will
                                      continue to be appropriated.<br><br> In Madhyamaka it is explained there is birth because of the innate
                                      self-grasping "I am" appearing to the afflicted mind. It is
                                      asserted that what appropriates birth in a new series of aggregates
                                      is the mental habit "I am." That "I am" is baseless, has no
                                      correspondence in the aggregates or seperate from them or in any
                                      one of them, just as a car is not found in its parts, seperate from
                                      them, or in any one of the parts. Nevertheless, the imputation
                                      "car" allows us to use cars effectively. Likewise, the mental habit
                                      "I am" is proper as both the agent of action and the object upon
                                      which it ripens even though it is basically unreal and has no basis
                                      in the aggregates, outside the aggregates, or in any one of them,
                                      but allows us to treat the aggreates as a nominally designated
                                      "person".</em></p>

              <p>Buddhism is not a philosophy, Buddhism provides the path that leads one out of suffering, attain enlightenment, and the ultimate liberation and bliss of nirvana. Philosophy is an aspect concerning the study of Buddhist teachings. But one does not need to be an expert in philosophy to understand Buddhism.</p>
              <p>To truly understand Buddhism, is to experience the truths in direct experience. Everything spoken in Buddhism must be penetrated in this very moment of experience. Whether it is ultimate reality or even things like karma, rebirth and so on... it is realisable in direct experience.</p>
              <p>To realise our true nature, we practice the path taught by the Buddha, to intuitively sense and fully experience the truths arising right now in this moment of experience.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is an entire way of life as well -- awakened living. See eight fold path. It covers all aspects of one's being (from wisdom, ethical conduct to mental development) that leads to awakening.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is the English translation of the Pali word <em>Sati</em>. <em>Sati</em> is an activity. What exactly is that? There can be no precise 
                                    answer, at least not in words. Words are devised by the symbolic 
                                    levels of the mind and they describe those realities with which 
                                    symbolic thinking deals. Mindfulness is pre-symbolic. It is 
                                    not shackled to logic. Nevertheless, Mindfulness can be experienced 
                                    -- rather easily -- and it can be described, as long as you 
                                    keep in mind that the words are only fingers pointing at the 
                                    moon. They are not the thing itself. The actual experience lies 
                                    beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness could be 
                                    describes in completely different terms than will be used here 
                                    and each description could still be correct. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is a subtle process that you are using at this very moment. 
                                    The fact that this process lies above and beyond words does 
                                    not make it unreal--quite the reverse. Mindfulness is the reality 
                                    which gives rise to words--the words that follow are simply 
                                    pale shadows of reality. So, it is important to understand that 
                                    everything that follows here is analogy. It is not going to 
                                    make perfect sense. It will always remain beyond verbal logic. 
                                    But you can experience it. The meditation technique called Vipassana 
                                    (insight) that was introduced by the Buddha about twenty-five 
                                    centuries ago is a set of mental activities specifically aimed 
                                    at experiencing a state of uninterrupted Mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                    you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instant 
                                    of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the thing, before 
                                    you identify it. That is a stage of Mindfulness. Ordinarily, 
                                    this stage is very short. It is that flashing split second just 
                                    as you focus your eyes on the thing, just as you focus your 
                                    mind on the thing, just before you objectify it, clamp down 
                                    on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of existence. 
                                    It takes place just before you start thinking about it--before 
                                    your mind says, "Oh, it's a dog." That flowing, soft-focused 
                                    moment of pure awareness is Mindfulness. In that brief flashing 
                                    mind-moment you experience a thing as an un-thing. You experience 
                                    a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is interlocked 
                                    with the rest of reality, not separate from it. Mindfulness 
                                    is very much like what you see with your peripheral vision as 
                                    opposed to the hard focus of normal or central vision. Yet this 
                                    moment of soft, unfocused, awareness contains a very deep sort 
                                    of knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind and objectify 
                                    the object into a thing. In the process of ordinary perception, 
                                    the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to be unobservable. We 
                                    have developed the habit of squandering our attention on all 
                                    the remaining steps, focusing on the perception, recognizing 
                                    the perception, labeling it, and most of all, getting involved 
                                    in a long string of symbolic thought about it. That original 
                                    moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over. It is the purpose 
                                    of the above mentioned Vipassana (or insight) meditation to 
                                    train us to prolong that moment of awareness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                    this Mindfulness is prolonged by using proper techniques, you 
                                    find that this experience is profound and it changes your entire 
                                    view of the universe. This state of perception has to be learned, 
                                    however, and it takes regular practice. Once you learn the technique, 
                                    you will find that Mindfulness has many interesting aspects. </span></p>

                                    Characteristics of Mindfulness</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is mirror-thought. It reflects only what is presently happening 
                                    and in exactly the way it is happening. There are no biases. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is non-judgmental observation. It is that ability of the mind 
                                    to observe without criticism. With this ability, one sees things 
                                    without condemnation or judgment. One is surprised by nothing. 
                                    One simply takes a balanced interest in things exactly as they 
                                    are in their natural states. One does not decide and does not 
                                    judge. One just observes. Please note that when we say "One 
                                    does not decide and does not judge," what we mean is that 
                                    the meditator observes experiences very much like a scientist 
                                    observing an object under the microscope without any preconceived 
                                    notions, only to see the object exactly as it is. In the same 
                                    way the meditator notices impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
                                    selflessness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">It 
                                    is psychologically impossible for us to objectively observe 
                                    what is going on within us if we do not at the same time accept 
                                    the occurrence of our various states of mind. This is especially 
                                    true with unpleasant states of mind. In order to observe our 
                                    own fear, we must accept the fact that we are afraid. We can't 
                                    examine our own depression without accepting it fully. The same 
                                    is true for irritation and agitation, frustration and all those 
                                    other uncomfortable emotional states. You can't examine something 
                                    fully if you are busy reflecting its existence. Whatever experience 
                                    we may be having, Mindfulness just accepts it. It is simply 
                                    another of life's occurrences, just another thing to be aware 
                                    of. No pride, no shame, nothing personal at stake--what is there, 
                                    is there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is an impartial watchfulness. It does not take sides. It does 
                                    not get hung up in what is perceived. It just perceives. Mindfulness 
                                    does not get infatuated with the good mental states. It does 
                                    not try to sidestep the bad mental states. There is no clinging 
                                    to the pleasant, no fleeing from the unpleasant. Mindfulness 
                                    sees all experiences as equal, all thoughts as equal, all feelings 
                                    as equal. Nothing is suppressed. Nothing is repressed. Mindfulness 
                                    does not play favorites. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is nonconceptual awareness. Another English term for <em>Sati</em> is 'bare attention'. It is not thinking. It does not get involved 
                                    with thought or concepts. It does not get hung up on ideas or 
                                    opinions or memories. It just looks. Mindfulness registers experiences, 
                                    but it does not compare them. It does not label them or categorize 
                                    them. It just observes everything as if it was occurring for 
                                    the first time. It is not analysis which is based on reflection 
                                    and memory. It is, rather, the direct and immediate experiencing 
                                    of whatever is happening, without the medium of thought. It 
                                    comes before thought in the perceptual process. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is present time awareness. It takes place in the here and now. 
                                    It is the observance of what is happening right now, in the 
                                    present moment. It stays forever in the present, surging perpetually 
                                    on the crest of the ongoing wave of passing time. If you are 
                                    remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When 
                                    you then become aware that you are remembering your second-grade 
                                    teacher, that is mindfulness. If you then conceptualize the 
                                    process and say to yourself, "Oh, I am remembering", 
                                    that is thinking. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is non-egoistic alertness. It takes place without reference 
                                    to self. With Mindfulness one sees all phenomena without references 
                                    to concepts like 'me', 'my' or 'mine'. For example, suppose 
                                    there is pain in your left leg. Ordinary consciousness would 
                                    say, "I have a pain." Using Mindfulness, one would 
                                    simply note the sensation as a sensation. One would not tack 
                                    on that extra concept 'I'. Mindfulness stops one from adding 
                                    anything to perception, or subtracting anything from it. One 
                                    does not enhance anything. One does not emphasize anything. 
                                    One just observes exactly what is there--without distortion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is goal-less awareness. In Mindfulness, one does not strain 
                                    for results. One does not try to accomplish anything. When one 
                                    is mindful, one experiences reality in the present moment in 
                                    whatever form it takes. There is nothing to be achieved. There 
                                    is only observation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is awareness of change. It is observing the passing flow of 
                                    experience. It is watching things as they are changing. it is 
                                    seeing the birth, growth, and maturity of all phenomena. It 
                                    is watching phenomena decay and die. Mindfulness is watching 
                                    things moment by moment, continuously. It is observing all phenomena--physical, 
                                    mental or emotional--whatever is presently taking place in the 
                                    mind. One just sits back and watches the show. Mindfulness is 
                                    the observance of the basic nature of each passing phenomenon. 
                                    It is watching the thing arising and passing away. It is seeing 
                                    how that thing makes us feel and how we react to it. It is observing 
                                    how it affects others. In Mindfulness, one is an unbiased observer 
                                    whose sole job is to keep track of the constantly passing show 
                                    of the universe within. <em>Please note that last point.</em> In Mindfulness, one watches the universe within. The meditator 
                                    who is developing Mindfulness is not concerned with the external 
                                    universe. It is there, but in meditation, one's field of study 
                                    is one's own experience, one's thoughts, one's feelings, and 
                                    one's perceptions. In meditation, one is one's own laboratory. 
                                    The universe within has an enormous fund of information containing 
                                    the reflection of the external world and much more. An examination

                                    is participatory observation. The meditator is both participant 
                                    and observer at one and the same time. If one watches one's 
                                    emotions or physical sensations, one is feeling them at that 
                                    very same moment. Mindfulness is not an intellectual awareness. 
                                    It is just awareness. The mirror-thought metaphor breaks down 
                                    here. Mindfulness is objective, but it is not cold or unfeeling. 
                                    It is the wakeful experience of life, an alert participation 
                                    in the ongoing process of living. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is an extremely difficult concept to define in words -- not 
                                    because it is complex, but because it is too simple and open. 
                                    The same problem crops up in every area of human experience. 
                                    The most basic concept is always the most difficult to pin down. 
                                    Look at a dictionary and you will see a clear example. Long 
                                    words generally have concise definitions, but for short basic 
                                    words like 'the' and 'is', definitions can be a page long. And 
                                    in physics, the most difficult functions to describe are the 
                                    most basic--those that deal with the most fundamental realities 
                                    of quantum mechanics. Mindfulness is a pre-symbolic function. 
                                    You can play with word symbols all day long and you will never 
                                    pin it down completely. We can never fully express what it is. 
                                    However, we can say what it does.</span></p>

                                    Fundamental Activities</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">There 
                                    are three fundamental activities of Mindfulness. We can use 
                                    these activities as functional definitions of the term: (a) 
                                    Mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed to be doing; 
                                    (b) it sees things as they really are; and (c) it sees the deep 
                                    nature of all phenomena. Let's examine these definitions in 
                                    greater detail. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(a) 
                                    Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing</em> . In meditation, you put your attention on one item. When your 
                                    mind wanders from this focus, it is Mindfulness that reminds 
                                    you that your mind is wandering and what you are supposed to 
                                    be doing. It is Mindfulness that brings your mind back to the 
                                    object of meditation. All of this occurs instantaneously and 
                                    without internal dialogue. Mindfulness is not thinking. Repeated 
                                    practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental 
                                    habit which then carries over into the rest of your life. A 
                                    serious meditator pays bare attention to occurrences all the 
                                    time, day in, day out, whether formally sitting in meditation 
                                    or not. This is a very lofty ideal towards which those who meditate 
                                    may be working for a period of years or even decades. Our habit 
                                    of getting stuck in thought is years old, and that habit will 
                                    hang on in the most tenacious manner. The only way out is to 
                                    be equally persistent in the cultivation of constant Mindfulness. 
                                    When Mindfulness is present, you will notice when you become 
                                    stuck in your thought patterns. It is that very noticing which 
                                    allows you to back out of the thought process and free yourself 
                                    from it. Mindfulness then returns your attention to its proper 
                                    focus. If you are meditating at that moment, then your focus 
                                    will be the formal object of meditation. If your are not in 
                                    formal meditation, it will be just a pure application of bare 
                                    attention itself, just a pure noticing of whatever comes up 
                                    without getting involved--"Ah, this comes up...and now 
                                    this, and now this... and now this". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is at one and the same time both bare attention itself and the 
                                    function of reminding us to pay bare attention if we have ceased 
                                    to do so. Bare attention is noticing. It re- establishes itself 
                                    simply by noticing that it has not been present. As soon as 
                                    you are noticing that you have not been noticing, then by definition 
                                    you are noticing and then you are back again to paying bare 
                                    attention. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    creates its own distinct feeling in consciousness. It has a 
                                    flavor--a light, clear, energetic flavor. Conscious thought 
                                    is heavy by comparison, ponderous and picky. But here again, 
                                    these are just words. Your own practice will show you the difference. 
                                    Then you will probably come up with your own words and the words 
                                    used here will become superfluous. Remember, practice is the 
                                    thing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(b) 
                                    Mindfulness sees things as they really are</em>. Mindfulness 
                                    adds nothing to perception and it subtracts nothing. It distorts 
                                    nothing. It is bare attention and just looks at whatever comes 
                                    up. Conscious thought pastes things over our experience, loads 
                                    us down with concepts and ideas, immerses us in a churning vortex 
                                    of plans and worries, fears and fantasies. When mindful, you 
                                    don't play that game. You just notice exactly what arises in 
                                    the mind, then you notice the next thing. "Ah, this...and 
                                    this...and now this." It is really very simple. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(c) 
                                    Mindfulness sees the true nature of all phenomena</em>. Mindfulness 
                                    and only Mindfulness can perceive the three prime characteristics 
                                    that Buddhism teaches are the deepest truths of existence. In 
                                    Pali these three are called <em>Anicca</em> (impermanence), <em>Dukkha</em> (unsatisfactoriness), and <em>Anatta</em> (selflessness--the absence 
                                    of a permanent, unchanging, entity that we call Soul or Self). 
                                    These truths are not present in Buddhist teaching as dogmas 
                                    demanding blind faith. The Buddhists feel that these truths 
                                    are universal and self-evident to anyone who cares to investigate 
                                    in a proper way. Mindfulness is the method of investigation. 
                                    Mindfulness alone has the power to reveal the deepest level 
                                    of reality available to human observation. At this level of 
                                    inspection, one sees the following: (a) all conditioned things 
                                    are inherently transitory; (b) every worldly thing is, in the 
                                    end, unsatisfying; and (c) there are really no entities that 
                                    are unchanging or permanent, only processes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    works like and electron microscope. That is, it operates on 
                                    so fine a level that one can actually see directly those realities 
                                    which are at best theoretical constructs to the conscious thought 
                                    process. Mindfulness actually sees the impermanent character 
                                    of every perception. It sees the transitory and passing nature 
                                    of everything that is perceived. It also sees the inherently 
                                    unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned things. It sees that 
                                    there is no sense grabbing onto any of these passing shows. 
                                    Peace and happiness cannot be found that way. And finally, Mindfulness 
                                    sees the inherent selflessness of all phenomena. It sees the 
                                    way that we have arbitrarily selected a certain bundle of perceptions, 
                                    chopped them off from the rest of the surging flow of experience 
                                    and then conceptualized them as separate, enduring, entities. 
                                    Mindfulness actually sees these things. It does not think about 
                                    them, it sees them directly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                    it is fully developed, Mindfulness sees these three attributes 
                                    of existence directly, instantaneously, and without the intervening 
                                    medium of conscious thought. In fact, even the attributes which 
                                    we just covered are inherently unified. They don't really exist 
                                    as separate items. They are purely the result of our struggle 
                                    to take this fundamentally simple process called Mindfulness 
                                    and express it in the cumbersome and inadequate thought symbols 
                                    of the conscious level. Mindfulness is a process, but it does 
                                    not take place in steps. It is a holistic process that occurs 
                                    as a unit: you notice your own lack of Mindfulness; and that 
                                    noticing itself is a result of Mindfulness; and Mindfulness 
                                    is bare attention; and bare attention is noticing things exactly 
                                    as they are without distortion; and the way they are is impermanent 
                                    <em>(Anicca)</em> , unsatisfactory <em>(Dukkha)</em>, and selfless 
                                    <em>(Anatta)</em>. It all takes place in the space of a few mind-moments. 
                                    This does not mean, however, that you will instantly attain 
                                    liberation (freedom from all human weaknesses) as a result of 
                                    your first moment of Mindfulness. Learning to integrate this 
                                    material into your conscious life is another whole process. 
                                    And learning to prolong this state of Mindfulness is still another. 
                                    They are joyous processes, however, and they are well worth 
                                    the effort. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                    is the center of Vipassana Meditation and the key to the whole 
                                    process. It is both the goal of this meditation and the means 
                                    to that end. You reach Mindfulness by being ever more mindful. 
                                    One other Pali word that is translated into English as Mindfulness 
                                    is <em>Appamada</em> , which means non-negligence or an absence 
                                    of madness. One who attends constantly to what is really going 
                                    on in one's mind achieves the state of ultimate sanity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The 
                                    Pali term <em>Sati</em> also bears the connotation of remembering. 
                                    It is not memory in the sense of ideas and pictures from the 
                                    past, but rather clear, direct, wordless knowing of what is 
                                    and what is not, of what is correct and what is incorrect, of 
                                    what we are doing and how we should go about it. Mindfulness 
                                    reminds the meditator to apply his attention to the proper object 
                                    at the proper time and to exert precisely the amount of energy 
                                    needed to do the job. When this energy is properly applied, 
                                    the meditator stays constantly in a state of calm and alertness. 
                                    As long as this condition is maintained, those mind-states call 
                                    "hindrances" or "psychic irritants" cannot 
                                    arise--there is no greed, no hatred, no lust or laziness. But 
                                    we all are human and we do err. Most of us err repeatedly. Despite 
                                    honest effort, the meditator lets his Mindfulness slip now and 
                                    then and he finds himself stuck in some regrettable, but normal, 
                                    human failure. It is Mindfulness that notices that change. And 
                                    it is Mindfulness that reminds him to apply the energy required 
                                    to pull himself out. These slips happen over and over, but their 
                                    frequency decreases with practice. Once Mindfulness has pushed 
                                    these mental defilements aside, more wholesome states of mind 
                                    can take their place. Hatred makes way for loving kindness, 
                                    lust is replaced by detachment. It is Mindfulness which notices 
                                    this change, too, and which reminds the Vipassana meditator 
                                    to maintain that extra little mental sharpness needed to keep 
                                    these more desirable states of mind. Mindfulness makes possible 
                                    the growth of wisdom and compassion. Without Mindfulness they 
                                    cannot develop to full maturity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Deeply 
                                    buried in the mind, there lies a mental mechanism which accepts 
                                    what the mind perceives as beautiful and pleasant experiences 
                                    and rejects those experiences which are perceived as ugly and 
                                    painful. This mechanism gives rise to those states of mind which 
                                    we are training ourselves to avoid--things like greed, lust, 
                                    hatred, aversion, and jealousy. We choose to avoid these hindrances, 
                                    not because they are evil in the normal sense of the word, but 
                                    because they are compulsive; because they take the mind over 
                                    and capture the attention completely; because they keep going 
                                    round and round in tight little circles of thought; and because 
                                    they seal us off from living reality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These 
                                    hindrances cannot arise when Mindfulness is present. Mindfulness 
                                    is attention to present time reality, and therefore, directly 
                                    antithetical to the dazed state of mind which characterizes 
                                    impediments. As meditators, it is only when we let our Mindfulness 
                                    slip that the deep mechanisms of our mind take over -- grasping, 
                                    clinging and rejecting. Then resistance emerges and obscures 
                                    our awareness. We do not notice that the change is taking place 
                                    -- we are too busy with a thought of revenge, or greed, whatever 
                                    it may be. While an untrained person will continue in this state 
                                    indefinitely, a trained meditator will soon realize what is 
                                    happening. It is Mindfulness that notices the change. It is 
                                    Mindfulness that remembers the training received and that focuses 
                                    our attention so that the confusion fades away. And it is Mindfulness 
                                    that then attempts to maintain itself indefinitely so that the 
                                    resistance cannot arise again. Thus, Mindfulness is the specific 
                                    antidote for hindrances. It is both the cure and the preventive 
                                    measure. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Fully 
                                    developed Mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and 
                                    utter absence of clinging to anything in the world. If we can 
                                    maintain this state, no other means or device is needed to keep 
                                    ourselves free of obstructions, to achieve liberation from our 
                                    human weaknesses. Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness. 
                                    It sees things deeply, down below the level of concepts and 
                                    opinions. This sort of deep observation leads to total certainty, 
                                    and complete absence of confusion. It manifests itself primarily 
                                    as a constant and unwavering attention which never flags and 
                                    never turns away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">This 
                                    pure and unstained investigative awareness not only holds mental 
                                    hindrances at bay, it lays bare their very mechanism and destroys 
                                    them. Mindfulness neutralizes defilements in the mind. The result 
                                    is a mind which remains unstained and invulnerable, completely 
                                    unaffected by the ups and downs of life.</span></p>
