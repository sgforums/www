            <div class='col-md body'>I just got into a car accident and is fresh from a state of shock. Car skid while going down a bend. It was raining and probably the brakes wasn't strong enough for the speed im going. The car spun and hit the railings. Thank godness no other vehicles was around at that time and thus no one was hurt. Its going to hurt the pocket though, with the bills expecting to hit $8000 plus.<br><br>I realised that in my life so far, im constantly reminded. A reminder not to get too carried away at times, not to get too confident, to review my life constantly and to take a fresh perspective. The reminders has been getting stronger as life goes on. I was probably too engaged in my work, my studies, my gf, to take a breather and spend some serious time contemplating. The distractions got into me and i just rush blindly everywhere, anywhere. This reminder was probably long overdue.<br><br>Prior to tonight, i thought i was in a state of peace. I thought the confident i carried was a result of me being able to keep a calm mind and maintain inner peace. I thought my peace within puts me above, enabling me to ignore all life distractions and focus on the task at hand. Realization: I overestimated and overrated myself. I was blinded. I was lost. I relinquish the times where i spend time reflecting what's important and whats not. I thought i know and i thought its enough.<br><br>Im glad no was was injure in this accident. I do hope that with the raining season this couple of weeks, forumers reading this post would be able to benefit from my experience. Please drive slow. Drive safe.<br><br>Forumers reading this post, kindly share your opinions as well. In the perspective of buddhism, how does the car accident evolves? From why it will happen, to the life lessons its trying to bring. Im still very much in shock and needs to regain my feet and rest. Awaiting for your contributions tomorow.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just met an accident too. Something similar to your scenario. However, i doze off was the reason that cause the accident. it was early morning...<br><br>luckily noone else was hurt. i really think this is one part of my life where i will think tru. I'm fortunately that i did not suffer any injuries but what a pity to the car. it is damage heavily.<br><br>I feel bad as the car was my parents'. They always remind me not to drive the car so late as you will tend to be tired and doze off while driving. Just felt that i really have to learn my lesson.<br><br>The past 2 years - i have not been sleep long enough. Usually just taking 4 to 5 hours of sleep except on weekends. I always tell myself that life is short and must make full use of my time. Guess i'm wrong in a sense that a person really requires a good sleep to start a day afresh.<br><br>It's a painful experience that i have but it really make me know how much my parent care for me. Upon the hit, they didn't really scold me or just say a few things and ask about my condition. Initially, i feel really upset as i have just damage their car.<br><br>As what ya mention, we always tend to take things for granted. I slowly picking up myself and thanks a superior being which allow me to survive tru it. As mention by the police usually this case - the victim suffer alot of injuries and bruises. I'm lucky indeed. LIfe is really fragile.<br><br>Upon hitting, one kind soul stop over and ask me how am and helped me sort out some matters before leavin the scene without even leaving a name. But i will remember that kind soul.<br><br>it has been almost one whole day - yet i'm thiking abt the past events and wonder to myself what i have learn from this experience.<br><br>Tomorrow, i will go and claim my insurance see face the consequences.</div>
