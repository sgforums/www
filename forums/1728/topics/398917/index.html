              <p>I'm not addicted to porn, but I'm sure all of us including myself have some form of addiction whether they are deemed as 'harmful' or 'not so harmful'. So I believe this will apply to most or all of us.</p>

              a while now I have had some trouble in reconciling some of my behaviour with my
              understanding of the teachings of Advaita. The fruits of this path have
              definitely been self evident in ways that I cannot describe. However, in a very
              honest and worldly sense, I have also been struggling with an addiction to lust
              and pornography.</span></em></p>

              obviously feel very conflicted about this. It seems to me that this addictive,
              lustful behaviour is certainly not in alignment with the truth that Advaita
              points to.  However, when the impulse arises to watch it, my mind creates
              a convincing dialogue that says, “There is no doer. This is a spontaneous
              occurrence. Don't resist this. All is meaningless," etc. </span></em></p>

              then act out on the impulse and afterwards the mind rationalizes the behaviour
              with more of this pseudo logic, falsely claiming that it never left Awareness.
              This is, of course, coupled with all sorts of guilt, inadequacy and other
              afflictive emotions. Common sense tells me that something is amiss. </span></em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Thank you for your honest email. It compels a thorough response:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Addiction of any sort, be it to inappropriate sexual behaviour,
              alcohol, drugs, smoking or any milder form of behaviour, almost always has its
              origin in the belief and, more importantly, the feeling of being separate,
              limited and located.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">The most common form in which this belief and feeling of
              separation manifest is the subtle and not-so-subtle rejection of the current
              situation - that is, the “I don’t like what is going on” and the “I want
              something other than what is going on.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">These two attitudes - traditionally referred to as fear and desire
              - are the two faces of the apparent separate self. They are two of the most
              common forms of ‘resistance to what is,’ otherwise known as the ‘search for
              happiness.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">In other words, ‘the apparent separate entity,’ ‘resistance to
              what is,' and the ‘search for happiness’ via various objects, substances or
              experiences, are synonymous.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">These three states are, in fact, one and the same state and could
              also be called ‘ignorance’ or the ‘ignoring of the true nature of experience.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Therefore, ‘the apparent separate entity,’ ‘resistance to what
              is,’ and ‘the search for happiness’ are incompatible with the experiential
              understanding of the non-dual nature of experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">You have seen that clearly and it is that ‘seeing’ which enables
              you to avoid the pitfall of pseudo Advaita that you rightly diagnose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">So, let us go to the origin of this ‘resistance to what is’
              because if we start anywhere else, for instance, if we were to start with a
              secondary cause, we would not be going to the root of the problem and, sooner
              or later, our search will reappear, often in a more virulent form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">In fact, the term ‘addiction’ is used precisely to describe this
              more virulent form of the search that has become chronic and destructive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">The origin of ‘resistance to what is,’ is the belief that what we
              are, Awareness, is limited to and located within a body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">This imaginary identification of our self with an object (which,
              upon investigation turns out, itself, to be imaginary) creates an apparent
              entity. The real ‘I’ of Awareness seems, as a result, to become the limited ‘I’
              of the imagined separate entity. That is, we <em>think</em> and <em>feel</em> that we
              are a body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">This apparent entity, being made out of an intermittent object is,
              by definition, unstable, always threatened with change, decay and
              disappearance. Hence the fear that resides at its heart and its natural
              corollary, desire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">The fear comes from the feeling that when this intermittent
              sensation (the form in which the body is appearing in this moment) disappears,
              ‘I’ will disappear with it. And the desire comes from the apparent need to
              substantiate this fleeting entity we believe and feel ourselves to be, in order
              to perpetuate its apparent existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">To begin with this fear and desire manifest in the most innocuous
              forms of behaviour, the most common of which is unnecessary thinking, the
              almost constant chatter or commentary that most of us are familiar with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">This innocuous commentary is the simplest form of the ‘resistance
              of what is.’ It is the repetitive background chatter which ensures that
              attention is almost always diverted away from the simplicity of ‘what is.’ This
              is the primal addiction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">‘What is’ is deemed too boring, plain and uneventful to be worthy
              of attention and thinking provides an alternative dream world into which to
              escape from the boredom or discomfort of the moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">One honest look at our thinking will show that the majority of it
              serves no practical, intelligent or creative purpose. It is simply a sort of
              ‘filler’ that serves to distract attention from the boredom of ‘what is.’ The
              vast majority of our thoughts about the past and future serve only to
              legitimise and perpetuate this type of thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">However, precisely because this type of thinking is deemed
              innocuous (in the sense that it has no harmful effect on the body or on
              society) it passes, for the most part, unnoticed and is indeed encouraged by
              our culture in general.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">For this reason, it is the most common and effective form of
              addiction that almost everyone is engaged in, for the most part, unknowingly.
              And therein lies its efficiency at keeping the sense of separation alive. Hence
              it is the perfect refuge for the apparently separate self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">However, as we grow up this subtle thinking is no longer
              sufficient to keep the anxiety, dis-ease and discomfort of the sense of
              separation at bay and we begin to turn to stronger forms of avoidance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">These stronger forms of avoidance are the common forms of addiction
              with which we are familiar - over working, over eating, excessive activity,
              addiction to money, excessive use of TV, excessive use of alcohol, smoking,
              drugs, pornography etc. etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

              whatever reason, we may be persuaded to change from one addiction to another,
              but in our hearts this fire of discomfort, avoidance and rejection, and its
              inevitable counterpart in the search for happiness (which is just another name

              have that seem to validate the existence of a separate self. You have a good
              mind. Use it to explore your experience and come to your own conclusion. See
              that there is absolutely no experiential evidence for such a belief.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">This conviction will initiate a much deeper exploration of the

              tobacco and drugs, is that it is mainly at the level of thoughts and feelings
              and does not have a lasting effect on the body which, in the case of drinking,
              smoking and drugs, is often irreparable or, at least, lasts long after the
              impulse to indulge them has been dissolved.</span></p>

              if, to begin with, it is only for half a minute, put a little space between you
              and the fulfilment of the impulse. As time goes on this period of time can be
              extended until you find yourself always as this space, as it were.</span></p>

              probably wont be! Most likely, the impulse (which is, in fact, the bare face of
              the separate self, the separate ‘I’ in its raw form) on finding that it is no
              longer relieved or fulfilled, will probably display itself in full force. It
              will rebel.</span></p>

              you that your impulses are perfectly OK, that you will only do it one more
              time, that it is all an expression of Awareness, that there is nobody there
              doing it, etc., etc., but more importantly to all the uncomfortable feelings in
              the body that rise up, demanding to be acted upon and relieved.</span></p>

              is, when sought, found to be non-existent. It is necessary in most cases to
              carry out this investigation at a rational level thoroughly, in order to come
              to this conviction. </span></p>

              separate entity, the feelings are exposed for what they are - raw bodily
              sensations. These bodily sensations are, in fact, neutral. They only acquire
              their apparent negativity (and hence their need to be avoided with addictive
              behaviour) when coupled with the belief in a separate self. </span></p>

              bodily sensations that, as such, have no power of us, that is, no power to make

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Being seen clearly is the one thing the apparent self and its
              entourage of strategic activity cannot stand. There may and probably will be
              tremendous resistance both in your thoughts and in your body to this gentle,
              non-interventive but firm approach.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">However, once the mechanism of the separate self, both at the
              level of the mind and at the level of the body, has been truly seen through,
              its foundation has been removed, and it is only a matter of time before the
              patterns of behaviour which depended upon its apparent existence for their
              survival, diminish and disappear.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Having said that, these addictions are very powerful and in most
              cases this deep explorative approach is best facilitated over a period of time
              with one in whom peace and understanding are established.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">In the end it is not the exploration that facilitates the peace
              and understanding, but rather the peace and understanding which allows the
              investigation and exploration to unfold and slowly, in most cases, reabsorbs,
              as it were, the apparently separate self and all its patterns of thinking,
              feeling and acting, back into itself.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">One last thing: as we sit allowing these thoughts and, more
              importantly, uncomfortable feelings to arise, it is important not to have any
              subtle agenda with them, not to ‘do this’ in order to ‘get rid of them.’ That
              would be more of the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">Just allow the full panoply of thoughts and feelings to display
              themselves in your allowing and indifferent presence. In time their ferocity
              will die down, revealing subtler and subtler layers of thinking and feeling on
              behalf of a separate entity, until we come to the little, almost innocuous
              background thinking about which we were speaking earlier.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-GB">This is the sense of separation, the ‘ego,’ in its apparently
              mildest and least easily detectable form. Be very sensitive to this. Be
              sensitive to the ‘avoidance of what is’ in its subtlest forms. It is the sweet,

              much of our thinking and feeling, let alone our activities, are generated for the
