              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 18.7pt; text-align: justify;">To many non-believers,
              Buddhism is the "good" kind of religion, one that doesn't start wars
              and has powerful things to say on the mindfulness and mental self control we
              all seek by one method or another.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">RedOrbit spoke to<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.rickhanson.net/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Dr. Rick Hanson</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">, psychologist, Senior Fellow of the Greater Good Science
              Center at UC Berkeley, and<span> </span><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>New York Times</span></em><span> </span>best-selling author, to discuss the

              enlightenment for ourselves.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> </span></p>

              Hanson begins by stressing that the word "enlightenment" has to be
              defined carefully.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; "></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"The word
              enlightenment has two kinds of meaning," he says. "One is in an
              entirely secular frame. In the Buddhist tradition, it's very psychological
              operationalized as a mind, a nervous system, that's no longer capable of any
              kind of sustained greed, hatred or delusion."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Pleasant things can
              still be experienced, he expands, but enlightenment means we don't get attached
              to the experience. At the same time, we are aware of unpleasantness, but it
              doesn't result in anger or hatred.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Dr. Hanson is keen to
              point out that talking about the science behind the thinkings of such a
              prominent religious figure as the Buddha should not necessarily be seen as a
              wholesale replacement for ideas of mysticism and transcendence. However, he
              says: "Buddhism in its roots is very practical, very down-to-earth, and
              maps very well to modern neuropsychology."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">He continues:
              "There are certain psychological states that seem associated with the
              upper reaches of human potential, if not enlightenment altogether."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Probably the best
              example of this is equanimity ("a state of psychological stability and
              composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain,
              or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their
              mind," as defined by Wikipedia).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Being connected -
              "at one" with things, to use a Buddhist term - is a better definition
              of enlightenment than is being aloof from and unaffected by everything. People
              with great equanimity are fully engaged in life; they are compassionate and
              loving; they can focus attention extremely well (or withdraw when applying it
              is not healthy), and have a strong sense of being connected to material reality
              - to humanity and nature, Dr. Hanson explains.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Such qualities, of
              course, sound very similar to those supposedly held by many of the great
              religious leaders, but in his book, Buddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience
              of Happiness, Love &amp; Wisdom, Dr. Hanson explains how neuropsychology makes
              it perfectly possible for regular people to have these qualities even at
              superior levels, rather than them being the reserve only of a blessed few.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">What goes on in an enlightened brain?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">So how can regular
              people improve these qualities in themselves? First, a brief overview of the
              emotional hardware of the brain, and of biological evolution, is needed.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"The brain is
              built like a house with three floors, from the bottom up," Dr. Hanson
              explains. "The reptilian brain stem is at the bottom; on top of that,
              beginning around 250 million years ago, we have the subcortex, which is loosely
              associated with the mammalian stage of evolution. And finally we have the
              primate level," which is the most advanced: the cerebral cortex.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"We are walking
              around with a vast, ancient zoo and museum inside us," he adds. "We
              diverged from fish some 350-450 million years ago, but some of the brain
              similarities are still there, making sound, for example."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Within the subcortex
              are the two amygdalas, and they are concerned with emotional reactions and
              threat detection. This part of the brain is also highly identifiable with our
              ancient ancestors, and yet can be trained to be even more highly developed than
              it has become in most humans.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"Research shows
              that while very equanimous people are not numb or apathetic - they can be
              passionate about their football team or angry about injustice - their emotional
              responses can be controlled," Dr. Hanson says. "This is marked by the
              amygdala becoming increasingly regulated from the top down, in the cerebral
              cortex. The alarm bells don't ring as readily or as loudly, and people recover
              more rapidly."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">This is process is
              aided by oxytocin, informally referred to as the "love hormone".</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Techniques for different aspects of enlightenment</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">So how do we do make
              our brains do this?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"Repeated
              internalization of positive emotions" is important, says Hanson. This
              doesn't have to be in a "giddy, new age kind of way", but in
              authentic ways such as taking pleasure from simple things like friendships or
              time with our family (this is where the oxytocin comes in), or learning a new
              thing; accomplishing something. Sublime emotions like looking at the stars or
              nature also do the job, especially for science geeks such as myself!"</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Labeling experiences
              assists internalization, and this applies with negative things too. Jotting
              down one word about how we are feeling ("angry", "worried",
              "competitive", for example) helps us to take control of our emotions.
              This helps to regulate activity in the amygdala.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Staying with a nice
              moment a little longer, indulging in it, also helps. We shouldn't over-analyze;
              it's just mental noting.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"It's these little
              things that add up to big things. It's not a magic cure, which is why it's
              credible," Dr. Hanson says. "For those who engage in some form of
              psychological practice and mental training, there is more and more evidence of
              an underlying neural signature for the results of the practice; an underlying
              change in the nervous system. People really can become more enlightened."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Could Buddha's purported enlightenment, then, be seen in its most
              basic definition as extreme brain training?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"Working within
              the natural frame, yeah, that's how I see it," says Dr. Hanson. "It's
              important to be clear about the purpose. Brain training could also be used to
              become the world's greatest sniper. I think the Buddhism journey was motivated
              by a desire to be free from suffering, as well as emphasizing virtue and
              kindness."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Enlightenment can't be
              explained by any one factor, he adds, but the neurological signatures of what
              today might be better referred to as equanimity certainly go a long way towards
              explaining it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Where focus of
              attention is concerned, the neurological signature is a build up of neuro
              circuits anterior cingulate cortex. This is where meditation comes in, with the
              build-up being added by techniques famously associated with it. Breathing
              techniques, or even concentration on one word of your choice being repeated
              over and over.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">If striving for virtue
              and kindness, Dr. Hanson says he likes to practice a technique called "hit
              and run compassion", in which a total stranger is chosen on the street,
              and is secretly and silently wished well for a few seconds.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The final Buddha-like
              quality we may wish to try and attain is a sense of connection with all things.
              This is more complex and profound than the other aspects, Dr. Hanson believes,
              but plenty of regular people do seem to possess such a quality. It's achieved
              when allocentric perceptual circuits in the brain gives us an impersonal
              perspective on things, as opposed to the egocentric perspective. One simple way
              to develop allocentric neural activity is to lift our gaze to the horizon or up
              to the sky more often - following the path of a bird, for example - which helps
              us to get a broader perspective on things.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">"The word 'Buddha'
              just means 'one who knows' or 'one who sees clearly', so we're all capable of
              having a 'Buddha brain'," Dr. Hanson concludes. "Some of us will be
              more motivated to achieve it than others, just as some people will be more
              motivated to become great Olympians or football players, but it is achievable.
              Buddhist psychology maps the best to modern, Western science of any
              contemplative traditions, because it tends to be at bottom really quite secular.
              It's not metaphysical - it's direct experience based."</span></p>
