              Self...<br></em><br><br><br><em>The final belief is to 
              believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. 
              The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it 
              willingly.<br></em><br>Wallace Stevens<br><br> <br>The appearance of buddhas and 
              ancestors in the world, being prior to the emergence of any incipient sign, has 
              nothing to do with old, narrow opinions. This accounts for the virtues of 
              buddha-ancestors, as of going beyond the Buddha. Unconcerned with time, the 
              life-span [of buddha-ancestors] is neither prolonged nor momentary, as it is far 
              from the comprehension of ordinary minds.<br><br>The ever turning wheel of the 
              Dharma is also a principle prior to the emergence of any incipient sign; as 
              such, it is an eternal paragon with immeasurably great merit. [Buddha-ancestors] 
              expound this as a dream in a dream. Because they see verification within 
              verification, it is known as expounding a dream in a dream.<br><br>The place 
              where a dream is expounded in a dream is indeed the land and assembly of 
              buddha-ancestors. The buddha-land and buddha-assembly, the ancestral way and 
              ancestral seat, are all verification founded upon verification, hence all are 
              the expounding of a dream in a dream. Upon encountering their utterances and 
              discourses, do not think that these are not of the buddha-assembly; they are the 
              Buddha’s turning the wheel of the Dharma. Because this wheel of the Dharma turns 
              in all directions, the great oceans and Mt. Sumeru, the lands and buddhas are 
              all realized. Such is expounding a dream in a dream, which is prior to all 
              dreams.<br> <br>The entire world, crystal-clear everywhere, is a dream; and a 
              dream is all grasses [things] clear and bright. To doubt the dream state is 
              itself to dream; all perplexity is a dream as well. At this very moment, [all 
              are] grasses of the “dream state,” grasses “in” [a dream], grasses“expounding” 
              [a dream], and so on. Even as we study this, the very roots and stalks, leaves 
              and branches, flowers and fruits, lights and hues [of our perception] are all a 
              great dream. Never mistake this, however, for a dreamy state.<br><br>Dogen, 
              <em>Shobogenzo, Muchu-setsumu</em> (Expounding a dream in a dream), Trans. Hee-Jin 
              Kim, <em>Flowers of Emptiness</em>, p.279-280<br> <br> <br><br>It’s a wonderful, 
              wonderful opera. Only it hurts.<br><br>Joseph Campbell, <em>The Power of Myth</em> (with Bill Moyers)<br><br> <br><br>Dogen here relates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nyo</span> (“like”), to 
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ze</span> (“this”), evoking the familiar Zen association <em>nyoze</em> (“like 
              this,” “thusness”). He goes on to draw the implication that “like this” 
              signifies not mere resemblance but the nondual identity of symbol and 
              symbolized. He thus rejects any dualistic notion of metaphor or simile 
              (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">hiyi</span>), whereby an image points to, represents, or approximates something 
              other than itself. Rather, for Dogen, the symbol itself <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> the very 
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presence</span> of total dynamism, i.e., it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presents</span>.<br><br>Hee-Jin Kim, 
              <em>Flowers of Emptiness,</em> note 8, p.251<br><br> <br><br>If the new empirical 
              results are taken seriously, then people throughout our culture have to rethink 
              some of their most cherished beliefs about what science and philosophy are and 
              consider their values from a new perspective...<br><br>If conceptual metaphors 
              are real, then all literalist and objective views of meaning and knowledge are 
              false. We can no longer pretend to build an account of concepts and knowledge on 
              objective, literal foundations. This constitutes a profound challenge to many of 
              the traditional ways of thinking about what it means to be human, about how the 
              mind works, and about our nature as social and cultural creatures.<br><br>George 
              Lakoff and Mark Johnson, <em>Metaphors We Live By</em>, 
              p.273<br><br> <br><br>Allegory and metaphor both start off saying one thing as 
              if it were another. But where allegorical method divides this double talk into 
              two constituents – latent and manifest – and requires <em>translation</em> of 
              manifest into latent, the metaphorical method keeps the two voices together, 
              here the dream as it tells itself, ambiguously evocative and concretely precise 
              at each and every instant. Metaphors are not subject to interpretive translation 
              without breaking up their peculiar unity... Since symbols and metaphors cannot 
              be translated, another method for understanding dreams is needed, a method in 
              which masks, disguises, and doubleness inherently belong, a method that is 
              itself metaphorical.<br> <br><br>…<em>if the dream is psychic nature per se, 
              unconditioned, spontaneous, primary, and this psychic nature can show a dramatic 
              structure, then the nature of the mind is poetic</em>. To go to the root human 
              ontology, its truth, essence, and nature, one must move in the fictional mode 
              and use poetic tools.<br><br>James Hillman, <em>Healing Fiction</em>, pp35-36

              <p> </p>
              <div>I could think of one example: people liken “Buddha-nature” to be “like the 
                                            moon”.</div>
              <div>In actuality, the very appearance of the moon is buddha-nature, it is not 
                                            that there is some hidden thing called buddha-nature which merely resembles the 
                                            moon. The moon is buddha-nature, the buddha-nature is the moon, the nondual 
                                            identity of symbol and symbolized. Or as Dogen says, the moon-face buddha and 
                                            sun-face buddha, the whole body is the whole moon. There is nothing hidden or 
                                            latent about it, there is no hidden noumenon in which phenomenon or symbols can 
                                            “point to” or “hint at”. The symbol, e.g. the moon, is itself the very presence 
                                            of total dynamism.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In fact everything is like this.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Scent of a flower is not scent of “a flower”, the scent does not represent 
                                            or approximate something other than itself but is a complete reality (or rather, 
                                            whole and complete manifestation) in itself: the scent IS the flower, wheel of a 
                                            car is not wheel of “a car”, the car IS the wheel. The word “car” is a mere 
                                            imputation, not a true reality that can be established. “Self” and aggregates 
                                            are likewise.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Seen in such manner, all constructs are deconstructed and what's left is just the shimmering "dream-like" (coreless, empty, illusory), luminous appearances which is all there is, but not to be confused with a dreamy state.<br></div>
