              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Thanissaro
              Bhikkhu</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then
              the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged
              courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp;
              courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed
              One: "Now then, Venerable Gotama, is there a self?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When
              this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Then
              is there no self?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A
              second time, the Blessed One was silent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then
              Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then,
              not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left, Ven. Ananda said to the
              Blessed One, "Why, lord, did the Blessed One not answer when asked a
              question by Vacchagotta the wanderer?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Ananda,
              if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to
              answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those brahmans &amp;
              contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism [the view that there is an
              eternal, unchanging soul]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if
              there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, that would be
              conforming with those brahmans &amp; contemplatives who are exponents of
              annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If
              I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer
              that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge
              that all phenomena are not-self?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"No,
              lord."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"And
              if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to
              answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more
              bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">See
              also: other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta (and the translator's
              Introduction); AN 4.42.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">Whatever one tries to extrapolate from this, the TathÄ�gata’s silence
              does not represent a position. However, the exchange between Ä€nanda and the
              TathÄ�gata after Vacchagotta departed does tell us that his silence was
              provisional to Vacchagotta’s own confusion and misapprehension over a ‘self’ as
              understood by eternalist (sassatavÄ�dÄ�) or annihilationist (ucchedavÄ�dÄ�)
              doctrines that were current at the time. Vacchagotta’s state of mind would also
              be a factor as he had come to the TathÄ�gata and his disciples several times on
              these topics that can be read in the Vacchagottasaá¹ƒyutta. And these
              preoccupations of Vacchagotta would reflect on the ‘improper attention’
              (ayoniso manasi karoto) of the untaught commoner (assutavÄ� puthujjano), as
              mentioned in the SabbÄ�sava Sutta. The ‘thicket of views’ in the SabbÄ�sava Sutta
              (MN.2), are those views on self of the puthujjana, who wrongly considers a
              personal existence ‘for me’ – ‘Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? (ahosiá¹ƒ
              nu kho ahaá¹ƒ atÄ«tamaddhÄ�naá¹ƒ, na nu kho ahosiá¹ƒ atÄ«tamaddhÄ�naá¹ƒ) … ‘I have a self’
              … I do not have a self’ (atthi me attÄ�’ti … natthi me attÄ�’ti).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">However, the noble disciple is not on the same footing. When the
              TathÄ�gata did give instruction on views of self as held by the world, it was to
              a suitable audience informed with a contemplative understanding of dependent
              origination and of the habits of volitional processes which cause false
              reification of sentient experience. In other words, they, the noble disciples,
              understood what props-up the illusion of substantiality. Thus they appreciated
              entirely the falsity of an enduring attÄ�, both in contexts of doctrinal claim
              and contemplative knowledge. Otherwise, there would be no utility in simply
              denying the ‘Self’ to someone who is ignorant of causal processes, devoid of
              contemplative understanding, and who’s awareness is only informed with either
              the dogma of a ‘Self’ (Ä€tman) or at least with an infatuation over sentient
              experience born of this ignorance – as this would only lead to vexation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">A helpful reference on this topic is Bhikkhu Bodhi’s footnote to the
              Ä€nanda Sutta:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 12pt;">384 “Probably this means that Vacchagotta would have interpreted the
              Buddha’s denial as a rejection of his empirical personality, which (on account
              of his inclination towards views of self) he would have been identifying as a
              self. We should carefully heed the two reasons the Buddha does not declare,
              “There is no self”: not because he recognizes a transcendent self of some kind
              (as some interpreters allege), or because he is concerned only with delineating
              “a strategy of perception” devoid of ontological implications (as others hold),
              but (i) because such a mode of expression was used by the annihilationists, and
              the Buddha wanted to avoid aligning his teaching with theirs; and (ii) because
              he wished to avoid causing confusion in those already attached to the idea of
              self. The Buddha declares that “all phenomena are nonself” (sabbe dhammÄ�
              anattÄ�), which means that if one seeks a self anywhere one will not find one.
              Since “all phenomena” includes both the conditioned and the unconditioned, this
              precludes an utterly transcendent, ineffable self.” (B. Bodhi p. 1457)</span></p>
