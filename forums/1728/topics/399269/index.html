              <p>Bad idea especially to pray for toto. Pray for health and safety still ok but I think the best is just rely on oneself. It's like giving Buddha a bow but in return expect so much? When we bow to Buddha, it is not to pray superstitiously for things, rather it is to pay our respect sincerely to our Teacher, who taught the dharma for the liberation of sentient beings..</p>
              <p>Praying for toto is increasing one's own greed and delusion, and the Buddha strongly advised against gambling.</p>

              <p><br>yah same applies to me...</p>
              <p>but i started observing people. The buddhists prostrates before Buddha 3 times. Got a kind of a handsign on their forehead.. Two index fingers meeting together.. I still learning.</p>
              <p>Prostration before Buddha is to "lessen or eradicate" our ego. I not sure I am using the right terms here...</p>
              <p>Then I started to learn chanting. Trying to understand what the sutras means.</p>

              <p>For me, it depends on which Buddha. If is to Earth Store Bodhisattvas , I will say that I'm very grateful to him (æ„Ÿæ�©) because he has cured the sickness of my family member. If is to Amitabha, I will say I wish to be born in Amitabha's Pureland. If I have problem, I will tell Goddess of Mercy, she can read my thoughts without I saying my problems aloud. If is to SiddhÄ�rtha<strong> </strong>Buddha, I will say I'm grateful to him for his teachings.</p>
              <p>If is to all the Buddhas, I will just prostrates before Buddhas 3 times. The most effective way to pray to all Buddhas is to recite their holy names as many times as possible and recite the sutras. I find it not effective just by praying using joss sticks.</p>

              <p>for me, if i got little time, i juz make prostrations and make some offerings either incense or light etc to accumulate merit and then dedicate the merit to enlightenment of all sentient beings. </p>
              <p>If got alot time, then try to make some positive aspirations... can also recite the æ™®è´¤è¡Œæ„¿å“�ã€‚</p>
              <p>If middling time, then try to make aspirations for no obstacles on Buddhist path, aspiration to generate renunciation, bodhichitta and realise emptiness and to wish for rebirth in Amitabha pureland etc.  These aspirations mainly connected with liberation... which is the most important thing...</p>
              <p>But if facing a mundane worldly problem, no matter what, health, money, success of project, etc i will also pray for resolution of problem... basically i go to Triple Gems for all my problems... cos take refuge in them mah...</p>
              <p>As long as Buddha statue or stupa or scriptures which are representations of the triple gems are there, i will regard all the Buddhas as present, and just do the above.</p>

              <p>Hey Hasene</p>
              <p>I believe that by your enquiry. It does show that you have good affinity with Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Most Buddist will do bowing, flower, incense etc offerings before the Buddha. All these are consider skillful means. Do bear in mind that Buddha does not need any of our offerings. It makes no differences to him.</p>
              <p>As Buddha is our teacher and we are his student. The skillful means are  meant to humble us so that we can learn to overcome the three poison; ignorance, greed and pride.</p>
              <p><em>Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 said</em></p>
              <p><em>And if persons, in the presence of such memorial towers,<br>such jeweled images and painted images,<br>should with reverent minds make offerings<br>of flowers, incense, banners or canopies,<br>or if they should employ persons to make music,<br>striking drums or blowing horns or conch shells,<br>playing pipes, flutes, zithers, harps,<br>balloon guitars, cymbals and gongs,<br>and if these many kinds of wonderful notes<br>are intended wholly as an offering;<br>or if one with a joyful mind<br>sings a song in praise of the Buddha's virtue,<br>even if it is just one small note,<br>then all who do these things have attained the Buddha way.<br>If someone with a confused and distracted mind<br>should take even one flower<br>and offer it to a painted image,<br>in time he would come to see countless Buddhas.<br>Or if a person should bow or perform obeisance,<br>or should merely press his palms together,<br>or even should raise a single hand,<br>or give no more than a slight nod of the head,<br>and if this were done in offering to an image,<br>then in time he would come to see countless Buddhas.</em></p>
              <p>Hence next time, when you are in the temple, just know that whatever one does. Each acts are a offering to Buddha and the merits accrued will help in your practice.</p>

              <p>Hey Hasene</p>
              <p>I believe that by your enquiry. It does show that you have good affinity with Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Most Buddist will do bowing, flower, incense etc offerings before the Buddha. All these are consider skillful means. Do bear in mind that Buddha does not need any of our offerings. It makes no differences to him.</p>
              <p>As Buddha is our teacher and we are his student. The skillful means are  meant to humble us so that we can learn to overcome the three poison; ignorance, greed and pride.</p>
              <p><em>Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 said</em></p>
              <p><em>And if persons, in the presence of such memorial towers,<br>such jeweled images and painted images,<br>should with reverent minds make offerings<br>of flowers, incense, banners or canopies,<br>or if they should employ persons to make music,<br>striking drums or blowing horns or conch shells,<br>playing pipes, flutes, zithers, harps,<br>balloon guitars, cymbals and gongs,<br>and if these many kinds of wonderful notes<br>are intended wholly as an offering;<br>or if one with a joyful mind<br>sings a song in praise of the Buddha's virtue,<br>even if it is just one small note,<br>then all who do these things have attained the Buddha way.<br>If someone with a confused and distracted mind<br>should take even one flower<br>and offer it to a painted image,<br>in time he would come to see countless Buddhas.<br>Or if a person should bow or perform obeisance,<br>or should merely press his palms together,<br>or even should raise a single hand,<br>or give no more than a slight nod of the head,<br>and if this were done in offering to an image,<br>then in time he would come to see countless Buddhas.</em></p>
              <p>Hence next time, when you are in the temple, just know that whatever one does. Each acts are a offering to Buddha and the merits accrued will help in your practice.</p>
