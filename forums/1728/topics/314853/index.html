            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is good that you are montioring all the mind keeps changing angry, jealousy,greed ,phobia,etc....You have to foucs and be consious at starting point and end point of state.For example, When someone hurt you, you realize you mind changes to angry state and after that you realize the angry mind will cool down .This is arising and perishing natual Dhamma in body and mind.Why angry mind come out from your the body? You attached to body and mind.So you should know only one things changes of states in mind for angry,jealousy, greed, phobia,etc mind..Don't let your mind know angry,jealousy,greed,phobia,etc.... This is the basic Dhamma that lead to Sotappan (ariya) for first enlighenment.Don't stop it.For  every times changes of mind (jeaslousy changes,greed changes and phobic changes,etc) , don't miss it .Concentrate and foucs all these chages.</p></div>

              <p>All the mind inside the body is due to Dhamma outside world. let me tell you the example ......When someone clap two palms to each other, the clapping sound come out from the hit of two palms. In the same way for eye sense door, the light wave from object stike or hit the eye object or door , the eye consciousness arises in the body. This eye consciousness consists of feeling, name memory,changes of state, and knowing of eye consciousness.Light wave is Dhamma in outside the body.Eye object is inside the body.These eye door and light wave is the matter. The stike of eye door and light object give birth the eye consciousness .When the eye door is closed or light of the object disappear , the previous eye consciousness is dead.This processing  is very fast  in the state.Why  you laugh when you see the something? The eye consciousness give you the feelings, name memory and changes of state and knowing of eye conscioussness.Why you cannot continue to laugh ? The feeling of knowing eye consciousness is already dead.This is Dhamma nature.I use the example for eye door. The same processing is happening in other 5 sense doors. What should you realize this eye conscioussness processing? You should realize cause and effect theory from the body. The cause of eye object and ligth wave from outside objects hit or strike  each other , the  effect of eye conscious  is given birth or arises. In a few micro seconds , this eye consciousness of arising and perishing is repeatly happening in the body.This is change of state of mind theory.How much  you can be aware of changing state of mind depend on your response of awarenees and concentration.</p>
              <p>Let me explain you more in details.</p>
              <p>I told you eye consciousness consists of the feelings, name memory and changes of state and knowing of eye conscioussness. Let say when I see gold bar in the shop, I know this is gold bar. I like it. I want to buy it if I have money. This is normal person knowledge.</p>
              <p>For who know and aware of  the processing of eye consicosness ,He will differeniate and  filter the eye consciousness into the feelings, name memory and changes of state and knowing of eye conscioussness.</p>
              <p>I like the gold. I don't like the good.  This is feeling of mind come from eye consciousness. This is gold I can recognize from my memory. This is name memory from eye consciousness. After my mind is cling to other 5 sense doors except eye door, what I see gold inside the body perishes . This is changes of state.What you are aware in seeing is eye consciousness.</p>
              <p>how is the feelings, name memory and changes of state and knowing of  conscioussness demage permanently?</p>
              <p>In some part of the brain or body is dead or any six sense door is demaged ,some people cannot feel , lost memory, lost consciousness and becomes sad from the six sense door.</p>

              <p>Don't laugh due to ignorance as well. Some people laugh with seemingly no bad intention, but still it is an act of ignorance. In some situations we should give rise to compassion instead of laughing. For example some monks/nuns were amused at a bird trapped in a room, and so they laughed. But my master told them not to laugh and it was an act of ignorance, but rather to have compassion for the suffering bird and open the windows for the bird to leave.</p>
