            <div class='col-md body'>often we see followers (xin duan) like to respect master monks but in most days i see it is getting beyond boundaries - the way they donated too much money to the monks, bring them to expensive vegetarian restaurant to eat, go shopping centre, some even worse to extend donate mercedes to them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>no doubt the followers trying to be devotee, but i find the way they doing it will lead the monks to hell when they die because of spending too much time in luxuries than to practice monkhood.<br><br>your thought pls? do you think pampering monks are getting common these days? is it right or wrong?</div>

Therefore, they have no need for money, cars or expensive food. They dress simply and eat simply. </div></blockquote>I have to agree that monks should not indulge in material things since they have already renounced. And sad to say, yes, there are such monks around... because they have not really renounced mentally. Even monks have to face karmic consequences for this.. Sorry. I am not in a position to comment further. I just said some of the things that my dharma teacher herself also mentioned before. But anyway concerned_man and sinweiy suggested, you should watch ourself and practise the dharma ourselves, and not be too concerned about the others.<br><br>As for donations, usually, the head of that Sangha will have to decide whether to keep or give it away. They may give away some things to charity, if they don't need it. Most of the donated funds will be used for basic needs and the propogation of the dharma. (pls correct me as I am not following directly under a monastic community)<br><br>I believe renunciation should come from within. This does not mean the monastic Sangha is not important, it is in fact, very very important, because it provides an order and a community for renuncants to stay in. There is great merits in supporting the monastic order by providing them material needs. In 'return', they have a task to guide the lay practitioners on their spiritual path. Monastic order and lay followers have always been interdependant in Buddhism and will continue to be.<br><br>It's not always easy to renounce. I know of many many people who truly wished to renounce, but in the end couldn't. All those are great practitioners who have already 'renounced within'. One of which happens to be my dharma teacher. Her family obstructed her from renunciation, although she tried many times to renounce. Some of the other great dharma practitioners who post in our forum, like 'Thusness' and 'Sangha', also met difficulties in renounciation due to family. And many more whom I have not mentioned.<br><br>So, let us not forget that majority of the monks renounced with good intentions and truly wishes to walk a more spiritual path. We should help them by providing them what we can for them to live and propogate the dharma. Also, monastic training is not easy... do not expect a luxurious life.</div>
