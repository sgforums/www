            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Spirit of Fire,<br><br>I'm trying to reply you in a respectful manner as much as possible, and if I happen to be unmindful or hurt you in anyway, please accept my apologies. I only mean to reply to your post, not to you as a person.<br><br>You tried to explain about the background, essence and so-called benefits of Nichiren's teaching as taught by the SGI (when nobody requested you to explain them), yet you DID NOT REPLY my qns at all.<br><br>You were unable to:<br>a) quote any part of the 2 chapters in Lotus Sutra, which states that monks/nuns are not necessary in this age; and<br>b) quote any part of the Lotus Sutra or any other sutra which states that faith in the Gohonzon leads to enlightenment.<br><br>Period.<br><br>Nichiren had been a highly controversial figure both when he was around and after he passed away. Several sects that branched out of Nichiren "Buddhism" also had a long history of political struggles and often displayed intolerance/ rejection of other Buddhist traditions. Well, just a simple point, if EVERY PERSON just needs to rely on TWO chapters of Lotus Sutra, then the Buddha might as well just teach the 2 chapters instead of wasting all his saliva to expound the rest of the chapters for Lotus Sutra and the Tripitakas etc.<br><br>There are a lot of reasons why SGI and Nichiren Shosho have generally not been recognized by mainstream Buddhist groups, but I have no wish to engage in long debates about it. People who are curious about Nichiren-based groups, the rights and wrongs of them, the validity etc... please feel free to find out more information on your own. I would also recommend the E-Sangha which provides rather objective representation of various views on the Nichiren-based faiths (http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showforum=44).<br><br>I would like to remind you that in this forum, the SGI is not considered as an orthodox/recognized tradition, and the forum owner had made a clear announcement that all links with SGI would be banned from the forum. I quote the forum owner in his post:<br><br><blockquote>I have made a descision after much consideration and discussions with my moderators and friends to ban all Soka Gakkai International (SGI) (and other unorthodox/unrecognised traditions) links from our forum ~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~. The tradition of Soka Gakkai is not recognised as part of mainstream Buddhism and was therefore removed.</blockquote>However, he had been very kind to allow your posts and lengthy expressions of SGI teachings here for quite a while. Pls show due respect to the forum by refraining from posting SGI teachings here.<br><br>If you do wish to participate in forum discussions about SGI and its teachings, I would also suggest you join the E-Sangha, where they have a forum just for Nichiren Buddhism itself.</div>
