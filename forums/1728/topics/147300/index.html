            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of Medicine Buddha... I roughly remembered a true story I was told over a year ago, by a Buddhist friend who experienced it himself. I can't really remember the detail now as it has been a long time.. but anyway...<br><br>This guy had some problem and needed to go for brain surgeries several times... Before he went, he went to a foreign lama who came to Singapore to teach the teachings on Medicine Buddha. I can't remember which Lama, but I know the name starts with S. Anyway, during some kind of ritual (or maybe not ritual, something else), everyone was sitting in a circle. The lama walked to him and pulled him out of the circle, and told him he got (Karmic) Obstructions, and he needs to practice well.<br><br>Soon, he went for the surgery (or is it not? i cant remember)... I believe he had been practising.. and then he slipped into a coma. For 4 days he remained unconscious, until the 4th day, the first thing he remembered was seeing a figure of a man, he done quite some description but i really cannot remember it anymore. After awaking from it he asked the doctors/nurses whether someone came to visit him. They said nope, nobody had visited him when he woke up. It was later he visited the lama again, and the lama told him the figure was a manifest of the Medicine Buddha, and he was saved by the Medicine Buddha. Later he went for several surgeries and succeeded. I still see him sometimes these days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Namelessness,<br><br>Dream interpretation is a part of my path.<br><br>I pay serious attention to the content of the dream and vision... for they often tell me what will i be experiencing soon. Under most circumstances, I cannot avoid what is about to happen and nowadays i don't even try to avoid them.<br><br>Each experience will show me something that i need to learn or know. It is like a planned path.<br><br>I know in Buddhism, dream content are mostly to be disregarded... I think there are benefits to this as well.<br><br>Some years ago  I do a lot Buddhist meditation, attending buddhist meditation classes and retreats. I have been a Tibetan monk in a previous life and Buddhism is still a very attractive teaching to me although some of my experiences differs from what is normally mentioned in Buddhism. For example i do not view reincarnation as bad... but as a neccessary stage for Source to understand itself. Utimately if we realise ourselve to be this all-pervading no-thing that is eternal, the fear of death just drops away.The fear is a reflection in the mind that sees itself as the self, not realising that it is just the reflection.<br><br>All real paths lead to the same goal... I just happen to choose a non-buddhist path now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the Buddhist scriptures it is mentioned in many occasions it is possible to see the future through dream interpretation. Buddha had done that at least a few times on special cases, but we do not do that often nor encourage it.<br><br>Recently I brought a person to meet my dharma teacher. He seems to have some psychic powers, and he met her because he had some trouble in seeing the cause of a karma or events and wanted to know how to go about it, and he wanted to 'burn away the karma'. My dharma teacher told him, what is the use of it? Can you stop the karma by knowing? Karma is not easy to avoid, if it is then Buddha did not have to suffer so much since he is All-Knowing. But even Buddha had to go through sickness, death, etc. In the Jataka tales, the Buddha had undergone a lot of tests and hardship while was practising as a Bodhisattva in his previous lives. It is still better to practise hard and not be too affected by visions/dreams etc... which John (Thusness) has advised similarly to me as well. There is no short cut to enlightenment, even Buddha had to practise for many many lives before attaining Buddhahood.<br><br>Perhaps you feel that you learn a lot of things from dreams... but important thing is... my master advises that one should not let the 'Dream world' dictate the way you live (in real life).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the Mahayana (including Vajrayana) point of view, Bodhisattvas are completely non-dual and therefore does not discriminate Nirvana over Samsara. This view is also presented in the Nagarjuna's work I sent you.<br><br>Which is why it is possible for Bodhisattvas to be reborn again and again to complete Buddhahood. Those following the path of self-liberation (attaining Arhantship) will enter into Nirvana and not be able to attain the perfect, complete Buddhahood.<br><br>The 4 Noble Truths, teaching that 'Life Is Suffering', although found in all traditions of Buddhism, is actually a path of 'self-liberation' catergory. On a Higher level Life is not suffering, although for most sentient beings this is true in the sense that Suffering is an inevitable part of life, like for example the <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">8 distresses</a> to speak of.</div>

Those following the path of self-liberation (attaining Arhantship) will enter into Nirvana and not be able to attain the perfect, complete Buddhahood.<br><br>The 4 Noble Truths, teaching that 'Life Is Suffering', although found in all traditions of Buddhism, is actually a path of 'self-liberation' catergory. On a Higher level Life is not suffering, although for most sentient beings this is true in the sense that Suffering is an inevitable part of life, like for example the <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">8 distresses</a> to speak of.</div></blockquote>Much of these are beliefs... in a future lifetime... you may know what are the truths and what are the lies....<br><br>Buddhism is no longer for me...

If you are a liberated person then either you have entered into Nirvana... or you came back as a Bodhisattva. Do you doubt that there is liberation? There were thousands of Arhants during the Buddha's era, and there continue to be Arhants living in the world now. I know and met many liberated beings and bodhisattvas, some of them are my teachers. I also do not doubt the existence of Buddhas. It is not a belief but it is a path. If you want to walk the Bodhisattva path, it requires deep Bodhicitta aspiration and great compassion for all beings.<br><br>I believe you do not get stuck to a system just because blind belief in your previous lifetimes. I suggest you read more Buddhist sutras to understand the teachings better, and very importantly clarify your doubts with a Buddhist teacher.</div>
