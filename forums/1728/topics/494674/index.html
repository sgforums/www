              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">JOHOR
              BARU: The Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar, has
              ordered the controversial Muslim-only launderette in Muar to immediately stop
              its discriminatory practice or risk being shut down by him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              cannot accept this nonsense. This is Johor, which belongs to Bangsa Johor and
              it belongs to all races and faiths. This is a progressive, modern and moderate
              state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“This
              is not a Taliban state and as the Head of Islam in Johor, I find this action to
              be totally unacceptable as this is extremist in nature,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Majesty said he also ordered the state Islamic religious affairs committee
              chairman Abdul Mutalip Abd Rahim, the religious council and the district
              council to investigate the matter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Sultan added that he had also spoken to Mufti Johor Datuk Mohd Tahrir Samsudin
              as well as state exco for religion Abd Mutalip Abd Rahim over the matter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              want the owner to apologise to me and the people of Johor. He has made
              Johoreans very angry and embarrassed because this is not the Johor we want.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              owner has gone against the vision of a united, harmonious, moderate and
              tolerant Johor. If he still insists on carrying on the Muslim-only practice, he
              can leave Johor. I suggest he set up shop in Afghanistan. His thinking is sick
              and goes against everything that Johor stands for.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Majesty, who was visibly upset, said he and his family members were “deeply
              appalled” by the action of the launderette owner, saying if this was not
              stopped, it would lead to more narrow-minded actions in the name of Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pictures
              of the launderette went viral last week when it was reported that it had a sign
              saying that only Muslims were allowed to use its machines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              said the owner had first put up his Muslim-only notices and after the issue
              became controversial, the owner put up a new sign to say it was
              “Muslim-friendly.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Don’t
              try to be clever. It’s still the same. The owner needs to have his brains
              cleaned up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              want to put a stop to such extremism. Extremism has no place in my state. We
              take pride in being Bangsa Johor and I want to know where the owner of this
              launderette learn his Islam? Islam teaches the faithful to be tolerant and
              respect other people and faiths,” he said at Istana Bukit Serene here
              yesterday,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              Monday, Johor Prince Tunku Idris Sultan Ibrahim expressed dismay over the
              launderette’s move, asked: “Is this for real? I’m appalled” in his Instagram.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Sultan said the mosques in Johor were open to non-Muslims, for example, as long
              as they were properly dressed and he could not imagine non-Muslims being banned
              from entering the mosques, saying he was concerned over rising religious
              extremism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              wonder where this launderette owner washes his clothes when he is overseas? Is
              he saying only the clothes of Muslims are clean and those of non-Muslims are
              unclean? That’s what he means, I believe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“From
              now on, I am directing the state executive council and all the councils to
              insist that any business owners who carry out such blatant discriminatory
              practices should have their licences revoked. Don’t mess around with your
              narrow-minded religious prejudices.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Majesty added that he could not keep quiet on the issue, as if this was allowed
              to go unnoticed, “then next we will have taxis for only Muslims or
              non-Muslims.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              said he also did not want other races to carry out similar actions.</span></p>
