              <p>I do not reject facts and proofs if you can show them. The
              question lies not with the facts and proofs, but with the
              INTERPRETATION of them. Contrary to what people like to say, facts
              DO NOT speak for themselves. If they do then we do not need
              lawyers! Evidence and facts must be interpreted within a framework
              or belief system. They must be put together to form a coherent and
              plausible story.</p>
              <p>The issue is not what God can do. God can do anything. He can
              even zap the fruit out of Eve's hand before she ate it or blow the
              serpent up the moment it went up the tree. But such a God would be
              capricious, wouldn't it? The world that God created was perfect,
              but the endowment of free will would entail also that consequences
              (whether good or bad) must follow and be borne. With free will
              comes moral responsibility.</p>
              <p>Naturalistic fallacy is part of Buddhism teaching of karma? How
              can an impersonal law of nature make moral judgements about
              good and bad? The law of gravity does no such thing. But once a
              moral law giver is factored in, it makes sense that there is such a
              thing as moral judgements.</p>
              <p>There is nothing unfair about one not being equal to God. The
              Creator by definition is always greater than the creation. By
              definition there can only be ONE necessary being. If we are all
              equal to God then it means there are numerous beings called God.
              This is not monotheism. And logic will tell you that God
              cannot create His own equal. As to many being Buddhas, that is just
              like saying everyone has the chance to enter heaven so I have no
              issue with that at all.</p>
              <p>Buddhism may be earlier than Christianity, but the history of
              the Bible well precedes Buddhism! On what basis do you conclude
              that Christians blindly believe the Bible while you do not blindly
              believe what the Buddha texts teach, bearing in mind that your
              Buddhist scriptures were written down 500 years after Buddha died?
              The events of the Tower of Babel is supported even in the field of
              linguistics. People cannot explain where the varieties of human
              languages come from. But most agree that the cradle of civilisation
              lies in the Middle East. And linguists have traced all languages to
              a few families of languages that seemingly just appeared and did
              not evolve from a proto-language.</p>
              <p>People who have read a lot of myths and legends can read the
              Bible and note that it does not fit the label at all. CS Lewis was
              one such person.</p>

              <p>According to Buddhism, there were countless Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be many Buddhas after him. In short, he is not the first, nor will he be the last.</p>
              <p>However, counting from the present <em>kalpa</em> (the beginning of our present universe) Buddha Gautama is considered the fourth Buddha. <strong>The first is Kakusandho Buddha, second Konakamano Buddha and the third Kassapo Buddha.</strong> The last Buddha of this <em>kalpa</em> will be <a class="new" title="Maitreya (not yet started)" href="/w/index.php?title=Maitreya&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Maitreya</span></span></a> Buddha. Then the universe will renew itself and from then begins a new <em>kalpa</em>. <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Who_was_the_first_Buddha.3F">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Who_was_the_first_Buddha.3F</a></p>

              <p>Problem with the above scenario is that the priest is wrong. But
                          I suppose the above is just a caricature to take a jab at
                          Christianity or Roman Catholicism.</p>
              <p>Anyway, a Christian who knows the Bible well enough will know
                          that the Bible is not silent on this. In the book of Romans the
                          Apostle Paul said that people DO KNOW about God and sin. He said
                          that the evidence for God is seen in the creation and thus people
                          are without excuse. It is not that people do not know, but that
                          people suppress the knowledge of God. As to sin, if you ask
                          everyone, they can tell you that they are not morally perfect. We
                          all know in our hearts that we have done wrong. We have lied, we
                          have stolen, we have coveted etc etc. God has given us His law
                          aka the conscience which functions as a moral compass albeit marred
                          by sin such that people can have their conscience hardened or
                          seared by repeated wrongdoing. Even if we do not know or heard of
                          the 10 commandments, our conscience can still judge us.</p>

              <p>Christians around me told me that babies who passed away without the knowledge of God will not go to hell and people who did not have the chance to know God will not go to hell. How come there are differences in understanding among Christians?</p>

              rebirth are tiresome. We don't care. Either you accept it or you don't. 
              If you don't fine. But there is no doubt that rebirth was the Buddha's 
              teaching. People who cannot accept that, cannot accept must of the other
               teachings of the Buddha.
              <br> <strong><br>And please spare us the "buddhas teachings were not written down 
              until..."First of all, this is false. Worst case scenario, Buddha's 
              teachings were written down 150 years after his parinirvana (dates of 
              Asokha pillars), which best scholarship places 407-400 BCE. But it is
