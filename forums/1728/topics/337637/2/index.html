              <p>To put it simply: open awareness (awareness that takes in all experiences) IS meditation. Without mindful awareness, it is not meditation. Without mindful awareness, it is likely that one is in a state of distraction, drowsiness, agitation, or perhaps in a state of trance, but all these has nothing to do with meditation.</p>
              <p>So, meditation is not limited to the time we spend sitting on the cushion meditating. Meditation should be 24/7, even though initially it may seem far from possible, but we should constantly come back to this present moment awareness. We must practice this regularly in daily lives, just sustaining this simple, present moment awareness... and when we notice our mind drifting, we just come back to present moment awareness without delay.</p>
              <p>It does not mean modify or get rid of thought -- if thought arise that is fine too, but rather than getting lost in the contents and mental stories, just notice that awareness component of thought -- just like countless waves on the ocean all have the same substance of water... all thoughts, experiences, phenomena have the same essence of luminous clarity and emptiness inseparable (our buddha-nature).</p>
              <p>Lama Surya Das: <em>"This is the heart teaching of Mahamudra, of Dzogchen, of Zen, of all the nondual
                                      teachings: Sustaining present awareness. Recognizing the Buddha-nature through the present
                                      moment, this very moment of awareness. If it's awareness taking the form of thinking,
                                      recognize the present awareness component of the thought. If you are remembering the past,
                                      recognize the present awareness component of the memory. You're not in the past. How could
                                      you be in the past? It is present awareness remembering. If you feel distracted when
                                      remembering, bring the mind back to the present awareness. You don't have to stop
                                      remembering. Recognize present awareness, which is remembering. If you are dreaming,
                                      fantasizing about the future, about what you are going to do when you leave here, how you
                                      are going to tell everybody how wonderful it was and how great Dzogchen view and
                                      meditation is, that's fine-recognize present awareness fantasizing, planning, dreaming.
                                      Recognize who or what is doing that present awareness. Know the knower; see through the
                                      seer; go beyond me and mine, and be free" </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even though we can and should be practicing in daily living, a scheduled sitting practice of say 20 or 30 minutes every day or at least 4 or 5 days a week is very important, too. I am trying hard to keep to a scheduled sitting practice on a daily basis even though life has been quite hectic for me too. I also notice that sitting meditation does make an impact on the practice in daily living, the mind is more stable.</p>
              <p>Regarding the types of meditation, perhaps the most common of all is Anapanasati or Mindfulness of Breathing -- which is also a practice in mindful awareness but the awareness is mostly concentrated on the breathing sensations -- means the breathe is sensed in full clarity, cold or hot, soft or hard, its texture and quality is completely 'awared' but without mental labeling or discrimination. Just pure awareness of breathing. There are many other types but I shall not go indepth here.</p>
              <p>Here's something from "Meditation: Now or Never" by Steve Hagen the book which I think I recommended previously:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><strong>Constancy</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>In Chapter 7 we looked at the three legs of meditation practice: regularity, meditating with others, and non-judgments. These are essential to practicing meditation over hte ong run.</em></p>
              <p><em>And so, in this chapter, and the two that follow, we'll look at these three aspects of meditation in more detail, in order to see and feel their vital importance.</em></p>
              <p><em>.....</em></p>
              <p><em>Constancy is the single most important factor in maintaining a meditation practice. If you find constancy in your practice, it's like throwing a switch that allows everything else to follow. Without it, there will be no understanding, no enlightenment.</em></p>
              <p><em>Meditating only now and then, when the urge arises or when you've had a stressful day and feel you need it, is like trying to boil water by turning on the stove for thirty seconds at a time, whenever you're in the mood. Unless the flame is constant, the water will never boil.</em></p>
              <p><em>Constancy means meditating no matter how we feel or what we think at the moment. We just go ahead and practice, no matter what.</em></p>
              <p><em>Without this attitude, we're just treating meditation the way we treat most everything else. Mentally and emotionally, it's just business as usual.</em></p>
              <p><em>In any moment, of course, we may lose our way or get distracted. But as soon as we remember, we come right back, take up this moment, and carry on -- without giving another thought to having just slipped off. This is constancy.</em></p>
              <p><em>People new to meditation often misunderstand constancy. They think it's about not faltering, not losing your way or focus. But constancy is precisely about faltering, over and over, and coming back, over and over.</em></p>
              <p><em>With this understanding, we let ourselves be human, allow ourselves to err and to learn, and avoid getting discouraged about our meditation practice.</em></p>
              <p><em>So it's not that we never veer from the path, but that we waste no time in returning to it. No time for discussion. No time for excuses. Back to here and now.</em></p>
              <p><em>.....</em></p>
              <p><em>To establish constancy in your practice, it's essential that you set up some kind of regular meditation schedule. Just as creating a budget helps us with our finances, a regular schedule will help you with meditation.</em></p>
              <p><em>This schedule might be as simple as half an hour every morning just before breakfast. Or maybe it's twenty minutes at midday or twenty minutes before bed on workdays, thirty minutes each morning on weekends.</em></p>
              <p><em>It's best to meditate at precisely the same time every day. Building a regular schedule around meditation creates a solid and grounded daily routine that brings stability to your life and allows you to maintain a steady, ongoing practice. Making and keeping this regular appointment from day to day is to put your entire life in order.</em></p>
              <p><em>The most important thing to remember is to set a schedule that you can actually follow, not one you dream of following. Often when people first take up meditation, they are excited about it and overdo it, perhaps setting up a schedule that is too ambitious. This might work for awhile, even for a few years, but if it's too much, it will only undo itself, and perhaps much of your life as well.</em></p>
              <p><em>Even if it's modest at first, it is far better to set up a schedule you can stick to without much difficulty. After you can maintain this schedule for a few months without missing any scheduled times, you can gradually increase the amount of time you devote to formal meditation practice. The key is to never waver from the schedule you set unless you are ill, or faced with an emergency, or some other unusual situation. As my teacher used to say, life is daily routine and unexpected occurrences. To live in constancy is to take care of both.</em></p>
              <p><em>The ideal schedule pushes you slightly, creates just a little internal resistance. This is good grist for the mill. Without some resistance, your practice will likely atrophy and die away; with too much, you may get discouraged and give up.</em></p>
              <p><em>As long as you stay with your schedule, the meditation practice will mature. Over time, you may increase the amount of time you spend in formal meditation. And as you continue to push gently against your resistance, your practice will gradually become more subtle and profound.</em></p>
              <p><em>.....</em></p>
              <p><em>Sometimes people think they are too busy to meditate. But how can you be too busy to be present?</em></p>
              <p><em>Meditation isn't a vacation from life. Meditation is simply being present -- even in the midst of tasks and obligations, urgencies and emergencies. Having a busy schedule is not a valid reason to avoid meditation. Indeed, in taking up meditation wholeheartedly, you may discover it's not necessary to be quite so busy.</em></p>
              <p><em>.....</em></p>
              <p><em>When we practice constancy and meditate without internally fussing or complaining, our whole life begins to change. Whereas before we might have resisted getting out of bed in the morning, now we just get up. This is much easier than lying in bed dreading the thought of having to get up and face the day.</em></p>
              <p><em>With constancy, we learn to take care of this moment whether or not it is something we want. If right now it is time to get our of bed,m then we just get up. If right now it is time to go for cancer treatments, we just go in. We're not tossed around by circumstances. We just get on with life.</em></p>
              <p><em>Over time, you will come to see that this is the easiest, freest, surest way to live.</em></p>

              <p>Sometimes, it is probably not as simple as just living at "now". For example, you are trying to meditate or chant and suddenly your  3-year old kid is making noise or tries to disturb you ... what are you going to do? The same question is posed to Mr æ�Žç‚³å�— (a disciple of Master Yin Kuang). He said you can scold or hit your children after you finish your meditation or chanting but you should not get angry while you are chanting. And you also must not get angry when you are scolding your children later.</p>
              <p>Well, this is easy said than done. It takes time and mindfullness to slowly improve ourselves.</p>

              <p>that's why i don't meditate, a lot of disturbance, and seems that ,when someone disturbing you ,you tend to overreact when you are doing meditation, i think someone said, meditation is a attitude,you can meditate when you walking, when you working, but this sought of meditation is not the meditation you are talking about, anyway different people have different view.</p>

              <p>Yes, samadhi or 'ding' is very important -- to have a mind that is stable, centered, not lost, attached and caught up in own's experiences (of thoughts and the environment). But to add on, the other aspect that is important is awareness... without awareness, wisdom cannot develope. One can enter deep states of samadhi and absorption yet is no closer to gaining wisdom and enlightenment. Hence practice of samadhi and wisdom should go hand in hand.</p>

              <p>Our moderator Thusness also explained over a year back:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">Source: (Transcript of the Lankavatara Sutra sharing by Thusness</a>)<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Ok. I think when we
                                                  view consciousness, we have to understand that there are a few
                                                  things. We cannot keep on thinking about the objective world first.
                                                  We must see how consciousness reacts. That is if we react very
                                                  intensely, strongly towards symbols, then whatever reactions will
                                                  go back deep into your consciousness. This is one thing. My
                                                  perspective is that when you chant, you are not dealing with our
                                                  luminous clarity. We're dealing with propensities deep in your
                                                  consciousness. Insight meditation (found in many various forms such as vipassana/vipashyana/zazen/shikantaza/dzogchen/mahamudra and many other derivatives) itself deals directly with this
                                                  clarity. That is the luminous clarity. But if we were to continue
                                                  to chant, you are actually focusing more on the deeper layers of
                                                  consciousness that deals with propensities and the power of
                                                  concentration. Do you see what I mean? It's not so much of the
                                                  luminosity. However, the chanting itself, when it takes strength,
                                                  it creates a kind of momentum. A momentum that synchronises not
                                                  only with your sub-conscious or the deeper layers of your
                                                  consciousness, but also your conscious level. This means it can
                                                  sync the two layers into one. This syncing the two into one clears
                                                  your mind, clears your thoughts. And then at this time, you ask who
                                                  you are, that is, not letting the momentum take place, but just
                                                  feel and sense... then you ask what is it. At that moment, you
                                                  might see your reality. But your mind must be able to settle down
                                                  first. But you must know there is a difference between working at
                                                  the concentration level, dealing with the karmic propensities and
                                                  creating new momentums, and practicing insight meditation that
                                                  touch directly the clarity and the luminous nature, are two
                                                  different things. You see what I mean or not?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: Yeah I think so.
                                                  This means that I still need to do insight meditation?<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Yes you have to do
                                                  insight meditation. Even if you attain calmness you still have to
                                                  do insight meditation. You must feel the awareness... You must
                                                  sense it everywhere... That is very important for liberation. Now
                                                  when we talk about awareness, we don't call it Self or we don't
                                                  call it Mind. Why people call it Awareness is because they do not
                                                  want to call it Self, because there is no Self. The reason they
                                                  said Awareness, is because Awareness is not an entity. It is not a
                                                  thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. It is just clarity.
                                                  But because we are so accustomed to thinking things in terms of
                                                  object and subject, we always take Awareness as something. It must
                                                  be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if it is not residing
                                                  inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace. This is the
                                                  problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be aware. We always
                                                  think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                                  they always look for a place, they always look for a something.
                                                  This is how the mind react, this is what I call a momentum. They
                                                  always behave this way. They do not know how to say Â“Just do
                                                  nothing. Everything is expressing itself by clarity.Â” They always
                                                  want to react, you see what I mean?</p>

              <p>There are two methods: The first is ' concentration develops wisdom', and the second method is 'wisdom develops concentration.' But we don't need to worry about both methods just yet, if we try the first and it does not work, then we will try the other method. The most important thing is that whichever you choose you must do it seriously to be successful. The genuine thing has to come from earnest striving, as you will see for yourself. The result will depend on your effort. The more often you do it, the more you will develop it.</p>
              <p>The book also mentions about understanding our temperament and habits. Unfortunately, i can't really summerise everythings to give a good overall picture.</p>

              <p>Hi, lately I have been trying to adopt an open awareness and feeling the present moment. Of course, my mind still drifts off but it doesn't wonder that much with mindfulness. I need to consistently remind myself to "live in the present moment" ie the present "now". I would certainly like to think that i am hitting the right note for a beginning on open awareness and the "now" experience. One question that still puzzled me is how can one stay in the "now" (present moment) when one is in thought (eg: thinking about a work process, planning an event, etc.) and meanwhile also trying to adopt an open awareness. Take for instance, when I am strolling, I know I am doing this action (being open awareness) but my mind may be planning on other things while strolling. So, how can my mind be in the present moment when i am in thought? I find that i got to constantly give myself a mental shake to live in the present moment. By the way, aside from the wisdom factor, may we equate "alertness" to be the same as "open awareness" ? Thanks</p>

              <p>Hi, lately I have been trying to adopt an open awareness and
                                                          feeling the present moment. Of course, my mind still drifts off but
                                                          it doesn't wonder that much with mindfulness. I need to
                                                          consistently remind myself to "live in the present moment" ie the
                                                          present "now". I would certainly like to think that i am hitting
                                                          the right note for a beginning on open awareness and the "now"
                                                          experience. One question that still puzzled me is how can one stay
                                                          in the "now" (present moment) when one is in thought (eg: thinking
                                                          about a work process, planning an event, etc.) and meanwhile also
                                                          trying to adopt an open awareness. Take for instance, when I am
                                                          strolling, I know I am doing this action (being open awareness) but
                                                          my mind may be planning on other things while strolling. So, how
                                                          can my mind be in the present moment when i am in thought? I find
                                                          that i got to constantly give myself a mental shake to live in the
                                                          present moment. By the way, aside from the wisdom factor, may we
                                                          equate "alertness" to be the same as "open awareness" ? Thanks</p>

              <p>When you are practicing awareness you will feel vivid, alert, clear and yet natural, open, spacious and relaxed. When we let go of our self we might also have the feeling the awareness is not confined within our body-mind, but that requires our bond/attachment to loosen enough. It becomes permanent only after certain insights/awakening... I am far from that of course.</p>
              <p>We
                                                          can still practice mindful awareness when thinking. Why? Thought itself is
                                                          occuring within and as present awareness. Thought does not belong to
                                                          past or future, even when we are thinking of past and future, the
                                                          thought occuring presently in present awareness and AS present
                                                          awareness. So we should just look at thought as a phenomena like any
                                                          others (i.e. sights and sounds) -- they are all occuring in the present
                                                          and is the display of pure awareness.</p>
              <p>Thoughts have no
                                                          existence apart from awareness. It is only when we are completely
                                                          fixated on our mental stories and contents that we apparently lose
                                                          sight of awareness, but awareness is actually never lost at any moment,
                                                          so we just have to keep coming back and notice it. Our Buddha-Nature,
                                                          emptiness and awareness inseparable is never born and <strong>never ceases</strong>. It is always present. In the same as without water there are no waves on the ocean, and waves can never depart from the ocean, without awareness you cannot even be aware of the thought so thought is inseparable from awareness. So stillness and movement are all evidence of Buddha-Nature -- and all phenomena and thoughts are the activities of Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>When
                                                          we practice observing present awareness, the bond of thoughts seem to
                                                          loosen and we are not so caught up with them. Instead of chasing after
                                                          our thoughts, we are attentive to what is presently happening, yet not
                                                          grasping on them. Practice observing the vivid presence when there is
                                                          no thoughts and even in the thought if thoughts arise.</p>
              <p>When we
                                                          chase after our thoughts, when we are lost in our thoughts, we lose our
                                                          attention and become agitated and lose our peacefulness. Instead of
                                                          simply paying attention to what is presently occuring, we are fixated,
                                                          attached to certain repetitive patterns of thoughts in our head. We feel contracted as an individual, stuck in our repetitive thoughts and feelings and lose 'alignment' with open spacious awareness.</p>
              <p>When
                                                          this occurs we should just pay attention to these thoughts without
                                                          further reacting to them, and in doing so we relax our
                                                          holding/clinging/dwelling and in this way we step out of the thought
                                                          repetitions and just watch whatever manifest arise and pass away by
                                                          themselves.</p>
              <p>Thoughts themselves are made of the same
                                                          substance as empty-awareness -- just like countless waves on the ocean
                                                          are all made of the same substance as the ocean: water. The waves no
                                                          existence apart from the ocean, apart from water.</p>
              <p>Hence it is said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no matter how many waves may arise,<br> They never depart from the ocean even in the slightest.</strong><strong><br> Similarly, whether still or in movement,<br> The 
                                                          mind never departs from awareness and emptiness even in the slightest.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Here's a passage from the Flight of Garuda:</p>

              <p><strong>Song 15 </strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Emaho! Once again, noble children, listen carefully!</p>
              <p>Rest your mind loosely in naturalness and<br> See how the mind is when calm.<br> Observed, it rests calmly in the continuity of awareness.<br> Calm, and yet empty, thus 
                                                          is the state of awareness.<br> Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.<br> This is how calm resting is the mind’s ornament.</p>
              <p>Give rise to a thought and observe how it arises.<br> Since it does not depart even in the slightest<br> From the state of empty and luminous awareness,<br> Arising and 
                                                          yet being empty is thus the state of awareness itself.<br> Fortunate heart-children, you must understand this.<br> This is how arising is the play of mind.</p>
              <p>To illustrate this, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no matter how many waves may arise,<br> They never depart from the ocean even in the slightest.</strong><strong><br> Similarly, whether still or in movement,<br> The 
                                                          mind never departs from awareness and emptiness even in the slightest.</strong></span><br> So rest, since whatever rests calmly is the state of awareness.<br> Rest, since whatever 
                                                          arises is the manifestation of awareness.</p>
              <p>To believe that meditation is only when the mind rests quiet,<br> And maintain that there is no meditation when the mind moves<br> Is proof of not knowing the core 
                                                          of stillness and movement,<br> And of not having mingled stillness, occurrence and awareness.</p>
              <p>For this reason, fortunate and noble heart children,<br> Whether moving or still, mind is the continuity of awareness.<br> So when you have fully comprehended 
                                                          stillness, occurrence and awareness,<br> Then practice these three as one.<br> This is how stillness and thought occurrence are nondual.</p>

              <p>This is the heart teaching of Mahamudra, of Dzogchen, of Zen, of all the nondual
                                              teachings: Sustaining present awareness. Recognizing the Buddha-nature through the present
                                              moment, this very moment of awareness. If it's awareness taking the form of thinking,
                                              recognize the present awareness component of the thought. If you are remembering the past,
                                              recognize the present awareness component of the memory. You're not in the past. How could
                                              you be in the past? It is present awareness remembering. If you feel distracted when
                                              remembering, bring the mind back to the present awareness. You don't have to stop
                                              remembering. Recognize present awareness, which is remembering. If you are dreaming,
                                              fantasizing about the future, about what you are going to do when you leave here, how you
                                              are going to tell everybody how wonderful it was and how great Dzogchen view and
                                              meditation is, that's fine-recognize present awareness fantasizing, planning, dreaming.
                                              Recognize who or what is doing that present awareness. Know the knower; see through the
                                              seer; go beyond me and mine, and be free.</p>

              <p>When you are practicing awareness you will feel vivid, alert,
                                  clear and yet natural, open, spacious and relaxed. When we let go
                                  of our self we might also have the feeling the awareness is not
                                  confined within our body-mind, but that requires our

                                  certain insights/awakening... I am far from that of course.</p>
              <p>We can still practice mindful awareness when thinking. Why?
                                  Thought itself is occuring within and as present awareness. Thought
                                  does not belong to past or future, even when we are thinking of
                                  past and future, the thought occuring presently in present
                                  awareness and AS present awareness. So we should just look at
                                  thought as a phenomena like any others (i.e. sights and sounds) --
                                  they are all occuring in the present and is the display of pure
                                  awareness.</p>
              <p>Thoughts have no existence apart from awareness. It is only when
                                  we are completely fixated on our mental stories and contents that
                                  we apparently lose sight of awareness, but awareness is actually
                                  never lost at any moment, so we just have to keep coming back and
                                  notice it. Our Buddha-Nature, emptiness and awareness inseparable
                                  is never born and <strong>never ceases</strong>. It is always
                                  present. In the same as without water there are no waves on the
                                  ocean, and waves can never depart from the ocean, without awareness
                                  you cannot even be aware of the thought so thought is inseparable
                                  from awareness. So stillness and movement are all evidence of
                                  Buddha-Nature -- and all phenomena and thoughts are the activities
                                  of Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>When we practice observing present awareness, the bond of
                                  thoughts seem to loosen and we are not so caught up with them.
                                  Instead of chasing after our thoughts, we are attentive to what is
                                  presently happening, yet not grasping on them. Practice observing
                                  the vivid presence when there is no thoughts and even in the
                                  thought if thoughts arise.</p>
              <p>When we chase after our thoughts, when we are lost in our
                                  thoughts, we lose our attention and become agitated and lose our
                                  peacefulness. Instead of simply paying attention to what is
                                  presently occuring, we are fixated, attached to certain repetitive
                                  patterns of thoughts in our head. We feel contracted as an
                                  individual, stuck in our repetitive thoughts and feelings and lose
                                  'alignment' with open spacious awareness.</p>
              <p>When this occurs we should just pay attention to these thoughts
                                  without further reacting to them, and in doing so we relax our
                                  holding/clinging/dwelling and in this way we step out of the
                                  thought repetitions and just watch whatever manifest arise and pass
                                  away by themselves.</p>
              <p>Thoughts themselves are made of the same substance as
                                  empty-awareness -- just like countless waves on the ocean are all
                                  made of the same substance as the ocean: water. The waves no
                                  existence apart from the ocean, apart from water.</p>
              <p>Hence it is said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no matter how many waves may
                                  arise,<br> They never depart from the ocean even in the
                                  slightest.</strong><strong><br> Similarly, whether still or in movement,<br> The mind never departs from awareness and emptiness even in the
                                  slightest.</strong></span></p>

              <p>I think Thusness and Longchen can advise much better than me...
                                  I myself have much to learn.</p>

              <p>Firstly, will like to state that I am still learning... so this is just a sharing.</p>
              <p>To me, the 'Now' concept can be quite misleading.</p>
              <p>What is more important for me is to expereince no-self in what is happening. It doesn't matter whether there are thoughts or not. There is a difference in experiencing the world through a self and one without it. This to me is more important.</p>
              <p>The Now concept can put one into a state of wanting to get into such a state. This will cause a thinking that there is a Now state and a non-now state... and that the Now state is better.</p>
              <p>However, the insight of spontaneous manifestation will change this view. Spontaneous manifestion need a clear understanding and experience of no-self. Here, it doesn't matter whether there are thoughts, feelings or not... these expereinces are arising not from a self... and cannot be stopped by a self.</p>
              <p>From the practice point of view, meditation is essential. It is also important to have the ability to realise one's blindspots... that is when one is unconsciously caught up. This can be very very subtle... and hard to discover... and presented the main difficulties for me.</p>
              <p>The conceptual understanding is much easier that the realtime practice.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thanks for sharing with me, I appreciate it. I have taken a quick glance at the linkage to Dzogchen teachings and the Pure Awareness. It cetainly requires me some time to digest it. My thought is that the "no self" is really too abstract, afterall Buddhism teachings are indeed profound and the concepts are not easy to grasp. Meantime, I will be happy if I can always remind myself to be mindful and strive to maintain present awarenesss. Occassionally, I am also afraid to dwell too much in thoughts that may create negative karma in me. Well, need to sign off now, Cheers! </p></div>

              <p><a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="336357">Reflection and Presence: The Dialectic of Awakening</a></p>
              <p>Excerpt:</p>
              <p>The ultimate practice here is learning to remain fully present and
              awake in the middle of whatever thoughts, feelings, perceptions, or
              sensations are occurring and to appreciate them, in
              Mahamudra/Dzogchen terms, as Dharmakaya -- as an ornamental display
              of the empty, luminous essence of awareness. Like waves on the
              ocean, thoughts are not separate from awareness. They are the
              radiant clarity of awareness in motion. In remaining awake in the
              middle of thoughts -- and recognizing them as the luminous energy
              of awareness -- the practitioner maintains presence and can rest
              within their movement. As Namkhai Norbu (1986) suggests:<br> <br> "The essential principle is to ... maintain presence in the state
              of the moving wave of thought itself ... If one considers the calm
              state as something positive to be attained, and the wave of thought
              as something negative to be abandoned, and one remains caught up in
              the duality of grasping and rejecting, there is no way of
              overcoming the ordinary state of the mind.” (p. 144)<br> <br> It is a dualistic fixation, the tension between "me" -- as self --
              and "my thoughts" -- as other -- that makes thinking problematic,
              tormenting, "sticky," like the tarbaby to which Brer Rabbit becomes
              affixed by trying to push it away. Thoughts become thick, solid,
              and heavy only when we react to them. Each reaction triggers
              further thought, so that the thoughts become chained together in
              what appears to be a continuous mind-state. These thought-chains
              are like a relay race, where each new thought picks up the baton
              from the previous thought and runs with it for a moment, passing it
              on again to a subsequent thought. But if the meditator can maintain
              presence in the middle of thinking, free of grasping or rejecting,
              then the thought has nothing to pass the baton on to, and naturally
              subsides. Although this sounds simple, it is advanced practice,
              usually requiring much preliminary training and commitment.<br> <br> When one can rest in presence even in the midst of thoughts,
              perceptions, or intense emotions, these become an ongoing part of
              one's contemplative practice, as opportunities to discover a
              pervasive quality of even awareness in all one's activities. As
              Tarthang Tulku (1974) describes this:<br> <br> "It's possible to make thought itself meditation... How do we go
              into that state? The moment you try to separate yourself from
              thought, you are dealing with a duality, a subject-object
              relationship. You lose the state of awareness because you reject
              your experience and become separate from it.... But if our
              awareness is in the center of thought, the thought itself
              dissolves... At the very beginning... stay in the thoughts. Just be
              there... You become the center of the thought. But there is not
              really any center -- the center becomes balance. There's no
              'being,' no 'subject-object relationships': none of these
              categories exist. Yet at the same time, there is... complete
              openness... So we kind of crack each thought, like cracking nuts.
              If we can do this, any thought becomes meditation... Any moment,
              wherever you are, driving a car, sitting around, working, talking,
              any activities you have -- even if you are very disturbed
              emotionally, very passionate, or even if your mind has become very
              strong, raging, overcome with the worst possible things and you
              cannot control yourself, or you feel depressed... if you really go
              into it, there's nothing there. Whatever comes up becomes your
              meditation. Even if you become extremely tense, if you go into your
              thought and your awareness comes alive, that moment can be more
              powerful than working a long time in meditation practice. (pp.
              9-10, 18)"<br> <br> Here no antidote need be applied: no conceptual understanding, no
              reflection, no stepping back, no detachment, no witnessing. When
              one is totally present in the thought, in the emotion, in the
              disturbance, it relaxes by itself and becomes transparent to the
              larger ground of awareness. The wave subsides back into the ocean.
              The cloud dissolves into the sky. The snake naturally uncoils.
              These are all metaphors that say: It self-liberates.<br> <br> Self-liberation is not a dialogical process, but a "straight heart"
              realization of being-emptiness. It makes possible an intimate
              knowing of reality, as Nishitani suggests when he writes that
              "Things reveal themselves to us only when we leap from the
              circumstance to the center, into their very [suchness]" (1982, p.
              130). This "knowing of not-knowing" is a complete openness and
              attunement to the self-revealing qualities of self, world, and
              other beings.<br> <br> For one who can remain fully present even in the middle of deluded
              thoughts and emotions, the distinction between samsara and nirvana,
              conventional and awakened consciousness, duality and nonduality is
              no longer of great concern. This is known as the awareness of 'one
              taste'. When one is no longer trapped in divided consciousness, the
              relative duality, or play of self and other, in daily life is not a
              problem. One can play by the conventional ground rules of duality
              when appropriate, and drop them when they're not useful. The
              interplay of self and others becomes a humorous dance, an energetic
              exchange, an ornament rather than a hindrance.</p>
