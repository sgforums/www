            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, I am new to this forum and would love to be part of it. This is not because I have a lot to share on my knowledge. On the contrary, I believe in Buddhism but has no firm foundation to grasp its concepts. For a start, may I seek the kind guidance from anyone to enlighten me. Basically, I have a wondering mind, my mind never seem to be able to settle down. Partly because I am a dreamer since young, and lately i have been trying to stop that wondering mind...... but it can be difficult at times, esp. I have a rather hectic working life and there are many human interactions in office that could be disturbing to the mind. But luckily, i am thankful that my life so far is all good and well and i do cherish what i have.....</p></div>

              <p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
              <p>What you need is to maintain the presence of open awareness whether in the midst of thinking or when not-thinking. It is a relaxed, but clear alert presence, that does not reject nor chase after thoughts and experiences that arise in it, but is aware of and present in the thoughts and experiences. The luminous clear awareness simply 'lights up' whatever manifests without discrimination/judgments. Like an ever-present and unmoved mirror that clearly reflects everything but does not modify/seek/grasp/reject them (thoughts and experiences), and is untouched by thoughts and phenomena, indestructible. Then all thoughts are simply the expression of awareness, are not experienced/grasped through dualistic vision. That awareness that is always present but temporarily obscured (by dualistic fixation on thoughts and experiences) is none other than your Buddha-Nature. And in the latter stage of realisation, thoughts (and all other sensations and experiences) are realised to be none other than that pure awareness itself.<br><br>Why do I say that the presence of awareness is required?<br><br>Because even if you reach a state of an absence of thoughts through certain techniques to calm down the mind, or through gradually relaxing the mind, but without that presence of awareness, if just one bad thought arises and there is no awareness.... the tendency is to follow, chase after the thought, and act out according to the thought, creating bad karma and bad consequences. But if there is a presence of awareness, that simply witnesses the thought but does not follow the thought, the thought is allowed to come and go of its own accord and leaves no traces -- there is no grasping or chasing after the thought. Also, without that presence of awareness, a thoughtless state of absorption itself does not lead to insight, enlightenment, liberation. No insight will be born out of such a state, one is not any different than a piece of inanimate wood. (wood doesn't think too right?)<br><br>If you remain that lucid awareness, whenever thoughts that usually 'chain up' to form one thought after another, when they arise they are simply seen as it is -- the hypnotic spell-like quality of the thought is simply not present. It's like you're having a nightmare, yet if one experiences an aware presence in that dream and the intuition that the dream scene is not real, this is only a nightmare, then how can fear affect you? The 'hypnotic' quality of the dream to make you believe in it is gone. You are not totally identified with the contents of your thoughts or the dream, because there is a witnessing going on. That means the dream settings and dream character may play out but the witnessing/aware presence – the movie screen that allows the seeing of the dream/’movie’ scene, remains untouched. You know you are not the dream character in the dream, that it’s just a projection of the mind with no substantiality. The conditioning of thought to bind you, make you absorbed in thoughts and ‘believe them’ and treat them seriously is gone. I have such experiences before, where in dreams and nightmares that aware presence is still there, and I can end that dream.<br><br>As my teacher used to say -- it is better to have 1000 thoughts arise, and be aware of them all, then to have only 1 thought arise, and there is no awareness of it. Because that 1 thought will become a deluded thought, will chain up and form karma and samsaric sufferings (like that single bad thought that leads to committing evil).<br><br>As the saying goes: “ä¸�æ€•å¿µèµ·ï¼Œå�ªæ€•è§‰è¿Ÿ”<br><br>Lastly, it is very helpful if you can practice meditation to develop ‘samadhi’. You can start with maybe 20 or 30 minutes and lengthen it to an hour a day habit. It is developing the quality of an unmoving mind that abides in no-abiding and is unmoved by circumstances. But this ‘samadhi’ must also come with ‘wisdom’ (awareness), otherwise it becomes the case of 1 thought without awareness leading to bad consequences. However, this practice of ‘samadhi’ and ‘wisdom’ must not be confined to sitting practice but should be a 24/7 daily practice. Whatever you are doing, you can ‘practice’ awareness.</p>
              <p>For meditation instructions, best is to receive instructions from a living teacher, though there are books out there on this. For beginners can try reading <em>'</em><a class="l" href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/mfneng/mind0.htm"><em><em>Mindfulness In Plain English</em></em></a>’ (book available for reading online<cite>) </cite>or ‘<a class="l" href="http://www.amazon.com/Meditation-Now-Never-Steve-Hagen/dp/0061143294"><em>Meditation Now or Never<br></em></a></p>

              <p>The best way to learn meditation is under the guidance of a qualified yogi. You need to verify with them your meditative experience. There are limits to what you can know or understand by reading books or through internet.</p>

              <p>A good teacher to the practice of meditation will be excellent.</p>
              <p>Basically, I start by practicing concentration or one pointedness. Then I I direct my concentration to the wandering mind by noticing it wander, but not commenting or feeling irriated about it and bring myself back to the one-pointedness whenever possible.</p>
              <p> In time you will notice your wandering thought slowing down (in the sense you are able to caught it faster before it wander away for too long)</p>

              <p>I am having the same problem too.</p>
              <p>I guess we can't stop the mind from wandering but to observe it when wandering, understand where it orignate from and to control it from wondering further.</p>
              <p>By practising this over and over, the mind wanders less. Guess until we are enlightened, we can't stop the mind from wandering at all.</p>
              <p>Just like the Law of Karma, we can't defeat it; we need to learn how to escape from it.</p>

              <p><br>This is how I am being taught. Just observe. No discussive thinking. Discussive thinking means  " oh this is rupa , this is nama, this is the root cause, this , that ". Just observe, and bring the attention of the mind back to the body (abdomen or walking) if it wanders. By even realizing that the mind wanders, we already have some form of mindfulness of the mental factors.</p>

              <p><br>Actually in history and the 5 surviving translation of Larger Amitabha Sutra ,there isnt an exact figure on the exact number of vows of Amitabha .One version states 35 vows ,while the Qing Dynasty Master Layman Peng Jingqing and Master Layman xialian stated as 48 vows .</p>
              <p>So it doesnt matter how much vows is it .but Medicine Buddha vows is still 12 Vows throughout the translation fm tang ,wei , and North Liang Dynasty</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>Perhaps sanath can share the Jodo Upholded translation as to how many vows of Amitabha ?</p>

              <p>Hi All</p>
              <p>Very thankful to all replies. It's always easier said than done and certainly requires a lot of determination to tame the mind.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify below excerpt by AEN:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Like an ever-present and unmoved mirror that clearly reflects everything but does not modify/seek/grasp/reject them (thoughts and experiences), and is untouched by thoughts and phenomena, indestructible. Then all thoughts are simply the expression of awareness, are not experienced/grasped through dualistic vision.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To illustrate by giving a (ficticious) example: I was wrongly blamed by the boss due to office politics. This thought will keep wandering in my mind. If I were to let the thought come by without suppressing it, will it actually go off without me consciously "nipping off" the bud. Because the mirror analogy given above is like telling me that i know the bad thought is there but just let it be there and refrain from suppressing or accessing the thought. Things reflected by the mirror will always be there unless you removed them. If you do not remove, it will always be there. Hence, am I right to say i got to train my mind such that i know the bad thought exists but do not dwell in it or let that thought affect you. That is, will bad thought actually disappear by itself without you curbing your mind. From my experiences, it will actually linger there (sometimes without me knowing how long it actually has stayed there) if I do not intentionally stop the bad thought.</p>

                  spiritual teachings say that one must get rid of unwholesome stuffs in

                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG">As already mentioned and explained <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/doer-beingdone.html"><strong>here</strong></a>,
                  the sense of self or 'I' is not the doer of action. As much as this
                  'sense of self' desires, it simply has no power over the arising and
                  ceasing of thoughts. Thoughts, are for most part, related to the
                  functioning of memory. Because of that, thoughts and memory cannot be
                  removed by will.</p>
                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG">So, if thoughts cannot be stopped from arising using volition, are we powerless with regards to its influences. No.</p>
                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG">While
                  thoughts cannot be stopped, the attachment or aversion to them can be
                  diminished with training. Both attachments and aversions are types of
                  grasping.</p>

                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>So
                  to be precise, during spiritual practice, we are not supposed to try to
                  stop unwholesome thoughts from arising. This will prove to be
                  ineffective and all we get will be more frustrations. What we can do,
                  is to let go of the grasping to the thoughts. There is an energetic
                  difference between the two.</strong></p>
                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG">About
                  this letting go, it is really a gentle process and cannot be forced.
                  Excessive forcing re-enforces the arising of 'sense of self' and
                  ineffective grasping kicks into action again.</p>
                  <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG">Often,
                  the thoughts that arised are in conditioned response to what is being
                  perceived by the senses. The speed of the arisal of the thought often
                  is very fast. Because there is a perception, which is followed rapidly
                  by the conditioned thought, the conditioned reaction(grasping) to the
                  thought often is almost immediate. The rapid change that occur within
                  this short span of duration is what makes 'recognising' the grasping
                  from the perception and thoughts difficult.</p>

              <p>From 'Meditation: Now or Never' by Steve Hagen:</p>
                  <p><strong>Distracting Thoughts</strong></p>
                  <p>All kinds of thoughts will bubble up in meditation. Some will be mundane, some surprising, some delightful, some disturbing. Let them all arise and fall.</p>
                  <p>Whatever thoughts come up, don't resist them. Resistance will only intensify thinking. Just let the thoughts crop up as they will, and they will die down or drift away on their own.</p>
                  <p>Learn just to <em>watch</em> your thoughts without comment. Put your bare attention on the thoughts without adding anything.</p>
                  <p>The unruly mind doesn't like to be watched. But if we <em>just watch</em> our mind without commenting, even to ourselves, our mind will begin to straighten up and settle down on its own.....</p>
                  <p>...People often think meditation is about driving thoughts out of your
                  mind. But this isn't meditation at all, as Foyan correctly points out.
                  You don't need to annihilate thoughts. Thoughts annihilate themselves,
                  if you'll let them. They simply fall apart. Everything does.<br><br>Yet
                  we think we have to make an effort to drive them out. We don't realize
                  that, in doing so, we only solidify them, and thus deepen our confusion
                  and entanglement.<br><br>In Zen we don't teach people to annihilate
                  their thoughts. Instead we sit quietly and learn to pay attention to
                  what's actually happening. Thoughts will naturally drop away if you
                  don't hang on to them, don't build them into something....</p>
                  <p>.....In meditation, we give full attention to direct experience - that is, what we feel, see, think, hear, smell, or taste right now. That's all. In other words, we don't comment on it. We don't ignore it or squelch it or analyze it or dwell on it or control it. Thus it all washes through.</p>
                  <p>In learning to come into this moment, we realize feelings directly, and we see the thoughts that often come attached to them. But we don't judge them or talk about them. We don't make anything of them at all. They come and go, and we taste them fully and directly, with no aftertaste. We don't consume them, and they don't consume us.</p>
                  <p>We only need to watch. Negative emotions under wordless observation cannot last for long. As long as we don't say anything to ourselves about them, they will naturally weaken and die away. But if we feed and amplify those feelings, they will just as naturally remain and grow.</p>
                  <p>Our emotions and thoughts are like the weather. They are sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant, always changing. We can do little to control them directly, and are wise not to try. Yet they needn't control us, either. What we can do is to be alert. Just observe and let them be what they are. And after the occasional, inevitable storm has passed, we only need to quietly watch as the clouds dissipate on their own without any help from us.</p>

              <p>Different humans have different capacities, what works for one may not work for another. A method that is useful for others may not work on you. Buddhism practice has 84,000 ways, we have hundreds of sutras, we have Theravada, Tibetan, Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, within Chinese Mahayana we have Tiantai, Yogacara, Pureland, Zen .... What is important is that you must find what works for you. </p>
              <p>But all methods must adhere to principle of three fold training i.e.  <a title="Sila" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sila">sila</a> (conduct or virtue), samadhi or <a title="Samatha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha">samatha</a> (concentration), and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pañña" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%C3%B1%C3%B1a">pañña</a> (wisdom)  æˆ’ï¼Œ å®šï¼Œ æ…§.</p>
              <p>Sila requires you to abstrain from killing, stealing, intoxicating yourself etc.</p>
              <p>Samadhi - many different ways: chanting (e.g. the amitbha in pureland sect, meditation, cultivation for awarenessï¼Œ tibetan mantra like om mani padme hum ...). Most of these methods require instruction from a Master when you go deeper.</p>
              <p>Panna - cultivate wisdom in Buddhism, there is basic teaching like law of karma, 4 noble truths and more advanced one like the law of dependent arising (sunyata)</p>
              <p>Training in one of the 3 aspects will help you in the two other aspects. For example, you may find your progress in meditation is slow. So you shift your focus to Sila and Panna to make progress. Later when you come back to meditate again, you may be surprised how the other two espects are helping you.</p>

              <p>Very well said by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche:</p>
              <p>This Very Mind, Empty and Luminous</p>
              <p>http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3204&amp;Itemid=247</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Excerpt:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Think about it from the perspective of your own experience. What do
              you do when an aggressive thought suddenly arises? You might try to
              stop that thought, deflect its energy by justifying it, or even correct
              it—change it from a “negative” thought into a “positive” one. We do all
              these things because we feel that that thought, just as it is, is not
              good enough to meditate on. We will meditate on the next pure thought
              we have; or even better, we will rest in the essence of the gap between
              our thoughts, the very next one we recognize. In this way, we
              continually miss the moment that we are awake now. The problem is that
              we will never catch up to the wakefulness of the next moment, the
              wakefulness we will have in the future. If aggression is here now, then
              that aggression is at heart, in its very nature, vividly awake, empty,
              and luminous. As our simple-minded master of Mahamudra and Dzogchen
              might say, “Do you see it? That is it.”<br></strong></span></span><br>You may prefer to
              meditate on the Buddha rather than on your emotions. The Buddha is
              always perfectly relaxed and at ease; therefore, you feel very
              comfortable. When you are meditating on your emotions, you may start to
              feel slightly anxious and uncomfortable. You may think that your mental
              health is at risk, or that the environment of your mind is not in a
              sacred, uplifted, or spiritual state. It is helpful to a certain point,
              at the beginning of our training, to meditate on pure objects like
              images of the Buddha, deities, or great masters. If, however, you get
              addicted to relying on such objects, there can be negative
              consequences. When you feel you cannot invoke the experience of
              sacredness or connect with your basic, enlightened mind through your
              everyday experiences of perceptions, thoughts, and emotions, you are
              developing a serious problem. Your emotions are as familiar, as
              commonplace, as sunshine and flowers, and that is great news for
              realizing ordinary mind. You have so many opportunities. Appreciate and
              take advantage of them. <br><br>What we have been looking for—the true
              nature of our mind—has been with us all the time. It is with us now, in
              this very moment. The teachings say that if we can penetrate the
              essence of our present thought—whatever it may be—if we can look at it
              directly and rest within its nature, we can realize the wisdom of
              buddha: ordinary mind, naked awareness, luminous emptiness, the
              ultimate truth. The future will always be out of reach. You will never
              meet up with the buddha of the future. The present buddha is always
              within reach. Do you see this buddha? Where are you looking?<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Adapted from the “Wild Awakening” lecture series presented in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, in February, 2004.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span></p>

Your explanation is indeed profound and I would never be able to put it down in detailed words on the delicate workings in our mind. I am amazed by your thoughts and take my hat off.  At least I now understand that thought will just arise and is not something which can be controlled by a person’s will power. However, it is conditioned by our perception from our fives senses. But instead of me dwelling on the thought when it arises, I should always try to be alert on when it arises and know when it disappears …. with no attachments or comments on these thoughts. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Just to digress a little, I can be very emotional when watching movies and this has affected my mood. So, perhaps the next time when I am watching movies, I should just enjoy it and try to disassociate the storyline with reality. I also love gazing at the scenery and really enjoying it esp in good mood. But does this mean my mind shouldn’t be carried away to indulge in the moment. I certainly do not think so since I am living in the moment and appreciating the mother’s nature. As what I assume AEN has implied that we are not a piece of wood. But it's kind of difficult not to be carried away and be alert / mindful at all times. In summary, I gather one got to be mindful, have compassions yet should not be attaching too much emotions in anything. I am no saint and can only try to strike a sweet balance between all these ......   </span></span></span></p>

              <p>The greatest enjoyment comes from being authenticated with non-dual, open awareness. When you are in nature, be fully mindful of what you see and hear. In fact it is our thinking that prevents us from fully 'enjoying' what is present. Our obsessive thinking will try to come up with something to worry ("what am I doing here walking in the park, I got to do this and that, blah blah...") or think, instead of being fully alive to what is present in one's own experience. Also when looking at, say, a tree, one does not label the tree, think about the tree etc, but simply submerge himself in that pure experience of the tree.</p>
              <p>You may encounter experiences of a sense of openness/boundlessness, as if you are not confined and limited to your body mind. When looking at nature, you are at one with nature, and everything is experienced in immense clarity. When seeing the tree there is the sense that you are the tree (more accurately there was no 'you', just the tree), you are not some entity inside the body looking outwards -- that you are in fact the seeing that is inseparable from the seen. In seeing tree there is just that experience of tree, which is pure aliveness, without a separate observer. Any sense of a separate self, or separation, uncoils. Everything is experienced as pure awareness. It might be a bit difficult to imagine but once you have glimpses of this you will understand. Yet even when one has had glimpses of such experiences, it is not yet the same as having the realisation/insight into it (the no-self and non-dual nature) as an ever-present characteristic of reality, or a dharma seal, and not as a temporary stage of experience.</p>
              <p>Pure Awareness perfectly reflects everything in clarity like a mirror, whether thoughts, or sight, or sound, everything is being 'awared' in/as pure awareness, our Buddha-Nature. But awareness itself does not 'grasp' or 'seek' any of these experiences, it is our deluded, sentient mind that does that. Awareness just naturally, non-discriminatorily, 'awares' by itself -- like the sound of airplane will effortlessly be heard when the condition arise (and it's not like you have any choice in that! unpleasant or pleasant sounds will be heard when the condition is there, whether you like it or not), awareness is always already 'here' manifesting as everything -- just that our being immersed in identifying with the story of 'me', 'mine', etc that we miss it all.</p>
              <p>Many people have pre-conceived notions that awareness requires a lot of mental effort to be sustained. They may think that it is some sort of highly concentrated state where one is fixated/focused an unmoving point. (which it is not) It is not an exercise in concentration (like samatha practices). Awareness is actually effortless, and the practice of awareness is more like a process of 'undoing' than a 'doing' and is just allowing our pure awareness, pure experience, to manifest in its completeness and clarity without mental filters (symbols, labeling, interpreted, etc). Awareness does not need a lot of effort to be 'held on to', (it is always already naturally here), we just have to relax/release our fixation on our thoughts and return to being mindful of our experience, which may include thoughts occasionally arising.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">The key point about the practice of mindful awareness is there is no keeping of the mind on anything and by not resting on
                          anything, it fuses into everything; therefore it cannot be
                          concentrated; rather it is to relax into nothingness empty of self,
                          empty of any artificial doing so that the natural luminosity can take
                          its own course. There is no focusing, there is only allowing the mirror
                          bright clarity to shine with its natural radiance. In essence there is
                          no one there, only the phenomenon arising and ceasing according to
                          conditions, telling their stories.</span></p>
              <p>If you practice mindfulness, you will be amazed by the quality of experience... everything becomes alive. There will also be immense bliss accompanied by this experience.</p>
              <p>As Thusness told me many years ago,</p>
              <p><em>You must taste, sense, eat, hear and see Pure Awareness in every authentication. And every authentication is Bliss. </em></p>
              <p>Anyway being "carried away" implies that your attention is fixated on thoughts and concepts, and you are immersed in thinking about past and future. But if you are fully present to your experience, that is not being carried away, more like 'returning' to where you have never left.</p>
              <p>p.s. an author 'Byron Katie' wrote her own awakening experience:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><em></em></em></p>
              <p><em>Less than two weeks after I entered the halfway house, my life changed
                              completely. What follows is a very approximate account. </em></p>
              <p><em> One morning I woke up. I had been sleeping
                              on the floor as usual. Nothing special had happened the night before; I
                              just opened my eyes. But I was seeing without concepts, without
                              thoughts or an internal story. There was no me. It was as if something
                              else had woken up. <em>It </em> opened its eyes. <em>It </em>was
                              looking through Katie's eyes. And it was crisp, it was clear, it was
                              new, it had never been here before. Everything was unrecognizable. And
                              it was so delighted! Laughter welled up from the depths and just poured
                              out. It breathed and was ecstasy. It was intoxicated with joy: totally
                              greedy for everything. There was nothing separate, nothing unacceptable
                              to it. Everything was its very own self. For the first time I — it —
                              experienced the love of its own life. I — it —was <em>amazed! </em></em></p>
              <p><em> In trying to be as accurate as possible, I am using the word “it” for
                              this delighted, loving awareness, in which there was no me or world,
                              and in which everything was included. There just isn't another way to
                              say how completely new and fresh the awareness was. There was no I
                              observing the “it.” There was nothing but the “it.” And even the
                              realization of an “it” came later. </em></p>
              <p><em> Let me say this in a different way. A foot appeared; there was a cockroach crawling over it. <em>It </em> opened its eyes, and there was something on the foot; or there was something on the foot, and then <em>it </em>opened its eyes — I don't know the sequence, because there was no time in any of this. So, to put it in slow motion: <em>it </em> opened its eyes, looked down at the foot, a cockroach was crawling across the ankle, and … <em>it </em></em> was awake! It was born. And from then on, it's been observing. But
                              there wasn't a subject or an object. It was — is — everything it saw.
                              There's no separation in it, anywhere.</p>
              <p><em> All my rage, all the thoughts that had been troubling me, my whole world, <em>the </em> whole world, was gone. The only thing that existed was awareness. The
                              foot and the cockroach weren't outside me; there was no outside or
                              inside. It was all me. And I felt delight — absolute delight! There was
                              nothing, and there was a whole world: walls and floor and ceiling and
                              light and body, everything, in such fullness. But only what <em>it </em> could see: no more, no less. </em></p>
              <p><em> Then it stood up, and <em>that </em> was amazing. There was no thinking, no plan. It just stood up and
                              walked to the bathroom. It walked straight to a mirror, and it locked
                              onto the eyes of its own reflection, and it understood. And that was
                              even deeper than the delight it had known before. It fell in love with
                              that being in the mirror. It was as if the woman and the awareness of
                              the woman had permanently merged. There were only the eyes, and a sense
                              of absolute vastness, with no knowledge in it. It was as if I — she —
                              had been shot through with electricity. It was like God giving itself
                              life through the body of the woman — God so loving and bright, so vast
                              — and yet she knew that it was herself. It made such a deep connection
                              with her eyes. There was no meaning to it, just a nameless recognition
                              that consumed her. </em></p>
              <p><em> Love is the best word I can find for it. It had been split apart, and now it was joined. There was <em>it </em> moving, and then <em>it </em>in
                              the mirror, and then it joined as quickly as it had separated — it was
                              all eyes. The eyes in the mirror were the eyes of it. And it gave
                              itself back again , as it met again. And that gave it its identity,
                              which I call love. As <em>it </em><em>it </em> what it is.
                              People name things a wall, a ceiling, a foot, a hand. But it had no
                              name for these things, because it's indivisible. And it's invisible.
                              Until the eyes. Until the eyes. I remember tears of gratitude pouring
                              down the cheeks as <em>it </em> looked at its own reflection. <em>It </em> stood there staring for I don't know how long. </em> looked in the mirror, the eyes —
                              the depth of them— were all that was real, all that existed — prior to
                              that, nothing. No eyes, no anything; even standing there, there was
                              nothing. And then the eyes come out to give</p>
              <p><em> These were the first moments after I was born as it, or it as me. There
                              was nothing left of Katie. There was literally not even a shred of
                              memory of her — no past, no future, not even a present. And in that
                              openness, such joy. “There's nothing sweeter than this,” I felt; “there
                              <em>is </em> nothing but this. If you loved yourself more than anything you could
                              imagine, you would give yourself this. A face. A hand. Breath. But
                              that's not enough. A wall. A ceiling. A window. A bed. Light bulbs.
                              Ooh! And this too! And this too! And this too!” </em></p>
              <p><em> All this took place beyond time. But when I put it into language, I
                              have to backtrack and fill in. While I was lying on the floor, I
                              understood that when I was asleep, prior to cockroach or foot, prior to
                              any thoughts, prior to any world, there is nothing. In that instant,
                              the four questions of The Work were born. I understood that no thought
                              is true. The whole of inquiry was already present in that
                              understanding. It was like closing a gate and hearing it click shut. It
                              wasn't I who woke up: inquiry woke up. The two polarities, the left and
                              right of things, the something/nothing of it all, woke up. Both sides
                              were equal. I understood this in that first instant of no-time . </em></p>
              <p><em> So to say it again: As I was lying there in the awareness, <em>as </em> the awareness, the thought arose: <em>It's a foot. </em> And immediately I saw that it wasn't true, and that was the delight of
                              it. I saw that it was all backward. It's not a foot; it's not a
                              cockroach. It wasn't true, and yet there was a foot, there was a
                              cockroach. <em>It </em> opened its eyes and saw a foot, and a
                              cockroach crawling over the foot. But there was no name for these
                              things. There were no separate words for foot or cockroach or wall or
                              any of it. So it was looking at its entire body, looking at itself,
                              with no name. Nothing was separate from it, nothing was outside it, it
                              was all pulsing with life and delight, and it was all one unbroken
                              experience. To separate that wholeness and see anything as outside
                              itself, wasn't true. The foot existed, yet it wasn't a separate thing,
                              and to call it a “foot,” or an anything, felt like a lie. It was
                              absurd. And the laughter kept pouring out of me. I saw that <em>cockroach </em><em>foot </em> are names for joy, that there <em>are </em>no
                              names for what appears as real now. This was the birth of awareness:
                              thought reflecting back as itself, seeing itself as everything,
                              surrounded by the vast ocean of its own laughter. </em> and</p>
              <p><em> When I try to explain how The Work was born in that instant of
                              realization, I can analyze the instant, slow it down, and tell it so
                              that it takes on time. But this is giving time to an instant that
                              wasn't even an instant. In that no-time, everything was known and seen
                              as nothing. <em>It </em> saw a foot, and it knew that it wasn't a foot, and it loved that it
                              was. The first and second of the four questions is like the slow-motion
                              mechanics of the experience. “It's a foot” — <em>is that true? Can I absolutely know that it's true? </em> No. What was it like before the thought of “foot” appeared, before there was the world of “foot”? Nothing. </em></p>
              <p><em> Then the third question: <em>How do I react when I believe the thought? </em> I was aware that there's always a contraction, that when I believe any
                              thought I create a world separate from myself, an object that is
                              apparently “out there,” and that the contraction is a form of
                              suffering. And the fourth: <em>Who would I be without that thought? </em> I would be prior to thought, I would be — I am — peace, absolute joy.
                              Then the turnaround: It's a foot / it's not a foot. Actually, all four
                              questions were present in the first — <em>Is it true? </em> — and
                              everything was already released in the instant that the first question
                              was asked. The second, third, and fourth questions were embedded in the
                              inquiry that was there in the experience. There were no words for any
                              of the questions — they were not explicit, not thought, not experienced
                              in time, but present as possibilities when I looked at my experience
                              later and tried to make it available for people. With the fourth
                              question the circle is complete. And then the turnaround is the
                              grounding, the re-entry. There's nothing / there's something. And in
                              that way people can be held without the terror of being nothing,
                              without identity. The turnaround holds them until it's a comfortable
                              place. And they realize that <em>nowhere to go </em>is really where they already are. </em></p>

                              got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out
                              more about the experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of
                              impermanence syncs deeply with what I experience in life. I am faced
                              with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by financial
                              crisis. At that point in time I have no idea that Buddhism is so
                              profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The mystery of life cannot
                              be understood, I seek for a refuge in Buddhism to alleviate my sorrows
                              caused by the financial crisis but it turned out to be the missing key
                              towards experiencing total presence.<br><br>I wasn’t that resistant
                              then about the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but the idea that all phenomenon

                              into me. Are they talking about the ‘Self’ as a personality or ‘Self’
                              as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we do away even with the ‘Witness’ itself or
                              the Witness is another illusion itself?<br><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is sound, no hearer<br>Suffering exists, no sufferer<br>Deeds there are, no doer<br><br>I
                              was meditating the above stanza deeply…about its meaning until one day,
                              suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it was so clear, there was nothing else,
                              just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’ resounding…. It was so

                              any in-between…What is it? IT is Presence! But this time it is not ‘I
                              AM’, it is not asking ‘who am I’, it is not the pure sense of “I AM”,

              <p>Many people have pre-conceived notions that awareness requires a
                                                      lot of mental effort to be sustained. They may think that it is
                                                      some sort of highly concentrated state where one is fixated/focused
                                                      an unmoving point. (which it is not) It is not an exercise in
                                                      concentration (like samatha practices). Awareness is actually
                                                      effortless, and the practice of awareness is more like a process of
                                                      'undoing' than a 'doing' and is just allowing our pure awareness,
                                                      pure experience, to manifest in its completeness and clarity
                                                      without mental filters (symbols, labeling, interpreted, etc).
                                                      Awareness does not need a lot of effort to be 'held on to', (it is
                                                      always already naturally here), we just have to relax/release our
                                                      fixation on our thoughts and return to being mindful of our
                                                      experience, which may include thoughts occasionally arising.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">The key point
                                                      about the practice of mindful awareness is there is no keeping of
                                                      the mind on anything and by not resting on anything, it fuses into
                                                      everything; therefore it cannot be concentrated; rather it is to
                                                      relax into nothingness empty of self, empty of any artificial doing
                                                      so that the natural luminosity can take its own course. There is no
                                                      focusing, there is only allowing the mirror bright clarity to shine
                                                      with its natural radiance. In essence there is no one there, only
                                                      the phenomenon arising and ceasing according to conditions, telling
                                                      their stories.</span></p>
              <p>If you practice mindfulness, you will be amazed by the quality
                                                      of experience... everything becomes alive. There will also be
                                                      immense bliss accompanied by this experience.</p>
              <p>As Thusness told me many years ago,</p>
              <p><em>You must taste, sense, eat, hear and see Pure Awareness in
                                                      every authentication. And every authentication is Bliss.</em></p>
              <p>Anyway being "carried away" implies that your attention is
                                                      fixated on thoughts and concepts, and you are immersed in thinking
                                                      about past and future. But if you are fully present to your
                                                      experience, that is not being carried away, more like 'returning'
                                                      to where you have never left.</p>
              <p>p.s. an author 'Byron Katie' wrote her own awakening

              <p>Excerpt:</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Want to add on to something about the difference of awareness and focusing.</p>
              <p>Awareness is not the same as the practice of focusing or concentration. Many non-Buddhist kinds of meditation, yoga, etc etc are purely exercises in concentration and does not bring about the kind of insights that as a practitioner of Buddhism we are aiming for, the kind of insights that eventually lead to liberation and Nirvana. Exercises in concentration can bring about altered states of consciousness but not wisdom and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism our practice of mindful awareness does not require us to be focusing on a single unchanging object of awareness. During meditation in Buddhism, some people may employ certain kinds of 'support' in meditation -- for example they may begin by practicing mindful awareness of their breathing sensations. Or they may practice a more formless kind of meditation which is aware of whatever is happening without focusing solely on the breathe. But even in the mindfulness of breathing practice in Buddhism, the purpose is not just to enter a profound state of concentrative absorption, because our breathe is constantly changing, and if you are simply aware of the changing sensations itself, it cannot be an unchanging object of concentration. Awareness of the impermanency of all experiences is one of the goal of Buddhist meditation, fixating on something stable as if it is solid does not bring about insight into its nature but leads to progressive stages of absorption known as samatha jhanas, which are very blissful but temporary.</p>
              <p>Similarly in daily lives, even while we are moving about, we can practice awareness. Our attention may shift from one thing to another, and we do not have to suppress that movement. No movement needs to be suppressed and whatever arises in awareness is perfectly fine to meditate on, whether it's scenes, sounds, taste, smell, touch, or thoughts. Including as mentioned by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, negative emotions, or any kind of emotions, thoughts, feelings. If it were a practice of concentration, then shifting of attention away from that object of concentration may be deemed as a hindrance to one's meditation. But in the practice of mindful awareness, we are not trying to fixate or focus or concentrate on one unchanging point to the exclusion of others. That is not the purpose of it. Rather it is to fully experience that luminous clear nature in all our experience, and also its empty nature. And its nature of impermanence. And the nature of no-self.</p>
              <p>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: <em>"We need to dismantle our fixation on the permanence of what we
                          experience. A normal person clings to his experiences as being 'real,'
                          concrete, and permanent. But if we look closely at what happens,
                          experience is simply experience, and it is not made out of anything. It
                          has no form, no sound, no color, no taste, no texture; it is simply
                          empty cognizance."</em></p>
              <p>As a friend of mine asked our moderator Thusness a few years ago:</p>

              <p>Hi, I am not certain if I have understood Byron Katie's awakening experiences. But I like the dialogue part with Thusness, it has kind of enlightened me a little. In this forum, I am only beginning to see the indepth knowledge on Buddhism, and got to admit that I am certainly far out of the class of most of you here with respect to the Buddhism knowledge, such as the Heart Sutra.</p>
              <p>Today, I have tried to be mindful and tried to live in the present moment. Of course, I am not seeing myself and the environment as "one-self", rather just experiencing all the things that are surrounding me just as they are. I like it and enjoy the way it is. However, I found myself wondering how would one handle this precious moment when one has a setback in life, for instance illness, stress in work, financial problems, etc..... . The mind will not be as calm to appreicate the beauty of the present moment, needless to say is this the ideal time to cultivate one mind's under these circumstances. Sadly, I find it hard, though i know my faith in Buddhism will still remain unwavered.</p>

The tendency to chase or worry about things is strong, but as long as we notice, let it go and return to this experience.. our mind will not 'control' us. We should cultivate that mindfulness, if there is mindfulness, it is not difficult.</p>
              <p>One simply acts out to solve the practical problems of life without giving reality to mental stories. Much like in dangerous situations people act out to save people (in a fire, or someone drowning). There is no notion of 'I' and no sense of volition -- it just acts out spontaneously according to condition. Buddha-Nature has always been acting out spontaneously according to conditions.</p>
              <p>There are no 'problems' ultimately. What's wrong with right now unless you think about it? If possible you can also try to spend some time to meditate everyday.</p>
              <p>Hopefully this helps:</p>

              <p><strong>The Power of Now; Eckhart Tolle</strong>, Excerpt:<br> <br> All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time
                                      and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry
                                      - all forms of fear - are caused by to much future, not enough
                                      presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness,
                                      bitterness, all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much
                                      past, not enough presence.<br> <br> Most people find it difficulty to believe that a state of
                                      consciousness totally free of all negativity is possible. And yet
                                      this is the liberated state to which all spiritual teachings point.
                                      It is the promise of salvation, not in an illusory future by right
                                      here and now.<br> <br> You may find it hard to recognise that time is the cause of your
                                      suffering or your problems. You believe that they are caused by
                                      specific situations in your life, and seen from a conventional
                                      viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt with the basic
                                      problem-making dysfunction of the mind - its attachment to past and
                                      future and denial of the Now - problems are actually
                                      interchangeable. If all your problems or perceived causes of
                                      suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for your today,
                                      but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon
                                      find yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of
                                      suffering, like a shadow that follows you wherever you go.
                                      Ultimately, there is only one problem: the time-bound mind
                                      itself.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">I cannot believe that I could
                                      ever reach a point where I am complete free of my
                                      problems.</span><br> <br> You are right. You can never <span style="font-style: italic;">reach</span> that point because you
                                      <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> at that point
                                      <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span>.<br> <br> There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future.
                                      Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.<br> <br> <strong>Finding The Life Underneath Your Life
                                      Situation</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">I don't see how I can be free
                                      now. As it happens, I am extremely unhappy with my life at the
                                      moment. This is a fact, and I would be deluding myself if I tried
                                      to convince myself that all is well when it definitely isn't. To me
                                      the present moment is very unhappy; it is not liberating at all.
                                      What keeps me going is the hope or possibility of some improvement
                                      in the future.</span><br> <br> You think that your attention is in the present moment when it's
                                      actually taken up completely by time. You cannot be both unhappy
                                      <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> fully present in the
                                      Now.<br> <br> What you refer to as your "life" should be more accurately be
                                      called your "life situation." It is psychological time: past and
                                      future. Certain things in the past didn't go the way you wanted
                                      them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and
                                      now you are resisting the <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>. Hope is what keeps you going, but
                                      hope keeps you focused on the future, and this continued focus
                                      perpetuates your denial of the Now and therefore your
                                      unhappiness.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">It is true that my present life
                                      situation is the result of things that happened in the past, but it
                                      is still my present situation, and being stuck in it is what makes
                                      me unhappy.</span><br> <br> Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to
                                      your <span style="font-style: italic;">life</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">What is the

                                      Narrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation may be
                                      full of problems - most life situations are - but find out if you
                                      have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in ten minutes,
                                      but now. Do you have a problem now?<br> <br> When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to
                                      enter, no room for a solution. So whenever you can, make some room,
                                      create some space, so that you find the life underneath your life
                                      situation.<br> <br> Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look,
                                      don't interpret. See the lights, shapes, colours, textures. Be
                                      aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space
                                      that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge
                                      them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something
                                      - anything - and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm
                                      of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life
                                      energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and
                                      without. Allow the "isness" of all things. Move deeply into the
                                      Now.<br> <br> You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction of
                                      time. You are getting out of the insane mind that is draining you
                                      of life energy, just as it is slowly poisoning and destroying the
                                      Earth. You are awakening out of the dream of time into the

              <p><strong>All Problems Are Illusions Of The Mind</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">It feels as if a heavy burden has
                                      been lifted. A sense of lightness. I feel clear... but my problems
                                      are still there waiting for me, aren't they? They haven't been
                                      solved. Am I not just temporarily evading them?</span><br> <br> If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before your
                                      mind would say "yes, but...."<br> <br> Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about
                                      realizing that there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be left
                                      alone and accepted as part of the "isness" of the present moment
                                      until they change or <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> be dealt with. Problems are mind-made and need time to survive.
                                      They cannot survive in the actuality of the Now.<br> <br> Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have
                                      at this moment.<br> <br> [Pause and meditate]<br> <br> I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a
                                      problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that
                                      needs to be either dealt with or accepted - yes. Why make it into a
                                      problem? Why make anything into a problem? Isn't lifechallenging
                                      enough as it is? What do you need problems for? The mind
                                      unconsciously loves problems because they give you an identity of
                                      sorts. This is normal, and it is insane. "Problem" means that you
                                      are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true
                                      intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are
                                      unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so
                                      overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of
                                      life, of Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane burden
                                      of a hundred things that you will or may have to do in the future
                                      instead of focusing your attention on the one thing that you can do
                                      now.<br> <br> When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a
                                      simple choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, I will
                                      create no more pain for myself. I will create no more problems.
                                      Although it is a simple choice, it is also very radical. You won' t
                                      make that choice unless you are truly fed up with suffering, unless
                                      you have truly had enough. And you won't be able to go through with
                                      it unless you access the power of the Now. If you create no more
                                      pain for yourself, then you create no more pain for others. You
                                      also no longer contaminate the beautiful Earth, your inner space,
                                      and the collective human psyche with the negativity of
                                      problem-making.<br> <br> [Pause and meditate]<br> <br> If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, you
                                      will know that it wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have time to
                                      fool around and make it into a problem. In a true emergency, the
                                      mind stops; you become totally present in the Now, and something
                                      infinitely more powerful takes over. This is why there are many
                                      reports of ordinary people suddenly becoming capable of incredibly
                                      courageous deeds. In any emergency, either you survive or you
                                      don't. Either way, it is not a problem.<br> <br> Some people get angry when they hear me say that problems are
                                      illusions. I am threatening to take away their sense of who they
                                      are. They have invested much time in a false sense of self. For
                                      many years, they have unconsciously defined their whole identity in
                                      terms of' their problems or their suffering. Who would they be
                                      without it?<br> <br> A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated
                                      by fear, which of course is always linked with having your focus on
                                      the future and being out of touch with the Now. As there are no
                                      problems in the Now, there is no fear either.<br> <br> Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your
                                      action will be clear and incisive if it arises out of
                                      present-moment awareness. It is also more likely to be effective.
                                      It will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of your
                                      mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In other
                                      instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, you will
                                      find it more effective to do nothing - just stay centered in the
                                      Now.<br> <br> <strong>A Quantum Leap In The Evolution Of

                                      human psyche. But what we are doing here is part of a profound
                                      transformation that is taking place in the collective consciousness
                                      of the planet and beyond: the awakening of consciousness from the
                                      dream of matter, form, and separation. The ending of time. We are
                                      breaking mind patterns that have dominated human life for eons.
                                      Mind pat-terns that have created unimaginable suffering on a vast
                                      scale. I am not using the word evil. It is more helpful to call it
                                      unconsciousness or insanity.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">This breaking-up of the old mode

                                      to do or will it happen anyway? I mean, is this change
                                      inevitable?</span><br> <br> That's a question of perspective. The doing and the happening is in
                                      fact a single process; because you are one with the totality of
                                      consciousness, you cannot separate the two. But there is no
                                      absolute guarantee that humans will make it. The process isn't
                                      inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation is an essential part of
                                      it. However you look at it, it is a quantum leap in the evolution
                                      of consciousness, as well as our only chance of survival as a
                                      race.</p>
              <p><strong>The Joy Of Being</strong><br> <br> To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by
                                      psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself:
                                      Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there
                                      isn't, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is
                                      perceived as a burden or a struggle.<br> <br> If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it
                                      does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are
                                      doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. "How" is always more
                                      important than "what." See if you can give much more attention to
                                      the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it.
                                      Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This
                                      implies that you also completely accept what is, because you cannot
                                      give your full attention to something and at the same time resist
                                      it.<br> <br> As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and
                                      struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When
                                      you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes
                                      imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most
                                      simple action.<br> <br> [Pause and meditate]<br> <br> So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action - just give
                                      attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of its own
                                      accord. This is a powerful spiritual practice. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bhagavad Gita</span>, one of the oldest and
                                      most beautiful spiritual teachings in existence, non-attachment to
                                      the fruit of your action is called Karma Yoga. It is described as
                                      the path of "consecrated action."<br> <br> When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of
                                      Being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns
                                      to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no
                                      longer depend on the future for fulfillment and satisfaction - you
                                      don't look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to
                                      the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change
                                      your inner state of Being. You have found the life underneath your
                                      life situation.<br> <br> In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived
                                      from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, the
                                      psychological need to become anything other than who you are
                                      already is no longer there. In the world, on the level of your life
                                      situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgeable,
                                      successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper dimension of
                                      Being you are complete and whole now.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">In that state of wholeness, would
                                      we still be able or willing to pursue external goals?</span><br> <br> Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that
                                      anything or anybody in the future will save you or make you happy.
                                      As far as your life situation is concerned, there may be things to
                                      be attained or acquired. That's the world of form, of gain and
                                      loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you
                                      realize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do.
                                      Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals
                                      with grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the
                                      need to become someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear
                                      of failure, which to the egois loss of self. When your deeper sense
                                      of self is derived from Being, when you are free of "becoming" as a
                                      psychological need, neither your happiness nor your sense of self
                                      depends on the outcome, and so there is freedom from fear. You
                                      don't seek permanency where it cannot be found: in the world of
                                      form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don't demand that
                                      situations, conditions, places, or people should make you happy,
                                      and then suffer when they don't live up to your expectations.<br> <br> Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born and die,
                                      yet you are aware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know
                                      that "nothing real can be threatened."<br> <br> When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have
                                      succeeded already.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, it is probably not as simple as just living at "now". For example, you are trying to meditate or chant and suddenly your  3-year old kid is making noise or tries to disturb you ... what are you going to do? The same question is posed to Mr æ�Žç‚³å�— (a disciple of Master Yin Kuang). He said you can scold or hit your children after you finish your meditation or chanting but you should not get angry while you are chanting. And you also must not get angry when you are scolding your children later.</p>
              <p>Well, this is easy said than done. It takes time and mindfullness to slowly improve ourselves.</p>
