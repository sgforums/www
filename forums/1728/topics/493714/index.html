              Age of Facebook and Trump</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Dr. Jay Michaelson MAR 07,
              2017 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">A
              meditation teacher and political columnist makes a case for considering the
              Internet an intoxicant that should be used in moderation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              literally cannot help ourselves. The news is toxic, the conversations about it
              are often rancorous . . . and yet, let me scroll down one more time to see what
              else is new.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Certainly,
              the Trump administration has brought with it new opportunities to worry,
              obsess, fear, get angry, get motivated, detach, indulge—and with any luck, to
              notice these various mind states as they come and go. The Internet, too, is
              quite new, at least in terms of human evolution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              some of our online conundrum is, in fact, quite old. Given the research on
              Internet addiction, I want to suggest that it’s time to expand the fifth
              precept, which proscribes the consumption of intoxicants, to include the online
              world. The Internet is an intoxicant and should be treated as such.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">First,
              social media is designed to maximize addictive behavior. Push notifications,
              “likes,” and other positive feedback loops have been shown to trigger the
              brain’s dopamine system. With each “like” you get, your brain gets the same
              little jolt that it gets from drugs, sex, gambling, and other potentially
              addictive stimuli.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thanks
              to evolution, we are wired to watch vigilantly for threats and reward, and to
              enjoy that reward when it comes. Thanks to social media, that happens every
              time your phone beeps.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What
              is that? Anticipation. Did I get a new like? Hope for validation. I did!
              Dopamine reward. This cycle activates the same parts of the brain as heroin and
              cocaine. Indeed, a 2011 study showed that heavy Internet users suffered
              physical and mental withdrawal symptoms after unplugging for a day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
              then there’s the converse: the feelings of envy or loneliness that can arise
              from viewing other people’s life updates. Researchers have dubbed this
              “Facebook depression.” Another study showed that the reward centers in young
              people’s brains were activated more by the “likes” a photo gets than by the
              content of the photo itself. We are, after all, social animals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Again,
              none of this is an accident. As technology folks readily admit, they’ve
              designed products to exploit your brain chemistry as effectively and
              efficiently as possible. There’s no hidden agenda here: it’s right out in the
              open. Each time you scroll down, you see another ad. Each ad you see, the
              advertiser pays a few cents. Now multiply that by a billion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Of
              course, this isn’t really new either. After all, both I and Tricycle have
              successfully enticed you to read this piece. We did it the way journalists have
              for centuries, with a (hopefully) interesting topic and a (hopefully)
              attention-grabbing headline. And if we didn’t have donors, you probably
              wouldn’t be reading these words.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              some of this really is new. Never before has an industry as large as social
              media had as many tools to maximize its impact on the human mind. And those
              tools are only going to get better (or worse): live video, augmented reality,
              virtual reality, sharper targeting for content and ads, wearable devices, new
              platforms, and, of course, innovations we can’t yet imagine. In a decade, we’re
              going to look back at 2017 as quaint.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That
              combination of improved means for unimproved ends is why it’s worth looking at
              older, yet often timeless, attempts to grapple with the addictive
              potentialities of mind. The fifth precept, present in multiple Buddhist
              traditions, is one of those.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              precept, in its classical forms, is refraining from liquors and other
              intoxicants. In Pali, sura-meraya-majja-pamadatthana literally means
              “abstaining from fermented drink that causes heedlessness.” There are many
              opinions as to the scope of the precept. On the strict side, almost everyone
              agrees that not just fermented drink but other intoxicants are also to be
              avoided.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">On
              the lenient side, many have said that intoxicants are only to be avoided when
              they cause heedlessness. One glass of wine is unlikely to cause heedlessness; a
              whole bottle quite likely would. So the former would not violate the precept,
              while the latter would.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              if Internet use has been shown to function neurologically like other
              intoxicants, what’s the difference between it and beer and marijuana?
              Obviously, moderate use of all these substances doesn’t cause heedlessness.
              Equally obviously, excessive use does. The precept isn’t about vodka as opposed
              to gin; it’s about how intoxicants lead to un-mindfulness. And anyone who’s
              lost an hour (or two) on Facebook can tell you about that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Including
              Internet use within the fifth precept can lead to a number of benefits. First,
              of course, you might not spend as much time and energy falling into rabbit
              holes of distraction or pits of rage and despair. That’s the main benefit: less
              of the insanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              there are other benefits too. Taking on the fifth precept in this way can lead
              to helpful discernment practice. We all need to be informed about the
              terrifying political moment we are living in. And it’s good to be connected to
              our friends and family. But can you notice when you’ve tipped over from those
              “wholesome” activities to the “unwholesome” activity of Internet addiction?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I’ve
              noticed that with me it’s quite subtle. Often there’s just a small movement of
              heart that indicates that, oops, now I’m just wasting time. Or that I’m looking
              for something to amuse myself. It’s ironic, really: social media both plugs us
              into bad news and offers candy-like distractions from it. It creates the
              problem and then pretends to solve it—all because we’d rather have some
              interesting formations [any physical or mental concepts]</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">to amuse ourselves. I’ve found it really
              interesting to observe these subtle movements of mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Finally,
              including Internet use in the fifth precept can be a useful reminder that this
              is not your special problem. It’s not your weakness, alone among all us better
              Buddhists. In fact, there’s no “you” getting brain-addled, Internet-addicted,
              or bored in the first place. It’s causes and conditions, not self. Take a human
              brain and expose it to the right bells and lights and it will get entranced.
              That’s how this organism works.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
              that’s why the fifth precept is offered as a universal guide. Regardless of the
              particular forms, human brains can get intoxicated, careless, and worse. In the
              sixth century BCE, intoxicants were mostly fermented drinks. Today, they’re on
              your phone and laptop. Much has changed, but much has stayed the same.</span></p>
