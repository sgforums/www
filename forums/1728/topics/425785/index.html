              <p>True Buddhists will not bother about this kind of thing. It does not matter to us whether it is true or false. Unlike other religion which use miracles to attract followers, Buddhism does not emphasize and promote miracles though miracles happen to many Buddhists including me.</p>
              <p>Buddha taught us to practice according to his Dharma. That is the only way to liberate ourselves from the rebirth cycle. Other things including miracles are all secondary.</p>

              <p>Buddha is everywhere , why need to restrict inside 4 statues ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This society needs more members la. Maybe the lowly educated ones will be awed. Those who can read more information on buddha teachings,  Zen and sutra will not bother.</p>
              <p>The statues can talk or not has nothing to do with your buddha nature either.  Or your death journey to Amitabhva Pureland.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"><strong>The Buddhist Perspective on Magic and the Supernatural<br> </strong> <br> <strong>A. Magic Is Not the Ultimate</strong><br> <br> According to scriptures, even though two thousand years have passed, several of 
              the Buddha’s disciples still live amongst us. Mahakyasyapa, one of the Buddha’s 
              top disciples, is guarding the Buddha’s robe and in deep meditation inside 
              Kukkutapada mountain. He is waiting for the birth of Maitreya Buddha fifty-six 
              trillion and seven hundred million years from now. He will present the robe, 
              which represents the correct Dharma of the previous Buddha, to Maitreya Buddha 
              for the continuous spread of the teachings. Decades ago, there was a story about 
              a French explorer who actually met Mahakasyapa in India.<br> <br> Venerable Pindolabharadvaja is another of Buddha’s disciples still living 
              amongst us. He is one of the sixteen disciples named in The Amitabha Sutra. He 
              has attained the holy fruit of Arhat. Why would an arhat remain here and not 
              enter Nirvana? It is because once he showed off his magic in front of the 
              faithful. Once when in a jubilant mood, he said to the faithful, "Do you think 
              flying in the sky is magical? I will show you some spectacular acts."<br> <br> He then jumped up into the sky and performed many miraculous acts. The faithful 
              were all impressed and praised him without ceasing. The Buddha was very 
              displeased upon learning of this incident. He asked the Venerable to come forth 
              and admonished him, "My teaching uses morality to change others and compassion 
              to save living beings. It does not use magic to impress and confuse people. You 
              have misused magic today. As punishment, I order you to stay in this world, to 
              work for more merits and to repent for this misbehavior before entering 
              Nirvana."<br> <br> Because the Venerable misused magic, he still has to live and suffer amongst us. 
              Magic cannot increase our virtue or eradicate defilements. Careless use will 
              only build more obstacles to emancipation. It is obvious that magic is not the 
              solution for cycles of rebirth. Only practicing virtue is the sure and steady 
              approach toward the Buddha Path.<br> <br> <strong>B. Magic Cannot Mitigate the Force of Karma</strong><br> <br> The strongest force in this world is not magic. It is the force of deeds, or 
              karma. In Chinese history, there once was an uprising and millions of people 
              were slaughtered. There was a saying, "Rebel Huang will kill eight million. If 
              you are in that number and it is your turn, you can never escape." The legend 
              held that this rebel did kill eight million people before he was suppressed. 
              Regardless of whether this story is factual or mythical, we will talk about the 
              phrase "your number and your turn." What does it mean? It means that none can 
              escape karma. Those citizens during that uprising shared common karma which had 
              to be repaid with blood. Magic cannot overcome the hindrance of karma. We must 
              reap what we have sown. There is no escape.<br> <br> Once, King Virudhaka of Kosala was attacking the Buddha’s motherland, 
              Kapilavastu. Maudgalyayana, foremost in magic among the Buddha’s disciples, 
              volunteered to save the Sakya clan. The Buddha replied sadly, "Maudgalyayana, 
              this is the Sakya clan’s karma and they have not repented for it. Today they 
              will have to pay for their deeds. Although they are my family, even my magic 
              cannot spare them."<br> <br> Maudgalyayana did not believe the Buddha’s words. He flew into the city, which 
              was completely surrounded by troops. He picked five hundred Sakya clansmen and 
              magically put them in his almsbowl. He flew out of the city and happily came 
              before the Buddha. He said, "Lord Buddha. Look! I have saved a group of your 
              clansmen."<br> <br> However, looking into the bowl, he was shocked. The clansmen had turned into a 
              pool of blood. Even Maudgalyayana himself, who was renowned for his magic, could 
              not overcome the force of karma. He could fly freely into the heaven and had 
              ventured into hell to save his mother. Yet, he was eventually killed by a stone 
              thrown by heretics. How can a venerable with such great magic be so easily 
              killed by a stone? Many of the Buddha’s disciples were perturbed and angry. The 
              Buddha spoke to the disciples, "Magic cannot mitigate the force of karma. It is 
              Maudgalyayana’s karma to be killed by the stone thrown by heretics. You should 
              not doubt the limit of magic. It is more important to diligently purify your 
              action, speech, and thought."<br> <br> There is a saying, "A boxer is killed by a fist. A swimmer drowns in water." 
              Magic is not all powerful. One must not think that magic will make one fearless. 
              The force of prior karma cannot be influenced by magic. If we only rely on 
              magic, we can worsen our situation and may even lose our lives.<br> <br> <strong>C. Magic Is Inferior to Virtues</strong><br> <br> Beginning students in Buddhism are most attracted to magic. When they learn 
              about someone who has had a supernatural experience, they flock to see this 
              person. They usually overlook the cultivation of virtue in daily living. Wisdom 
              is only developed through deep mental concentration from meditation, and 
              meditation success relies on upholding precepts in daily living. If all of us 
              here are serious students of Buddhism, we must start from the foundation of 
              morality, not magic.<br> <br> Do you really think magic will make your life happier? As long as we cannot read 
              minds, even though people may hate us and curse us, we do not know it and 
              everything is okay. If we could read minds, then we would know that this person 
              is totally immoral, that one is hateful, and the other one is full of devious 
              ideas. We would feel uncomfortable among these people. Even when we wished to be 
              spared, we would still have the information anyway. Every day would be a long 
              day. Suppose that we were about to die tomorrow but we did not know that, then 
              today still would be a joyful day. If we had the power of knowing the future and 
              we found out that death awaited us in twenty years, from this day on we would 
              live our lives anxiously under the shadow of death. If we had celestial vision 
              and found our loved ones having an affair, we would be consumed by jealousy and 
              life would be miserable. If we do not know, we may live happily as ever. If we 
              had celestial hearing, we might find our most trusted friends reviling us behind 
              our backs, and we would certainly be enraged. Without celestial hearing, we may 
              enjoy more peace and quietness.<br> <br> Magic would not necessarily make life better. Morality and virtue are the true 
              inexhaustible treasures. Before we are accomplished in high virtue and morality, 
              we should not have magical powers. A life of virtue is superior to that of 
              magic.<br> <br> <strong>D. Magic Cannot Surpass Emptiness<br> </strong> <br> Magic is in the realm of phenomena. The prajna wisdom of Buddhism is in the 
              realm of emptiness which is everywhere, not bounded by anything. When there is 
              experience in life, experience is magic. When there is wisdom in life, wisdom is 
              magic. When we have different capabilities in life, those capabilities are 
              magic. There is the truth of emptiness in life; the truth of emptiness is also 
              magic. The wisdom of emptiness is very profound. It is not void or annihilation 
              as most people commonly believe. Emptiness allows existence. It is the source of 
              all phenomena. For example, because of the empty space in this lecture hall, it 
              can accommodate us and make this lecture series possible. When our hearts are as 
              broad as the universe, we too can have the capacity for everything. Emptiness is 
              the most powerful force. Magic cannot compare with its boundlessness and 
              inexhaustibility.<br> <br> Once, the Ch’an master Venerable Tao Shu settled next to a Taoist temple. The 
              Taoist priests were very irate at his presence and used every kind of magic and 
              tricks to scare him away. Almost all the residents were frightened away. 
              However, the Ch’an master remained unmoving as ever. After twenty years, the 
              Taoist priests gave up. People asked, "What magic did you use to beat those 
              Taoist priests?"<br> <br> The Ch’an master replied, "Oh, nothing. I used emptiness to beat them. Taoist 
              priests have magic and tricks. ‘Having’ is being finite, being exhaustible, 
              being bounded, being measurable. I do not have any magic. ‘Not having’ means 
              being infinite, being inexhaustible, being boundless, being immeasurable. 
              Therefore, emptiness (not having) can overcome magic (having) by being broader, 
              greater, higher, superior."<br> <br> Buddhism uses emptiness as existence. It is much more powerful than magic. The 
              wisdom of emptiness is much more advanced than magic. We will be much better off 
              attaining the truth of emptiness than the power of magic. The truth of emptiness 
              will be far more essential and valuable.</span></p>

He picked five hundred Sakya clansmen and magically put them in his almsbowl. He flew out of the city and happily came before the Buddha. He said, "Lord Buddha. Look! I have saved a group of your clansmen."<br><br>However, looking into the bowl, he was shocked. The clansmen had turned into a pool of blood. Even Maudgalyayana himself, who was renowned for his magic, could not overcome the force of karma. He could fly freely into the heaven and had ventured into hell to save his mother. Yet, he was eventually killed by a stone thrown by heretics. How can a venerable with such great magic be so easily killed by a stone? Many of the Buddha’s disciples were perturbed and angry. The Buddha spoke to the disciples, "Magic cannot mitigate the force of karma. It is Maudgalyayana’s karma to be killed by the stone thrown by heretics. You should not doubt the limit of magic. It is more important to diligently purify your action, speech, and thought."<br><br>There is a saying, "A boxer is killed by a fist. A swimmer drowns in water." Magic is not all powerful. One must not think that magic will make one fearless. The force of prior karma cannot be influenced by magic. If we only rely on magic, we can worsen our situation and may even lose our lives.<br><br><strong>C. Magic Is Inferior to Virtues</strong><br><br>Beginning students in Buddhism are most attracted to magic. When they learn about someone who has had a supernatural experience, they flock to see this person. They usually overlook the cultivation of virtue in daily living. Wisdom is only developed through deep mental concentration from meditation, and meditation success relies on upholding precepts in daily living. If all of us here are serious students of Buddhism, we must start from the foundation of morality, not magic.<br><br>Do you really think magic will make your life happier? As long as we cannot read minds, even though people may hate us and curse us, we do not know it and everything is okay. If we could read minds, then we would know that this person is totally immoral, that one is hateful, and the other one is full of devious ideas. We would feel uncomfortable among these people. Even when we wished to be spared, we would still have the information anyway. Every day would be a long day. Suppose that we were about to die tomorrow but we did not know that, then today still would be a joyful day. If we had the power of knowing the future and we found out that death awaited us in twenty years, from this day on we would live our lives anxiously under the shadow of death. If we had celestial vision and found our loved ones having an affair, we would be consumed by jealousy and life would be miserable. If we do not know, we may live happily as ever. If we had celestial hearing, we might find our most trusted friends reviling us behind our backs, and we would certainly be enraged. Without celestial hearing, we may enjoy more peace and quietness.<br><br>Magic would not necessarily make life better. Morality and virtue are the true inexhaustible treasures. Before we are accomplished in high virtue and morality, we should not have magical powers. A life of virtue is superior to that of magic.<br><br><strong>D. Magic Cannot Surpass Emptiness<br></strong><br>Magic is in the realm of phenomena. The prajna wisdom of Buddhism is in the realm of emptiness which is everywhere, not bounded by anything. When there is experience in life, experience is magic. When there is wisdom in life, wisdom is magic. When we have different capabilities in life, those capabilities are magic. There is the truth of emptiness in life; the truth of emptiness is also magic. The wisdom of emptiness is very profound. It is not void or annihilation as most people commonly believe. Emptiness allows existence. It is the source of all phenomena. For example, because of the empty space in this lecture hall, it can accommodate us and make this lecture series possible. When our hearts are as broad as the universe, we too can have the capacity for everything. Emptiness is the most powerful force. Magic cannot compare with its boundlessness and inexhaustibility.<br><br>Once, the Ch’an master Venerable Tao Shu settled next to a Taoist temple. The Taoist priests were very irate at his presence and used every kind of magic and tricks to scare him away. Almost all the residents were frightened away. However, the Ch’an master remained unmoving as ever. After twenty years, the Taoist priests gave up. People asked, "What magic did you use to beat those Taoist priests?"<br><br>The Ch’an master replied, "Oh, nothing. I used emptiness to beat them. Taoist priests have magic and tricks. ‘Having’ is being finite, being exhaustible, being bounded, being measurable. I do not have any magic. ‘Not having’ means being infinite, being inexhaustible, being boundless, being immeasurable. Therefore, emptiness (not having) can overcome magic (having) by being broader, greater, higher, superior."<br><br>Buddhism uses emptiness as existence. It is much more powerful than magic. The wisdom of emptiness is much more advanced than magic. We will be much better off attaining the truth of emptiness than the power of magic. The truth of emptiness will be far more essential and valuable.</span></p>

              <p>We could realize Buddha nature from contemplating the deposition of thousands hands &amp; eyes of Guan Shi Yin. The main one is pure emptiness - According to Flower Adornment sutra - one in all and all is one - Heart Sutra - form is formless, formless is form, form and formless is same :D</p>
