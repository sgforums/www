Humans should cherish the conditions of being a human being, not be too fond of relationships with spirits. There are virtuous and evil spirits. Nevertheless they all belong to the spirit realm. Some people call them spirit guide, but the simple reason why they appear to you is because you have affinity with them, and they may even help you out with or grant you worldly things (and even some spiritual powers!).<br><br>But you are now a human, if you always want to be with these beings and even think that they are even better than other fellow human beings, chances are you have already deeply planted the seeds of the ghost realm in your mind. I wonder if i have mentioned before, but i know of people who practised spiritual mediumship, and at death all the spirits want to bring them away. In buddhism, we should avoid dealing with these spirits in this manner.<br><br>I have another friend who also post at times here, he used to practise mediumship but now has stopped. He still continues to be able to see spirits. I brought him and someone else new to my dharma centre, but when my dharma teacher was told that someone was able to see spirits, she immediately pointed at the right person and said "is it him? His eyes look very yin". For his case he was asked to take refuge in the triple gem (buddha, dharma, sangha) as soon as possible and to chant buddha/bodhisattva name regularly to increase his "brightness". My dharma teacher also advised him that since he has a lot of affinity with the spirit realm, he should cultivate the dharma well and after enlightenment, he should teach the spirits dharma. Because some spirits are receptive to dharma (they even attend dharma talks).<br><br>But if we never practice dharma, and instead act superstitiously, we will surely end up in the spirit realm. As my teacher said, all human beings seek bliss and brightness. Those spirits themselves have not transcended the three poisons, greed, anger, ignorance. Much less transcended samsara (although i know of spirits who claim otherwise to trick people into believing them, they are far out). They themselves are not free of sufferings, they also belong to one of the 3 lower realms unlike human beings who belong to a higher realm, and therefore they are unable to give humans true happiness. Therefore we should associate with the noble and virtuous people in the human realm, those who have practised the dharma, gained insights and cleared their fetters. And not to go into seeking supernatural powers, they are very unimportant and secondary, they should only be a side effect of precepts, samadhi and insight practise.</div>
