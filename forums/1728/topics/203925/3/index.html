            <div class='col-md body'>Nevertheless you'll see something in common in these contemplative paths. They are all in pursuit of Truth and have no room for violence and conflict. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I remember Ajahn Brahmavamso said, why when we look into all these contemplative traditions like Christian Mystics, the Taoists, they are so peaceful unlike those fully academic persons?<br><br>Because people dwell dogmatically on theory and academic understanding, they cling to what they <strong>believe</strong> to be truth in exclusion to all others, instead of undergoing an intense inward journey of self-realisation and finding out for themselves, - and this is why hatred arises. On the other hand the path of contemplation is to "look within".<br><br><blockquote><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"</blockquote>But this goes to all contemplative traditions in our world, though are uncommon/rare  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It is there, but in Buddhism we say "body-mind drop off".<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If you relax into present experience in that fashion, the separate-self sense will uncoil; you will stop standing back from life; you will not have experience, you will suddenly become all experience; you will not be Â“in hereÂ” looking Â“out thereÂ” Â– in here and out there are one, so you are no longer trapped Â“in here.Â”<br><br>And so suddenly, you are not in the bodymind. Suddenly, the bodymind has dropped. Suddenly, the wind doesnÂ’t blow on you, it blows through you, within you. You are not looking at the mountain, you are the mountain Â– the mountain is closer to you than your own skin. You are that, and there is no you Â– just this entire luminous display spontaneously arising moment to moment. The separate self is nowhere to be found.<br><br>The entire sensation of Â“weightÂ” drops altogether, because you are not in the Kosmos, the Kosmos is in you, and you are purest Emptiness. The entire universe is a transparent shimmering of the Divine, of primordial Purity. But the Divine is not someplace else, it is just all of this shimmering. It is self-seen. It has One Taste. It is nowhere else.</span><br><br><blockquote>You are not looking at the mountain, you are the mountain Â– the mountain is closer to you than your own skin.</blockquote>I have glimpses of this, although it is only a state where the 'bond' is temporarily suspended.</div>

Any 'movement' is a sense of self, a sense of location. It is grasping on a form and thinking that it has a "continual, connected existence". Therefore the zen parable says "the mind moved".<br><br>Here's another one which my teacher used to mention:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Pines &amp; Water Fowl</strong><br><br>One day the Master and his disciples strolled along the lake. Calm emerald water, stately immobile century old pines, and iridescent playful water fowl created a serene Zen-like picture of nature.<br><br>"Look what's in front of us!" exclaimed the Master.<br>"There are pretty ducks chasing each other." answered the disciples.<br>"Well, why didn't you notice the motionless pine trees?" rebutted the Master.<br><br>The moral of the story is the minds of sentient beings tends to notice and cling to what stirres and changes around them. The emerging thoughts derived from the attachments will dull their awareness. A life attuned to sensual stimulation prevents a person from experiencing the stationary tranquil Truth around us.</blockquote>Anyway it cannot be intellectually understood. It has to be experienced.<br><br>When it says "the mountains is closer than your skin", I mean it <strong>literally</strong>. There is no sense of distance and seperation at all, you are the mountain, not someone looking at the mountain. Everything becomes clear and vivid. There is also a blissful energy like meditative rupture in jhana arising in me when this happened.<br><br>Such experiences can happen through the practise of mindfulness, but it is not enlightenment because one doesn't realise the nature of this pure awareness and no-self. It remains a stage that can be entered and left, not as a dharma seal.</div>

All authentic Buddhist traditions bear this 3 dharma seals. But other religions do not bear this 3 dharma seals.<br><br>Christians generally do not practise meditation, Christian kind of meditation, even though same in word, is quite different in nature. Mainstream Christian meditation literally means contemplating the words of Jesus, means thinking over the words of Jesus so that it can sink into their mind.<br><br>Hindu meditation is also quite different from Buddhist meditation. Hindu meditation is Shamatha meditation, and they do not practise Vipassana medtation. There is no practise of mindfulness in Hinduism, their practises is on focusing, concentration. This practise of focusing, concentration, can lead them to deeper level of absorptions, or mundane samadhi, and is also known to lead to the development of supernatural powers, however it is not insight-practise and does not lead to liberation.<br><br>This is just a general overview.
