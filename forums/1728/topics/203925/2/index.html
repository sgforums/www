But rather as I said, the sense of location and self is formed by the 7th consciousness. In terms of Buddhism your mind is the 6th consciousness, 7th consciousness is refering to 'self-consciousness'. Meaning any dualism, attachment to self, is refering to this 7th consciousness, and it is the basis of illusion. 7th Consciousness works ON the first 6 senses input (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind), it works on it by discriminating and seperating them into subject-object dualism, thus causing a sense of self. This basis of ignorance, the 7th consciousness, is something subtler than our gross mind and body. Mental objects, sense perceptions come and go, they are originally pure One Awareness but is wrongly perceived by the 7th consciousness to have their own seperate and inherent existence, and a self that is perceiving them. Although the 7th consciousness works on the first 6 consciousness, it does not depend on the first six senses for survival. It works on mental objects (thoughts etc) by grasping, seeking, discriminating, seperating them but not necessarily dependent on it for survival. When you fall asleep, your first 6 senses go to sleep, and during certain phases of R.E.M in your sleep, your 7th consciousness works on your 8th consciousness by searching and and retrieving all the information that is within your 8th consciousness and replaying them, which induces dreams. Dreams may not have deep meaning on our conceptual level, it is a symbolic realm.<br><br>I think this could be quite deep for a beginner to understand without first knowing about the Buddhist teaching on Anatta, which means No-self. This is a very important teaching and is one of the 3 dharma seals which all authentic Buddhist teachings must bear. It means that 'Self' is an illusion. If we analyse, nothing we can point to is our 'Self'. Our body is not ourself because if we cut a part of our body, we still claim that "I survived". It is not our thoughts, because our thoughts are impermanent and no particular content or thought of our mind that we think, is our 'self'. And so on.... We cannot find our 'self' in anything particular. Therefore it is illusional. I believe neutral_onliner can elaborate on this.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises.

Only when we dissolve the 7th consciousness can we see the True Nature which is impersonal.<br><br>Schizophrenic people are suffering from split personalities, and seeing things as they are is going even beyond our own personality to see things as it is. Doesn't mean you no longer have any interest, on the level of relativity you still have a personality but you are no longer attached to your personality, you do not see yourself as merely your personality anymore. You are no longer caught up with ideas and notions, you still can function in the conceptual level but there is no bondage.<br><br>And does trying to stop heart from pumping has anything got to do with this subject?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway consciousness is not limited to brain and only temporarily function within a body. Our 5 senses are related to the brain, our mind and thoughts does reflect in the brain (and in fact it does reflect in every part of our body not only in our brain), the brain is a organ like the rest but is not consciousness itself. Any honest scientist will admit that they know very little about the nature of consciousness. Some are also working with Buddhist meditators and scholars into researching consciousness. Also see, <a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~ursa/philos/cns.htm" rel="nofollow">CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES</a><br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467" rel="nofollow">Buddhism and Science article</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by concerned_man:</div><div class="quote_body">The Boy with No Brain<br><br>This is a well known case that throws a challenge to modern science. It's the case of Professor John Lorber and the student with no brain.[1] Professor Lorber was a neurologist at Sheffield University who held a research chair in paediatrics. He did a lot of research on hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. The student's physician at the university noticed that the youth had a slightly larger than normal head, and so referred him to Professor Lorber, simply out of interest. When they did a brain scan on the student they saw that his cranium was filled mainly with cerebrospinal fluid. The student had an IQ of 126, had gained a first-class honours degree in mathematics, and was socially completely normal. And yet the boy had virtually no brain. This is not just a fabrication; research has found other people with no brains. During the first world war, when there was such carnage in the trenches of Europe. Soldiers had their skulls literally blown apart by bullets and shrapnel. It is said that the doctors found that some of the shattered heads of those corpses were empty. There was no brain. The evidence of those doctors was put aside as being too difficult to understand. But Professor Lorber went forward with his findings, and published them, to the great disturbance of the scientific community. Billions of dollars are going into research on the brain. Current views hold that imbalances in the brain are causing your depressions, your lack of intelligence, or your emotional problems. And yet here is evidence that shows you don't need much of a brain to have an excellent mind.<br><br>A doctor friend in Sydney discussed this case with me once. He said he'd seen those CT scans, and confirmed that the case was well known in the medical community. He explained that that boy only had what was called a reptilian brain stem. Usually, any baby born with just a reptilian brain stem, without the cortex and the other stuff, will usually die straight away or within a few days after birth. A reptilian brain stem is not capable of maintaining basic bodily functions such as breathing, heart or liver. It's not enough to keep the higher brain functions going. It's not enough for speech, not enough for intelligence, certainly not enough for being an honours student in mathematics. This doctor said, "Ajahn Brahm, you wouldn't believe the problem that this is causing in my field of science. It shatters so much past research. It is challenging so many drug companies that are making billions of dollars in profits". Because dogmatic scientists can't understand how a person with virtually no brain can be intelligent, they are just burying the findings at the back of the filing cabinet, classifying it as an anomaly. But truth just won't go away.<br><br>The Mind and the Brain<br><br>As soon as you start to include the mind, this 'ghost in the machine', in the equations, scientists tend to become discomfited. They take refuge in dogma, and say, "No, that cannot exist". I really took the Sate Astronomer to task over such dogmatism in science.<br><br>As far as Buddhism is concerned there are six senses. Not just the five senses of science, namely sight, sound, smell, taste and touch but in addition the mind. From the very beginning in Buddhism, mind has been the sixth sense. Twenty-five centuries ago, the sixth sense was well recognised. So this is not changing things to keep up with modern times; this was so from the very beginning. The sixth sense, the mind, is independent of the other five senses. In particular the mind is independent of the brain. If you volunteer to have a brain transplant with me you take my brain and I take your brain I will still be Ajahn Brahm and you will still be you. Want to try it? If it was possible and it happened, you would still be yourself. The mind and the brain are two different things. The mind can make use of the brain but it doesn't have to.<br><br>Some of you may have had out of the body experiences. These out of the body experiences have recently been the subject of mainstream scientific research. Out of the body experiences are now a scientific fact! I like to stir people up by saying things like that. Recently I saw that Dr. Sam Parnia, a researcher from the University of Southampton Medical School, has given a paper, stating that consciousness survives death.[2] He said that he did not know how it happens, or why it happens, but, he says, it does happen. His evidence was gathered from people who have had out of the body experiences in his hospital. Dr Parnia, investigated and interviewed many, many patients. The information which they gave him, as a cool headed scientist, said yes, those people were conscious during the time they were dead. What was especially very convincing was that often they could actually describe to the doctor the medical procedures that were done during the time when they were clinically dead. They could describe it as if they were looking at their body from a position above the table. But how that happens Dr. Parnia can't explain. Why it happens he can't explain. But other medical findings also support the above. Finally, their findings replicated the work done earlier by Dr. Raymond A. Moody in the United States.[3]<br><br>The evidence proved to those hard nosed doctors that out of body experiences do happen. But how could they happen? If we agree that the mind can be independent of the body, then we have a plausible explanation. The brain doesn't need to be functioning for a mind to exist. The scientific facts are there, the evidence is there, but a lot of scientists don't like to admit those facts. They prefer to close their eyes because of dogmatism.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=206409" rel="nofollow">Understanding Our MIND</a> by neutral_onliner.<br><br>Another article: <a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha264.htm" rel="nofollow">Buddhism, The only real science</a><br><br><blockquote>Some evangelical scientists would do well to reflect on the (amended) old saying "Scientists rush in where angels fear to tread" and stop pontificating about the nature of the mind, happiness and even Nirvana. Neurologists are especially prone to such neuroses (Neurosis: an undue adherence to unrealistic ideas of things). They are claiming that the mind, awareness and will, is now adequately explained by activity in the brain. This theory was disproved over 20 years ago by Prof. Lorber's discovery of the student at Sheffield University with and IQ of 126, a First Class degree in mathematics, but with virtually no brain (Science, Vol. 210, 12 Dec 1980)! More recently, it was disproved by Prof. Pim Van Lommel, who demonstrated the existence of consciousness activity after clinical death, i.e. when all brain activity has ceased (Lancet, Vol. 358, 15 December 2001, p 2039).<br><br>Although there may be correlation between a measurable activity in part of the brain and a mental impression, such co-occurrence doesn't always imply that one is the cause of the other. For instance, some years ago, research showed a clear correlation between cigarette smoking and the non-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. It was not that smoking cigarettes somehow caused immunity from Alzheimer's, as much as the tobacco companies might have wished, it was only that many smokers did not live long enough to get Alzheimer's disease! Thus a co-incidence of two phenomena, even when repeated, does not mean that one phenomenon is the cause of the other. To claim that activity in the brain causes awareness, or mind, is plainly unscientific.</blockquote>----<br><br><blockquote>Anyway, how can anyone measure the measurer, the mind? At a recent seminar on Science and Religion, at which I was a speaker, a Catholic in the audience bravely announced that whenever she looks through a telescope at the stars, she feels uncomfortable because her religion is threatened. I commented that whenever a scientist looks the other way round through a telescope, to observe the one who is watching, then they feel uncomfortable because their science is threatened by what is doing the seeing! So what is doing the seeing, what is this mind that eludes modern science?<br><br>A Grade-One teacher once asked her class "What is the biggest thing in the world?" One little girl answered "My daddy". A little boy said "An elephant", since he'd recently been to the zoo. Another girl suggested "A mountain". The six-year-old daughter of a close friend of mine replied, "My eye is the biggest thing in the world"! The class stopped. Even the teacher didn't understand her answer. So the little philosopher explained "Well, my eye can see her daddy, an elephant, and a mountain too. It can also see so much else. If all of that can fit into my eye, then my eye must be the biggest thing in the world"! Brilliant.<br><br>However, she was not quite right. The mind can see everything that one's eye can see, and it can also imagine so much more. It can also hear, smell, taste and touch, as well as think. In fact, everything that can be known can fit into the mind. Therefore, the mind must be the biggest thing in the world. Science's mistake is obvious now. The mind is not in the brain, nor in the body. The brain, the body and the rest of the world, are in the mind!<br><br>Mind is the sixth sense in Buddhism, it is that which encompasses the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch, and transcends them with its own domain. It corresponds loosely to Aristotle's "common sense" that is distinct from the five senses. Indeed, ancient Greek philosophy, from where science is said to have its origins, taught six senses just like Buddhism. Somewhere along the historical journey of European thinking, they lost their mind! Or, as Aristotle would put it, they somehow discarded their "common sense"! And thus we got science. We got materialism without any heart. One can accurately say that Buddhism is science that has kept its heart, and which hasn't lost its mind!</blockquote></div>

One is an agent housing emotions, feelings, thinking...and so on and so forth...the other is the experience of empty phenomenon rolling on as described by Buddhaghosa.  There is never a doer doing anything from start, a point of centricity and locality is not the way to understand this knowingness.  We are molded and led to this idea of 'self' by our entire cultural, language and the manifold of phenomonal world.  When we experience phenomenal world in raw, we find delight in no-self and dependent origination.<br><br>Next, going beyond symbols and labels, one experiences manifestation directly as the luminous presence of knowingness.  Phenomenal arising is the result of emptiness nature manifesting from moment to moment.  There is no one experiencing and therefore sinking back to a source is a subtle attachment and the result of our symbolic habitual energy.  But this experience of presence can become an object of attachment that we must let go.  The letting go must be very thorough in terms of mental detachment.  We don't have to worry about Presence.  What we have to worry is our attachment.<br><br>GTG...Makan time... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
