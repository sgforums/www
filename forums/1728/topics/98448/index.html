Is she a goddess?<br><br>Guan Yin is the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva of Buddhism, he/she (depends on manifest) is the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion. This Mahabodhisattva (da pu sa) is known back in India 2500 years ago, and when Buddhism spreads to China, this "bodhisattva" mixes into chinese traditions and people mistook Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva as a goddess or a person of worship.<br><br>It is most unfortunate that people have become superstitious over Guan Yin or Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. No, the real Guan Yin doesn't provide divination and toto numbers to you. The real manifests Guan Yin teaches dharma* to the masses, to liberate people, either through words or actions.<br><br>Most importantly, the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is a role model for Mahayana students to look upon. We should all learn to be as compassionate as the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>* Dharma: "Fa3". It means "Truth".

How does he convey Dharma to sentient beings? What are matters that demonstrate his power of skillful means?" Buddha told Bodhisattva Inexhaustible Intent, "Good man, if there were lands and sentient beings that should be saved through the body of a Buddha, then Bodhisattva Guan Shi Yin would appear as the body of a Buddha to preach Dharma to them. To those that should be saved through the body of a Pratyeka-Buddha he would appear as the body of a Pratyeka-Buddha to preach Dharma.

Guan Yin is known as the "bodhisattva of compassion", and if sentient beings are more used to the idea of Female as more compassionate, Guan Yin will appear in a female form to save sentient beings.<br><br>Oh ya btw.. sorry for moving all these threads here, i'll stop moving them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guan Yin is very compassionate to me... by chanting the name of Guan Shir Yin itself, I was able to achieve a very peaceful state of mind, even amidst strong anger and conflict. It happened to me, this inner peace is undescribeable, when amidst tension, anger, conflict, you are blessed if you can chant Namo Guanshiryin Pusa. Yes - it has averted me in one of my most angry times I have ever experienced. This have saved my mind from being stained even more by the 3 poisons (greed, hatred, ignorance), and from committing any more foolish acts.<br><br><blockquote>If anyone wants to hurt you and pushes you into a great fire-pit, if you contemplate the power of Avalokitesvara, the fire-pit will change into a pond. - Lotus Sutra</blockquote>So, this is what the translation says. But my master explained that, the "great-fire-pit" refers to the fires of hatred and anger, while the pond, clear and pure, refers to our Buddhamind. This relates to a true story, or experience, back in Taiwan.<br><br>My master had once observed that one of his disciples will meet a tribulation in the coming days... He called him up, and advised him not to be moved away from the triple jems (buddha, dharma, sangha), CHANT Guan-Shir-Yin frequently, and never to be affected by any anger. Just next day, this disciple was working at the construction site (he is a construction worker). Then, he got into an argument with someone on who should use the machine first. Tension rosed, and finally they decided to "settle it" outside. Suddenly, this person remembered my master's words, and began to truly regrett his earlier harshness. He chanted Namo Guanshiryin Pusa, and became very peaceful and calm, and smiled happily. The other person then went there to "settle" the issue, but seeing that he was smiling, he walked away. He threw a vegetable knife he was hiding onto the table. On seeing this, the person (who chanted guanshiryin) was extremely shocked, and realised what could have happened if he had continued the conflict. He was without any weapons, how could he be able to survive, fighting him with a fist?<br><br>From this, we should chant, pay reverence, learn, and most importantly, Be Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. We should learn to be compassionate in all situations, a Bodhisattva's compassion is selfless.<br><br>This is the testimonial to the "power of Avalokitesvara", of course, testimonials are really a lot, many people meeting disasters, car accidents, those that one definitely could not have survived, are saved miraculously by the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Those who suffers from bad temper and strong hatred can try chanting regularly.. perhaps, 108 times a day. Most importantly, when we chant, we must not let our mind wander, and practice Samadhi (concentration, one-pointedness) on the chanting. In this way, chanting works best to remove our minds of sentient, samsaric thoughts.<br><br>We should all learn to be compassionate like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Â“The ultimate goal of teaching is that Emptiness whose essence is Compassion.Â” - Great Pandita Atisha<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Buddhism, especially Mahayana Buddhism, we all learn to be Bodhisattvas. We look to the Mahabodhisattvas as role models... like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, Manjusri, Ksitigarbha, and many other Mahabodhisattvas.<br><br>Do they exist? Of course they do. It has been mentioned, all the Mahabodhisattvas have been mentioned in the Sutras. It was not made up, but recorded by witnesses. Although some of them were not real monks during those times, they manifested and were witnessed by the monks then.<br><br>However, there are many things in each Mahabodhisattva that are symbolic.<br><br>If you realise, all the Mahabodhisattvas represents one quality of Buddhism. For Avalokitesvara, it is compassion. For Manjusri, it is wisdom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What you said is neither right nor wrong...<br><br>Is cow holy? Why is cow different from the rest of the animals? Did the Buddhist sutras mention anything about cow?<br><br>The Buddhist Sutras have many stages... in the earlier teachings, they taught the Hinayana. During this period of discourse, Buddha did not set any laws to forbid the eating of meet, except that we have to eat meat in the 3 clean states*. It was at a later time, when he taught full vegetarianism. However, most buddhists are still eating meat, so they follow the 3 clean meats precepts.<br><br>It's only the chinese traditions that say cows cannot be eaten. But, praying to guan yin, we must learn guan yin's Great Compassion... be compassionate not only to human beings, but to all sentient beings of the 6 realms. Therefore, if we can, it is best to abstain from eating all meats... this is the prequisite to practicing the Great Compassion of the Mahayana. How can you expect to learn to have Bodhisattva's compassion when you cannot even stop eating the dead bodies of other living beings?<br><br><blockquote>* 3 clean meats:<br>Addressing the monks, Buddha said: "Do not eat meat knowing that it has been killed specially for (your) use; I allow the use of fish and meat blameless [NOTE1] in three ways, unseen, unheard and unsuspected" (na bhikkave jÃ¢na.m udissakata ma.msa.m paribhunjitabba.m. AnujÃ¢nÃ¢mi bhikkave tiko.tiparisuddha.m maccama.msa.m adi.t.ta.m asuta.m aparisankitan ti [V I 233]). We shall refer to this rule as the Buddha's three-fold rule on meat eating [NOTE 2]. The three conditions postulated amount to not witnessing the actual killing, not being told that the meat had been specially killed (for the use of the consumer), and even in the absence of such information not suspecting that such was the case (i.e. the eye, ear and mind should be satisfied as to the "blamelessness" of the meat).</blockquote></div>

The name Avalokitesvara has its root meaning as "he who observes the sounds of the world". The great vow of Avalokitesvara is to listen to the supplications, and cries for help from those in difficulty in the world and to provide them with aid. He takes many different forms....male, female, four-armed, thousand-armed, human, non-human, teacher, student...whatever expedient means are needed to help people most effectively.<br><br>Kuan Yin Bodhisattva, an emanation of Amida Buddha's compassion, is the "Regarder of the Cries of the World". Sometimes referred to in the West as the Goddess of Mercy. (Note: Avalokitesvara means "Kuan Yin" in Sanskrit, the language of early India, from an earlier time when The Cry Regarder was depicted as a male figure. "Kuan Yin" is Chinese; "Kannon" is Japanese.)<br><br>The following brief excerpt was adapted (notably changing "he" to "she") from the chapter on the Bodhisattva Regarder of the Cries of the World, in the W. E. Soothill translation of The Lotus Sutra (The Lotus of the Wonderful Law, published by Curzon Press):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Listen to the deeds of the Cry-Regarder,<br>Who well responds to every quarter;<br>Vast is her vow as deep the sea,<br>Age-long, and inconceivable.<br>Who hears her name and looks to her,<br>Unremittingly remembering her,<br>Will end the sorrows of existence.<br><br>*        *        *<br><br>Sorrows of birth, age, disease, death,<br>All will thus be ended.<br>True regard, serene regard,<br>Far-reaching, wise regard,<br>Regard of pity, regard compassionate,<br>Ever longed for, ever looked for,<br>In radiance ever pure and serene!<br>Wisdom's sun, destroying darkness,<br>Subduer of woes, of storm, of fire,<br>Illuminator of the world!<br>Law of pity, thunder quivering,<br>Compassion wondrous as a great cloud,<br>Pouring spiritual rain like nectar,<br>Quenching all the flames of distress!<br><br>*        *        *<br><br>Voice of the Regarder, wondrous voice,<br>Voice of the rolling tide, Brahma-voice,<br>Voice all world-surpassing,<br>Ever to be cherished in mind<br>With never a doubting thought.<br>World's Cry-Regarder, pure and holy,<br>In pain, distress, in death or woe,<br>Potent as a sure reliance,<br>Perfect in every virtuous merit,<br>All-beholding with eyes of pity,<br>Boundless ocean-store of blessings!<br>Prostrate, let us make obeisance."</span><br><br><strong>Praise To Qwan Yin Bodhisattva</strong><br><br>Gwan Yin Bodhisattva's compassion for all beings is so vast and inconceivable, our gratitude cannot comprehend nor fully express the magnitude of her blessings. Her body and garments of brilliant, translucent White Light. Her adornments, a white vase of Compassionate Water in her left hand, The Sacred Willow Branch in her right hand.<br><br>Enlightened through infinite acts of compassion countless lifetimes ago. Her feet rest upon a fragrant red lotus flower above a vast ocean. Her brows curved and radiant like the crescent of an autumn moon. With the sweet dew drops she sprinkles from her vase, She relieves the suffering of beings everywhere and always, for countless autumns.<br><br>Prayers for help arise from thousands of hearts, and thousands of prayers are answered by her vow of eternal compassion: Beings in Samsara, who sail the ocean of suffering, She will guide and deliver safely to the ultimate shore of enlightenment.</div>
