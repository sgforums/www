Prime among these: </blockquote>Hi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>Man is an immortal, spiritual being. His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized Â— and those capabilities can be realized. He is able to not only solve his own problems, accomplish his goals and gain lasting happiness, but also achieve new, higher states of awareness and ability.</blockquote>Buddhist teachings differs here: We believe that there is no permanent Self and Being, but rather everything is Impermanent. We also believe that the Highest Bliss, which is not impermanent, is Nirvana. All other worldly states of hapiness is only temporary, even in Meditative Jhanic states.<br><br>We also believe that everyone have innate Buddha Nature, therefore everyone has the potential of a Buddha. However, the Buddha Nature is not realised/revealed yet. It takes practise, realisation, and Enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>In Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith. That which is true for you is what you have observed to be true. An individual discovers for himself that Scientology works by personally applying its principles and observing or experiencing results.<br><br>Through Scientology, people all over the world are achieving the long-sought goal of true spiritual release and freedom. </blockquote>Good, similarly, in Kalama Sutra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha</span><br><br></div>
