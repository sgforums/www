U already realised the thoughts of lust arising, which is alright if u can see how it comes about and then press the thoughts down.<br><br>The imprints r still fresh in ur mind cos actually u r the one who wants to recall them as maybe they excite u. How not to get excited( so the thought won't even arise in the first place) is the difficult part for most people. So that's why u may try the other 2 steps I suggested?

Do you watch sexually suggestive women on the net..? Do you have posters of pretty ladies all over your room? And many other possible factors....<br><br>One suggestion he gave was to tear down all the pictures of the skimpily dressed ladies in your room, and replace them with all the pictures of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas... my teacher said, confirm you won't get excited! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos they're all so holy and 'zhuang1 yan2' everywhere you look.. hehe..<br><br>Here's also some suggestions from my Master's book:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">The Buddha taught some solutions:<br><br>(Book Source: Fa Yu Bing Fen 2nd Series by Ven.

Here is a summary.<br><br>The Chinese text was talking about the king who is concerned with the progress of youngsters and the distraction of sexual lust on the youth's academic and work perfomance. He requested the give instructions on how to be free from sexual lust.<br><br>The Buddha gave 3 suggestions:<br><br>1) The female that is more elder in age should be looked upon as one's Mother or aunt. For the female that is younger in age one should look upon her as one's own sister and for one that is very young in age, one should look upon her as one's.. uh, (sorry I don't know what's that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> someone can tell me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). In this way, one's mind will be in stillness, and ones three poisons, Greed, Hatred and Ignorance will be transformed and dissolved by one's Wisdom naturally.<br><br>2) One should review this very frame of body upwards from the soles of the<br>feet, &amp; downwards from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as<br>full of many kinds of impurities: There are in this body head-hairs,<br>body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow,<br>kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery,<br>vomit in the stomach, excrement, bile, lymph, pus, blood, sweat, fat,<br>tears, mucus, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine and the various impurities, this way one can be freed from sexual lust and the mind will naturally be still.<br><br>3) One should guard one's six sense doors: Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind.. if one's eyes sees sights, one should not grasp on the appearances, do not give rise to discriminative mind and naturally our attachment will be dissolved. After one guards his eye-sense faculty one should then guard the other senses (ears, nose, tongue, body and mind), do not give rise to discriminative mind and naturally craving will not arise.</div></blockquote></div>

It is actually quite effortless as long as you maintain an awareness that constantly lets go -- all phenomena simply self-liberates (which means the thought and experience liberates by itself because it is impermanent!), nothing stays... nothing leaves a trace. As my taiwanese teacher said... don't resist or reject thoughts, the more you try to find ways to suppress your thoughts or reject them the worse it becomes.. instead don't even treat your thoughts as if they are events happening (it is as if nothing has happened). Not even thoughts of sexual lust.. Perhaps that is why AndrewPKYap said "The more you try to get rid of lust, the more you affirm its existence when the reality is that lust does not exist."<br><br>So there is no need to condemn your thoughts or resist them, if you know how to practise this. It is much more direct. However if you have difficulty practising this, you may try the methods I have posted above in the previous post.<br><br>Please read <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/kee/inward.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/kee/inward.html</a> -- the part on <strong>Aware Right at Awareness, November 3, 1975</strong> by Upasika Kee Nanayon.<br><br>And as for the PM you sent me, please read this article written by my local dharma teacher, hope it helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Constantly mindful, constantly letting go of the 3 minds and the 4 forms...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">([1] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped.

This is also being experienced by Longchen who recently wrote about it along with other karmic imprints like fear and anger.<br><br>Also, according to Buddhism those who reach Anagami and above will be able to overcome it.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes it is not easy but it isn't really about our own chemicals in the body that is dififcult.
