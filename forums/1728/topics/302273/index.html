            <div class='col-md body'>I can't help wondering if there is a real life Buddhist wedding ceremony in the first place, in Singapore to start with.<br><br>We know quite a lot about Christian church weddings and ballroom dinners through television, friends and family. It has already become common sense to most of us, even if you are a free-thinker or a Buddhist.<br><br>But has anyone ever witnessed a Buddhist wedding held in a temple or Buddhist organisation? Has anybody attended a Buddhist wedding ballroom dinner before, where at least the VIP tables are served only with vegetarian food?<br><br>What is a Buddist wedding like? Is it officated by a member of the monastic order?<br><br>It would help for members of the public to know more about the real-life aspects of Buddhism for its layman followers. After all, not all intend to become celibate or enter the monastic order.<br><br>If such ceremonies are filmed and produced into DVD or Vcds, I'm sure it would help members of the public to have a better understanding of Buddhism in terms of how it views marriages rather than the very neutral and bland way of saying that it's neither for marriage nor against marriage.<br><br>I hope that Buddhism can enter into the lives of people who are willing to believe in it, not necessarily having to become Buddhists first.<br><br>For example, a person may believe in Buddhism, but has not or does not want to take refuge in the Triple Gems yet, but he likes the idea of Buddhist wedding rites and decides to go through with it, why, it is a joy for all Buddhists isn't it?<br><br></div>

              <p>Just a real life experience that happened last thursday, where I held my solemnisation in a monastery.  I'm not exactly sure if you consider this as a wedding, but definitely, in the eyes of law, after this day, you have resigned from the bachelor/spinster club.</p>
              <p>As the solmenisation is done outside ROM, so we could pretty much decide what we want to do, including writing our own wedding vow.  Of course, some things are legal standard which has to be included.</p>
              <p>The sequence is as follows :</p>
              <p>Offerings to Buddha<br>Prayer for Turning Our Minds Towards Dharma<br>Recitation of 4 Immeasurable<br>Solemnisation<br>Bride and Grooms Aspiration Vow<br>Exchange Rings (without KISS)<br>Recitation of Aspiration of Shantideva<br>Dedication of Merit<br>Pronouncement of Marriage<br><br>Whole session took around 45 mins and pretty much short but meaningful ceremony for me and my wife.</p>

              <p>It's definitely a Buddhist wedding solemnisation. Wedding itself has many parts; solemnisation, offering tea to parents and elders and wedding dinner in general.</p>
              <p>Well, I wonder if I can hold a wedding solemnisation like yours, it would be nice though if I and my wife don't have to recite the 4 immeasurable and recitation and aspiration of shantideva (å¯‚å¤©).</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing me with about your wedding. It seems that most down here are singles and it's hard to really read about a real-life account.</p>
              <p>Congrats on your wedding, coolbluewater!</p>

              <p>You can decide on how you want to hold your solemnisation,  but all these must be communicated to the solemniser  if you need him/her to help conduct the prayer session.    But that's one advantage of doing your solemnisation outside ROM, that is you can organise it in whichever way you want.</p>
              <p>As for the actual day wedding, I'm planning to incorporate some buddhist rituals, like inviting a blessing to both of us (fingers crossed) by a sangha memmber.    The rest like tea ceremonies will be as per normal, but dinner will definitely be vegetarian food.  Maybe the rest of the brothers and sisters in this forum can help give ideas on how I should do my actual day wedding to make it meaningful and fun.</p>
              <p>If you need more info about solemnisation, can always pm me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>

              But that's one advantage of doing your solemnisation outside
              ROM, that is you can organise it in whichever way you want.</p>
              <p>As for the actual day wedding, I'm planning to incorporate some
              buddhist rituals, like inviting a blessing to both of us
              (fingers crossed) by a sangha memmber.    The rest
              like tea ceremonies will be as per normal, but dinner will
              definitely be vegetarian food.  Maybe the rest of the brothers
              and sisters in this forum can help give ideas on how I should do my
              actual day wedding to make it meaningful and fun.</p>
              <p>If you need more info about solemnisation, can always pm
              me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>

              <p>Hmm..if only I knew you long ago, I would be able to witness everything with my own eyes. :^_^</p>
              <p>Ideas on making the actual day wedding meaningful and fun? Well, I wish I could help, but I'm a boring person in real-life, so don't want to spoil the mood by giving you lousy ideas.</p>
              <p>I think the invitation of a sangha member to bless both of you and a totally vegetarian dinner (for all tables, right?) are one of those best things for me should I marry a Buddhist wife.</p>
              <p>Take care, may your married life be full of bliss and joy and your faith in the Triple Gems be your guide and support in leading a happy life with your wife.</p>
              <p>All the best. ^_^</p>
