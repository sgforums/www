Non-stop does not mean eternal, it means there is no resting for him. When he passes away after 1 kalpa, he again gets reborn in the same place, undergoing suffering for another kalpa, and on and on until he has exhausted his bad karma.<br><br>For example, Devadatta, who tried to kill Buddha 4 times but failed at teach time, was then swallowed by the earth to suffer in Avici hell for a 100000 world periods (kalpas), but would then become a paccekabuddha/pratyekabuddha. Buddha allowed him to enter the Sangha because he knew that even though he would commit karma for lower realms, he would plant the seeds of enlightenment through his attainments (i.e the Jhanas).<br><br>Furthermore, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is known to have made a great vow to save all hell beings before attaining Buddhahood. He will accomplish that before our universe is destroyed and a new universe if formed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:</div><div class="quote_body">Can someone prove to me by scientific fact that reincarnation is real?</div></blockquote>There has been scientific research on reincarnation and rebirth. You can find information from the net. For example you can search for '<a href="http://www.childpastlives.org/stevenson_articles.htm" rel="nofollow">Ian Stevenson</a>'. And many others who has likewise done research on this subject...<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm</a><br><br>Exerpt:<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/images/title_question.gif"><br>Well, have there been any scientists who believe in rebirth?<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/images/title_answer.gif"><br><br>Yes. Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced into the 19th century British school system and who was the first scientist to defend Darwin's theories, believed that reincarnation was a very plausible idea. In his famous book 'Evolution and Ethics and other Essays', he says:<br><br>In the doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical and Buddhist speculation found, ready to hand, the means of constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man... Yet this plea of justification is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty thinkers will reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality; and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy is capable of supplying.<br><br>Then, Professor Gustaf Stromberg, the famous Swedish astronomer, physicist and friend of Einstein also found the idea of rebirth appealing. Opinions differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or not. In 1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and reported by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from Delhi) could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five hundred miles from Delhi) which ended about a year before her "second birth." She gave the name of her husband and child and described her home and life history. The investigating commission brought her to her former relatives, who verified all her statements. Among the people of India reincarnations are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this case was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and similar cases can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory of the indestructibility of memory. Professor Julian Huxley, the distinguished British scientist who was Director General of UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony with scientific thinking. There is nothing against a permanently surviving spirit-individuality being in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message is given off by a sending apparatus working in a particular way. But it must be remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the receiver. So with our possible spirit-emanation. It... would never think or feel unless again 'embodied' in some way. Our per venalities are so based on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in any true sense personal without a body of sorts... I can think of something being given off which would bear the same relation to men and women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus; but in that case 'the dead' would, so far as one can see, be nothing but disturbances of different patterns wandering through the universe until... they... came back to actuality of consciousness by making contact with something which could work as a receiving apparatus for mind. Even very practical and down-to-earth people like the American industrialist Henry Ford found the idea or rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted to the idea of rebirth because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea, rebirth gives you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: I adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty-six. Religion offered nothing to the point.. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction. Work is fume if we cannot utilize the experience we collect in one life in the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal plan. I realized that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the clock... Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls than others, and so they know more... The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind at ease... If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so that it puts men's minds at ease. I would like to communicate to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us.<br><br>So the Buddhist teachings of rebirth does have some scientific evidence to support it. It is logically consistent and it goes a long way to answering questions that theistic and the materialistic theories fail to do. But it is also very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that gives you no second chance, no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in this life and no time to further develop the skills and abilities you have nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you fail to attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try again next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be able to correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to learn from your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or achieve in this life may well become possible in the next life. What a wonderful teaching!</div>

These worldly deities are often not found in Buddhism but rather in folk beliefs. There are 'celestial beings' in Buddhism, although we do not worship them. Many of them are Dharma Protectors (they protect the teachings of Buddhism), therefore we do pay our respects as such, although we do not worship them. Many celestial beings have also taken refuge in the Three Treasures. Anyway true buddhists do not pracitse 'mi2 xing4 bai4 bai4', we 'li3 bai4', pay reverence, respect, homage.<br><br>Furthermore, to be a true Buddhist, one has to take refuge in the Three Treasures. The Three Treasures are: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The Dharma is the Teachings/Truths that the Buddha taught. The Sangha is the monastic community in Buddhism.<br><br>Many people in Singapore who claim to be Buddhist are so called 'IC-Buddhist' and are not really Buddhists. Although they claim to be Buddhist they know not the teachings of Buddhism, and neither do they practise them. What they practise is a form of folk tradition that are practised since our ancestors, they are not the dharma teachings of the Buddha. To be a 'true Buddhist', one must take refuge in the Three Treasures, learn and practise the Dharma.<br><br>By the way, Guan Yin is from Buddhism. It just happens that it becomes extremely popular in China that the figure has become idolised and worshipped. Guan Yin originates from Buddhism, and is a role model Great Bodhisattva symoblising great compassion. Buddhists should therefore learn from this Great Bodhisattva and cultivate the Bodhisattva ways. There are many other famous Bodhisattvas - i.e Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa (the great Bodhisattva who vows to save sentient beings in hell), Wen Shu Shi Li Pu Sa (the Bodhisattva known for his Great Wisdm), and many many other famous ones. A Bodhisattva is one who not only seeks his own liberation/Nirvana but also vows to save/liberate sentient beings from the world of sufferings (samsara), and thereby walking the path towards perfect Buddhahood. All sentient beings have inherent Buddha Nature, and as a Buddhist we seek to awaken our Buddha Nature, practise the Bodhisattva way and eventually attain Buddhahood ourselves. The Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (i.e Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa) is also known to be able to perceive the voices and sounds of the entire universe and help emancipate sentient beings' sufferings.</div>

You find they are in the different canons. Undeniable there ARE some fake sutras circulating, but they are not major ones and are quite obvious they are faked, and the translator of the sutras are also not known (certainly its not recorded that those sutras were translated by famous Chinese masters who did the first sanskrit-chinese translation and so on). And it also does not correspond to the different canons - Chinese, Tibet, Sanskrit, so we will know. Other than that, the Pali canon/nikayas and Agama sutras of the Chinese canon are also identical.<br><br>How about prior to writing them down on written form in Sanskrit and Pali? Well, they are passed down through oral recitation since the Buddha's period. They are not only recited by one person, but by groups, so the chance of any changes and mistakes is minimal. There is a comparison of current versions of sutras compared to olden day versions and these showed little changes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">There has been scientific research on reincarnation and rebirth. You can find information from the net. For example you can search for '<a href="http://www.childpastlives.org/stevenson_articles.htm" rel="nofollow">Ian Stevenson</a>'. And many others who has likewise done research on this subject...<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm</a><br><br>Exerpt:<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/images/title_question.gif"><br>Well, have there been any scientists who believe in rebirth?<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/images/title_answer.gif"><br><br>Yes. Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced into the 19th century British school system and who was the first scientist to defend Darwin's theories, believed that reincarnation was a very plausible idea. In his famous book 'Evolution and Ethics and other Essays', he says:<br><br>In the doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical and Buddhist speculation found, ready to hand, the means of constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man... Yet this plea of justification is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty thinkers will reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality; and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy is capable of supplying.<br><br>Then, Professor Gustaf Stromberg, the famous Swedish astronomer, physicist and friend of Einstein also found the idea of rebirth appealing. Opinions differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or not. In 1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and reported by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from Delhi) could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five hundred miles from Delhi) which ended about a year before her "second birth." She gave the name of her husband and child and described her home and life history. The investigating commission brought her to her former relatives, who verified all her statements. Among the people of India reincarnations are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this case was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and similar cases can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory of the indestructibility of memory. Professor Julian Huxley, the distinguished British scientist who was Director General of UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony with scientific thinking. There is nothing against a permanently surviving spirit-individuality being in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message is given off by a sending apparatus working in a particular way. But it must be remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the receiver. So with our possible spirit-emanation. It... would never think or feel unless again 'embodied' in some way. Our per venalities are so based on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in any true sense personal without a body of sorts... I can think of something being given off which would bear the same relation to men and women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus; but in that case 'the dead' would, so far as one can see, be nothing but disturbances of different patterns wandering through the universe until... they... came back to actuality of consciousness by making contact with something which could work as a receiving apparatus for mind. Even very practical and down-to-earth people like the American industrialist Henry Ford found the idea or rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted to the idea of rebirth because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea, rebirth gives you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: I adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty-six. Religion offered nothing to the point.. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction. Work is fume if we cannot utilize the experience we collect in one life in the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal plan. I realized that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the clock... Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls than others, and so they know more... The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind at ease... If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so that it puts men's minds at ease. I would like to communicate to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us.<br><br>So the Buddhist teachings of rebirth does have some scientific evidence to support it. It is logically consistent and it goes a long way to answering questions that theistic and the materialistic theories fail to do. But it is also very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that gives you no second chance, no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in this life and no time to further develop the skills and abilities you have nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you fail to attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try again next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be able to correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to learn from your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or achieve in this life may well become possible in the next life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly the best Scientific Method when dealing with things like rebirth is still Buddha's 'scientific method' which as Ajahn Brahmavamso said, and that is readily reproduceable by anyone without any $$ as long as he is willing to take up the effort.<br><br>Because our current modern scientific understandings has its limits and defects, it covers lots of areas but the closest it gets to conciousness studies is neuroscience but it can't help much. It is just that - consciousness is not being studied enough. Quantum physics may be able to prove things that Buddhists talk about regarding to consciousness but anyway, still best if you can recall your past lives yourself.</div>
