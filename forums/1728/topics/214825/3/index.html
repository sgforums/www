I for one, am not a vegetarian.<br><br>In general, Buddhism has 3 major traditions, which is the Theravada (i.e Thai, Sri Lankan Buddhism), Mahayana (i.e Chinese Buddhism), Vajrayana (i.e Tibetan Buddhism). The Theravada tradition does not have a tradition of following vegetarian diet, and are willing to take any non-vegetarian food alms from lay Buddhists as long as they are suitable for eating. This is in a way a practise of 'non-preference'. Likewise, vegetarianism is not very emphasized in the Tibetan Tradition, although some of them do practised it. That is because in Tibet, the high altitude and climate makes it very difficult for agriculture and they depend largely on animals for their food, etc.<br><br>Vegetarianism is more widespread in the Chinese Mahayana tradition. But still, not everyone from the Chinese Mahayana tradition is a vegetarian. I am considered to be from the Chinese Mahayana tradition but I am currently not a vegetarian yet.<br><br>Those who do not wish to become vegetarian yet, in Buddhism, would have to eat meat only under 5 conditions which the karma resulted is lesser, also known as the 5 pure meat:<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">Five Clean Sources of Meat</a><br><br><blockquote>Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter </blockquote>Vegetarianism is practised in Mahayana because the Mahayana scriptures stated that the Buddha taught that a Bodhisattva/Mahayana practitioner will have to abstain from meat in order to develop Great Compassion. Or rather, meat eating will destroy one's root of Great Compassion, because eating meat is indirectly killing the animals.<br><br>&gt; "Further more, Mahamati, in order to turn the worlds into pure Buddha-<br>&gt; worlds, in which all living beings can be enlightened, Bodhisattvas<br>&gt; should not eat meat. They should discern that all meats are like the<br>&gt; dead bodies of human being, we cannot even bear looking at or<br>&gt; smelling them, how could we put them into our mouths? Mahamati, the<br>&gt; burned dead bodies are mephitic and feculent, the cooked meats are as<br>&gt; mephitic and feculent as the burned dead bodies, so how could we eat<br>&gt; such things? Therefore, Mahamati, in order to turn the worlds into<br>&gt; pure Buddha-worlds, to enlighten all living beings, Bodhisattvas<br>&gt; should not eat meat."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ~ Lankavatara Sutra<br><br>---------<br><br>Now as to the question of beef...this has also been discussed before but to answer beyond_religion's first post, it's perfectly alright to ask whether it has been asked before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The custom of not eating beef is linked with Hinduism and Chinese folks culture. Because they do not forget the hard work that cows have helped in their agriculture. And also, the Hindus treat cows as holy animals.<br><br>Actually Buddha did not particularly single out beef as not to be eaten. However, those who choose to eat meat should eat meat under only three conditions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you go to Thailand, the monks there can eat beef because they belong to the Theravadin tradition. The only animals they cannot eat are the flesh of humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, and panthers.</div>

The flesh of any biped or quadruped, except for that which is unallowable. The following types of meat are un-allowable: the flesh of human beings, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas (panthers). Human beings, horses, and elephants were regarded as too noble to be used as food. The other types of meat were forbidden either on grounds that they were repulsive ("People were offended and annoyed and spread it about, 'How can these Sakyan contemplatives eat dog meat? Dogs are loathsome, disgusting'") or dangerous (bhikkhus, smelling of lion's flesh, went into the jungle; the lions there were offended and annoyed and attacked them).<br><br>To eat human flesh entails a thullaccaya; to eat any of the other unallowable types, a dukkata (Mv.VI.23.9-15).

Thus bhikkhus may not eat steak tartare, sashimi, oysters on the half-shell, etc. (Raw flesh and blood are allowed at Mv.VI.10.2 only when one is possessed by non-human beings (!)) Furthermore, even cooked fish or meat of an allowable kind is unallowable if the bhikkhu sees, hears, or suspects that the animal was killed specifically for the purpose of feeding bhikkhus (Mv.VI.31.14).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by bladez87:<br>sorry . so in short we can eat beef? btw what are the 3 conditions that we can eat meat?</blockquote>You can eat beef as long as under the three conditions/five conditions. Usually beef is OK (i.e under the 5 conditions) because its frozen meat, therefore its not directly killed for us, as we usually don't demand people to slaughter the cows for us. Unfortunately very often when we order seafood, we will be going against the 5 Pure Meat principle, because we are ordering those sea creatures to be slaughtered for us. Therefore we should take note. For me, if someone treat me seafood I still eat, but I will not order live seafood for myself or others.<br><br>Three Conditions or Five Conditions of eating meat are mentioned in the sutras. The more commonly heard is the three conditions, the five conditions is merely an extension of that.<br><br>Three conditions: did not see the killing, did not hear the killing, and do not suspect that they were killed.<br><br>Five conditions: (1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter<br><br><blockquote>after reading about this, i not sure what buddhism is about. i know is the cultivation of 1 self. but why are we praying with joss sticks to Guan Yin?<br><br>just this morning i broke a mirror, and my dad asked me to pray to Ti Gong, Guan Yin, Laughing Buddha and Buddha to seek protection.</blockquote>It is a form of folks belief. And your family practises the common folks practises, or 'Ming Jian Xing Yang'. Ti Gong is a Chinese deity and is not from Buddhism. Deities are different from Enlightened Beings, because worldly deities still belong to Samsara, while enlightened beings have transcended Samsara, freed from the three poisons of Greed, Hatred, Ignorance, and the cycle of rebirth in the six realms of existence (the three lower realms are Hell, Spirits, Animals, while the three higher realms are Asura, Human, Heaven/Celestial). There are some deities that honour the teachings of the Buddha and vows to protect the dharma. We call them dharma protectors and pay them due respects. However we do not worship any worldly deities, in fact we do not even worship the Buddha or Bodhisattvas. Buddhists do not 'mi2 xing4 bai4 bai4', we 'li3 bai4', pay homage, reverence, respect, etc. Hmm sounds so familiar... oh, I just mentioned a few days ago haha. Do see my reply to SumOne on 19 October 2006 Â· 07:33 PM.<br><br>Joss sticks, the 'sao1 siang1', the 'siang' (fragrance) symbolises the Fragrance of Dao4 De2. In the sutras (i.e Lu Xiang Zan) it mentions 'Lu Siang Za Re Fa Jie Meng Xun', the Fragrance of Dao De pervades the entire Dharmadhatu, which means pervades the entire universe. We must learn to have 'Dao4 De2', that is what it means. Buddhists do not necessarily need to put joss stick everywhere in Buddhist monasteries at every altar, I mean if you imagine Buddha were here and the whole place is so smokey, he wouldn't like it. We can pay our respects with '3 prostrations' (san1 bai4), or just ding2 li3. But anyway there is difference between Chinese temples and Buddhist monastery, dharma centers. Chinese temples are folks tradition temples that worship gods and deities. (usually) Buddhist monasteries are where Buddhist monks and nuns resides, and also the Monasteries and Dharma Centers serves as a place to propagate the Buddha Dharma (the Truths and Teachings that Buddha taught that leads to Wisdom, Bliss, Liberation)<br><br>Anyway just to intro about those figures you mentioned. Guan Yin is Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva who can perceive and hear the voices and sounds throughout the universe, and has the ability to save beings in need of help. Laughing Buddha is Maitreya Bodhisattva (Mi2 Le4 Pu2 Sa4), the Next Buddha to appear on Earth, and therefore <strong>not</strong> yet a Buddha. 'Bodhisattvas' are beings cultivating to attain complete Buddhahood. And Buddha (I presume you refering to the thinner one) is Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical Buddha in India. We should learn from the examples of the Great Bodhisattvas, and of course the Buddha himself, in practising the way of the Bodhisattva, to save the inner sentient being (yourself) and the outer sentient beings.. and eventually attain Buddhahood. The ultimate aim of Buddhism is to attain Enlightenment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>More about Bodhisattvas I mentioned days ago:<br><br><blockquote>Guan Yin originates from Buddhism, and is a role model Great Bodhisattva symoblising great compassion. Buddhists should therefore learn from this Great Bodhisattva and cultivate the Bodhisattva ways. There are many other famous Bodhisattvas - i.e Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa (the great Bodhisattva who vows to save sentient beings in hell), Wen Shu Shi Li Pu Sa (the Bodhisattva known for his Great Wisdm), and many many other famous ones. A Bodhisattva is one who not only seeks his own liberation/Nirvana but also vows to save/liberate sentient beings from the world of sufferings (samsara), and thereby walking the path towards perfect Buddhahood. All sentient beings have inherent Buddha Nature, and as a Buddhist we seek to awaken our Buddha Nature, practise the Bodhisattva way and eventually attain Buddhahood ourselves.</blockquote><blockquote>will breaking mirror really cause 7 years of bad luck? aha.</blockquote>I'll be direct about this... it is a form of superstition. Even the idea of 'bad luck' is superstitious.... there is no such thing as 'bad luck', there is only karma - wholesome, unwholesome, and pure karma. Being a Buddhist, we should drop and let go all superstitious beliefs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You may want to read the stickied topic posted by Neutral_Onliner: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=199365" rel="nofollow">KARMA - nobody but you yourself is in control of your fate</a></div>

But it's ok since I type very fast... hahaha<br><br>Anyway I'm going to reply two parts in one post because they are interrelated. And I have to be very careful especially when talking about Christianity <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Because it can be quite political hehe... so anyway, what is being typed here may not reflect what Christians think about these issues, but what we think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So first of all you need to understand what learning and practising Buddhism means. It is about avoiding all evil deeds, doing all virtuous deeds and completely purifiying the mind. It is about enlightening the mind, to have a bright mental culture. All orthodox religions teach about "avoiding all evil deeds, doing all virtuous deeds", including Christianity, however, most religions do not teach about "liberation", "enlightenment", "purifying one's mind". These are what is unique in Buddhism. Purifying one's mind is important in Buddhism because the mind is the source of all good and bad, the source of all sufferings, and also that which makes us become trapped in Samsara.. and purifying the mind includes getting rid of Greed, Hatred, Ignorance, our fetters, and to eventually become freed from all sentient thoughts, and much more. "Avoiding all evil deeds, doing all virtuous deeds" is the basics of all religions and also Buddhism, i.e the Five Precepts and 10 virtuous deeds (<a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4a.htm</a>), however that does not ensure that one will attain enlightenment or become liberated. That is only to avoid bad karma and accumulate blessings. It will allow us to be reborn in the 3 higher realms in the next life, or even the Celestial/Heaven realm. However it does not mean we will become enlightened or liberated. Therefore only through practising Buddhism will we be able to become liberated from sufferings, from rebirth in the 6 realms of samsaric existences.<br><br>Jesus is an enlightened person, as I mentioned in other topics recently, my master (Master Shen Kai), and other famous masters like the Dalai Lama, Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh, and many more, commended that Jesus is a Bodhisattva. Meaning that he is a highly enlightened being on the path to Buddhahood. However, due to the conditions and the capacity of the people, Jesus could not teach higher truths that people would not understand.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/june11/15.64.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/june11/15.64.html</a><br><br>....I reminded him of his belief that Jesus is "a fully enlightened being" and asked, "If Jesus is fully enlightened, wouldn't he be teaching the truth about himself? Therefore, if he is teaching the truth, then he is the Son of God, and there is a God, and Jesus is the Savior. If he is fully enlightened, he should teach the truth. If he is not teaching the truth, he is not that enlightened."<br><br>As the Dalai Lama felt the momentum of the question, he laughed more than at any other time in the interview. He obviously understood the argument, borrowed from C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity.<br><br>"This is a very good question," he said. "This is very, very important, very important." Even in Buddha's case, he said, a distinction must always be made between teachings that "always remain valid" and others that "we have the liberty to reject."<br><br>He argued that the Buddha knew people were not always ready for the higher truth because it "wouldn't suit, wouldn't help." Therefore, lesser truths are sometimes taught because of the person's ignorance or condition. This is known in Buddhist dharma as the doctrine of uppayah, or skillful means. The Dalai Lama then applied this to the question about Jesus.<br><br>"Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said. "So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that. Then, at a certain period, certain era, he appeared as a new master, and then because of circumstances, he taught certain views different from Buddhism, but he also taught the same religious values as I mentioned earlier: Be patient, tolerant, compassionate. This is, you see, the real message in order to become a better human being." He said that there was absolutely no lying involved since Jesus' motivation was to help people....</blockquote>However Jesus did teach higher teachings to his disciples (i.e Apostles), however not many people understood his higher teachings and very often his teachings in the bible was being misinterpreted by those who do not understand and distorted as I have mentioned in the previous topic.<br><br>p.s fyi, my Buddhist Master was once an active pastor who wrote Christian books, and my local dharma teacher was also a devoted Christian.. as for my master, on the day he attained enlightenment at 12, he received divine signs telling him to bring bliss to humanity (see the second last post here: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=153935&amp;page=6" rel="nofollow">Curious - Any Christian-turned-Buddhist converts here?</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>btw what is enlightenment? i dont get it. haha because i am dim i supposed. what am i supposed to be enlightened of?</blockquote>Sorry I missed out this part.. enlightenment means realising the truth. It can be likened to turning on the switch and the whole room becomes lightened up, while prior to that it was completely dark. Therefore 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng said, <span style="font-style: italic;">Even as the light of a lamp can break up darkness which has been there for a thousand years, so a spark of Wisdom can do away with ignorance which has lasted for ages.</span><br><br>As one practises the dharma one will gain small realisations/insights along the path, perhaps the realisation that what we possess is impermanent and ungraspable, even to step into Buddhism and take refuge in the Three Treasures can be considered a 'small realisation'... with such 'small realisations' as we cultivate earnestly we will eventually attain 'da ce da wu', Great realisation. This 'great realisation' is beyond comprehension of our mind, it is directly seeing into our all-pervading Buddha Nature, original nature. Our Buddha Nature/Dharma Nature pervades the entire Dharmadhatu, the entire universe. Our Buddha Nature is always present, 'following' us wherever, every realm we become born in... even when we become reborn in Hell, our Buddha Nature is still there, present, although we just don't realise it. It is likened to a mirror that is covered with dust and we do not know that below the layer of dust is in fact a clear bright mirror. Even such analogy is not entirely accurate.. it is only an analogy... in truth there is no mirror, the mirror is empty. There are highly enlightened persons even in this forum who has directly seen for themselves our true nature. It is not a theoretical, conceptual understanding, but to directly SEE for ourselves our true nature is as it is.<br><br>Enlightenment is the realisation of the Ultimate Reality, Emptiness, Pure Awareness (i.e our Buddha Nature which is All-pervading - Buddha is called 'aware', 'awakened one').</div>

But if you want to become enlightened it is important that you hear the teachings and practises that leads to liberation, enlightenment. As I have mentioned, Jesus taught many teachings out of skillful means that is the practise of virtuous qualities -<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...He argued that the Buddha knew people were not always ready for the higher truth because it "wouldn't suit, wouldn't help."
