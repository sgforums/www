            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Well I think many of the young generations are beginning to have their doubts on Buddhism than the older generations irregardless the highly educated or illiterate ones. Why so? From time to time, this is a question mark in my head. The only answer I can find, All these are happening due to misinterpretation or mis-representation of what should be the teaching of True Buddhism.<br><br>I liken this World as a Big Ocean with many fishes. In this Big Ocean, there are many kinds of fishes &amp; other living creatures. One good example &amp; specie will be the "Rough Eye Rockfish", who live much longer than humans. In Alaska, they have been known to reach the ripe old age of 205 years. This longevity is so rare in the animal kingdom that makes them a "centenarian species" which none is comparable to them. To be able to distinguish a True "Rough Eye Rockfish" is as difficult as "Finding a needle in the sea" for most of the people. Seeing it, Even putting a name to a face isn't as easy as it seems. Just distinguishing 30 of the 100 rockfish species found around the world which is the True "Rough Eye Rockfish" is not really possible to the Mass Public. Why so? Well its because many of these fish look alike. Recognition of Which is the Truth is often muddled by Illusion created by some. All I can say "Rockfish: More Than Meets The Eye".<br><br>I feel this is the most appropriate analogy to be shared in here. This will let others have a chance to think &amp; ponder on What is the Truth? Back to the Main Topic in here, In short Buddhism is a Religion for more than 2,500 years, many factions or school of thoughts of Buddhism has been surfaced over time. However not all really are following the Teachings of the Buddha which is True Buddhism. I shall not go into the details on the Teachings of the Buddha which cannot be explained in mere words. In laymen terms, True Buddhism is based on certain core teachings which are "Unique" &amp; none can be comparable to it. Just like only a True  "Rough Eye Rockfish" possess such longevity which many sub-species tried to imitate "Externally" however they can never be on par in term of life span no matter how similar they in their outlook. In term of Buddhism, Many who seemingly "Preach" to be that of a True Buddhist are not really so, beneath their so called Buddhist Way may be "More Than Meets The Eye". So we come to the point of What is "Orthodox Buddhism" &amp; What is "NOT"? Well many of the younger generations are misled due to External Influences or Warped Teachings planted by Others into their mind with material stuffs behind a Faux smokescreen. I would like to bring your attention to these REAL HAPPENINGS that are going on not only in HERE but in this SOCIETY we are in. What is the TRUTH seems to be in a Fog created by Others. there is no transparency or simply can longer be seen. We do not only see things with our Eyes, we need to see things with our Heart. Do not attempt to cover the TRUTH with a SHAM. This only mark down to INTERGRITY of One is seriously of Doubts. At times the TRUTH hurts when it come to light but not matter how dark it is, Darkness can never cover the LIGHT of TRUTH. It takes a Great Man to be able to admit their faults. The sad irony is that although such facts are too obvious to be ignored by even the most ignorant, they continue to be ignored by the most intelligent. Why? Simply because it is convenient for many to invest in false hopes or promises rather than expose the futility of failure. Instead of admitting the obvious, they chose to invest in false hopes or promises of Salvation by UNORTHODOX Teachings which is not TRUE BUDDHISM. If you pronounce you lead a life of a True Buddhist, it must not only be in your Words but your Actions. Your Words &amp; Actions must be Coherent. Do not preach something You do not even apply in your Actions or daily lives. That is an Illusion, A Web of Deceit you spin not only for yourself but Others. Remember its YOUR OWN DOINGS, only yourself is ANSWERABLE to your OWN ACTIONS. Buddha is Omnipresent. No matter what lies or deceits, it can never cover the TRUTH, not all are blind. If Blind Lead Blind, all will fall in the Ditch.<br><br>Personally I do not see myself as a True Buddhist although I do apply certain Buddhist Teachings in my daily life. I am here to share &amp; learn, Great Wisdom is Boundless &amp; never selfish. Only Flawed Human Natures are, Imperfection can be a beauty if we are able to accept &amp; admit our Flaws. Attempting to cover Flaws with Deceit is Despicable. It does great harm not only to yourself but Others who placed their trust in you. Sins or Karma is highly subjective. Good or Bad its yours to take, only you, yourself know.<br><br>Last but not least, these are my personal views in my own words which I am sharing in here. Pardon my poor writing, forgive my long passages. With so much on-going happenings, I feel a need to address these to fellow Dharma Brothers &amp; Sister not only in here but all. Many may start to think &amp; ponder more perhaps. Maybe its time to educate not only the younger generation but all on the True Teachings of Buddha. Just like a glass of Pure Juice, as you add more water to it, it becomes diluted. Diluted is still fine, you may not get the Pure thing but the core is still there just you are getting less of the REAL THING. What can be worse when you put in other additives like liquor, it can look the same but it can never taste or work the same? Its worse than most Venomous Poison. Perhaps its the doing what we call "Three Poison" in Buddhism.

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, thank you to all who replied to my post, it's really helpful to have opinions from other practitioners.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm considering taking a more structured approach to studying Buddhism.  My aunt is well-meaning but I feel she's not able to address my doubts. Where are the places to study the religion?  Are there different schools of Buddhism?  Where do I find more information about this?  How to decide which to study?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My aunt is kinda self-taught.<br>She dreamt of Guan Yin visiting her and telling her to convert to Buddhism; she was previously a Taoist.  So she did some research, went to a temple , officially became a Buddhist ( I think there is some ceremony for that? ), set up a home altar, and started practicing.  She studies Jin Gong Fa Shi vcds.  There is a temple she goes to but can't remember which.<br><br>You're right, if I understand the sutra perhaps I will then understand the purpose of chanting . <blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">By the way what tradition is your mother from, or what Venerable does your mother take refuge under?<br><br>Ok as for chanting sutras, my master used to say, chanting is not as good as understanding the sutra, and understanding the sutra is not as good as really practising the sutra and even higher level, the sutra must lead us to Insight, to enlightenment. Chanting sutras is a good practise.. why? Because even if we do not understand the sutra completely now, we plant a deep karmic seed of the teachings of the Buddha into our consciousness and when conditions are there the seed will ripen and we will gain insight. Furthermore chanting sutras have its own vast merits, so if people chant sutras we should encourage them.<br><br>But true Buddhists shouldn't just stop at chanting, I think you understand what I mean. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read your post in the thread "can fate be changed?".  My Aunt does what you described about Skillful Means in the Mahayana tradition.<br><br>Another thing she is fond of saying is,  when you chant Na Mo Omni Tofo , all spirits will respect it (and you) because the Buddha is the biggest "god" or diety around. Is that true? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">In regards to 'asking favours'... still ultimately is your karma.

This is the path to Buddhism's highest perfection, nibbana. Not even the Buddha can take you to that goal.You alone must do the work necessary to complete the journey<br></div></blockquote></div>
