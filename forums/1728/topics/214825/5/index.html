Even if there is no continuity of consciousness after death, true Buddhist practitioners will not be overly disturbed as they are thoroughly trained to understand the meaning of emptiness and doctrine of no-self.

May you gain in wisdom and find bliss of dharma. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>'Gods' and 'prayers', what do you mean by them? In Buddhism we do not worship any gods. And what do you mean by 'prayers'? Can you elaborate them?<br><br>Lastly, a Buddhist only needs to watch that (if they are not vegetarian) their meat comes from 5 clean sources, see <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">Five Clean Sources of Meat</a>. Why? Because we do not want to commit more serious karma as a result of the diet we take. If we can eat meat under these 5 conditions, the karma will be much less.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Five Clean Sources of Meat</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Many people firmly recognise that the Buddha's teachings are full, subtle, comprehensive and profound. They recognise and revere the truth of the Buddha-dharma as soon as they encounter it. However, they face a common dilemma: they hesitate to take refuge in the Three Treasures because they do not wish to be vegetarians. For this reason, some ponder at the gate of Buddhism for a long time and are afraid to take that step forward. Others arrive at the crossroad of religion, some took the wrong turn and ended up with some cults or unorthodox ways. They do not realise that it is not easy to be born a human, and it is even harder to have the opportunity to encounter the Buddha-dharma. Having been born a human, it is indeed a waste of opportunity not to embrace Buddhism as it knocks at our door.</span><br><br>The Buddha-dharma is infinite and there are in reality more than 84,000 Dharma doors, or methods by which we can embark to learn and practise Buddhism. Vegetarianism is just one of the many methods. To refrain from killing is merely a means of assisting us to progress in our cultivation. As a medicine, meat is permitted in the Buddhist precepts if it is required to cure a particular sickness. Buddhism cherishes compassion. However, killing and causing harm to life have their retributions. The world has no peace as victims and villains engage in a vicious cycle of vengeance and revenge, culminating in calamities and disasters, and inflicting suffering and misery across the world.<br><br>Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br><strong>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter</strong><br><br>To refrain from killing is fundamental to Buddhism. Regardless of life forms, we must not kill, we must not instruct others to kill, and it must not be killed for our sake, for example, to celebrate our birthday or because we were coming to dinner. These are three sources of clean meat.<br><br>In Confucianism, benevolence also means to refrain from killing. It is said that heaven has the virtue of loving life. It cannot bear to witness the loss of life, let alone eat the flesh of those whose cries in death we have heard. Buddhism advocates compassion and loving-kindness to all sentient beings, regardless of their relation to you. It is only appropriate that we do not kill for our livelihood or for the purpose of celebrating occasions, such as births, birthdays, funerals or weddings. Meats are no different from the other foodstuffs purchased from the market if people do not witness the killing or hear the cries of the animal that is being slaughtered. If a differentiation between the two kinds of purchases and the taste of the meat do not exist in the mind, then the guilt is lighter. Together with the three mentioned earlier, these constitute the five sources of clean meat.<br><br>Meat eating however is a pre-condition to killing. If people refrain from eating meat, there will be no killing of animals for meat. Sadly, the human race has committed killings for aeons and is engaged in an endless cycle of vengeance and revenge over their past lives. For one who is slaughtered for meat in this life, it is probably because he had done the same to others in the past. The score is even, no more and no less.<br><br>People who eat meat from the five clean sources are advised to learn to chant the Buddha's name and the Buddhist mantras, so as to transfer the merits to those whose meat they are eating. They should also wish them an early rebirth in the human realm, to eliminate any thoughts of vengeance, to nurture their virtuous roots to benefit all sentient beings and together build a peaceful, caring and blissful pure land in this world. Only when this is promoted across the entire world, will we be able to eliminate hatred and vengeance, and enhance a mind of compassion and loving kindness. In this way we will be able to transform this Saha world into a pure land.</blockquote></div>

One who truly knows dharma will know that Buddhism is really about practising and cultivation, to see the truths for ourselves. It is not only just a philosophy, and it is not a religion that is about rituals and things like that. Even if there are rituals they are secondary, only as an expedient means for sentient beings. They have its purpose and place, but Buddhists should know that rituals is not the primary purpose of Buddhism, of the teachings of Buddha. Buddhism is about cultivating wisdom, a bright mental culture... living a blissful life and experience freedom, bcos of dharma.<br><br>Releasing birds is a good practise, but we must make sure that those birds will survive on their own. Releasing animals has its merits also, that's like setting free someone who is kidnapped. Of course that is a virtuous deed. However even if we cannot release animals, an even better thing is to 'protect animals', every single animal we should try to protect them from harm, and if we can be a vegetarian by all means do be a vegetarian and by this we can save a lot of animals' lives because if there is no demand then there will not be so many animals killed.<br><br>By the way what tradition is your mother from, or what Venerable does your mother take refuge under?<br><br>Ok as for chanting sutras, my master used to say, chanting is not as good as understanding the sutra, and understanding the sutra is not as good as really practising the sutra and even higher level, the sutra must lead us to Insight, to enlightenment. Chanting sutras is a good practise.. why? Because even if we do not understand the sutra completely now, we plant a deep karmic seed of the teachings of the Buddha into our consciousness and when conditions are there the seed will ripen and we will gain insight. Furthermore chanting sutras have its own vast merits, so if people chant sutras we should encourage them.<br><br>But true Buddhists shouldn't just stop at chanting, I think you understand what I mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add on to the previous post.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by choco B:<br><br>Hmm I'm having problems explaining without revealing too much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Suffice to say that I'm kinda under pressure to convert to Buddhism by my family.   As previously mentioned I agree with the Buddhist philosophy but being a skeptic I can't bring myself to believe in the ... supernatural  (OK this is a lousy word but dunno how else to describe) aspects.</blockquote>Don't feel pressurised. To take refuge in the Three Treasures to become a Buddhist, is something to rejoice. Because taking refuge is like returning. For countless aeons sentient beings like us have wandered from one lifetime to the other in ignorance... undergoing countless sufferings and not seeing that there is any hope of freedom and awakening. Not seeing our innate Buddha Nature. So to take refuge is like after aeons of wandering in ignorance in the 6 realms we have finally remembered our parents at home, and we wish to return.<br><br>Taking refuge is also creating a deep affinity with the triple gems so that we may continue to encounter the three treasures and continue on our spiritual path in future lives..<br><br>It is normal to have doubts because many things are beyond our scope to comprehend. This should not stop us from taking refuge or becoming a Buddhist. There is no need to blindly believe everything you hear. But if we have confidence in the Three Treasures to lead us to enlightenment, and really practise the teachings, one day we will find out for ourselves. What is the ultimate aim of practising Buddhism? It is 'ming xin jian xing'. To awaken to our true nature, our own buddha nature. To attain Buddhahood. This is definitely possible and countless others (even today, even in this forum) have awakened to their true nature under the guidance and teachings of the buddhadharma.<br><br>When our practise/cultivation bears results, we will gain confidence in the words of the Buddha. We will see for ourselves what the Buddha said is indeed absolutely true and the way he taught truly leads to fruition. So as our practise and cultivation gains strength, the more confidence we have in the teachings of the triple gems. Even 'heaven' and 'hell' also truly exist and eventually you will know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In regards to 'asking favours'... still ultimately is your karma. But in Mahayana Buddhism it is also possible to pray for certain changes as long as it is not against the principles of Buddhism, and I posted this recently in: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=222635" rel="nofollow">can fate be changed?</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">There is no such thing as fate... is only karma. And yes, karma can be changed, if you think you have done something wrong, you can repent, do virtuous deeds, etc, and this will help overcome the karma. Chanting also helps...<br><br>In the Mahayana tradition... it is actually possible to pray to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas for help. I'll summarise a little on what my dharma teacher said about this. This is called Skillful Means, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is able to help in certain cases. It really depends on your situation... and what you pray for must be of right intentions, what you pray for must not contradict the dharma. For example if you pray to win big bucks from toto or gambling then of course you won't find that praying is helpful. Instead, the more you pray, the more you won't win. If say you are in financial crisis and you have a family to feed.. you really need money, and if you chant Namo Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa very often, very regularly, and pray for changes.. then you might indeed see a change of events.<br><br>However, it may not work in all cases. Because still it is your karma. The Buddhas/bodhisattvas can only help you have 'access' to these wholesome, virtuous seeds. So let's say you have $100 in your bank, if you are in crisis and you need some money, you pray to the Buddhas/bodhisattvas you may get some money from your bank (i.e the 8th consciousness, alaya consciousness). But if the money is used up (i.e the karma is used up) then even if you pray to Buddha/bodhisattva, they cannot help you.<br><br>So if you really didn't see much changes then perhaps it is because you do not have enough good karma. So it is important also, to be wholesome, do virtuous things, avoid unwholesome actions/speech/thoughts, this is to accumulate blessings. But that is not enough of course... because there is a saying by Buddha in accordance to a true story.. if you cultivate blessings and not wisdom, you will be reborn as a royal elephant (good karma but ignorant), and if you cultivate wisdom only but not blessings, even after you become Arhat (liberated person who attained Nirvana), the lay people do not give you alms to eat. So, meaning even if you are enlightened, on the material side you are poor.<br><br>But.. still for one who has wisdom, he completely every moment as it is, irregardless of the life situation around him. He is unaffected.. peaceful.. calm.. and joyful at all times. Therefore dharma practise is important, it allows us to be liberated and at peace, happy at all times.<br><br>p.s what kind of "fate" do you want to be changed? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote></div>

This is the path to Buddhism's highest perfection, nibbana. Not even the Buddha can take you to that goal.You alone must do the work necessary to complete the journey<br><br></div>
