              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>The editors of <em>Awake at the Bedside: Contemplative Teachings on Palliative and
              End-of- Life Care</em> want to make one thing very clear: this book is
              not about dying, it's about life and what it can teach us, it's about caring
              and what giving care really means. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Equal parts instruction manual and contemplative testimony ,this
              book addresses how we think about death and dying and examines current
              practices in palliative and end-of-life care, with important suggestions for
              improvement. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Key elements to this new way of approaching the end of life
              include both presence and a way to make the interaction between 'us' and 'them'
              more collaborative, and with any spiritual luck, more beautiful. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Zen teacher Koshin Paley Ellison, who co-founded the New York
              Zen Center for Contemplative Care (NYZCCC) in 2007 with Robert Chodo Campbell
              have transformed the narrative around end-of-life practice on a national level.
              In just nine years, NYZCCC has brought contemplative care to 80,000
              individuals, and has trained more than 600 physicians, nurses, social workers,
              and chaplains. Thirty-five medical residencies across the country have
              integrated their curriculum. <br> What Ellison and co-editor Matt Weingast have to teach us is invaluable -
              wisdom and counsel for those who keep watch at the bedside. The Buddhist
              approach brings a grace to an often difficult and frightening time that is
              beyond comforting, it's life-changing. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>And the nicest part is that all of this is shared with an
              abundance of joy and the kindest and best of intentions. A gift.</span></p>

              dying changed my own life and was honored to interview Koshin Paley Ellison
              about this book:</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Nancy Doyle Palmer</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'> : Can you elaborate on what is new about the ways you approach
              end-of-life care in this book? </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Koshin Paley Ellison</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>: We are because of relationships. The New York Zen Center for
              Contemplative Care is focused on how to live an engaged life, and we do this through
              study, care and meditation. All three aspects are integral in our view of how
              to offer contemplative care. Contemplative care is a practitioner who maintains
              their own deep meditation practice with a community and teacher, who
              understands that everything and everyone is a teacher, and who come alive
              through constant study and realizes that care is a practice of generosity. I
              understand generosity as giving and receiving as one. So, there is no
              "self-care." If we care we include ourselves and others.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>When I set out to create this book, I wanted to have all the
              voices of people on the ground doing the work--from the pioneers of hospice and
              grief work to contemporary contemplative teachers and caregivers. Matt, my
              co-editor and dear friend, and I culled together all those we love and feel
              nourished by. We did this because this is the approach to contemplative
              care--we can't do it alone in a singular voice. This is what is new and old. We
              used to value community more. So, this book is about remembering there are so
              many vital voices to nourish and support us. To do this well, we need each
              other. So, this book's approach is a reminder of community and practice and to
              engage fully. How do we each do that? As one of the marvelous contributors
              writes, "Feast on your life."<br> <br> <strong>NDP</strong>:
              How do you work with people, particularly of an older generation, who do not
              wish to talk about their feelings or have frank discussions about the fact that
              they are dying?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>KPE</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>: Most of us live in
              unspoken fears. I was training a group of seventy doctors, with Chodo, and we
              asked them what they are afraid of. Pain, loss, change were the themes. So
              ordinary. In my experience, people are afraid, and when I meet someone who does
              not want to talk about their feelings or speak frankly, I ask them what they
              want to talk about.<br> I had the privilege to meet a middle aged man with metastatic cancer said,
              "I don't do feelings." He told me about the baseball game, and how he
              was worried that his team was not going to make it to the world series this year.
              "They always go," he said. So we talked about baseball, and how it
              was an anchor for him in his life, and how his winning team was not making it,
              broke his heart. It made him sad. "What will happen to them?" he
              asked. "What do you imagine?" I said. "I don't know," he
              said, "I am just worried they will fall away into insignificance."
              "What then?" I asked. "Well," he said looking out the
              window, "I guess we all have our time." "Sounds like that is
              really true for you," I said. "Yep," he said, "it is really
              true for me too. I am disappointed and yet okay with it too. I go with me
              team."</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>We are always telling our whole story. To me, we can just learn
              to pay attention and receive fully where the person is without an agenda.
              Without needing to talk about something in a particular way. Of course this is
              easy to say and takes a life time to practice. And this is the joy of
              practicing care and meditation. It is a lifetime of curiosity and
              investigation.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>NDP</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>: What do you advise
              when the person who is facing end-of-life is fearful, panicked, anguished, in
              turmoil? How can that person be helped?<br> <strong>KPE</strong>:
              I am a very curious person now. So if someone is afraid, I am curious about
              their fear and anguish. The best help is not to try to fix them and to not try
              to push away those feelings because I am uncomfortable with them.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Recently I met a woman in her fifties who was raging and in
              pain. She was dying and really was sure this was not supposed to happen. When
              we talked together we told me how she had waited her whole life to retire so
              that she can begin to really live and fulfill her "bucket list." This
              was not going to happen, and she was howling in pain about it. It felt as if
              the universe had conspired against her. This howling needs to be heard. It
              isn't easy, and yet most valuable moments in life are not easy--they take
              diligence. Like all the great stories of the worlds religions and myths--it
              isn't just about the simple way. And yet, the simple way to meet ourselves and
              others in the moment. She told me she now really related to the Virgin Mary
              because she had to suffer her son dying and not growing old. "The thing
              is," she said, "I know I am not going to grow old and it pains me. I
              was living for another time." "What is the time you have?" I
              asked. "Two months," she said. "How do you want to be in that
              time?" I asked. "Maybe just be really angry and bitter," she
              said. "Okay, that's possible," I said. She looked at me surprised,
              and said "What did you say? Did you say that is possible?"
              "Yes" I said. "Wow," she said. You are the first person to
              say that. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Everyone is always trying to tell me they are going to find a
              cure and to cheer up. Everyone is so f--cking uncomfortable with me. The truth
              is I don't want to do that stewing in misery. I want to live these days
              differently." "That's also possible," I said. And for the first
              time, her face softened and almost appeared to smile.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>She reminds me we need to be heard and that is the heart of <em>Awake at the
              Bedside</em>. It is not called <em>How I am Comfortable at the Bedside</em>. We can be awake to
              all the joys and sorrows and be forever changed. This is why I am so honored to
              be able to live this life.<br> <br> <strong>NDP</strong>:
              What has been your biggest challenge with people in the medical community
              concerning end-of-life issues?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>KPE</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>:The biggest
              challenge is the treatment of people as people. This is not a new event. It
              turns out that the oldest stories in the world are about people treating each
              other in challenging ways. Of course, we also live in a time when we send the
              sick to hospitals, the elderly to nursing homes and the dying to hospices. Old
              age, sickness and death are such powerful teachers. So, the book and our
              organization are about doing the radical pivot--turning towards what we fear
              and being a source of compassion and wisdom in the places of great suffering.
              We will all get older, get sick and die. The historical Buddha reminds us that
              our actions are our only true belongings. So, we have the unique opportunity to
              engage through study, care and meditation. We have the opportunity to plunge
              fully into life. What will you do with your days? This is the great question to
              live with each day.</span></p>
