              <h1>This moment is your teacher</h1>
              <h2>Zen Master Wu Bong</h2>
              <hr>
              <p><em>Excerpted from a talk on March 26, 1989</em></p>
              <p>As I said at the beginning of the talk, wherever we are, whatever
               we are doing, that is our teacher. Most important is our "don't know" 
              mind. When we approach a teacher for help, it is the same. More than 
              just her or his sharp and penetrating words, our own sincerity and 
              openness is most important.</p>
              <p>There is a wonderful story about a Korean monk who was very 
              stupid. He was so stupid that he couldn't understand any dharma talks, 
              so he eventually stopped going to them. He couldn't understand kong-ans,
               so he stopped going to interviews. He had a hard time even sitting Zen,
               so he felt he was too stupid and didn't sit. So all he did in the 
              temple was working practice, because he could not do anything else.</p>
              <p>One day, he went to his teacher and said, "Master, I'm too stupid
               for anything. Can you help me in some way, tell me something that will 
              help my practice?" So his teacher gave him a phrase as a hwadu, a 
              kong-an, to work with: "mind is Buddha." But because this monk was so 
              dull, he misheard it. What he heard was, "grass shoe is Buddha," which 
              sounds very similar in Korean.</p>
              <p>The monk was very confused when he left the Zen master. He 
              thought, "what a difficult kong-an! How can I ever understand it?" Every
               day he did his working practice, and this question was alive for him 
              all the time, very strong: "what is the meaning of 'grass shoe is 
              Buddha'?"</p>
              <p>Then one day he stumbled against a rock, and his shoe flew off. 
              In those days, shoes were indeed made of grass or straw. When his shoe 
              flew off, it landed on the ground and broke. At this, the monk attained 
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>He was so happy that he rushed to the Zen master yelling, "I 
              understand, I understand." The Zen master asked, "what do you 
              understand?" The monk took his shoe, hit the Zen master with it, and 
              said,
              "my shoe is broken." The Zen master was very happy.</p>
              <p>So, we do not need something special, some great teaching from 
              someone. "Grass shoe is Buddha" is not exactly a very wise statement. 
              What we need to do is cultivate the question, the fire, that we all have
               within, and not let it go out. All the wisdom is already there.</p>
              <p>In this moment, it's right in front of us. Wherever we are, whatever we are doing, that's our teacher.</p>
