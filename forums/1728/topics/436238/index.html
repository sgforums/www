              <p>One of the most important reformation in the Mahayana Buddhism of the 20th century is that of pursuing Humanistic Buddhism (äººé–“ä½›æ•™ï¼‰ or socially engaged Buddhism (as put forth by Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Han) or even "Pureland" in the Human world. This involves doing good deeds not just to gain merits but also to dedicate all the good merits accumulated to all sentient beings as a way to relieve sufferings in the human world. In this way, this is making Buddhism relevant to our daily life.</p>
              <p>Wisdom is no doubt the higher level of practice and requires years to studying and realization. But a general beginner in Buddhism should start off by doing good (good mind, actions, words) , avoid evil and purify oneself (mind, actions and words) as part of their daily practice in life. Not only can one change oneself to grow one's own bodhicitta, doing good and seeing the good merits come allow one to see how one's own karma can change, it's an internal realization that's fruitful to one's spiritual practice.  </p>
              <p>Wisdom is the ultimate high level of practice. It requires one to study more indepth, to delve into sutra, listen to dharma talk, realization in life and meditation etc.</p>

              <p>Somewhat a wall of text, but this article by Bikkhu Bodhi is helpful for understanding how accumulation of merit is important 
                          for "propelling" one towards enlightenment.   It however reminds us that there 
                          is no intrinsic sanctity in rites, rituals and acts of charity in and of
                           themselves, but that merit-making is for channeling the current of 
                          mental activity in a spiritually beneficial
                           direction.</p>
              <p>From: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel259.html#merit">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel259.html#merit</a></p>
              <h1>Merit and Spiritual Growth  <a id="merit" class="back    " title="Go to top of page" name="merit" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel259.html#top"> </a></h1>
              <p>The performance of deeds of merit forms one of the most essential 
                          elements of Buddhist practice. Its various modes provide in their 
                          totality a compendium of applied Buddhism, showing Buddhism not as a 
                          system of ideas but as a complete way of life. Buddhist popular belief 
                          has often emphasized merit as a productive source of worldly blessings —
                           of health, wealth, long life, beauty and friends. As a result of this 
                          emphasis, meritorious activity has come to be conceived rather in terms 
                          of a financial investment, as a religious business venture yielding 
                          returns to the satisfaction of the agent's mundane desires. While such a
                           conception no doubt contains an element of truth, its popularization 
                          has tended to eclipse the more important function merit plays in the 
                          context of Buddhist practice. Seen in correct perspective, merit is an 
                          essential ingredient in the harmony and completeness of the spiritual 
                          life, a means of self-cultivation, and an indispensable stepping-stone 
                          to spiritual progress.</p>
              <p>The accumulation of a "stock of merit" is a primary requisite for 
                          acquiring all the fruits of the Buddhist religious life, from a pleasant
                           abiding here and now to a favorable rebirth in the life to come, from 
                          the initial stages of meditative progress to the realization of the 
                          states of sanctity that come as the fruits of entering upon the noble 
                          path. The highest fruition of merit is identical with the culmination of
                           the Buddhist holy life itself — that is, emancipation from the shackles
                           of samsaric existence and the realization of Nibbana, the unconditioned
                           state beyond the insubstantial phenomena of the world. The mere piling 
                          up of merit, to be sure, is not in itself sufficient to guarantee the 
                          attainment of this goal. Merit is only one requisite, and it must be 
                          balanced by its counterpart to secure the breakthrough from bondage to 
                          final freedom. The counterpart of merit is knowledge <em>(ñana),</em> the direct confrontation with the basic truths of existence through the eye of intuitive wisdom.</p>
              <p>Merit and knowledge together constitute the two sets of equipment the
                           spiritual aspirant requires in the quest for deliverance, the equipment
                           of merit <em>(puññasambhara)</em> and the equipment of knowledge <em>(ñanasambhara),</em> respectively. Each set of equipment has its own contribution to make to
                           the fulfillment of the spiritual life. The equipment of merit 
                          facilitates progress in the course of samsaric wandering: it brings a 
                          favorable rebirth, the encounter with good friends to guide one's 
                          footsteps along the path, the meeting with opportunities for spiritual 
                          growth, the flowering of the lofty qualities of character, and the 
                          maturation of the spiritual faculties required for the higher 
                          attainments. The equipment of knowledge brings the factor directly 
                          necessary for cutting the bonds of samsaric existence: the penetration 
                          of truth, enlightenment, the undistorted comprehension of the nature of 
                          actuality.</p>
              <p>Either set of equipment, functioning in isolation, is insufficient to
                           the attainment of the goal; either pursued alone leads to a deviant, 
                          one-sided development that departs from the straight path to deliverance
                           taught by the Buddha. Merit without knowledge produces pleasant fruit 
                          and a blissful rebirth, but cannot issue in the transcendence of the 
                          mundane order and entrance upon the supramundane path. And knowledge 
                          without the factors of merit deteriorates into dry intellectualism, mere
                           erudition or scholasticism, impotent when confronted with the task of 
                          grasping a truth outside the pale of intellection. But when they 
                          function together in unison in the life of the aspirant, the two sets of
                           equipment acquire a potency capable of propelling him to the heights of
                           realization. When each set of equipment complements the other, polishes
                           the other, and perfects the other, then they undergo a graduated course
                           of mutual purification culminating at the crest in the twin endowments 
                          of the Emancipated One — in that clear knowledge <em>(vijja)</em> and flawless conduct <em>(carana)</em> which make him, in the words of the Buddha, "supreme among gods and humans."</p>
              <p>But while merit and knowledge thus occupy coordinate positions, it is
                           merit that claims priority from the standpoint of spiritual dynamics. 
                          The reason is that works of merit come first in the process of inner 
                          growth. If knowledge be the flower that gives birth to the fruit of 
                          liberation, and faith <em>(saddha)</em> the seed out of which the flower 
                          unfolds, then merit is the soil, water and fertilizer all in one — the 
                          indispensable nutriment for every stage of growth. Merit paves the way 
                          for knowledge, and finds in knowledge the sanction for its own claim to a
                           place in the system of Buddhist training.</p>
              <p>The reason for this particular sequential structure is closely linked
                           to the Buddhist conception of noetic realization. From the Buddhist 
                          standpoint the comprehension of spiritual truth is not a matter of mere 
                          intellectual cogitation but of existential actualization. That is, it is
                           a matter of grasping with our whole being the truth towards which we 
                          aspire, and of inwardly appropriating that truth in a manner so total 
                          and complete that our being becomes transformed into a very reflex and 
                          effusion of the truth upon which we stand. The understanding of truth in
                           the context of the spiritual life, in other words, is no affair of 
                          accumulating bits and pieces of information publicly accessible and 
                          subjectively indifferent; it is, rather, a process of uncovering the 
                          deepest truths about ourselves and about the world, and of working the 
                          understanding that emerges into the entire complex of the inner life. 
                          Hence the use of the words "actualization" and "realization," which 
                          bring into the open the ontological backdrop underlying the noetic 
                          process.</p>
              <p>In order to grasp truth in this totalistic manner at any particular 
                          stage of spiritual development, the tenor of our inner being must be 
                          raised to a pitch where it is fit for the reception of some new 
                          disclosure of the truth. Wisdom and character, though not identical, are
                           at any rate parallel terms, which in most cases mature in a delicately 
                          balanced ratio. We can grasp only what we are fit to grasp, and our 
                          fitness is largely a function of our character. The existential 
                          comprehension of truth thus becomes a matter of inward worth, of 
                          deservingness, or of merit. The way to effect this inward worthiness is 
                          by the performance of works of merit, not merely outwardly, but backed 
                          by the proper attitudes and disposition of mind. For the capacity to 
                          comprehend truths pertaining to the spiritual order is always 
                          proportional to the store and quality of accumulated merit. The greater 
                          and finer the merit, the larger and deeper the capacity for 
                          understanding. This principle holds at each level of maturation in the 
                          ascent towards full realization, and applies with special force to the 
                          comprehension of ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>Ultimate truth, in the Buddha's Teaching, is Nibbana, the unconditioned element <em>(asankhata dhatu),</em> and realization of ultimate truth the realization of Nibbana. Nibbana 
                          is the perfection of purity: the destruction of all passions, the 
                          eradication of clinging, the abolition of every impulse towards 
                          self-affirmation. The final thrust to the realization of Nibbana is the 
                          special province of wisdom, since wisdom alone is adequate to the task 
                          of comprehending all conditioned phenomena in their essential nature as 
                          impermanent, suffering and not-self, and of turning away from them to 
                          penetrate the unconditioned, where alone permanent freedom from 
                          suffering is to be found. But that this penetration may take place, our 
                          interior must be made commensurate in purity with the truth it would 
                          grasp, and this requires in the first instance that it be purged of all 
                          those elements obstructive to the florescence of a higher light and 
                          knowledge. The apprehension of Nibbana, this perfect purity secluded 
                          from the dust of passion, is only possible when a corresponding purity 
                          has been set up within ourselves. For only a pure mind can discern, 
                          through the dark mist of ignorance and defilement, the spotless purity 
                          of Nibbana, abiding in absolute solitude beyond the turmoil of the 
                          phenomenal procession.</p>
              <p>The achievement of such a purification of our inward being is the 
                          work of merit. Merit scours the mind of the coarser defilements, 
                          attenuates the grip of the unwholesome roots, and fortifies the 
                          productive power of the wholesome, beneficial states. Through its 
                          cumulative force it provides the foundation for wisdom's final 
                          breakthrough to the unconditioned. It is the fuel, so to speak, for the 
                          ascent of wisdom from the mundane to the supramundane. Just as the 
                          initial stages of a lunar rocket work up the momentum that enables the 
                          uppermost stage to break the gravitational pull of the earth and reach 
                          the moon, so does merit give to the spiritual life that forward thrust 
                          that will propel the wisdom-faculty past the gravitational pull of the 
                          mundane order and permit it to penetrate the transcendental truth.</p>
              <p>The classical Buddhist commentators underscore this preparatory purgative function of merit when they define merit <em>(puñña)</em> etymologically as "that which purges and purifies the mental continuum" <em>(santanam punati visodheti).</em> Merit performs its purgative function in the context of a complex 
                          process involving an agent and object of purification, and a mode of 
                          operation by which the purification takes place. The agent of 
                          purification is the mind itself, in its creative, formative role as the 
                          source and matrix of action. Deeds of merit are, as we have already 
                          seen, instances of wholesome kamma, and kamma ultimately reduces to 
                          volition. Therefore, at the fundamental level of analysis, a deed of 
                          merit consists in a volition, a determinative act of will belonging to 
                          the righteous order <em>(puññabhisankhara).</em> Since volition is a mode 
                          of mental activity, this means that merit turns out, under scrutiny, to 
                          be a mode of mental activity. It is, at the core of the behavior-pattern
                           which serves as its vehicle, a particular application of thought by 
                          which the mind marshalls its components for the achievement of a chosen 
                          end.</p>

              <p>This discovery cautions us against misconstruing the Buddhist
                                      stress on the practice of merit as a call for blind subjection to
                                      rules and rites. The primary instrument behind any act of merit,
                                      from the Buddhist point of view, is the mind. The deed itself in
                                      its physical or vocal dimension serves mainly as an expression of a
                                      corresponding state of consciousness, and without a keen awareness
                                      of the nature and significance of the meritorious deed, the bare
                                      outward act is devoid of purgative value. Even when rules of
                                      conduct are observed, or rituals and worship performed with a view
                                      to the acquisition of merit, the spiritual potency of these
                                      structures derives not from any intrinsic sanctity they might
                                      possess in themselves, but from their effectiveness in channelizing
                                      the current of mental activity in a spiritual beneficial direction.
                                      They function, in effect, as skillful means or expedient devices
                                      for inducing wholesome states of consciousness.</p>
              <p>Mechanical conformity to moral rules, or the performance of
                                      religious duties through unquestioning obedience to established
                                      forms, far from serving as a means to salvation, in the Buddhist
                                      outlook actually constitute obstacles. They are instances of
                                      "clinging to rules and rituals" <em>(silabbataparamasa),</em> the
                                      third of the fetters <em>(samyojana)</em> binding beings to the
                                      wheel of becoming, which must be abandoned in order to enter upon
                                      the path to final deliverance. Even in such relatively external
                                      forms of merit-making as the undertaking of moral precepts and
                                      ceremonial worship, mindfulness and clear comprehension are
                                      essential; much more, then, are they necessary to the predominantly
                                      internal modes of meritorious activity, such as meditation or the
                                      study of the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>The object of the purifying process of merit is again the mind,
                                          only here considered not from the standpoint of its immediacy, as a
                                          creative source of action, but from the standpoint of its duration,
                                          as a continuum <em>(cittasantana).</em> For, looked at from the
                                          temporal point of view, the mind is no stable entity enduring
                                          self-identical through its changing activities; it is, rather, a
                                          serial continuity composed of discrete acts of mentation bound to
                                          one another by exact laws of causal interconnection. Each
                                          thought-unit flashes into being, persists for an extremely brief
                                          moment, and then perishes, passing on to its immediate successor
                                          its storage of recorded impressions. Each individual member of the
                                          series inherits, preserves and transmits, along with its own novel
                                          modifications, the entire content of the series as a whole, which
                                          thus underlies every one of its components. Thence the series
                                          maintains, despite its discontinuous composition, an element of
                                          uniformity that gives to the flow of separate thought-moments the
                                          character of a continuum.</p>
              <p>This sequential current of mentation has been going on,
                                          according to Buddhism, without discernible beginning. Driven
                                          forward from life to life by ignorance and craving, it appears now
                                          in one mode of manifestation, now in another. Embedded in the
                                          mental continuum throughout its beginningless journey is a host of
                                          particularly afflictive and disruptive mental forces known as
                                          <em>kilesas,</em> "defilements." Foremost among them are the three
                                          unwholesome roots — greed, hatred and delusion; from this triad
                                          spring the remaining members of the set, such as pride, opinion,
                                          selfishness, envy, sloth and restlessness. During moments of
                                          passivity the defilements lie dormant at the base of the mental
                                          continuum, as <em>anusaya</em> or latent tendencies. But when,
                                          either through the impact of outer sensory stimuli or their own
                                          subliminal process of growth, they acquire sufficient force, they
                                          surge to the surface of consciousness in the form of obsessions
                                          <em>(pariyutthana).</em> The obsessions pollute the mind with their
                                          toxic flow and rebound upon the deeper levels of consciousness,
                                          reinforcing their roots at the base of the continuum. If they
                                          should gather still additional charge, the defilements may reach
                                          the even more dangerous stage of transgression
                                          <em>(vitikkama),</em> when they erupt as bodily or verbal actions
                                          that violate the fundamental laws of morality and lead to pain and
                                          suffering as their retributive consequence.</p>
              <p>When merit is said to "purge and purify the mental continuum,"
                                          it is so described in reference to its capacity to arrest the
                                          surging tide of the defilements which threatens to sweep the mind
                                          towards the perilous deep of transgressional action. Only wisdom —
                                          the supramundane wisdom of the noble paths — can eradicate the
                                          defilements at the level of latency, which is necessary if the
                                          bonds of existence are to be broken and deliverance attained. But
                                          the practice of merit can contribute much towards attenuating their
                                          obsessive force and establishing a foothold for wisdom to exercise
                                          its liberating function. Wisdom can operate only upon the base of a
                                          purified mind; the accumulation of merit purifies the mind; hence
                                          merit provides the supporting condition for wisdom.</p>
              <p>When the mind is allowed to flow according to its own momentum,
                                          without restraint or control, like a turbulent river it casts up to
                                          the surface — i.e., to the level of active consciousness — the
                                          store of pollutants it harbors at its base: lust, hatred, delusion,
                                          and their derivative defilements. If the defilements are then given
                                          further scope to grow by indulging them, they will wither the
                                          potential for good, darken the beam of awareness, and strangle the
                                          faculty of wisdom until it is reduced to a mere vestige. The
                                          performance of meritorious deeds serves as a means of resisting the
                                          upsurge of defiling states, of replacing them with their wholesome
                                          opposites, and of thereby purifying the mental continuum to an
                                          extent sufficient to supply wisdom with the storage of strength it
                                          requires in the work of abolishing the defilements.</p>

              <p>The effectiveness of merit in purifying the mental continuum stems 
              from the concordance of a number of psychological laws. These laws, 
              which can only be indicated briefly here, together function as the 
              silent groundwork for the efficacy of the entire corpus of Buddhist 
              spiritual practice.</p>
              <p>The first is the law that only one state of consciousness can occur 
              at a time; though seemingly trivial, this law leads to important 
              consequences when taken in conjunction with the rest. The second holds 
              that states of consciousness with mutually opposed ethical qualities 
              cannot coexist. The third stipulates that all the factors of 
              consciousness — feeling, perception, volition and the remaining states 
              included in the "aggregate of mental formations" — must partake of the 
              same ethical quality as the consciousness itself.</p>
              <p>A kammically active state of consciousness is either entirely 
              wholesome, or entirely unwholesome; it cannot (by the second law) be 
              both. Therefore, if a wholesome state is occurring, no unwholesome state
               can simultaneously occur. A wholesome, spiritually beneficial state of 
              consciousness necessarily shuts out every unwholesome, detrimental 
              state, as well as (by the third law) all unwholesome concomitant factors
               of consciousness. So at the moment one is performing an act of merit, 
              the consciousness and volition behind that meritorious deed will 
              automatically preclude an unwholesome consciousness, volition, and the 
              associated defilements. At that moment, at least, the consciousness will
               be pure. And the frequent performance of meritorious acts will, on 
              every occasion, bar out the opportunity for the defilements to arise at 
              the time of their performance.</p>
              <p>Thus the performance of deeds of merit always induces a momentary 
              purification, while the frequent performance of such deeds induces many 
              occasions of momentary purification. But that some more durable result 
              might be achieved an additional principle is necessary. This principle 
              is supplied by the fourth law.</p>
              <p>The fourth law holds that repetition confers strength. Just as the 
              exercise of a particular muscle can transform that muscle from a frail, 
              ineffectual strip of flesh into a dynamo of power and strength, so the 
              repeated exercise of individual mental qualities can remodel them from 
              sleeping soldiers into invincible warriors in the spiritual quest.</p>
              <p>Repetition is the key to the entire process of self-transformation 
              which constitutes the essence of the spiritual life. It is the very 
              grounding that makes self-transformation possible. By force of 
              repetition the fragile, tender shoots of the pure and wholesome 
              qualities — faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom — can 
              blossom into sovereign faculties <em>(indriya)</em> in the struggle for enlightenment, or into indomitable powers <em>(bala)</em> in the battle against the defilements. By repeated resistance to the 
              upsurge of evil and repeated application to the cultivation of the good,
               the demon can become a god and the criminal a saint.</p>
              <p>If repetition provides the key to self-transformation, then volition 
              provides the instrument through which repetition works. Volition acts as
               a vector force upon the mental continuum out of which it emerges, 
              reorienting the continuum according to its own moral tone. Each act of 
              will recedes with its passing into the onward rushing current of 
              mentation and drives the current in its own direction. Wholesome 
              volitions direct the continuum towards the good — towards purity, wisdom
               and ultimate liberation; unwholesome volitions drive it towards the 
              evil — towards defilement, ignorance and inevitable bondage.</p>
              <p>Every occasion of volition modifies the mental life in some way and 
              to some degree, however slight, so that the overall character of an 
              individual at any one time stands as a reflex and revelation of the 
              volitions accumulated in the continuum.</p>
              <p>Since the will propels the entire current of mental life in its own 
              direction, it is the will which must be strengthened by force of 
              repetition. The restructuring of mental life can only take place through
               the reformation of the will by leading it unto wholesome channels. The 
              effective channel for re-orientation of the will is the practice of 
              merit.</p>
              <p>When the will is directed towards the cultivation of merit, it will 
              spontaneously hamper the stream of defilements and bolster the company 
              of noble qualities in the storage of the continuum. Under its gentle 
              tutelage the factors of purity will awaken from their dormant condition 
              and take their place as regular propensities in the personality. A will 
              devoted to the practice of charity will generate kindness and 
              compassion; a will devoted to the observance of the precepts will 
              generate harmlessness, honesty, restraint, truthfulness and sobriety; a 
              will devoted to mental culture will generate calm and insight. Faith, 
              reverence, humility, sympathy, courage and equanimity will come to 
              growth. Consciousness will gain in tranquillity, buoyancy, pliancy, 
              agility and proficiency. And a consciousness made pure by these factors 
              will advance without hindrance through the higher attainments in 
              meditation and wisdom to the realization of Nibbana, the consummation of
               spiritual endeavor.</p>
