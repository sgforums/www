              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Akhilesh Pillalamarri October 29, 2017 The Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Demography and history explain troubled attitudes toward
              Islam in Buddhist-majority Asian regions today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A cursory glance at world news today may suggest that the
              fault-line where Buddhism and Islam meet in Asia is increasingly characterized
              by conflict between the two religions. Of course, in broadest sense, this is
              not true, as religions are made up of numerous individuals and leaders, who are
              generally of differing opinions. Yet, there is an unusually high level of
              tension between Buddhists and Muslims in regions where the two groups share
              space, including Rakhine state in Myanmar, southern Thailand, Sri Lanka, and
              Ladakh, the eastern part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the root of this tension is the fear among Buddhists — not
              completely exaggerated — that Muslims will swamp them demographically. Many
              Buddhists also fear that their countries will lose their culture and become
              Muslim, as had been the case in many parts of modern day Central Asia,
              Xinjiang, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, which were majority Buddhist before the
              arrival of Islam in the 7th-11th centuries. <em>Often,
              the arrival of Islam went hand-in-hand with the destruction of Buddhism.</em> When the Muslim Turkic Qarakhanids captured the Buddhist city of Khotan in
              Xinjiang in 1006 CE, one of their poets penned this verse: “We came down on
              them like a flood/We went out among their cities/We tore down the
              idol-temples/We shat on the Buddha’s head.” In the Islamic world, a destroyer
              of idols came to be known as a but-shikan (Ø¨Øª Ø´Ú©Ù†), a destroyer of but, a
              corruption of the word Buddha, as Buddhism was prevalent in much of what became
              the eastern part of the Islamic world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Unfortunately, this history, and demographics, have lead to
              great fear of Islam among Buddhists, which in turn has led to genocide in
              Myanmar, and violence in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Ladakh. If all Rohingya
              refugees were to be repatriated to Rakhine in Myanmar for example, they would
              outnumber the local Buddhist Rakhine people. And in Ladakh, the Buddhist
              proportion of Leh district fell from 81 to 66 percent over the past three
              decades (relative to Muslims and Hindus). In Ladakh as a whole, which also
              includes Kargil district, Buddhists are 51 percent of the population, and
              Muslims 49 percent, a fact of great concern to the region’s Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Attitudes reported from Burmese Buddhists in a recent New
              York Times piece sum up views commonly held among both hardline monks and the
              lay-population of Myanmar. One monk said of the Rohingya: “They stole our land,
              our food and our water. We will never accept them back.” A Rakhine politician
              said: “All the Bengalis learn in their religious schools is to brutally kill
              and attack… It is impossible to live together in the future.” A local
              administrator elsewhere in Myanmar said, “Kalar [a derogatory term for Muslims
              in Myanmar] are not welcome here because they are violent and they multiply
              like crazy, with so many wives and children.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meanwhile, extremist elements in Myanmar, such as the 969
              Movement, have pledged to work with Buddhist extremists elsewhere, such as in
              Sri Lanka, home to the Bodu Bala Sena, a Buddhist extremist organization that
              lead anti-Muslim riots in that country in 2014. Ladakh was recently the scene
              of communal tensions between Buddhists and Muslims after the marriage of a
              Muslim man and a Buddhist woman, something seen as threatening to the region’s
              demographics. A head lama from a local monastery said, “The Muslims are trying
              to finish us off,” also adding that Buddhist women ought to have many more
              children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism was arguably the world’s largest religion a century
              ago, if one counts everyone who also followed Chinese folk religion, Shinto,
              Muism, and other East Asian religions. In the modern era, Buddhism has been
              particularly vulnerable, however, to both secularism and evangelism from other
              religions. According to a Pew survey, alone among the world’s major religions
              (including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Chinese folk religion), Buddhism
              and its adherents are projected to decline both in terms of raw numbers, and as
              a percentage of the world population. The world Buddhist population is
              projected to fall from 488 million to 486 million people, and from 7 percent to
              5 percent of total share. Christianity and Islam are still growing; in
              particular, the latter will grow from around 23 percent of the global population
              to 30 percent by 2050. Put another way, there will be six times as many Muslims
              as Buddhists by then.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The nature of Buddhism may be related to the issue of the
              religion’s decline: there is a huge gap between the religion’s lay
              practitioners, who have adopted a set of customs associated somewhat with
              Buddhist mythology, and the monastic community, which follows the Buddha’s
              example. While there is an element of elite-popular division in all religions,
              in few other religions is the gap so stark. After all, the community, the
              sangha, founded by the Buddha himself was monastic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">State patronage was also important to the survival of the
              sangha, as in many Buddhist countries, monks beg, do not produce food, and do
              not engage in warfare. When a territory was conquered by non-Buddhist powers,
              or Buddhism was patronized less by certain rulers, the sangha inevitably
              declined and the lay people merged their folk customs into whatever other
              religions were dominant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By the Middle Ages, after a thousand years of growth,
              Buddhism was sidelined as the elite religion throughout much of its former
              dominion, except in mainland Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. Neo-Confucianism and
              Shinto prevailed in East Asia, partially due to state policies. In 845 CE,
              China’s Tang Dynasty launched the great anti-Buddhist persecution, stimulated
              in part by the fact that too many people were entering tax-free monasteries.
              Neo-Confucianism thereafter became the dominant philosophy among the elite in
              China; a similar process unfolded in Korea with the rise of the Joseon Dynasty
              in 1392, and in Japan, where the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1868) promoted
              Neo-Confucianism and Shinto at the expense of Buddhism, mostly for political
              reasons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism also all but vanished in South Asia, as folk Buddhism
              was reabsorbed into Hinduism, with the Buddha being acknowledged as an avatar
              of the god Vishnu. Hinduism was simultaneously less dependent on state
              promotion for its survival, and more attuned with the ritual and political
              needs of kingship, as well as being more aligned with folk beliefs. The
              destruction of the great Buddhist university at Nalanda in 1193 by Muslim
              Turkic invaders sealed its fate. Throughout South Asia, after the establishment
              of Muslim dynasties, conversion to Islam occurred fastest in the heavily
              Buddhist regions of Afghanistan, Swat, Sindh, western Punjab, and eastern
              Bengal, compared to other areas where Hinduism was more prevalent.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This history informs Buddhist attitudes toward Islam,
              regardless of the actual doctrines of Buddhism, or Islam for that matter.
              History and demographics have created a sense of siege that is unlikely to be
              resolved soon. Unfortunately, ideas such as education, development, spreading
              awareness of family planning, or autonomous regions for Muslim minorities are
              taking a back seat to hysteria throughout numerous Buddhist-majority countries
              with Muslim-minorities.</span></p>
