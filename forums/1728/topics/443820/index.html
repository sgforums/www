              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">People often bring up another Zen story about
              seeing that the mountains are not mountains, seeing that the rivers are not
              rivers, and seeing the mountains and seeing the rivers; so I might as well
              include a discussion of it here. This story comes from a statement given in a
              formal lecture by Zen Master Wei Cheng, who said, “Thirty years ago, before I
              had studied Zen, I saw the mountains were mountains and the rivers were rivers.
              Later, when I had personally seen a Zen teacher and had attained initiatory experience,
              I saw that the mountains are not mountains and the rivers are not rivers. But
              now that I had attained peace, I see the mountains simply as mountains, and see
              the rivers simply as rivers. Tell me, everyone, are these three views the same
              or different? If anyone can distinguish the black from the white, I will admit
              that you have seen me in person.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Because this story is part of traditional Zen
              lore, students of later generations, including people all over the world today,
              have taken it as a handle on Zen study. Some people say it represents the
              so-called three barriers of Zen. Others say that it is necessary to reach the
              point at which you see that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not
              rivers, and then turn around again to arrive at seeing mountains as mountains
              and rivers as rivers again; this they identify as the realm of great
              penetration and great enlightenment. In reality, these explanations are
              ultimately just impressionistic talk; these views may seem to be correct, but
              they are not.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">First, it is necessary to understand clearly
              that this talk by Zen Master Wei-cheng is about his own personal experience in
              practice. When it comes to the matter of whether Master Wei-cheng had actually
              attained great penetration and great enlightenment himself, you first of all
              cannot invent some fabrication and make up a subjective determination of the
              issue on his behalf.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">His first stage, where he says he saw mountains
              as mountains and rivers as rivers, of course, represents the state of anyone
              before studying the Zen Way. Everyone is like this, seeing mountains, rivers,
              and earth, the various humans and natural environments in the physical world
              clearly and distinctly; this does not require any special interpretation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">For the second stage, where he said he saw
              mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers, it is one hundred
              percent certain that this is a state achieved through the actual application of
              meditative concentration work. If one has genuinely practiced meditative
              concentration work and the method and process of cultivation realization, and
              if one’s inner and outer physical and mental application and conduct have not
              gone astray in any way, then eventually this should cause the physical and
              mental temperament and constitution to undergo a great change. The eyes will be
              full of spiritual light, the spirit will solidify, the energy will mass, and
              the material world seen by the eyes, the mountains, rivers, land, and so on
              will naturally seem as though one is in a waking dream, like images of light
              reflected in water. One will feel that everything in this material world is all
              dreamlike, illusory existence, totally unreal; and one will also see people as
              like mechanical robots.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Many people who reach this stage, whether they
              are studying Zen or practicing Taoism, thereupon assume it is the true Way, but
              really this sort of state has nothing to do with the Way. This happens because
              of long immersion of the body and mind in quiet concentration, resulting in
              diminution of psychological and biological instincts, and repletion with vital
              energy that causes the brain and nervous system to undergo a change resembling
              electrical charging, so one sees the phenomena before one as ephemeral and has
              no feeling of reality. This is similar to the scattering of vision experienced
              when the body is depleted and weakened after a serious illness, or when one is
              about to die. Of course, this phenomenon associated with sickness and dying
              does not itself represent the state of people practicing meditative
              concentration who see mountains and rivers as not being mountains and rivers:
              it is just a way of making a comparison. One is due to illness or dying; one
              arises from being filled with the living power of life; so they are not exactly
              the same.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">But you must not forget that this kind of
              phenomenon is just a different sensation of the biological organs; what enables
              you to produce such feelings and cognition is still the function of your
              consciousness and thought. If you assume that seeing mountains as not being
              mountains and seeing rivers as not being rivers is a good phenomenon reflecting
              practice of Zen or Tao, that is still mediocre; if so, then you might as well
              take a hallucinogenic pill or a moderate dose of tranquilizers, for would that
              not cause a similar marvel? Can you say this is the Way?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">So many people who study Zen and lecture on Zen
              today, both in China and the rest of the world, often bring up this issue. I
              cannot but add some explanation to the matter so that practitioners avoid
              making the mistake of entering into byways and ruining the useful physical
              body.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Coming to Zen Master Wei-cheng’s third stage of
              seeing the mountains as mountains again and seeing the rivers as rivers again
              represents a Zen state where he had advanced a step farther, so he said of himself
              that he had attained peace. If you just go by these remarks and assume that
              this is great penetration and great enlightenment, then you might as well relax
              and go to sleep, waking up to see that mountains are still mountains and rivers
              are still rivers. Would this not be more direct and enjoyable?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Therefore it is really not easy at all to read
              the classics and stories of Zen; we should not by any means become confused by
              fragmentary interpretations. It is essential to seek personal experience of
              realization; only then do you know the ultimate. If we were to take this one
              story, which only points to a process of practice, and augment it so that it
              would be perfectly complete, we would have to cite the saying of T’ang dynasty
              Zen Master Nan-ch’uan, “When people today see this flower, it is like a dream,”
              to be able to approach the final Zen work of letting go. In sum, this story
              only refers to the mental work involved in Zen; it is not completely relevant
              to the insight of enlightenment.</p>

              <p>good maps of enlightenment are truly rare.</p>
              <p>even the original text of zen ten oxherding pictures also only describe from i amness to non-dual no mind. anatta realization and shunyata is not described. however more recently i have seen one zen master's commentary on that ninth stage which clearly shows his anatta insight. know however that the interpretations of the map vary vastly according to who is commenting.</p>
              <p>buddha's four stages to arhant is good because the first stage already eliminate self view which means anatta insight is necessary. the fetter model also shows progress in terms of fetter elimination, something that only the bhumi models talk about apart from it.</p>
              <p>bhumi model also quite good because first stage already realize twofold emptiness, it also talks about fetters removed and qualities attained on the path to buddhahood.</p>
              <p>i also like mahamudra four yogas map since mahamudra place much emphasis on sunyata. also it  seems dakpo tashi namgyal is truly clear experientially about anatta and shunyata</p>
