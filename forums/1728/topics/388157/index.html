              family and friends!<br><br>It is of importance for one to pay respect to their 
              ancestors or<br>deceased loved ones before the Chinese Lunar New Year. With this 
              in<br>mind, our centre has arranged the Chenrezig Chang Chog Puja on 
              30th<br>January 2010 (Saturday).<br><br>30/01 10am - 12pm and 2pm - 
              5pm<br>Chenrezig Chang Chog Puja &amp; Smoke Offering<br><br>Vajrakilaya Gutor 
              is a ritual for pacifying negativities and<br>eliminating obstacles of the 
              current year for a smooth new year ahead.<br><br>The ritual will be performed 
              according to the Terma text of Terton<br>Ratna Lingpa. During the ritual, there 
              will be prayer sessions with<br>tsok offerings.  The Lamas will make a large 
              Torma (in the form of<br>Vajrakilaya) together with 46 retinue Tormas 
              representing various<br>sacred hand emblems for this particular event.<br><br>At 
              the end of the 3 days ritual, the Tormas will be burnt, symbolizing<br>the 
              purification of our obstacles and negativities.  The schedule of<br>this ritual 
              is set out as follows: -<br><br>10/02 &amp; 11/02<br><br>10am - 12pm 
               Vajrakilaya Gutor<br>2pm - 5pm    Vajrakilaya Gutor &amp;   Mahakala 
              Puja<br>8pm - 10pm   Vajrakilaya Puja<br><br>13/02<br>10.00am - 12.00pm Amitayus 
              Long Life prayers and Lüd Tangwa<br>1.00pm - 3.30pm   Amitayus Long Life prayers 
              and Lüd Tangwa<br><br> Amitayus Buddha (the Buddha of long life, merits and 
              wisdom) is<br>considered the Sambhogakaya aspect of the widely known 
              Amitabha<br>Buddha.  The main practice of Amitayus is to prolong or extend 
              one's<br>lifespan.  Longevity is seen as a contributing condition that 
              will<br>allow us more time and opportunity to practice the Dharma so that 
              we<br>can fulfill our true human potential - the achievement of 
              ultimate<br>happiness. It is therefore very important to do the Amitayus 
              Long-life<br>practice.<br><br>The ritual of Lüd Tangwa is performed to eradicate 
              untimely death due<br>to obstacles caused by evil spirits &amp; other 
              negativities.<br><br>During this ritual, participants will place their cut 
              nails, hair,<br>unwashed worn clothing, len-chag (a type of mold used for 
              rubbing on<br>unwell body parts) into a receptacle (Lüd) containing a figurine 
              of a<br>human being. The figurine actually represents the obstacles 
              and<br>negativities of participants, just like the various substances that 
              we<br>place into the Lüd.  Other offerings like food and etc are also 
              placed<br>into the Lüd, with the aim of pacifying the evil spirits and 
              other<br>negativities.<br><br>Traditionally, at the end of this ritual, the Lüd 
              will be thrown at<br>crossroads, but due to legal constraints here, the Lüd will 
              be burnt<br>or sent away instead, thus eliminating all causes of untimely 
              death.<br><br>Sakyamuni Puja and Khatag Offering<br>13th February at 
              10.30pm<br><br>On the eve of the Tibetan New Year, 13th February at 10.30pm, 
              our<br>center will conduct the Sakyamuni prayers followed by a session 
              of<br>khatag (Tibetan silk scarves) offerings to the portrait of His<br>Holiness 
              Penor Rinpoche (the 11th Throne Holder of Palyul Lineage) and<br>His Holiness 
              Karma Kuchen Rinpoche (the 12th Throne Holder of 
              Palyul<br>Lineage).<br><br>Twenty One Dzambala Puja<br>14th February at 
              11.00am<br><br> In order to welcome an auspicious new year that bring 
              better<br>achievement and prosperity to all, our centre will conduct the 
              Twenty<br>One Dzambala Puja on 14th February at 11.00am.<br><br>On this day, 
              devotees may bring their treasure vases and da dhar (the<br>5 colors cloth with 
              ceremonial arrow) that were previously acquired<br>from our centre for blessing. 
              Devotees are encourage to light a lamp<br>on the 1st day of the New Year to 
              offer to the Buddha to pray for a<br>wonderful year ahead.<br><br>Gya Nag Kag 
              Dok Puja<br>21st February 2010 from 10am - 12pm<br><br>Gya Nag Kag Dok Puja is 
              done for clearing obstacles in relation with<br>one's life for specific age of 
              the year, like the age of 13, 25, 37<br>and so forth for every twelve years, 
              where it is called "kag" in<br>Tibetan. This is explained according to 
              astrological calculation in<br>the Tibetan tradition.<br><br>The benefits of 
              this puja helps to clear one's obstacles in general<br>and even specific way. It 
              helps to smooth one's activity, obstacles<br>get reversed and help to prevent 
              one's from sickness. Normally things<br>will be better for oneself during the 
              year after doing the Gya Nag Kag<br>Dok Puja.<br><br>Pot Luck Vegetarian 
              Lunch<br>21st February 2010 @ 12pm<br>All devotees to gather together during the 
              New Year for a POT LUCK<br>vegetarian lunch on on  21st February 2010 @ 
              12pm<br><br>Vajrasattva Puja &amp; Dedication Prayer<br>Requesting the Swift 
              Rebirth of  H.H. Penor Rinpoche<br>28/02 10.00am - 12.00pm<br><br> The first 
              month of the Tibetan calendar is known as "the multiplying<br>of the blessings 
              month."  During the life of Shakyamuni, many people<br>asked him to perform 
              miracles to prove his enlightenment. He ignored<br>their requests and moved from 
              town to town giving teachings. Finally,<br>when he taught in Shravasti, the 
              people beseeched the King to order<br>Shakyamuni to hold a contest of spiritual 
              or miraculous feats to prove<br>his greatness. The Buddha agreed and as it so 
              happened the first day<br>he began these demonstrations was the first day of 
              Losar till the last<br>day, which falls on the full moon.<br><br>This auspicious 
              period is also known as Chotrul Duchen. Whatever good<br>deeds one performs or 
              merits one accumulates during this period, those<br>actions will be multiplied 
              by 100,000 times.<br><br>On this auspicious period, 14th to 28th Feb 2010, we'll 
              like to<br>request all devotees to join us in the accumulation of H.H. 
              Penor<br>Rinpoche Swift Rebirth Prayer (short version). Devotees may do 
              the<br>accumulation in their home from 14th to 27th February and on 
              28th<br>February 2010, our centre will conduct a Vajrasattva Puja 
              together<br>with dedication prayer requesting the swift rebirth of H.H. 
              Penor<br>Rinpoche.<br></div>
