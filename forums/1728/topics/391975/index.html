              <p>First of all there is no objective reality to thoughts, vision of 
                                                                  tree, etc. Like David Carse said, <em>what all this is is All That Is, 
                                                                  pure Being Consciousness Bliss Outpouring; it is your perception of it

                                                                  obviously is not objective like a 'thing' existing 'outside' separate

                                                                   make a sound?</strong>"<br> <br> In actuality no sound, no thought, no perception, is actually an 
                                                                  objective reality. They are only Mind, or Awareness, they do not exist 
                                                                  outside. There is no objectively existing tree or a thought. The notion 
                                                                  of sensations and perceptions having objectivity is really just an 
                                                                  illusory mental construct. Seeing through this mental construct, one 
                                                                  dissolves everything into just one whole field of experiential reality. 
                                                                  The self-manifestations commonly known as 'objects' aren't really 'outer
                                                                   objects' but are rather perceptions arising and vanishing momentarily 
                                                                  in/as this One Mind, so that cannot form an identity of sorts. Since there 
                                                                  is no objective reality to begin with, Awareness cannot be  identified 
                                                                  with any objects. However one who experiences One Mind is also different
                                                                   from the I AM stage since the One Mind is not purely Subjective Reality
                                                                   like a Subject behind all things, rather one experiences non-dual with 
                                                                  everything perceived/experienced, one whole experiential field in which 
                                                                  subject and object are inseparably incorporated. There is no more sense of 'distance' between awareness and objects, 
                                          perceiver and perceived, for the very substance of all 
                                          sensations/perceptions IS Awareness. Awareness is the very substance of the entire
                                           experiential field, not an observer observing it. There is no Awareness inside and objects outside, there is just Oneness 
                                      appearing as sights, sounds, thoughts, etc.<br> <br> At this stage it's seen nothing exists outside of or apart from 
                  Mind/Awareness, so all is just manifestation of the One Mind and is none
                   other than It, so you dissolve all dharmas (notions of objectivity) 
                  into One Mind. Many Advaitins do eventually reach this stage.<br> <br> So the first step is seeing the falsity of the division between Mind and
                                                                    phenomena, giving rise to non-dual insight or One Mind. However, there
                                                                   will still be some remaining notions of the One Mind as something 
                                                                  permanent and independent. There must be insight into 'how' Mind and 
                                                                  phenomena actually co-arise - there isn't a sense of Mind as a Source, 
                                                                  and phenomena arising out of, or within, or being part of, this One 
                                                                  Mind. Phenomena actually has no beginning and end, and therefore we 
                                                                  cannot say phenomena began and originated or ended from/within a

                                                                  on notion of time, an illusory construct. <br> <br> The notion of One Mind as permanent as opposed to things beginning and 
                                                                  ending in time, the notion of Mind being the source of appearances 
                                                                  coming and going within this One Source, are all false views, and are 
                                                                  all the views of inherency. Time, beginning, end, and an origin/Source, 
                                                                  etc are all false views. One must see all these are just more illusory 
                                                                  mental constructs in the same way as 'objectivity' is, there must be an

                                                                  the 'source of phenomena', then we realise there is just phenomena, 
                                                                  sensations and perceptions which are all 'mind', but without an

                                                                  There is just mind, but not a permanent independent mind/source, but

                                                                  insight. At first there will be inherent view of Awareness as the

                                                                   already so', or in Dzogchen where the term 'self-liberation' 
                                                                  originated, 'spontaneously self-perfected' -- always already, all 
                                                                  arising are by nature luminous and empty, non-dual, anatta, empty, but 
                                                                  we mistaken it as dualistic and inherent. It is the deeply rooted wrong 
                                                                  view that shapes and distorts experience that causes all problems.</p>
              <p>So at the moment when you see that all arising are by nature non-dual 
                                                          and empty, whatever is experienced: sounds, thoughts, sensations, 
                                                          everything just self-liberates on its own accord. Phenomena are always 
                                                          already arising and subsiding, but once self-liberation is experienced, 
                                                          phenomena arise and subside like drawing on pond and leaves no traces, 
                                                          there is no grasping. Best part is that NO EFFORT is required to 
                                                          disassociate from phenomena (when there is no source behind, what is there to dis-associate?) or maintain any state in order to liberate, 
                                                          the only problem is our inherent and dualistic views. But if we see with
                                                           our entire body/mind/soul that all sensations and phenomena are by 
                                                          nature luminous and empty, they spontaneously self-liberate 
                                                          effortlessly. But if we view them dualistically and inherently, that is 
                                                          bondage. In Thusness words, "it is not negative feelings is already 
                                                          liberated... all sort of nonsense". And it is not that there is nothing 
                                                          to do as in the case of Advaita Vedanta. They missed the importance of 
                                                          dissolving the views and how it relates to true liberation. In Buddhism 
                                                          one must see how ignorance is the cause of suffering and how wrong views
                                                           shape our experience. It is the wrong view that causes psychological 
                                                          and spiritual pain, and at any moment there is wrong view, you will 
                                                          experience suffering. Practice is thus dynamic to see such tendencies 
                                                          arise moment to moment. Yet even after liberation, sour is still sour, 
                                                          pain is still pain, whatever arise according to conditions cannot be 
                                                          denied, yet simultaneously there is no suffering.<br> <br> And as Thusness wrote before... <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Zen%20Patriarch%20Bodhidharma">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.c...%20Bodhidharma</a><br> <br> <em>It is important to know that mind is itself liberation.

It can be quite misleading.</em><br> <br> Anyway this post is a good read and is related, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/11/reflection-and-presence-dialectic-of.html">Reflection  and Presence: The Dialectic of Awakening</a></p>

              <div style="font-style: italic;">S9: No, what else are phenomena then, besides thoughts? Don’t say Awareness, please, as we both agree that there is ‘Constant Awareness,’ but sometimes Awareness is without illusions, illusion being described as wrongful view/or wrong perspective.<br><br>When we think that Awareness is being thought, what we are saying is that Awareness cannot be without thoughts. Any advanced meditator will tell you, in a New York minute, that this simply isn’t the case. Granted thoughts cannot be without Awareness, but this is because Awareness lends temporary existence to these thoughts, not the other way around. Can you see that they are not equal in this way? Thoughts are pure imagination, just as dreams are.</div>

              <p>I think it is better to approach this way:</p>
              <p>Non-conceptual thought VS conceptual thought instead of  Awareness VS Thoughts.</p>
              <p>If you see it is “Awareness Vs Thoughts”, then it is dualistic and inherent view.  If you see it as non-conceptual thought, then eventually you will realize both non-conceptual and conceptual thoughst share the same luminous essence and empty nature.  Non-conceptual thought is non-verbal and direct.  It appears still and with the tendency to reify it is often mistaken as ‘Unchanging Witness’. </p>
              <p>Therefore in your experience of the “I AMness”, I advise you to understand this experience from the perspective of “direct and non-conceptual aspect of perception” and how by being “direct and non-conceptual” creates that sort of ‘certain, unshakable and undeniable’ confidence.  That is, if a practitioner is fully authenticated from moment to moment the arising and passing phenomena, the practitioner will always have this sensation of ‘certain and unshaken’ confidence. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It requires a practitioner to be sufficiently clear about the cause of ‘separation’ so that the perceptual knot that creates the ‘division’ is thoroughly seen through.  At this phase, non-dual becomes quite effortless.  The three following articles that you posted in your blog are all about the thorough insights of seeing through the illusionary division created by mental constructs.  They are all very well written.  It is worth revisiting these articles.<br></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Of all the 3 articles, I like Joan’s article Body/No-body best.  Do not simply go through the motion of reading, read with a reverent heart.  Though a simple article but is not any less insightful than those written by well-known masters, it has all the answers and pointers you need. :)<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Next, there are several points you made that is related to the deconstruction of mental objects but you should also note that there exist a predictable relationship between the 'mental object to be de-constructed' and 'the experiences and realizations'.  For example “The Teachings of Atmananda and the Direct Path” will, more often than not lead a practitioner to the realization of One Mind whereas the article from Joan will lead one to the experiential insight of No-Mind.  As a general guideline,<br></span>

              <p>I want to say that I v highly recommend the book "Standing As Awareness: The Direct Path" by Greg Goode to forummers here.<br> <br> I just read the first 34 pages of the book today, it is a truly good 
                          guide for the practitioner to investigate. One of the clearest and most 
                          practical Advaita books I've read yet.<br> <br> I actually bought the e-book years ago, but just got the hardcopy 
                          because the newly published edition included an additional 3 chapters at
                           the front. The 3 chapters definitely made it worth the re-purchase.</p>
              <p>The first 3 chapters is a guide for the practitioner to investigate their own direct experience to realise the Witness, see through the illusion of objectivity, and finally the collapse of the Witness. Very well written and very good guide. It is longer and more detailed than the article given in the link.</p>
              <p>The rest of the chapters are also very well written.</p>
              <p>It has 10 customer reviews at Amazon the past several months, all of which gave the book 5 stars. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Standing-as-Awareness-Greg-Goode/dp/0956309151">http://www.amazon.com/Standing-as-Awareness-Greg-Goode/dp/0956309151</a></p>

              <p>There are a lot of good instructions and practical experiments which I find very helpful, and I'm just going to quote one (among others which are just as good!) - in fact I'm not going to quote the experiment itself, just 'the results' that are discovered through the experiment.</p>
              <p>2 page excerpt:</p>
              <p><strong>What is realized in this experiment?</strong></p>
              <p>You realize this - through a series of stages, the cup you had earlier thought to be an independent physical object is actually nothing other than awareness itself. The stages can be seen as follows:</p>
              <p><strong>1. The cup is not separate from form. </strong>Visually, you experience colors and forms. But vision does not directly pick up anything beyond that. It can be transformational and perhaps thrilling to realize how much actually does <em>not </em>appear to direct visual experience. You do not directly experience any independence of the cup. In other words, vision itself does not communicate anything like "cup that exists whether you see it or not." In fact you do not directly experience independence or separation at all.</p>
              <p>You do not actually experience a <em>cup </em>apart from the forms (colors and shapes) that are your direct experience at this moment. You do not experience these colors and shapes pointing outside of themselves to a true, physical cup lying beyond. You have no way of getting between these visual forms and a "real" cup so as to be able to compare the colors to the cup. None of that is given in your direct experience. The colors and shapes directly given in vision do not communicate that it they are "about" the cup or that they "refer to" the cup or that they are "caused by" the cup. <em>Aboutness, reference </em>and <em>causation </em>are not part of your direct experience. Sure, there are intellectual theories about these abstract things, but they are not seen or given in your direct visual experience. So there is no cup given in direct experience.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Form is not separate from seeing. </strong>Next, you come to realize that you do not experience <em>form </em>apart from the faculty of <em>seeing. </em>You cannot separate form from seeing, even in imagination. You cannot get between seeing and form in order to make a comparison. You have no experience of pre-existing forms, some which happen to be seen, and some which happen not to be seen. An unseen form is not experienced anywhere, just like an unthought thought.</p>
              <p>This leads to the shocking realization that you do not see form at any time! Form is not something external that is independent of seeing; form goes into the very idea of seeing. Seeing is not a function that <em>operates </em>on form, it is another word <em>for </em>form. So you do not actually see form.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Seeing is not separate from witnessing awareness. </strong>Next, you come to realize that seeing itself cannot be separated from the awareness to which it arises. When seeing is present, its presence is noted by awareness. When seeing is absent, its presence is noted by awareness. When seeing is absent, its absence is noted by awareness. Other than awareness, seeing has no other independent way of arising or being experienced. You have no other access to seeing. You cannot get between awareness and seeing to watch them make contact with each other. When seeing is not present, it is not like an actor in the wings, waiting to come onstage.</p>
              <p>This leads to another fresh realization - because seeing is not something that happens independently of awareness, you are actually not ever aware <em>of </em>seeing. It makes no sense to think that seeing is truly an object. Rather, awareness is actually another word <em>for </em>seeing. Because seeing has nowhere to go and nothing to be other than awareness, awareness is actually the nature of seeing. This same nature cascades all the way through to the supposed physical object, which itself is nothing other than awareness. This is your direct experience at all times.</p>
