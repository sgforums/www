            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, Zhou, or Mantras, are not meant to be translated. It is best it remains in the original Sanskrit language... when we chant, we also no need to specially note its meaning. Most importantly we chant sincerely, one mindedly, with an 'empty' mind rather than an attached/wild mind.<br><br>Da Bei Zhou mostly consists of Bodhisattva names, there is no special meaning. It is perceived by the Great Compassionate Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Guan Yin) as a Universal Sound.<br><br><strong>Benefits in Reciting and Holding The Great Compassion Mantra</strong><br><br>Excerpts from The Dharani Sutra<br>English translation by the Buddhist Text Translation Society,<br>Dharma Realm Buddhist University, USA<br><br>If humans and gods recite and hold the phrases of the Great Compassion Mantra, then when they approach the end of life, all the Buddhas of the ten directions will come to take them by the hand to rebirth in whatever Buddhaland they wish, according to their desire.<br>Should any living beings who recites and holds the spiritual mantra of Great Compassion fall into the three evil paths, I vow not to realise the right enlightenment. Should any living being who recites and holds the spiritual mantra of Great Compassion not be reborn in any Buddhaland, I vow not to realise the right enlightenment. Should any living being who recites and holds the spiritual mantra of Great Compassion not obtain unlimited samadhis and eloquence, I vow not to realise the right enlightenment. Should any living being who recites and holds the spiritual mantra of Great Compassion not obtain the fruits of whatever is sought in this very life, then he cannot have been making proper use of the Dharani of the Great Compassion Heart.<br>People and gods who recite and hold the Great Compassion Mantra will obtain fifteen kinds of good birth and will not suffer fifteen kinds of bad death.<br><br>The bad deaths are:<br>1. They will not die of starvation or privation<br>2. They will not die from having been yoked, imprisoned, caned or otherwise beaten<br>3. They will not die at the hands of hostile enemies<br>4. They will not be killed in military battle<br>5. They will not be killed by tigers, wolves, or other evil beasts<br>6. They will not die from the venom of poisonous snakes, black serpents, or scorpions<br>7. They will not drown or be burned to death<br>8. They will not be poisoned to death<br>9. They will not die as a result of sorcery<br>10. They will not die of madness or insanity<br>11. They will not be killed by landslides or falling trees<br>12. They will not die of nightmares sent by evil people<br>13. They will not be killed by deviant spirits or evil ghosts<br>14. They will not die of evil illnesses which bind the body<br>15. They will not commit suicide<br><br>Those who recite and hold the spiritual Mantra of Great Compassion will not suffer any of these fifteen kinds of bad death and will obtain the following fifteen kinds of good birth:<br>1. Their place of birth will always have a good king<br>2. They will always be born in a good country<br>3. They will always be born at a good time<br>4. They will always meet good friends<br>5. The organs of their body will always be complete<br>6. Their heart will be pure and full in the way<br>7. They will not violate the prohibitive precepts<br>8. Their family will be kind and harmonious<br>9. They will always have the necessary wealth and goods in abundance<br>10. They will always obtain the respect and help of others<br>11. They riches will not be plundered<br>12. They will obtain everything they seek<br>13. Dragons, gods, and good spirits will always protect them<br>14. In the place where they are born they will see the Buddha and hear the Dharma<br>15. They will awaken to the profound meaning of that Proper Dharma which they hear.<br>Those who recite and hold the Great Compassion Mantra will obtain these fifteen kinds of good birth. All gods and people should constantly recite and hold it, without carelessness.<br><br></div>

It works like sending out radio waves to the Buddha realm. Pronunciation controls the frequency so that it is better to send it at the right frequency range.<br><br>Power is also important because it takes power or energy to send it. An 'empty' mind without knowing its meaning and without expectations will give it the full power. Those who can't empty their mind will have to chant it for at least 60 times or more to make it work. And it can get down to even once for those with strong power.<br><br>The benefit of chanting Da Bei Zhou is profound. Most of all, we'll get peace in mind.<br><br></div>
