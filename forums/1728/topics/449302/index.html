              <br> Here are some postings from Dharma Wheel forummer "<a href="http://dharmawheel.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1597">asunthatneversets</a>".
               He is a student of the Dzogchen master Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. Thusness
               told me that this forummer has strong experience, realization and view.
               I went through the posts more thoroughly today after I booked out from 
              camp (previously only took a few glimpses due to lack of time and 
              resources in camp) and found them to be very profound and well written, 
              clearly written from deep insight and experience.<br> <br> Note: not in chronological order<br> <br> ....<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Within self-emergent primordial gnosis, <br>there are no objects to be experienced,<br>There is nothing which has previously passed away,<br>Nor anything which will subsequently emerge,<br>Nor anything at all which currently appears.<br><br>There is no karma,<br>There are no latent karmic propensities,<br>There is no dimmed awareness,<br>There is no mind,<br>There is no psyche,<br>There is no insight,<br>There is no cyclic existence,<br>And there is no transcendence of misery -<br>It is not the case that even awareness itself exists. <br><br>There is nothing whatsoever which manifests within primordial gnosis.<br><br>- excerpt from The Tantra Of The Wordless Secret<br>(Absence Of Letters | yi ge med pa) or (Letterless Tantra | yi ge med pa'i rgyud)</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>....<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">All that we are is the result of

              All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on 
              our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts 
              with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never 
              leaves him. 'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed 
              me,'--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease. 'He

Since the clear light of your own intrinsic<br>awareness is empty, it is the DharmakÄ�ya; and this is like the sun<br>rising in a cloudless illuminated sky.

The meaning of this, whether or not it is understood, is<br>especially significant.<br><br>- Padmasambhava</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>....<br> <br> It's completely natural to be confused but that's good you find it 
              fascinating! Some would say your fascination signifies that you're 
              karmically predisposed to this knowledge and are ready for it. All of it
               is undoubtably diametrically opposed to, and surely contrasts how we 
              normally view things but that is the point. How we normally view things 
              is due to ignorance or avidyÄ�, which is predicated on habitual patterns 
              and tendencies to reify a dualistic schematic of subject-object. This 
              dichotomy is unreal apart from it's illusory nature, it has conventional
               value but apart from being a convention it is a fallacy. <br> <br> <blockquote>
              <div><cite>duckfiasco wrote:</cite>There
               is an absolute truth (suchness), and we continue to perceive it on 
              relative terms (subject-object) because we latch onto our aggregates as 
              something wholly separate and unique. Ignorant of the existence of this 
              process, we see exclusively our version of things, believing we have no 
              part in creating what we perceive. There may be hints of what the actual
               thing or experience is if we try to average out many relative 
              experiences. This may even be what science tries to do.</div>
              </blockquote> <br> <br> Being
               able to experience reality in it's suchness is the doorway to 
              liberation, although labeling suchness as an absolute truth 
              in-and-of-itself would ultimately be a misnomer. Suchness is a quality 
              of what-is and is an extremely important pointer, but in this teaching 
              and on one's path to posit any type of absolute truth can be dangerous, I
               would advise that it'd be beneficial to hold any conviction of absolute
               truth very lightly. We have to use labels and words to communicate, but
               ultimately any label, idea, concept etc.. is going to be a projection. 
              This goes for aggregates as well, aggregates is useful in seeing that 
              "things" and experience itself are product of constituent parts but 
              again, to hold this as a truth is only going to serve as a block.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Just as the Buddhas have spoken of <br>"I" and "mine" for a practical purpose;<br>Likewise they spoke too of "aggregates", <br>"Elements" and "sense-fields" for a practical reasons. <br><br>Such things spoken of as the "great elements",<br>These are fully absorbed into consciousness;<br>Since they are dissolved by understanding them,<br>Are they not falsely imputed?"<br><br>- Nagarjuna: excerpt from his 60 Stanzas</span><br> <br> So
               seeing that "we see exclusively our version of things, believing we 
              have no part in creating what we perceive" is also important insight to 
              gain because it starts to disarm the notion of taking our perceptions as
               king. We start to see the relativity of any opinions, beliefs and ideas
               we hold onto about 'things' and this is a step in the right direction 
              because it allows us to unlatch from our projections in that way. This 
              unlatching starts to bring projections from a level of subconscious 
              imputation paraded as inherent truth, to a new level of 'conscious 
              knowing' that our ideas are merely implementations of conventional 
              language for communication purposes. But this is the catch; this 
              realization of relativity in our notions and ideas is absolutely 
              necessary, but if it's left here then one remains in avidyÄ�. This is 
              because to conceive that it's possible to identify "hints of what the 
              actual thing or experience is if we try to average out many relative 
              experiences" is assuming that there is a 'actual thing' 'out there'. 
              This definitely is what science tries to do, although newer schools of 
              thought such as quantum physics and such are starting to deviate from 
              the old paradigm, the old paradigm still subtly reigns supreme in 
              dominating understanding. That Dimitri Halley guy touches on this in one
               of those other videos where one of C.G. Jung's successors is being 
              interviewed and is explaining something in the context of comparing 
              something psychologically to known science, with the reigning scientific
               paradigm being used as the fundamental inescapable absolute truth to 
              make the comparison against... making a comment such as (and I 
              paraphrase) "mythology is always present, that's like asking 'is matter 
              always present in todays world?' and the answer is of course, yes" to 
              which Dimitri replies(again paraphrased) "there is no matter, that is 
              the illusion". (Mind you I'm not continually going to or quoting this 
              Dimitri guy as some kind of great guru who has all these answers or 
              anything. It just naturally fit the conversation at hand.) But it is 
              inescapably true; this is the scientific process this day in age, and is
               considered the scientific process. To gain the 'true' knowledge of some
               'thing' by using experimentation or deductive reasoning etc... and as I
               said they're getting closer and closer, but the duality of the 'thing' 
              in question, being an object, will have to be removed before the reality
               of experience can shine in it's true form. And sadly this cannot be 
              done if it is continually approached from a dualistic perspective, 
              because the dualistic perspective becomes the confines that the 
              experiment dwells within. Reality mirrors how it is perceived, if you 
              perceive it as something separate it is that way, and if you can get to 
              the point where this perception is realized to be projection and it is 
              discarded, then reality will reflect that knowledge. Experience has 
              plasticity in this way, your projections shape and define it, it doesn't
               define and shape your projections(but of course it does shape you in a 
              fundamental way, you being a projection yourself, and a natural 
              formation or expression of it).<br> <br> The point being that there is no 
              'thing' beyond the projection of a 'thing'. There is no way to know 
              something in it's true form apart from your projections about it. There 
              are no hints of the actual state of affairs or the thing in it's 
              actuality. The 'thing' cannot be known apart from your knowledge of it, 
              and the thing is in fact your knowledge itself and inseparable from 
              that-which-you-are. To put it another way, as you stare at this computer
               screen, you feel as if when you get up and walk away from this computer
               it is somehow still existing 'over-there' or 'in the other room' or 
              something of that sort, but what needs to be fundamentally understood is
               that the 'thing'(computer screen) is the experiencing of it. The 
              computer screen IS the visual seeing of it, and the tactile touch 
              sensation of it(I have to again clumsily say 'of it' as if there's 
              something the vision or touch is objectively contacting). The computer 
              screen IS vision, the computer keyboard IS touch. And you ARE the 
              vision, you ARE the touch. Merge with the senses, the subject and the 
              object coalesce to create a continuum, this is your true state. But this
               must be actualized experientially, apart from intellectual 
              understanding.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> Language is naturally 
              dualistic so it's impossible for it to accurately describe that which is
               being discussed. But to clear up your two messages in a way that points
               somewhat closely; Experience appears to happen, however there's no 
              experiencer and nothing which is experienced. However the absence of 
              self/phenomena cannot be believed, because the self is reborn in the 
              belief, as that which believes or disbelieves.  The experience of a 
              thing is a projection, there is no 'thing itself'(even apart from 
              sensory perception like noumena). So there are no 'things' or objects 
              anywhere in experience(of course there is conventionally). But if this 
              is left on the level of belief then it's a rebirth of the same exact 
              ignorance. A notion of absence is just as imputed as the original notion
               of appearance. A subject-object split of any nature is a projection of 
              ignorance. Thought creates all separation, the problem is that thoughts 
              are believed, and it's believed that thoughts are merely commenting on a
               'thing' which inherently exists apart from the thought. But in truth 
              the thought creates the 'thing'. The thought implies a thinker and that 
              which is thought of. Thought and memory create time, space, everything. 
              If you can start to view thought in it's suchness, as merely a sound, 
              that points to nothing and self-liberates the moment it appears, and 
              then eventually see that there's no one who views the thought but that 
              it is self-originated... and it continues to collapse in from there with
               a few other possible steps until it's only emptiness.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> Change is an imputed projection. Its a useful convention but 
              experience is always in the immediacy. Observation and processes of 
              observation are also imputed, a process would require time, point of 
              origin, end point, etc.. And observation as an act itself would require 
              an observer and something observed.<br> <br>  ....<br> <br> The aggregates are also imputed as mentioned above, as well as 
              observations... the cause for the removal of ignorance is described in 
              different ways, and realization itself varies among the different 
              vehicles. Realization in Theravada isn't to the same extent as mahamudra
               or dzogchen. Each tradition has it's own nomenclature as well. On the 
              ultimate platform nothing ever happens, there is no change, no samsara, 
              no nirvana etc.. But that is a little extreme for this discussion. I 
              guess you could say 'that-which-is' suddenly becomes aware of itself, 
              although that isn't exactly accurate either. The metaphor of the sun 
              being obscured by the clouds is good too like Greg mentioned, the sun is
               ever-present and ever-shining and only seemed to be absent or difficult
               to see due to the cloud cover. The Dharma is the means to remove these 
              clouds.<br> <br> ....
              <br> <br> Externality and constituent particles are imputations as well, at no
               point during the experience of a fire hydrant does the experience 
              itself claim to be external. And in direct experience constituent 
              particles are never experienced either (unless under a microscope, but 
              that experience would not be the same as looking at the fire hydrant on 
              the street, one only infers that it's the same via imputation).<br> <br> It's 
              direct experience that is the key point, every moment is fresh and brand
               new, as if it's the first moment that ever existed... we only form a 
              causal chain of happenings and time via imputation of memory which is 
              also always ever fresh and brand new. Also, experience never suggests 
              that impressions exist inside a persons mind, this is also imputed. In 
              your direct experience the 'sound' of a thought and the 'sound' of 
              someone speaking are the same and occupy the same space, neither are 
              internal or external.<br> <br> Mind is also never experienced, the seeming 
              appearance of a consecutive number of thoughts in a sequence of time 
              makes it seem as if there is an entity called the mind, there is no 
              mind, only thoughts, and thoughts lack a thinker. Physicality is also 
              never experienced, we only accept a story of the physical and impute 
              this onto experience, for instance when you touch something, you believe
               a story that 'you' are 'touching' a 'thing'... the actual experience is
               only one sensation.. just a single tactile sensation.<br> <br> You can play a 
              game with this by touching something and rubbing it lightly, if you 
              shift attention to the object then the sensation becomes the touching 
              and feeling of the object, if you shift attention to your finger the 
              sensation becomes the feeling in your finger, there is only one touch 
              sensation, the shifting of attention and intention creates the nature of
               the sensation via imputation. Or another one; if you rub your thumb and
               pointer finger together, shifting attention to the thumb it's your 
              thumb doing the touching, shift your attention to your pointer finger 
              and it's your pointer finger doing the touching, in truth neither are 
              touching, a tactile sensation simply appears in awareness, and the 
              sensation is in fact awareness itself. <br> <br> ....<br> <br> The impressions themselves dictate external and internal, self 
              and objects, apart from the impression none of these can be found, 
              experience is whole and beyond any designations. <br> <br> Everything is imputed. No thing exists apart from imputation.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> The constituent particles are experienced? So prior to the day 
              you went to school and/or read a book which informed you of particles 
              and atoms and what-have-you, you knew 'things' were constructed of 
              particles? My 3 year old certainly doesn't know of particles, if I asked
               him what a table was made out of he'd say "I dunno"... maybe once he 
              goes to kindergarten he'll reply with "it's made of wood"... and someday
               down the line he'll say "it's made of particles". These are learned 
              ideas, they are not inherent in experience. You presently do not see 
              particles, you only know they are present at a subatomic level and 
              therefore that knowledge governs your perception. Presently all 'you 
              see' is shades of color and shapes (which bordering colors imply), that 
              is all vision consists of. Kinesthetically you feel sensation attributed
               to muscle contractions, you feel tactile sensations when you touch 
              things... soft... hard.. rough... smooth.. hot.. cold. Do the colors, 
              shapes, kinesthetic feelings and tactile sensations communicate that 
              particles are present? No. Your present experience consists ONLY of 
              colors, shapes, feeling, auditory noise etc.. Now this is the kicker; 
              there are not 2 separate parts to vision (1. the act of seeing and 2. 
              objects seen), visual objects ARE the colors and shapes.... and colors 
              and shapes ARE vision. There isn't "seeing" and "objects which are 
              seen", the objects are the seeing. Colors and shape implies seeing, you 
              never, ever, ever at any time experience unseen colors or shapes... they
               are one process... one appearance. The 'external' field of objects IS 
              vision and is therefore your own display. You are looking at your own 
              state. Awareness reflecting itself to itself in it's totality... 
              timelessly. It is an ocean of being. Tactile sensations are the same 
              way... not 2 processes, the touching of the object IS the object, the 
              singular kinesthetic sensation of the objects weight IS the objects 
              weight, and there is no object apart from these sensual appearances... 
              again it is your own display. And we already discovered that there is no
               "you" for the display to belong to... so it is timeless awareness or 
              consciousness... wisdom... whatever you want to name it.. 
              in-and-of-itself. Same goes for hearing, same goes for taste, every 
              single aspect of experience without fail is your own display... know 
              this thoroughly, know it innately... divorced from intellect, be it, and
               be free. <br> <br> There are no constituent movements of mind. The 'mind'
               is ONLY the apparent movement. There is no mind apart from thought, and
               thought itself conceptualizes a compartment or container called 'the 
              mind' to belong to. Likewise there is no thought apart from 
              awareness/consciousness... thought IS awareness, thought IS 
              consciousness. Nothing appears to consciousness, consciousness IS these 
              appearances... and there are no appearances, only consciousness. 
              Consciousness alone IS. Lucid and clear, unobstructed and pure timeless 
              nondual perfection. <br> <br> Don't believe any of what I'm saying just 
              look at your present experience, investigate empirically... it is 
              self-evident and undeniable.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> <br> There are no physical and mental ultimates. There never was a 
              beginning in the ultimate sense. Physical, mental, beginning and notion 
              of eventual end, were seemingly born with the first imputation of 
              selfhood. These notions have merely become so subconsciously engrained 
              into you through incessant reification of duality that to conceive 
              experience to be any other way seems absurd and counterintuitive. The 
              marker and identifier is your own intimate state, the compelling notion 
              that there is a marker or identifier on the side of the object is your 
              own radiance, you are it. Your being is the unparalleled birthless and 
              deathless principle which saturates what-is. <br> <br> ....<br> <br> It seems utterly impossible, but disavow the reigning paradigm 
              you champion and it's there to see, you just have to know how to look. 
              There is no external or internal, these notions are based on 
              identification with 'the body' as it is, the bordering line between 
              "internal" and "external" is imputed as the surface of the skin. You are
               not the body or in the body, the body is in you, as you, and "you" is a
               concept, which is a thought, which is a sound, which is awareness, 
              which is self-liberated the very moment it appears to itself in this 
              primordial non-arising.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> <br> Why are you afraid of giving up the object? In my opinion you're
               holding onto a few presuppositions about the nature of experience that 
              are poisoning the well in a sense. You're insisting that consciousness 
              acts as a flashlight in that when it shines on an object, the object is 
              experienced but when it isn't shining on the object the object is still 
              there but somehow off screen or something. So you're saying that there 
              are substantiated physical objects made of particles that exist 
              separately from awareness?<br> <br> I'm not sure what to say it sounds like you 
              want to have your cake and eat it too, I'm afraid you're setting up 
              barriers for yourself. There are far too many dualities in the schematic
               you're proposing to navigate to the place you want to be. Everything I 
              mentioned above; the "straight up sautrantika" stuff will successfully 
              dismiss actual physical and mental ultimates if they're applied to ones 
              experience beyond the intellect.<br> <br> Because if the root of emptiness is 
              essentially the dismissal of markers and identifiers (as you said), 
              you'll obviously have to dismiss the markers and identifiers to 
              establish emptiness. I mean, right off the bat; objects are dependently 
              originated, on so many levels it's ridiculous. Everything is empty.. 
              including emptiness itself, and emptiness teachings are undoubtably a 
              process of giving up the ghosts that plague one's perception. We're 
              talking about inherent existence versus conventional appearance.<br> <br> So you 
              can dismiss objects' inherent existence and still know they have 
              conventional existences. It's not as if 'poof' the objects will 
              disappear, you're just not going to take them a seriously as you would, 
              you'll know they're empty. If you want to take it further there are ways
               to fuse experience into it's natural state of timeless awareness, that 
              will actually destroy physicality experientially, but that isn't 
              achieved via intellectual understanding (except on rare occasions 
              perhaps). These are all processes to remove ignorance. It is our own 
              ignorance that makes the world and objects seem real. <br> <br> ....<br> <br> Why do you feel it's dangerous to claim the "mental aspect" is 
              all there is? Whether it's all that is, is truly ultimately irrelevant, 
              it's all conjecture. It's the classic phenomena vs. Noumena argument. If
               such a noumena does exist there is still no way to ever "know" it. What
               is experienced directly is what-is. There is no objective physical form
               and subjective mental representation(of said objective physical form). 
              These are simply imputations. If these imputations continue to govern 
              ones perception then they remain lost in duality and true emptiness can 
              never be accessed. The idea that one is subject to structures and laws 
              of some world outside of themselves is innately defeating.. Like a 
              victim saying "well I can only do so much since I'm confined to these 
              limitations". In truth there are no limitations, there are no natural 
              laws of outer or inner, phenomena and noumena etc.. You give these 
              notions power. You are the source of their solidity and presence in 
              experience, they're 110% imputed. So your question of how you go from 
              selflessness to emptiness within the confines of your view is 
              impossible.<br> <br> ....<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">The cognizer perceives the cognizable;<br>Without the cognizable there is no cognition;<br>Therefore why do you not admit<br>That neither object nor subject exists [at all]?<br><br>The mind is but a mere name;<br>Apart from it's name it exists as nothing;<br>So view consciousness as a mere name;<br>Name too has no intrinsic nature.<br><br>Either within or likewise without,<br>Or somewhere in between the two,<br>The conquerors have never found the mind;<br>So the mind has the nature of an illusion.<br><br>The distinctions of colors and shapes,<br>Or that of object and subject,<br>Of male, female and the neuter - <br>The mind has no such fixed forms.<br><br>In brief the Buddhas have never seen<br>Nor will they ever see [such a mind];<br>So how can they see it as intrinsic nature<br>That which is devoid of intrinsic nature?<br><br>"Entity" is a conceptualization;<br>Absence of conceptualization is emptiness;<br>Where conceptualization occurs,<br>How can there be emptiness?<br><br>The mind in terms of perceived and perceiver,<br>This the Tathagatas have never seen;<br>Where there is the perceived and perceiver,<br>There is no enlightenment.<br><br>Devoid of characteristics and origination,<br>Devoid of substantiative reality and transcending speech,<br>Space, awakening mind and enlightenment<br>Posses the characteristics of non-duality.<br><br>- Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">....</span><br> <br> A valid cognition on the conventional level would just be the most 
              accurate description or representation of ultimate cognition one can 
              convey using concepts. Conventional or relative truths always correlate 
              with the use of linear thought processes and language. So in truth, a 
              'conventional truth' or valid conventional cognition is never really a 
              "truth", just an accurate account of the ultimate. <br> <br> A valid 
              ultimate cognition can never really be known apart from the experience 
              itself. It's like describing the taste of an apple. The verbal, 
              conceptual description is the conventional. The actual, sensual taste is
               the ultimate or absolute truth. The description of the taste obviously 
              never properly captures the actual taste. In terms of peak experiences 
              or realizations in the dharma, a metaphor of attempting to describe the 
              color red to a man blind since birth can be used. Having never seen 
              before the man would have no reference level with which to gauge your 
              description. So the same principle goes for those attempting to describe
               ultimate truths or cognitions in the dharma as well. A nondual 
              experience or liberation or what have you can be described 
              conventionally, but the ultimate cognition or nature is only to be 
              actualized in your own experience.<br> <br> If thought or reasoning are 
              being implemented to understand or break something down it's always only
               conventional. An experience of an ultimate cognition is just direct 
              sensual experience divorced from/prior to translation or interpretation 
              in thought/language etc.. And an ultimate truth or experience in 
              reference to a realization or liberation will be explicitly evident 
              beyond any doubts. When those things pop up more often than not you 
              won't have to ask, it is just an innate intuitive certainty.<br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">....</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br> <blockquote>

              </blockquote> <br> <br> Yes
               but just as TMingyur said above, the implications associated with the 
              selflessness of the person(i.e. subjective self) are directly related to
               the emptiness or selflessness of other-than-the-person(i.e. the 
              objective world). Because to posit the inherent existence of a "person" 
              or "I", automatically creates everything that is not the "person" or 
              "I". Self goes hand in hand with other, they're mutually interdependent 
              co-arisen concepts. Just as black goes with white, up with down and left
               with right. So it's a package deal, if you're a self then there is 
              automatically stuff in experience which is not you by default, it's a 
              dichotomy. Removal of the self(subject) automatically removes the 
              world(object). This notion of separation which dominates experience is 
              the basis for suffering, it arises from avidyÄ� or ignorance of our true 
              condition. The purpose of the dharma is to remove this delusion.<br> <br> There
               is no self, but when that truth is conceptualized and believed to be 
              true, it is automatically falsified, because the very self that 
              statement and idea attempts to negate is reborn through attachment or 
              aversion to that concept or belief. So seek to comprehend these truths 
              but hold them lightly, and when the time is right let go... apart from 
              attachment and aversion you are unborn. <br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">All
               dharmas are like reflected images, clear and pure, without turbulence, 
              ungraspable, inexpressible, truly arisen from cause and from action.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">....</span><br> <br> <blockquote>

               funny, when this first happened to me the very first thing I remember 
              was looking at my hands (I was driving) and being like "what the f***

               more subtle and which is grosser. The most important thing is finding 
              out what the 'me' and 'mine' depend on. Much like fire depends on fuel, 
              you need to investigate what the 'me' and 'mine' rely on for fuel.

              found. - Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> Ok so throughout this I want to stick 
              with what is sensible. By "sensible" I mean capable of being sensed or 
              that which is perceived by the senses. So audible, visible, tangible, 
              etc... and for this we'll go with what is immediately perceived. Not 
              mediately (through the intervention of something else). For example; 
              when reading a book what you <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> perceive is letters on the page, but <span style="font-style: italic;">mediately</span> or by means of these, notions of truth, virtue, vice etc are suggested 
              to the mind. So though notions such as truth, vice, virtue etc are 
              suggested and signified to the mind by sensible marks with which they 
              have an arbitrary connection with, it would be absurd to designate 
              these(truth, virtue etc..) as sensible things. So 'sensible things' 
              means only what is immediately perceived by the senses and sensible 
              things that we investigate don't include such designations inherently. 
              To add; in instances such as a situation where one sees both red and 
              blue in the sky, and thus it is inferred that there must be a cause for 
              the differences in colors, that cause cannot be said to be a sensible 
              quality immediately perceived by eyesight. Likewise, when one hears a 
              variety of sounds it cannot be said that you hear their causes, and when
               one touches something hot or feels something heavy; one cannot say with
               truth that you feel the cause of the heat or weight. Hopefully we can 
              agree that the senses perceive only what is perceived immediately 
              because they do not make inferences.<br> <br> So immediate sensible qualities include:<br> Sight -  light, colors, shapes.<br> Hearing - sounds.<br> The palate - tastes.<br> Smell - odors.<br> Touch - tangible qualities.<br> (And obviously combinations of these.)<br> <br> The
               purpose for this is to obviously stay with the theme I mentioned in an 
              earlier post which was based on the premise that experience suggests 
              nothing about itself. Aside from our conceptualizations about 
              experience, experience itself communicates nothing. So staying with what
               is immediately perceived allows us to remain objective (no pun 
              intended) and allows a mutually shared middle ground (non-conceptual 
              awareness) apart from our contrasting notions about that middle ground. 
              So like I said we're empirically investigating the nature of experience 
              itself, and the emptiness or non-emptiness of an objective field in 
              relation to it's validity in being a substantiated attribute of 
              experience.<br> <br> The underlying inquiry consists of two contrasting 
              notions which are; does the reality of sensible things consist of being 
              perceived? Or do things in fact exist as inherent exterior objects 
              independent of sensual perception, distinct from, and having no relation
               to being<br> perceived? And related notions of objectivity, 
              subjectivity, physicality, etc. Inherent separate existence vs. Empty 
              dependent origination.<br> <br> You started with salt before so... 
              beginning with salt; inquiring into salts characteristics and attributes
               we'll look into whether salt exists as an objective independent agent 
              which inherently exists and posses these attributes or the contrary.<br> <br> Salt
               as it's usually experienced is predominantly comprised of vision, 
              tactile sensation and obviously taste. I suppose salt can, on occasion 
              be heard and also undoubtably bears an aroma to match it's pungent taste
               but those senses are secondary. So I think approaching salt 
              sense-by-sense will be appropriate so that we can ensure that each 
              sensory field can be properly isolated and examined. The reason for this
               is that in my opinion the different sense fields are heterogeneous 
              instead of how they are usually taken to be (homogeneous). So even 
              though they seem to amalgamate and interact to create what appears to be
               an organized and coordinated experience of reality, they are in fact 
              separate fields which only communicate with one another via inferential 
              projection. <br> <br> This issue was examined rather thoroughly in a 
              philosophical thought-experiment called Molyneux's Problem which 
              consisted of attempting to understand the level of sensorial 
              coordination one would possess upon immediate recovery from blindness. 
              Taken from wikipedia; The problem can be stated in brief, "if a man born
               blind can feel the differences between shapes such as spheres and 
              cubes, could he similarly distinguish those objects by sight if given 
              the ability to see?"<br> <br> The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher William Molyneux, whose wife was blind:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Suppose
               a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish
               between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same 
              bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the 
              cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed 
              on a table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, 
              before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the 
              globe, which the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer 
              answers: ‘Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a globe,
               and how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the 
              experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight 
              so or so…’</span><br> <br> To which Locke responds in "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding":<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">I
               agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, 
              in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at 
              first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the 
              globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could 
              unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the
               difference of their figures felt.</span><br> <br> In 1709, in “A New 
              Theory of Vision,” George Berkeley also concluded that there was no 
              necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world—that a 
              connection between them could be established only on the basis of 
              experience. He speculated:<br> <span style="font-style: italic;">the 
              objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, 
              high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived 
              by touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, 
              perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in no 
              sort make themselves perceived by touch (sect. 95).</span><br> <br> There 
              have been events matching this predicament which actually verified these
               philosopher's educated speculations; one of them being the case of "a 
              woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she underwent surgery for 
              dense bilateral congenital cataracts. They report that the subject could
               recognize family members by sight six months after surgery, but took up
               to a year to recognize most household objects purely by sight."<br> <br> So starting with vision; I included a reference image we can both use to avoid conflicting imagery.<br> <br> <img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/301ddh4.jpg" alt="Image"><br> (image A)<br> <br> Salt
               on a table is a fairly common affair (if one is making a mess) and is 
              good because it entails fairly limited differences in <span style="font-style: italic;">color</span>, which as it ends up is pretty much equivalent to the very sense of vision we're exploring. <br> <br> My
               argument to start is going to be that color is exactly vision and 
              vision is exactly color, they are synonymous in nature and 
              manifestation. The common presupposition that the process of visually 
              perceiving an object consists of 'seeing' a 'color' (which exists 
              separately from said act of seeing) is a misnomer. Wherever there is 
              color there is seeing and vice versa. The two go hand-in-hand and you 
              cannot have one without the other. With color we also get 'shape' which 
              is a result of colors bordering each other in various ways. So color 
              also implies shape, and shape likewise will imply color. Ultimately the 
              object of vision is color and therefore shape. <br> <br> Vision standing 
              alone as an isolated sense is much like Image A posted above. If we 
              attend to the visual evidence in the image alone we get a circular patch
               of white surrounded by brown. There is no separating line between the 
              colors and vision. And likewise there is no separating line between the 
              colors and you, no evidence in the colors of being "out there" and no 
              evidence of yourself being an observer "in here". The conclusion that 
              the colors are external to us is based on the principle that these 
              colors change over time. So we accept a story that the colors (object) 
              is separate from us even though the basis for this conclusion is lacking
               in the visual evidence in-and-of-itself. This aligns with my previous 
              statement that experience suggests nothing about itself. Experience 
              instead receives projected conceptual overlay which over time serves to 
              create habitually solidified subconscious presuppositions conveying a 
              compelling sense of separation. <br> <br> Separation in general is based 
              on spatiality. We usually conceive of two opposite aspects existing on 
              opposite sides of unbridgeable spatial gaps. In truth we never 
              experience spatial externality or independence. These designations are 
              based on the formation of a subtle reference point of a subjective self 
              "here" as opposed to "there". The feeling of subjectivity is never 
              anything more than a tendency to identify with certain clusters of 
              sensation and project that the remainder is objective and "other". But 
              by looking at experience very directly it can actually be ascertained 
              that this "otherness" is never a part of our experience. <br> <br> So back
               to the white salt on the brown table... this image that arises as 
              vision is composed of these colors, we see a white circular expanse of 
              color, and various shades of white within that circular shape. Bordering
               that we see a brown expanse of color which seems to surround the white,
               and if we could back up and see a larger image the colors would unfold 
              as we went along. <br> These colors are all there is to vision. So to 
              examine the 'objectivity' of vision let's examine the 'whiteness' in the
               image(and you can do this by putting salt on a table in front of 
              you)... speaking specifically about the shades of the 'whiteness' and 
              the particular value of the color. Can we say that the shade itself is 
              salt? Can it be said that wherever you have that particular shade(white)
               you have salt - and wherever you have salt you have that particular 
              shade(white)? Obviously not. So white itself isn't definitive of salt. 
              Now would you say that there is salt on the far side of that color? Do 
              you directly experience salt behind the white? Because we just 
              established that we wouldn't take the shade of white itself to be salt 
              one should naturally inquire as to whether there is salt behind the 
              white. We'll find that there is in fact no salt to be found on the 
              posterior side of the white. Now on the near side of the color, do we 
              experience any separation between the seeing of the color and the color 
              itself? Attending exclusively to vision and letting go of any arising 
              concepts or beliefs, is there any distance experienced between the 
              seeing of the white and the white itself? You can't see the 'seeing'... 
              so there can't be any distance, the color simply arises. So there's no 
              salt on the far side of the white, and no salt on the near side, and no 
              distance or gap between the white and the seeing of the white itself. 
              Wherever white appears, vision is occurring, there's no access to white 
              without vision, so the objectivity of the salt should melt or fuse into 
              vision itself. The color should disappear into vision, because at that 
              point it makes no sense to say one is "seeing" a "color" in the first 
              place... the two are inseparable. Vision itself means color is arising, 
              they're one and the same. It's not as if you have independent access to 
              colors where you can notice a color out of the visual field and then say
               now i'm seeing that color, there couldn't be a color unless vision was 
              already there. <br> <br> Now the idea that there is a bordering line 
              between an internal aspect of the body and an external aspect apart from
               the body has to be taken into account as well. This 'bordering line' 
              creating the dichotomy of internal/external is based on identification 
              with 'the body'. But the body itself is not separate from vision either,
               there are other colors and shades which are identified as 'my body' but
               just like the colors which composed the salt, these colors appearing as
               a 'body' do not communicate a possessive nature. The colors simply 
              arise no different than any other color in the field of vision. We only 
              impute a notion of 'my body' over these colors. There are other 
              faculties that seem to correlate with vision to give the appearance of a
               homogeneous cluster of sensations conventionally called the body and we
               can discuss those separately, but all are merely qualities appearing to
               awareness as awareness itself. So the notion of an 'subject inside' 
              viewing an 'object outside' is not self-evident in vision. Vision simply
               appears and is completely non-discriminitive. Another thing which isn't
               self-evident in vision is the presence of 'eyes' doing the seeing, we 
              never experience or see our own eyes at any time, even in the act of 
              looking at a mirror we only are ever seeing colors and shapes arise that
               we identify with as 'me' and 'my eyes' but the eyes appear nowhere 
              within vision itself, we again only accept a story about this. <br> <br> About this Nagarjuna states: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Through
               this the eyes, visible forms and so forth, which are described as the 
              elements, these should be known also as [the twelve] sense-fields, and 
              as the objects and the subjects as well. <br><br>Neither atom of form 
              exists nor is sense organ elsewhere; even more no sense organ as agent 
              exists; so the producer and the produced are utterly unsuited for 
              production." - Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">"In
               terms of objects and subjects, whatever appears to the consciousness, 
              apart from the cognitions themselves, no external objects exist 
              anywhere.<br><br>So there are no external objects at all existing in the
               mode of entities. The very perceptions of the individual 
              consciousnesses arise as appearances of the forms." - Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> So
               vision is color. You can't even say they arise as mutually 
              interdependent co-emergent qualities because the duality is lacking to 
              begin with. The notion of the duality between observing and observed is a
               conceptual imputation. A story simply arises and say "i'm seeing white"
               and we accept this story, but the story is never evident in vision 
              itself. The objectivity of color as an external quality isn't 
              substantiated by experience. Now vision itself doesn't appear separate 
              from awareness, or 'that' which 'knows' vision to be apparent. But 
              that-which-knows is the appearance itself, there is no duality, even to 
              say appearance implies something to which the appearance would 
              appear-to, so what "is" escapes all such conceptualizations (aside from 
              conventional descriptive concepts). So the objectivity of the salt 
              collapses, the objectivity of color collapses, the objectivity of vision
               collapses as well. We can't say that vision is a 'thing' out there 
              which is separate that we have access to sometimes and not at other 
              times. Vision is awareness, there is no separation and there are no 
              'objects', all we have is awareness. And this same exercise is done for 
              every sense modality. (Awareness itself must also be refuted as such.)<br> <br> For
               the salty taste; my argument would be much like what has been proposed 
              for vision, i saw that namdrol used the example of MSG in showing the 
              appearance of 'saltiness' to not be unique to salt itself. So following 
              the same examination done with vision and focusing on the palate alone 
              one can successfully find taste to be empty as well. I would also add 
              that with your argument being that saltiness is an innate quality with 
              which salt itself is inherently endowed with; if one runs the gamut of 
              taste congruent with other sensory appearances such as heat; it can be 
              seen that an intense level of taste such as spiciness correlates with an
               intense heat in that at the highest volume of appearance both arise as 
              pain. The pain that arises is in fact the taste. There are not two 
              appearances such as taste and then also pain, they are one and the same.
               So to posit that an external objective thing like salt inherently 
              contains it's taste would be akin to claiming it also contains the 
              appearances of pain and pleasure. One also cannot attribute lesser 
              volumes of the same spectrum such as a general mild taste to an object 
              without naturally accrediting higher and lower volumes of that same 
              spectrum. So salt cannot be said to contain it's taste. And taste cannot
               be said to be anything more than awareness itself and empty. This 
              insight combined with the former which coincides with the experiment 
              done in vision should hopefully annihilate this false designation(of 
              inherent objective existence) apart from mere conventional usage. <br> <br> Ultimately
               awareness itself is empty. Because for one to claim that this inquiry 
              has successfully reached a foundation at 'awareness' implies a 'ground' 
              of being of some type where none can be found. Yet conventionally 
              awareness is a clear and proper concept to use in describing 
              that-which-is, for such an awareness likewise cannot be denied. <br> <br> The Buddha attempted to capture these realizations in The Heart Sutra when he stated: <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">There
               are no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no
               seeing, no hearing, no smelling, no tasting, no touching, no imagining.
               There is nothing seen, nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted, nor touched,
               nor imagined.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Devoid of all real entities; <br>Utterly discarding all objects and subjects,<br>Such as aggregates, elements and sense-fields;<br>Due to sameness of selflessness of all phenomena,<br>One's mind is primordially unborn;<br>It is in the nature of emptiness.<br>- Nagarjuna</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"> ....</span><br> <br> Well then perhaps look at it this way; <br> It appears that thoughts 
              arise but there is no thinker. Likewise it appears seeing is happening 
              but there is no seer. And all the way down the line for all the senses. 
              So whatever this is that we label as experience is spontaneously 
              self-appearing. It appears to no one, so to say "we experience concepts"
               is true conventionally. But in truth the concept in it's appearance as 
              letters or thought or verbal utterance doesn't point to anything. And in
               fact any-thing conceivable IS a concept. Apart from the conceptual 
              overlay of experience we have the incredibly long breakdown I posted on 
              the previous page having to do with the suchness and one-taste of 
              experience in-and-of-itself. I tried to conceptually get as 
              nonconceptual as I could by making that post experimental with actual 
              experience. But getting back to the concepts, when you think or say 
              "we",  the sound "we" just appears and is self-liberated in the very 
              same moment. The error is that via the faculty of memory experience is 
              extended into what appears to be time. And time gives the feeling that 
              there is a subject which experiences an arising such as a concept which 
              is conceived to be separate(from said subject). Time is an illusion. The
               subject is an illusion. Likewise the object is then negated as well. 
              The concept in whatever form it appears IS experience itself. The notion
               that "we" experience anything is product of delusion. Experience just 
              "is"... Seamless, timeless and whole in this ever-presence. Another 
              short and potentially confusing way to put it is; the totality of all 
              that is appearing in this very moment is what you are, and "you" are a 
              concept. (And experience is empty.) <br> <br> Reminds me of what Satan says in Mark Twain's<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Mysterious Stranger</span> which is actually incredibly on point. There's a creepy claymation 
              adaptation of this scene in a old Tom Sawyer film you can find on 
              YouTube. But anyways, Satan says:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Life itself is only a vision, a dream. Nothing exists except empty space and you, and you... are but a thought"</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">....</span><br> <br> Well what is there to change? Since the examination i proposed 
              showed colors are vision, and vision is consciousness, and consciousness
               is empty. That in-and-of-itself negates the changing display of color. 
              But to go further into it, the notion of change must be judged from a 
              reference point of either less-changing or unchanging in the usual 
              sense. But we found the less-changeful and/or changeless reference point
               to be inherently nonexistent. Change must move against a stagnant 
              background to be change. There must be something to gauge the change... 
              and we find nothing. Because you're right to know change requires memory
               to implement as a reference. But this is impossible. We don't have to 
              lobotomize what is already lobotomized. We usually take memory to be an 
              image 'of' a past event. Because we believe ourselves to be entities 
              extended into time and space. This is not the case. A memory thought is 
              always an ever-fresh appearance. It seems to resemble a previous state 
              but it is just an image which appears in the present timeless moment. It
               is only an image. When the image appears, under the delusion of time we
               conceive ourselves to be a subject witnessing or possessing this image 
              and then project that it is evidence of a previous event and call it 
              memory. But time must exist as an inherent faculty of experience for 
              this to be the case, and it isn't, because time IS the so-called memory 
              thought as well. And that "memory" thought is only an ever fresh 
              appearance. So there is only ever this timelessness. The past is a 
              thought appearing now, and there is no thinker of that thought(it isn't 
              even a thought either). Thoughts don't point or refer to anything. They 
              just appear. We get in the habit of believing they refer to actual 
              "things" out there in a world, but they don't. We also get in the habit 
              of validating a thought with another thought. For example if a 
              thought(a) appears and then a thought(b) appears which claims thought(a)
               is true. Thought(a) is already long gone. Thought(b) cannot reach out 
              and touch thought(a). They never appear at the same time. When (b) is 
              present (a) is not. Another thought may appear that says "bullsh*t!"... 
              But that's thought(c). Whatever is appearing now is all that is. <br> <br> To
               further negate the change of color; in our direct experience we never 
              experience an unseen color. So a color's absence is never a part of 
              experience. If a color cannot be experienced as absent, it cannot be 
              experienced as present. A color cannot alternate between presence and 
              absence. Having one side of a pair of opposites makes no sense. There 
              are no one sided coins. So neither present or absent applies to color or
               any other appearance. <br> <br> I must also sleep now. Hasta mañana. Taking my 3 yr old to the Oakland zoo mañana. Party animals.<br> <br> <br> ....<br> <br> Internal/external phenomena is a projection of your so-called 
              "internal" phenomena called conceptualization. Your main concern about 
              this being "projected" as emptiness of external phenomena is impossible 
              being that external phenomena is a projection itself. Aside from 
              conventionality; people, hummingbirds, snails and tree lack inherent 
              being. You're right it isn't due to any personal hubris of yours, but 
              clinging to concepts and attachment to habitual patterns which reify 
              that view certainly make it seem like there appears to be a person who 
              does so. And in contrast makes it appear that there's a person who 
              claims he or she doesn't do so due to any personal hubris of theirs. <br> <br> I
               agree with namdrol that the apparent solidity of phenomena is directly 
              related to the solidity of one's delusion. The more solid one's delusion
               is, the more solid apparent phenomena seem. <br> <br> Pick out an object 
              if you want yadave and let's break it down. I'd like for you to 
              semi-grasp what i'm talking about so I'm not just throwing horsesh*t out
               on a message board without backing up my statements. <br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Just as the Buddhas have spoken of <br>"I" and "mine" for a practical purpose;<br>Likewise they spoke too of "aggregates", <br>"Elements" and "sense-fields" for a practical reasons. <br><br>Such things spoken of as the "great elements",<br>These are fully absorbed into consciousness;<br>Since they are dissolved by understanding them,<br>Are they not falsely imputed?"<br><br>- Nagarjuna: excerpt from his 60 Stanzas<br><br>-------------------------<br><br>"In the universal womb that is boundless space<br>all forms of matter and energy occur as a flux of the four elements,<br>but all are empty forms, absent in reality;<br>all phenomena, arising in pure mind, are like that.<br><br>Magical illusion, whatever it's shape,<br>lacks substance, empty in nature;<br>likewise, all experience of the world, arisen in the moment,<br>unstirring from pure mind, is insubstantial evanescence.<br><br>Just as a dream is a part of sleep,<br>unreal gossamer in it's arising,<br>so all and everything is pure mind,<br>never separated from it,<br>and without substance or attribute.<br><br>....Just as the objective field is absent in reality,<br>so 'the knower' - in actuality pure mind,<br>in essence and absence, is like the clear sky:<br>know it in it's ineffable reality!<br><br>....In total presence, the nature of mind that is like the sky, <br>where there is no duality, no distinction, no gradation,<br>there is no view nor meditation nor commitment to observe,<br>no diligent ideal conduct, no pristine awareness to unveil,<br>no training in the stages and no path to tread,<br>no subtle level of realization, and no final union.<br><br>......

              awareness, causes and conditions have totally vanished. In the instant 
              liberation of awareness, appearances are primordially pure. Such purity 
              does not occur after some time, nor does it come from anywhere else than
               the very nature of awareness. Awareness is liberated from all extremes 
              of nihilism, eternalism, and so on. The "four alternatives" are to be 
              existent, nonexistent, both existent and nonexistent, and neither 
              existent nor nonexistent. Awareness is liberated from being any of these
               four alternatives. Since it is of the single nature of the entirety of 
              samsara and nirvana, awareness is "empty of multiplicity". <br><br>Thus,
               since all appearances and sounds remain in the four types of 
              liberation, they are not bound by anything, and they are not liberated 
              by anything. Everything self-arises from it's own state and is 
              self-liberated. Whatever appears is free from the three extremes of 
              birth, cessation and abiding, so reality-itself is self-appearing. 
              Therefore, due to the spiritual mentor's simply pointing this out, once 
              you know reality-itself to be self-appearing, you will realize 
              appearances and consciousness as reality-itself. <br><br>In the four 
              types of liberation, nothing is bound by anything, but in the cycle of 
              existence, we are bound by self-grasping: grasping on to a personal self
               and grasping onto phenomena. However, in terms of their own nature with
               reference to these four types of liberation, all appearances and sound 
              are not bound by anything, nor are they liberated by anything; so no 
              antidotes are necessary.</span><br> <br> The ultimately existent essence 
              of X is like; expansive, boundless, centerless, borderless, 
              beginningless, endless, clear, complete, nonexclusive, dynamic, 
              inconceivable, spacious, unchanging, pure, pristine, unmoved, 
              immaculate, spontaneous, immutable, unsurpassable, intrinsic, innate, 
              supreme, open, free.<br> <br> <br> ....<br> <br> It's not an early way of saying things have no essence as in a 
              "god" or "soul" doesn't exist. It's not an "early" way of saying 
              anything of the sort. It's a way of showing the absence of duality. That
               you think you're a physical body, in a physical world with objects 
              outside of you which are alien to you, but this is simply a 
              misconception derived from our false conditioned perception. The outcome
               truly is that "you" as a subjective entity are removed completely. And 
              the feeling that there are "things" outside you is removed completely. 
              Whatever it is you would call "experience" is all that's left. But a 
              singular, zero-dimensional experiencing in-and-of-itself. This isn't 
              some philosophy which is left on the level of a humored intellectual 
              contemplation. You seem to want to rationalize it to be that way. I 
              can't say that I blame you being that you have no reference point to 
              gauge it in it's ultimate sense. But it surely isn't a mere "early" way 
              of pronouncing some philosophical notion.<br> <br> .... <br> <br> <br> It's used as a support to remain in contemplation while in 
              movement. Just as the ganapuja stimulates all the senses so you can 
              incorporate/integrate them into contemplation. Movement(tactile 
              sensation) with the mudras, auditory sensation with the 
              bell/drum/mantras, taste with the food, smell with the incense, visual 
              with the mudras/visualizations. <br> <br> Song of vajra dance and music is
               the same type thing. Support to remain in contemplation. So you can 
              eventually remain in constant nonmeditation. <br> <br> Just listen to the song of vajra in it's suchness. As white noise almost. Let it pass as a reflection and remain as the mirror.<br> <br> The sound of traffic and people bustling in the streets is the song of vajra... Integrate integrate integrate<br> <br> <br> ....<br> <br> <br> <br> I see what you're saying... 
              But if one abides in their true nature then there would be no "seeing" 
              in the ultimate sense, it would be more of a zero-dimensional empty 
              cognizance appearing as a "rock". The notion that there is a 'rock' is 
              again due to dualistic imputation (conceptual overlay)... So dharmakaya 
              is it's fullness would be a continuum of nonduality which would be 
              inherently void of a self perceiving a rock. It would be like mind 
              experiencing itself.. But the mind isn't a substantial "entity" it's 
              just empty-cognizance. Really hard to convey using conventional 
              language. <br> <br> But I see what you mean that what I'm describing 
              sounds like if one "thing" is enlightened then 'everything' would be... 
              But the enlightenment is really the falling away of anything which could
               be said to have attained such a realization and also the negation of 
              'that-which-hasn't'. All that remains is the fully perfected natural 
              state in it's spontaneous fullness. The imputation of one who would be 
              realized and one who isn't would fall</div></div>

              <p>You have to let go of the sense of self completely and totally... plus with right view of dependent origination. Naturally you will start to see. For without any self or agency, manifestation is always the universe manifesting via causality.</p>
              <p>But first go into anatta. Without that, it will not be possible to experience it.</p>
