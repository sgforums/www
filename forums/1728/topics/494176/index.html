              self-mastery is self-defeating</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">David Brazier SUMMER 2014

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The logic of morality is often based on
              a wish</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, an assumption, or an
              aspiration toward self-mastery in service of a spiritual or worldly goal.
              Buddhists in the West, for instance, often present morality as the necessary
              basis for meditation, as a means of gaining a personal stability that allows
              one to practice beneficially. Another kind of moral logic is based on
              calculation. This might manifest as fear of retribution, whether in terms of
              karma or as sin against divine law, or, conversely, as hope for a reward. Even
              secular morality often has this attitude: if I am good to others when they need
              help, then I’m creating social capital for when I need help. Modern Western
              Buddhists often include in this kind of logic of morality a calculation about
              gaining happiness: if I am good to others, I create the conditions for my own
              mental well-being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pureland
              Buddhism has a different starting point. Pureland moral logic starts with the
              recognition that self-mastery sets the self against the self and thereby
              undermines the very thing it is attempting to do. Pureland instead aims to
              undermine the calculation involved in trying to master oneself. It does this by
              directing us to be grateful for the support of others for whatever good we are
              able to do. Our meritorious actions are only possible because of countless
              others who conspire unknowingly to guide us, help us, and create the conditions
              in which our typically confused and ambiguous efforts to do good don’t backfire
              on us. Pureland’s faith in other-power and nembutsu (keeping Buddha in mind)
              lays a basis for a radically different approach to spiritual practice than what
              many meditators bring to it. Let us, therefore, consider the possibility,
              whether or not one is a Pureland Buddhist, that Pureland ideas can reorient and
              enrich how we understand morality, resting it on a foundation that does not set
              the self against itself and that starts not from how we imagine we’d like to be
              but from how we actually are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the core of morality is morale; a person in good morale is less likely to act
              in an unprincipled manner. Morale is essentially a matter of faith, which is
              the mainspring of motivation. People do things that contribute to what they
              have faith in, be it a goal, an ideal, certain values, an institution, or some
              other base. Obviously, faith is not always positive. No doubt the Gestapo had
              faith in the supremacy of the Aryan race, for instance. Or as Dale Carnegie
              points out in the original self-help book How to Make Friends and Influence
              People, even Al Capone regarded himself as a good man who was simply
              implementing the values he believed in. This is all in line with basic Buddhist
              thinking that wickedness is mainly a matter of error. Acts that are akushala
              (mentally unskillful or unwholesome) rather than kushala (wholesome or
              skillful), to use the Indian terminology, are basically mistakes flowing from
              wrong belief rather than sins or disobedience to an overruling deity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Pali Buddhist texts contain repeated descriptions of sila, samadhi, and prajna.
              The moral guidelines (shila) precede descriptions of meditation (samadhi) that
              in turn precede descriptions of wisdom (prajna). It is common, therefore, to
              understand that morality is a foundation for meditation and that meditation is
              a foundation for wisdom. It is, however, also possible to read the causal
              relationship in the reverse direction, seeing morality as the surface level,
              dependent upon a rightly ordered mind, which in turn depends upon wisdom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Morality,
              then, is an outcome or consequence of a well-ordered mind, and such a mind is
              well-ordered because there is correct understanding of the true situation. It
              is not so much that morality leads to meditation and meditation to wisdom as
              that wisdom naturally leads to right-mindedness and that this, in turn, leads
              to the kind of behavior that even the uninitiated recognize as moral.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              wisdom is at the core of the Buddhist understanding of morality, what can we
              say about wisdom itself? In Buddhism, wisdom is closely related, on the one
              hand, to foresight and, on the other, to faith. (Foresight is, in fact, one
              implication of the word prajna.) Buddhas see the long term, which obviously has
              a good deal to do with morality. Immoral acts arise from unskillful intentions
              based on the kleshas (mental hindrances) of greed, hatred, and ignorance.
              Often, the harm brought by immoral acts comes only in the long run; many
              immoral acts have a short-term payoff. If they didn’t, no one would bother with
              them. Understanding the long-term consequences of our acts is a case of right
              orientation of mind leading naturally to rightly ordered behavior. As it says
              in the Dhammapada regarding our actions, “Mind is first. Mind made are they. If
              a person acts with a right mind, happiness clings to them like a shadow.” Faith
              and foresight go together, because to act on foresight is to act in faith. The
              Buddha prescribes a life of good faith.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Conceit
              says, “I can do this; I am a special case; I will not reap the consequences
              that others reap.” Wisdom says, “I cannot do this by my own power.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddhist notion of foresight is closely tied to the teaching of dependent
              origination, that everything arises in dependence on multiple causes and
              conditions. Things become possible only when the necessary conditions are in
              place, and right-mindedness and wisdom are necessary conditions for right
              behavior. The question is, therefore, how to understand this wisdom and
              right-mindedness. In East Asia, dependent origination underwent two distinctive
              and contrasting developments. One, deriving from the idealism of Yogacara
              philosophy, was the downplaying of the element of temporality. This ultimately
              led to the ideas about nonduality, interbeing, and non-arising that modern
              Western students of Mahayana are generally familiar with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              East Asian Buddhist practitioners, however, it was the second development that
              had more impact. This was the transformation of dependent origination into
              other-power, a natural development from the Buddha’s first two teachings. The
              Buddha’s first teaching was on the eightfold path and the four noble truths,
              which can be described as essentially a distillation of dependent origination.
              His second teaching was on non-self, within which we find the repeating refrain
              “this is not me, this is not mine, this is not myself.” If forces are at work
              in our lives that are not oneself, then they are other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              time, this led to a Buddhist approach that was based on a principle quite
              different from the idea of deliberately pursuing spiritual achievement. In this
              approach, the major forces at work were taken to be non-self, or what we
              moderns might call unconscious. This is completely in accord with the actual
              experience of anyone who tries to keep a New Year’s resolution. One makes a
              conscious resolve . . . and then something else happens. Positive psychology
              adherents would say that one did not try hard enough. Followers of Pureland
              Buddhism would say, however, that one is not capable of achieving one’s
              salvation by one’s own conscious effort. In fact, it is the very realization
              that one is so incapable that leads to the transformation that constitutes real
              Buddhist wisdom: namely, the awakening to non-self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Let
              us consider another example. It is notoriously difficult to give up smoking.
              Doing so requires persistence and, from a self-power perspective, one can say
              that what is needed is strong willpower. What actually motivates a person,
              however, is foresight. It is generally only when a person becomes strongly
              aware of the future consequences that he does something about the habit. Often
              this happens too late. If a person does not stop smoking until he has had one
              lung surgically removed, then we can readily say that he should have stopped
              earlier. Why didn’t he, and why can he do so now? One might say that it is
              because his fear is now strengthening his willpower. But what usually happens
              is actually the reverse: the evidence of surgery has brought home to the person
              the fact that he is mortal and that he cannot, by the power of self alone, defy
              natural processes. It is the realization that natural processes are stronger
              that paradoxically permits the person to do what he could not do before when
              his self felt more powerful. This is not a case of self-assertion but of
              self-diminishment; not one of achievement, but of submission.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Moral
              resolve is like this. A noble person does not do good because of willpower. She
              does it through a combination of, on the one hand, modesty about self, and, on
              the other hand, faith in a higher purpose, a higher meaning, in powers more
              potent than self-will. Such a person is not moral through gritted teeth. She is
              at ease in goodness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              revolves around the idea of refuge. One takes refuge not from a position of
              strength but from a position that acknowledges weakness. Right-mindedness is
              self-diminishment plus gratitude for higher guidance and assistance. For a
              Buddhist, the source of guidance and assistance is the Buddha, the dharma, and
              the sangha. Since the dharma is the teaching of Buddha and the sangha is the
              community of Buddha, the core of refuge is the Buddha himself.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Other-power
              thus came to mean allowing Buddha to work in, on, and for us by reducing our
              self-estimation, willfulness, ambition, and conceit. The core attitudes here
              are gratitude and assurance: gratitude for the awakened one who
              “has-come-to-us” (Japanese, Nyorai; Sanskrit, Tathagata), and assurance that
              comes from confidence in the power and process that result from our taking
              refuge therein. From such gratitude the traditional virtues such as generosity,
              energy, patience, balance, foresight, and morality flow naturally without special
              effort. From such assurance flows a confidence that takes away the need to
              grasp at short-term personal gain or be ever vigilant in self-defense. In this
              way, right-mindedness naturally gives rise to right behavior. It is not a case
              of achieving morality by will-power as a necessary basis for mental
              cultivation—such a method is self-defeating and ignores the inherent weakness
              of the individual. In sutra after sutra, the Buddha tries to combat the folly
              of conceit. Conceit says, “I can do this; I am a special case; I will not reap
              the consequences that others reap.” Wisdom says, “I cannot do this by my own
              power; I am not a special case; I, like all others, am subject to suffering and
              impermanence; all dharma is non-self.” For one who has such faith, morality is
              not rule-keeping, it is naturalness.</span></p>
