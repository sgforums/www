              <p> I have bought and keeping hamsters as pets. However, my religion is Buddhism and I was told by my relative that keeping pets is actually not allowed in Buddhism. I wonder whether it is true? I check sites on buddhism and little information on this topic is found. However, there was one site says:</p>
              <p>"According to the Bodhisattva precepts, it is discouraged to keep pets 
              in general. Keeping pets is a subtle kind of enslavement, and can lead 
              to attachment. Though many animals are domesticated, this domestication 
              is a result of continual enslavement over the centuries – that rendered 
              the animals no longer suitable for independent survival. Keeping pets 
              perpetuates this for generations to come. Could reverse domestication be
               possible?"</p>
              <p>Thus I went to find out about the Bodhisattva precepts and keeping pets does not really have direct impact on the precepts. Anyone got any ideas on this?</p>

              <p>I think sometime Buddhist spiritualize thing without proper understanding of modern living. There are many report in the west on how keeping a pet such as dog can make a old folk happy which lead to healthier body and mind.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, in Singapore, a lot of youngster kept pets out of fun when the fun period died down. They tend to dump and mistreat the pet. Some parents out of kindness will release the pets in parks which indirectly cause their death. Since the pets has been domesticated therefore they are unable to live due to the lack of survival skill. They end up being starve to death.</p>
              <p>I think one word of advise is if one want to keep a pet, please put in extra effort to look after it. Finally, I don't think there are any sutra that said you can't keep a pet. In fact, a lot of temple keep dogs and cats to guard the temple from burglary and rodent. Last round, I even saw a youtube how a nun kept a praying cat in Korean Buddhist temple.</p>
              <p>There is always two side to a coin. It depend on one's view. The important thing don't mistreat the pet and always keep the environment clean so that paraside will not be pass on to the owner and family.</p>

              <p>i think a real good monk/nun won't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purposely</span> buy a dog to guard "his" wealth. they go by affinity, if have, have, if don't have, don't have. :)</p>
              <p>read a good praxis, if his previous life never commit stealing, his belonging opening put on street also nobody will take. :)</p>
              <p>think some of the 'stray or unwanted' pet/cat/dog just came by affinity to the temple. and the temple can't reject affinity or sent them to SPCA to end their life.</p>
              <p>the key is also don't be <em>emotionally</em> attached to them, like u have a strong relationship with them bah.</p>

              <p>Thanks, helpful articles.Amazing how you always manage to pull these quotations out...</p>
              <p>I have always been a bit uneasy when seeing people being too attached to pets... esp when i see a fellow dharma friend being very attached to her pets.  But had never been able to vocalise out the problem. Thanks for clarifying.</p>

              <p>However, i ever saved a small red fish from office which would be flushed down the toilet if i don't and that started my aquarium .

              Either you heard incorrectly from your master or your master does not have good insight in buddhism. Arenâ€˜t we ourselves and many living beings still in lower realm. Buddha is not able to liberate beings of lower realm without having affinity with them. They are buddha by nature.

              <p>This is slightly off-topic, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.</p>
              <p>A few months ago, when I stumbled upon the website for the <a href="http://www.sanghatasutra.net/">Sanghata Sutra</a> , there was advice in it to recite this sutra in the presence of pets 
              or other animals in order to benefit these other sentient beings. </p>
              <p>Thinking
               aloud, I wonder if keeping pets depends really on the intention and 
              motivation behind doing it.  If it's to save them from certain death at 
              temporary animal shelters, then I would have thought it is ok.  If we 
              expose them to the Dharma by letting them listen to sutra recitations, 
              dharma talks and even play Buddhist chants for them, I would think the 
              effects are meritorious both for the owner and the pet.  But these are 
              just my personal opinions on the matter.</p>
              <p>One thing I definitely do
               agree with though, we should not get too attached to pets, in the same 
              way that we should not be too attached to even our own family members.  
              The Buddhist goal afterall, is liberation. </p>
              <p>(and if anyone has vowed to keep the Bodhisattva precepts, then of course one should abide by them.)</p>

              <p><br>last time when i have not learn buddhism, i used to live in kampong, our grand parent use to have a fish farm. got chicken, got pigs etcs. we also have dogs/cats, that come from no where. the dog were not so much in capivity as they can roam around freely. so it's ok. but we also got catch small animal, like birds and put then on cages. this is not okay. think. we are reaping some karma related to enclosure and family not getting along. now i never want to keep fishes. ignorant when young.</p>

              <p>I am certainly not attached to my fishes. In fact when they died, i would chant for them.</p>
              <p>I started keeping fishes because i wanted to save one fish. And it turns out the position i put the fish tank is good fengshui for me.</p>
              <p>However after some deaths, i decide to keep the minimum in my small fish tank. Just 4 suckerfish and it is more of a fengshui for my house than a pet now.</p>
              <p>I think if you keep a pet out of a good reason, like saving the pet ( the cat in the Korean temple) from hunger and death, it is a good karma and a good seed sow for the animals when you introduce them to your chanting.</p>

              <div>On casual observation, one would have seen the applicability of the two</div>
              <div>different set of vows, both are agarian cultures, one predominantly on</div>
              <div>agriculture, the other, pastoralist.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Owning or keeping pets have may have two unhelpful causes,one of  overly</p>
              <div>attachment, the other, indifference, leading to  impersonalisation.
              <div>People often have fuzzy lines between ownership and relationship with</div>
              <div>animals as pets. Also perception of different member of the family differs.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The type of pets we keep also depends ability to cope with demands of the </div>
              <div>relationship. Cats and dogs have different bondings as do breeds.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There is a need to consider the pet as a member of familly, as obligations</div>
              <div>to towards the animal is different if compared to an infant as inclusion to</div>
              <div>the family, even though the baby is tougher to raise. Thus when bringing </div>
              <div>a pet requires commitment and thus much thought. Some pets are more</div>
              <div>adaptive and some families are  more accommodating, however, the reverse is </div>
              <div>also true. Animals also provide companionship for the childless. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I am a sucker for animals, as a kid, I would enjoy playing with animals, feeding</div>
              <div>chicken, rearing fishes. I would try adopt feral dogs and cats, only to be told to </div>
              <div>return them back.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>One thing about loving animals is you develop empathy and responsibility over</div>
              <div>other sentient beings, you learn to be aware of them as being an individual,</div>
              <div>capable of emotions and idiosyncrasies.  Also animals are capable of returning</div>
              <div>our affectoins and also capable of being naughty. And also responsibility too, </div>
              <div>there was a British documentary on how to prevent their cats from bringing home</div>
              <div>prey which the cats brought back to their owners.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Another is the impermernance of life,  as pets are inevitability of shorter lifespan</div>
              <div>than us humans. The stronger the attachment, the more the loss is being felt.</div>
              <div>Now, the question is, do you wish to expose or shield your kids at an earlier</div>
              <div>age than necessary? Death is is something is dawned slowly on us.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Keeping fishes, note plurality,  as there is less connectivity with them, although</div>
              <div>i may be wrong, but, we live in two different environment, and also it is so very </div>
              <div>easy to flush them down the toilet when they die. However, it is also possible to observe individuality in each of them, even though they don't communicate with you</div>
