              <p>These people do not understand the true meaning of liberating animals in Buddhism. Don't worry, Buddhists who understand will not be affected by the bad press about liberating animals.</p>
              <p>Many temples organise going out to the open sea to liberate fishes. Some organise at least once a month. These fishes were released to their own habitat which will not endanger their life. Even if the fishes were caught, they will benefit from the 3 refuges which the monks and devotees had chanted on them. Only true Buddhists can understand the true meaning behind liberating animals and not just looking at what happen to them in this lifetime.</p>

              <p>The problem in present releasing of animals is that often the animals released do not belong the the environment, eg., they are imported from else where. In earlier times, if buy fish or birds from the hawker, chances are he caught from nearby. Releasing them causes no additional harm. I have seen land tortoises being released into the sea!</p>
              <p>Before, we do not know or understand, but now we do.  We can still practise  vegetarianism, if you wish!</p>

              <p>I notice that the people discrediting animal liberation often tends to shy away from using comparative statistics to substantiate their claim (no. of animals being harmed because of liberation vs. no. of animals being harmed because of hunting/fishing any time of the day). </p>
              <p>Hmm....I wonder why...Is this due to own eating habits as hinted by Weychin?  Can this be considered the pot calling the kettle black?</p>
              <p>Anyway, with regards to releasing animals into the wrong environment, there are free books and DVDs teaching us how to liberate correctly.  So, why the need to throw the baby out with the bathwater when we can actively propagate the correct animal liberation methods to the public?  So, why the need to insist that some isolated cases are representative of ALL the animal liberation exercises?</p>

              <p>Really inevitable?  Is animal liberation really more ecologically harmful than other activities, such as fishing?  Is it too much to ask for concrete evidence?  How could we just blindly accept information without questioning? </p>

              <p>Look at the feral species existing in Singapore, mainly the aquarium types, tortoises, sucker fishes, emperor fishes , arrowanas, luohan fishes,tiger barb(local/feral?) tilapias(food fish)  in water bodies. These have been seen and caught in singapore water. I remember seeing people releasing their pet tortoises in temple ponds since I was a kid. No exhaustive evidence just what I personally observed over the years. There is also a local published book listing the indigenious and feral fishes in Singapore, do you know the guppy and mosquito fish are not local fishes?! It is possible for animals to coexist, however, if they occuppy the same niche, the food source will dwindle and usually one species remains. Can you find our own local fighting fishes anymore or the gouramis or even the snakeheads?  </p>
              <p>The reason I brought these up, is that we can better understand the perception, and through education, maybe manage it  </p>
              <p>Releasing animals by individual is usually a small profile thing, a irregular timings,at the longkangs, reservoirs, for unwanted pets. Religious liberations has higher visibility with more people participationat more predictable periods,eg. Vesak Day, or some pujas, liberation of animals is sometimes also mention in the activities literature. What do you think?  </p>

              <p>Was the introduction of exotic species PURELY due to animal liberation; not due to people using these species as food for game fish or some (Buddhists/non-Buddhists) simply throwing away their pets?  Anyway, how could you simply conclude that the individuals performing animal liberation are just throwing away "unwanted pets"?  Have you seen ALL the animal liberation acts by individuals?    </p>
              <p>As for your final point, if you have read even one or two Buddhist books on animal liberation, you should know that we are encouraged to make liberation unpredictable and also not to keep the animals until a specific time for liberation!  My thoughts?  I think that people should at least do some basic research before commenting. </p>
              <p>Indeed, the environment is very important, so much so that a more thorough study should be conducted and appropriate prevention measures formulated; instead of simplistically pushing the blame.</p>
