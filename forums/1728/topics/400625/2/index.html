              <p>Was the introduction of exotic species PURELY due to animal
                  liberation; not due to people using these species as food
                  for game fish or some (Buddhists/non-Buddhists)
                  simply throwing away their pets?  Anyway, how could you
                  simply conclude that the individuals performing animal liberation
                  are just throwing away "unwanted pets"?  Have you seen ALL the
                  animal liberation acts by individuals?    </p>
              <p>As for your final point, if you have read even one or
                  two Buddhist books on animal liberation, you should know that
                  we are encouraged to make liberation unpredictable and also not to
                  keep the animals until a specific time for
                  liberation!  My thoughts?  I think that people
                  should at least do some basic research before commenting. </p>
              <p>Indeed, the environment is very important, so much so
                  that a more thorough study should be conducted and
                  appropriate prevention measures formulated; instead of

              <p><br>So the introduction of these species were due to animal liberation?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>If not, seems as if you are grasping at straws, trying to pull in anything that can discredit animal liberation.  For someone claiming to be "not against animal liberation", this kind of action is contradictory.  In addition, you clearly have not read any of the animal liberation books, as evident in your avoidance of my charge in my previous post. </p>
              <p>Now, this is not a matter of whether or not you are against animal liberation but that you are trying to propagate a view despite having insufficient evidence or knowledge - you did not even know the standard animal liberation practice of Buddhist organisations/individual Buddhists.  This brings the question of why you are doing this.  Can you answer this directly without trying to sidestep?</p>
              <p>If you seriously care for the environment, shouldn't a more thorough study should be conducted and appropriate prevention measures formulated; instead of simplistically pushing the blame? </p>

              <p>It would have been a very Happy Vesak Day indeed, had it not been slightly marred by the Channel 8 news.  It once again emphasised that animal liberation has decreased and no longer the focus of some temples.</p>
              <p>Now, is animal liberation really as bad as portrayed?  Where did they get the statistics and how was the sample size derived?</p>
              <p> How many people do you see liberating animals at the beach everyday?  More than the people fishing there (5 or 6 everyday I think)?  I think there are more people fishing at any time than people freeing animals and yet, animal liberation is been portrayed in a bad light.  Is fishing really more environmentally friendly? </p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,</p>
              <p>Hmmm i happen to know that a temple cancelled the life liberation activity due to oil spill incident.</p>
              <p>I see ur points - introducing other species ( esp in large quantity ) will affect the ecological balance right?</p>
              <p>Sometime, life liberation can be done appropriately. I have attended some life liberation activities involving fishes and crabs before. I can't really say i represent the organisers but from my own understanding....</p>
              <p>The organiser has been doing for some years and they know what they are doing. They understand what are the appropriate conditions and where to release those fishes/crabs... these fishes will eventually swim away to the sea or other places. If we don't save those animals, they will surely be eaten by us. So life liberation is about 'saving life'.  The best like what u say is to become a vegetarian.</p>

              <p>For your information, I have participated in animal liberation in the religious context, and I have also released animals to prevent it from becoming food on the table!</p>
              <p>In order to find a suitable location, in need to look for silty freshwater environment which afford the animal it's natural way of getting food, ambush, concealment in the sand, clear water to allow clear vision of prey, available prey and sufficient shallow water level for it reach to the surface  to breathe. For that, I have to deep in a forested area by foot for 1 hour.</p>
              <p>I am not against animal liberation, I am against irresponsible animal release!  </p>
              <p>If you want show that animal release is not harmful, act in responsible manner, more importantly,show that animal liberation is done in responsible manner by responsible, mature, rational people.</p>
              <p>For example when releasing mud crabs, typical habitat is the mangrove, estuarine areas within the surf line.  Fishes may be pelagic or benthic, fully saltwater or euryhaline. Where and when to release them will determine mortality rates.</p>
              <p>For proponents of animal liberation, why don't  you start a new topic to illustrate the proper responsible and mature manner of releasing animals acceptable to all? Make friends, not adversaries !    </p>
              <p>If we cannot even concur on this point, to show animal release can be done with care and responsibilty,   you are wasting time.</p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,</p>
              <p>Hmmm i happen to know that a temple cancelled the life
              liberation activity due to oil spill incident.</p>
              <p>I see ur points - introducing other species ( esp in large
              quantity ) will affect the ecological balance right?</p>
              <p>Sometime, life liberation can be done
              appropriately. I have attended some life liberation activities
              involving fishes and crabs before. I can't really say i represent
              the organisers but from my own understanding....</p>
              <p>The organiser has been doing for some years and they know what
              they are doing. They understand what are the appropriate conditions
              and where to release those fishes/crabs... these fishes will
              eventually swim away to the sea or other places. If we don't save
              those animals, they will surely be eaten by us. So life
              liberation is about 'saving life'.  The best like what u say
              is to become a vegetarian.</p>

              <p>Why do you keep on sidestepping my main issue
                                                  - <strong>evidence</strong>?  If you insist that animal liberation is bad for the environment and animals themselves, the onus is on you to prove it. </p>
              <p>However, all you have done is to shift from stand to stand while avoiding my call for evidence and critical thinking.  It seems as if you are trying to hide that fact that the main stand of animal liberation opponents is flimsy to begin with - there is simply not enough concrete evidence supporting the argument. </p>
              <p>Shall we have put all our posts into a separate thread for debating on the reasoning behind the argument propagated by the animal liberation opponents?  Can moderator help?  Thanks.</p>

              <p>For your information, I have participated in animal liberation in the religious context, and I have also released animals to prevent it from becoming food on the table!</p>
              <p>In order to find a suitable location, in need to look for silty freshwater environment which afford the animal it's natural way of getting food, ambush, concealment in the sand, clear water to allow clear vision of prey, available prey and sufficient shallow water level for it reach to the surface  to breathe. For that, I have to deep in a forested area by foot for 1 hour.</p>
              <p>I am not against animal liberation, I am against irresponsible animal release!  </p>
              <p>If you want show that animal release is not harmful, act in responsible manner, more importantly,show that animal liberation is done in responsible manner by responsible, mature, rational people.</p>
              <p>For example when releasing mud crabs, typical habitat is the mangrove, estuarine areas within the surf line.  Fishes may be pelagic or benthic, fully saltwater or euryhaline. Where and when to release them will determine mortality rates.</p>
              <p>For proponents of animal liberation, why don't  you start a new topic to illustrate the proper responsible and mature manner of releasing animals acceptable to all? Make friends, not adversaries !    </p>
              <p>If we cannot even concur on this point, to show animal release can be done with care and responsibilty,   you are wasting time.</p>
