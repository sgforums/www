              <p>Not sure if this is the correct forum to post in as it is not

              <p>first of all, let me clarify</p>
              <p>1. i am not anti-buddhist, i would like to apologize beforehand
                                              to anyone who find my style of
                                              writing offending to buddhists</p>
              <p>2. i am just anti-vegetarian, as to why, it is a story for
                                              another thread another time</p>
              <p>True Story</p>
              <p>I have a very good friend, one of my best friend if you will who
                                              turn into a pussy after becoming a vegetarian. 2 years ago,
                                              his baby daughter became very sick and he was told that she would
                                              not survive for long. As he and his family is
                                              buddhist/taoist, (i am not sure of the distinction between the
                                              two) he made a promise to buddha/kwan yin/ kwan kong/ the fat
                                              smiling god in between kwan yin and kwan kong/the begger god(ji
                                              kong, i think) and a bunch of other deities that he would
                                              become a vegetarian if his daughter survives. For some reason she
                                              did so he became a vegetarian.</p>
              <p>now, i have known him since we were still in secondary school
                                              and after graduation, we join the same company and worked in the
                                              same department. you can say that i know him inside out. He was a
                                              very active person who would stand up for people he care about and
                                              for his beliefs.</p>
              <p>Some months later after becoming a vegetarian, his character
                                              completely change. He became very tired looking, always coming to
                                              work late, complaining of fatigue. He even start to let things
                                              slide when people challange his core beliefs.</p>
              <p>his wife has also commented on his changes, saying that he did
                                              not stand up for her when some guys tried to flirt with her in
                                              front of him, saying that he does not need to act like a monk just
                                              because he eats like a monk (at first i did not think much into
                                              this but recently, she confided in me that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shes not getting enough
                                              sex and she ask me for some but i refuse saying shes my
                                              friend's wife but actually i just find her not that hot</strong></span>).</p>
              <p>being a vegetarian has turn my friend into a pussy who cannot
                                              sexually satisfy his wife, becoming a weak and tired slacker who
                                              let things slide. it has seriously affected his career
                                              and family in a negative way.</p>
              <p>any similar stories to share?</p>
              <p>anyway to help my friend on this?</p>

              <p>I haven't been following the MCK arguments nor am I very familiar with MCK teachings... but my stance is this.</p>
              <p>If MCK is saying the foundational aspect of morality of religions are similar, then I agree that there is in fact a lot of similarities. Morality, and teachings like the 4 brahma viharas, are not perculiar to Buddhism at all. Also, there would not have been a need for Buddhism at all if Buddha were just to teach these 'foundational' aspects as they have been covered elsewhere... even though they are very important.</p>
              <p>But if MCK is equating all religions as totally similar, then I do not agree, though I do not think MCK said this.</p>
              <p>Now it is up to people to discern for themselves.... don't just follow people's critiques (which often quotes people out of context) but go and listen to MCK teachings and judge for yourself.</p>
