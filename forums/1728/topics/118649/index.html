            <div class='col-md body'>There are many people who do not consider Buddhism a religion, partly because Buddhists does not worship anyone, let alone any idols or images. We do not worship deities, gods, spirits, God, or Buddha. Even the Buddha did not claim to be god, neither do we treat him as god, but the wisest teacher who relieves our sufferings of samsara, gives us insight on life, give us the dharma that leads to bliss and joyfulness, and Wisdom.<br><br>There are Buddhist figures that appear in other religions, the most commonly known one is Guan Yin. Guan Yin is commonly worshipped by the Taoists. However there is a lot of difference between Taoism nowadays and Buddhism. Guan Yin, along with other deities like the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor in Taoism actually derives from Buddhism, one heavenly king we call Lord Sakra. As the Lord Sakra is not yet enlightened, we do not take refuge in him, neither do we worship him, but we pay reverence and repsect to the heavenly deity also. Other characters like Ji Gong, is also from Buddhism. However it is protrayed very differently from what it really was. Ji Gong was an enlightened saint [an Arhant]. He is being freed from Samsara and enters Nirvana after his death. He is is no longer trapped in the rebirth cycle of Samsara. However very unfortunately some people worships Ji Gong as a form of spirit-deity. This is a very deluded view. The spirit/ghost realm is one of the 3 lower realms, the Arhant who is free from samsara, how could he possibly be reborn in the lower realm?<br><br>We take refuge in the Triple Jems, which are: Buddha, Buddhadharma [truths &amp; teachings], and the Sangha [community of monks]. In Buddhism, Guan Shir Yin Pu Sa [Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva] is a role model of the Mahabodhisattva [Da Pu Sa], someone whom we should learn from, one who seeks liberation himself and also helps liberate the other sentient beings out of great compassion.<br><br>We revere our world honoured one, Buddha Shakyamuni, and other Buddhist Bodhisattvas and Saints (Arhants) whom set an example for us on the path towards Enlightenment. We bow to them in reverence respect, also a practise of eliminating the "Ego-Form", but we do not really worship them like in other religions. Definitely Buddhists do not engage in Idol-Worshipping, which is clearly stated in the Diamond Sutra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"If one sees me in forms,<br>If one seeks me in sounds,<br>He practices a deviant way,<br>And cannot see the Tathagata." - Buddha</span><br><br>In fact forms and statues of Buddhas are a later development of Buddhism and did not appear at the very beginning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Buddhism arrived in China, people adapted it to the widely practised Chinese folklore and culture, whereas in fact in Buddhism, no one really worship any god or so.<br><br>Thats why there is always confusion because people see Chinese going to temples and pray, at places like the Guan Yin Temple in Waterloo Street.<br><br>But real Buddhists are the people who followed Buddhism in depth and chant sutras, instead of offering joss sticks.<br><br>To add, there is this interesting thing i read from some books on Chinese religion, whereas they say Chinese do not have a single defining religion, but beliefs are based on Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folklore.<br><br>Chinese folklore is the one that give us Chinese New Year and Qing Ming Festival...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chanting sutra is not as good as understanding sutras. Understanding sutras is not as good as truly penetrating the essence of the sutra into insights. Realising the truth. However this is not to say that the effort put in chanting sutras is no use. In my own understandings, chanting sutras is very important as although you have no understanding of the sutra, maybe one day in meditation you may realise it. It is because it has planted a Dharma seed in you.<br><br>And after realising the truth, you still must let go to any trace of attachments and thoughts to the truth. Only then can you advance in the Buddha path.<br><br>Chinese Buddhism used to be very pure but in recent few centuries it has been affected by degeneration. Chinese Buddhism is largely intact with little degeneration in places like Taiwan. Singapore is also generally OK.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More or less in all these areas they have suffered degeneration to some level, although not as bad as other places.<br><br>In Tibet the main problem is the persecution from the Chinese decades ago, while in Japan there are certain newly formed groups that have a not really a correct conception of the Buddhadharma. But I particularly like the Japanese Zen culture, just watched a video about the jap zen monks. Very strict routine... those people are really practising.</div>
