              <p>Every night, before going to bed, do Vajrasattva practice, reciting one mala, a half mala, or at least twenty-one repetitions of the long mantra. If you can combine your recitation with prostrations, it will be very, very powerful; two powerful practices combined. You will collect extensive merit and purify unbelievably heavy karma. Otherwise, you can do your Vajrasattva practice while seated. It depends on whether or not you have the opportunity to do prostrations and on how you feel. You can decide for yourself. You can begin your evening Vajrasattva practice with prostrations to the thirty-five Confession Buddhas, going straight through and not necessarily repeating each buddha’s name over and over with each prostration as in the morning practice, that will be very powerful because reciting each buddha’s name even once purifies many thousands of eons of negative karma. This practice is unbelievably powerful. OM VAJRASATTVA SAMAYA MANUPALAYA / VAJRASATTVA TVENOPATISHTHA / DRIDHO ME BHAVA / SUTOSHYO ME BHAVA / SUPOSHYO ME BHAVA / ANURAKTO ME BHAVA / SARVA SIDDHIM ME PRAYACCHA / SARVA KARMA SU CHAME / CHITTAM SHRIYAM KURU HUM / HA HA HA HA HO / BHAGAVAN SARVA TATHAGATA / VAJRA MAME MUNCHA / VAJRA BHAVA MAHA SAMAYA SATTVA AH HUM PHAT There are three ways to make purification while reciting the mantra. One can do all three or only one, whatever is most comfortable and depending on one’s individual practice. The first method Visualize the white blissful kundalini energy flows down from Vajrasattva father/mother in union into your central channel. It spreads throughout your nervous system, flowing very strongly like water coming from a hose or like a very powerful shower, and flushes out all negativities of your body, speech, and mind through the openings and pores of the lower part of your body. All this negative energy is expelled in the form of snakes, scorpions, ants, long worms, etc. or as black tar or dirty black oil. Feel that you are completely purified, clean clear, especially your gross negativities, and overcome with blissful energy.</p>
              <p>The second method The blissful kundalini energy slowly fills your body starting from below. As the level of amrita rises, your negativities start to rise as well, floating on top of the nectar, like oil floating on water. Your negativities and defilements are slowly pushed upward by the pure amrita kundalini energy; it gradually overflows out of your body through all your upper orifices and your crown chakra. You experience great bliss.</p>
              <p>The third method An immense amount of powerful light energy, limitless blissful kundalini energy in the form of light, radiates from Vajrasattva’s heart. Immediately as it makes contact with your crown chakra, the negative energy, especially your ignorant attachment energy, completely disappears, just as when a bright light is switched on in a dark room, the darkness instantly and completely disappears. You cannot say that the darkness leaves through the window or through the door when a light is turned on. It just disappears, no longer existing anywhere at all.</p>
              <p>Detailed explanation of the meaning of the mantra</p>
              <p>OM - the qualities of buddha’s holy body, speech, and mind; all that is auspicious and of great value VAJRA SATTVA - the being who has the wisdom of inseparable bliss and emptiness SAMAYA - a pledge that must not be transgressed MANU PALAYA - lead me along the path you took to enlightenment VAJRA SATTVA TVENOPATISHTHA - make me abide closer to Vajrasattva’s vajra holy mind DRIDHO ME BHAVA - please grant me a firm and stable realization of the ultimate nature of phenomena SUTOSHYO ME BHAVA - please grant me the blessing of being extremely pleased with me SUPOSHYO ME BHAVA - bless me with the nature of well-developed great bliss ANURAKTO ME BHAVA - bless me with the nature of the love that leads me to your state SARVA SIDDHIM ME PRAYACCHA - please grant all powerful attainments SARVA KARMA SUCHAME - please grant all virtuous actions CHITTAM SHRIYAM KURU - please grant your glorious qualities HUM - the vajra holy mind HA HA HA HA HOH - the five transcendental wisdoms BHAGAVAN - one who has destroyed every obscuration, attained all realizations, and passed beyond suffering SARVA TATHAGATA VAJRA - all those who have realized emptiness, knowing things just as they are MAME MUNCHA do not abandon me VAJRA BHAVA - the nature of indestructible inseparability MAHA SAMAYA SATTVA - the great pledge being; the great being who has the pledge, the vajra holy mind AH - the vajra holy speech HUM - the transcendental wisdom of great bliss PHAT - clarifying the transcendental wisdom of inseparable bliss and emptiness and destroying the dualistic mind that obstructs it</p>
