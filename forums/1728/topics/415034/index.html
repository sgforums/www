              <p>VASUBANDHU'S CONVERSION</p>
              <p>"Asanga, teacher of the Law [Dharma], saw that his younger brother was endowed with an intelligence surpassing that of others, his knowledge being deep and wide, and himself well-versed in esoteric and exoteric doctrines. He was afraid that the latter might compose a <em>sastra</em> and crush the Mahayana. He was living then in the land of the Hero (Purusa-pura) and sent a messenger to Vasubandhu in Ayodhya with the following message: "I am seriously ill at present. You had better attend to me quickly." Vasubandhu followed the messenger to his native land, saw his brother and inquired what was the cause of his illness. He answered: "I have now a serious disease of the heart, which arose on account of you." Vasubandhu again asked: "Why do you say on account of me?" He answered: "You do not believe in the Mahayana and are always attacking and discrediting it. For this wickedness you will be sure to sink forever in a miserable Life. I am now grieved and troubled for your sake to such an extent that my life will no long survive. On hearing this Vasubandhu was surprised and alarmed and asked his brother to expound the Mahayana for him. He then gave him a concise explanation of the essential principles of the Mahayana. Thereupon the Teacher of the Law (Vasubandhu), who was possessed of clear intelligence and especially of deep insight, became at once convinced that the truth of the Mahayana excelled even that of the Hinayana.</p>
              <p>"He then fully investigated, under his brother, the principles of the Mahayana. Soon after he became as thoroughly acquainted with the whole as his brother was. When its meaning was already clear to him, he would meditate on it. From the beginning to the end everything was perfectly in accordance with the truth, there being nothing contradictory to it. For the first time he realized that the Hinayana was wrong and the Mahayana right. If there were no Mahayana, then (he thought) there would be no path (<em>marga</em>) and no fruition (<em>phala</em>) of the Tri-yana [Three Vehicles]. Since he formerly did harm by speaking ill of the Mahayana, in which he then had no faith, he was now afraid that he might fall into a miserable life on account of that wickedness. He deeply reproached himself and earnestly repented of his previous fault. He approached his brother and confessed his error, saying: 'I now desire to make a confession. I do not know by what means I can be pardoned for my former slander.' He said (further): 'I formerly did harm speaking ill (of the truth) by means of my tongue. I will now cut out my tongue in order to atone for my crime.' His brother answered: 'Even if you cut out your tongue a thousand times, you cannot wipe out your crime. If you really want to wipe out your crime, you must find some other means.' Thereupon he asked his brother to explain the means of wiping out the offence. The latter said: 'Your tongue was able to speak very skillfully and effectively against the Mahayana, and thus discredit it. If you want to wipe out your offence, you must now propound the Mahayana equally skillfully and effectively.'" (<em>The Life of Vasubandhu</em>, J. Takakusu, tr., pp. 290-292)</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Does such a place really exist? Or is it just an imagination of our mind? If such slandering does occur, whether it is within the religion itself, or between religions, it is usually due to a poor understanding of the teachings and practices of the religion, and all involved should sit down and try to straighten thing out. Otherwise, there may not be any need to wait till you are dead to go to hell. Likely, all hell would break loose long before then. </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>My personal believe is that, there is not even a need to wait till death to know what hell is. Most, if not all of us, are already living it in our daily life, not just hell, but all the other 5 realms of existence as well. Leave behind the cycle of birth and death, and the word ‘hell’, would also disappear from our vocabulary. </span></p>

              <p>Human beings were being squeezed out between the piece of "sandwish" of their mother's womb. The pain that they have gone through between that "sandwish", was no longer palpable. Similarly, samsaric beings have been in / out of hells and forgotten their suffering, according to Earthstore Bodhisavattas Sutra.</p>
