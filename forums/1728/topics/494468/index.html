              trips, but China...</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ilaria Maria Sala 13 Aug 2017 South China Morning Post</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As the pontiff prepares for his fourth visit to Asia, the
              Vatican’s hopes for rapprochement with Beijing appear as distant as ever</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When Pope Francis touches down in Asia this November, for his
              fourth visit to the region in as many years, it will do much to underline his
              regard for the peripheries of the traditional Catholic world. Yet, however
              closely he embraces the region, his hopes of forging a stronger relationship
              with China appear likely to remain – at least for now – an unanswered prayer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The visit, still not officially announced for the Myanmar
              leg, but which should take place from November 23 to December 8, will make
              Francis the first pontiff in history to visit Myanmar and only the second to
              visit Bangladesh, after Pope John Paul II’s 1986 trip to Dhaka.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“This confirms the openness with which the Holy Father looks
              to Asia,” said Father Sergio Ticozzi, of Hong Kong’s Holy Spirit Seminary, “not
              only to China, but also to Vietnam, Bangladesh and Myanmar: it is very
              significant, since it shows how much the Holy See is aware that the future of
              the world lies in Asia.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The visit comes after an invitation extended to the pontiff
              by Myanmar’s president, Htin Kyaw, in May, when the two countries formally
              established diplomatic relations during State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi’s
              visit to Italy and the Vatican. While the Pope’s schedule has been cleared for
              the above dates, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Myanmar still has not
              officially announced the visit, due to concerns of possible unrest from
              “ultra-nationalists elements”, according to one source.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the time, the Pope expressed his concern for the situation
              in Rakhine State in northern Myanmar, where the Rohingya, a majority Muslim
              community in a predominantly Buddhist country, have faced violence and what the
              UN and rights groups say may amount to crimes against humanity by the army.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to reports, the State Counsellor did not change her
              stance on the issue – she denies claims of ethnic cleansing on behalf of the
              security forces – even in front of the Holy Father, who, nevertheless, offered
              his assistance for “non-violent peace building”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Father Augustine Zaw Aung, a Catholic priest in Kachin, said
              the visit was “to strengthen the ties just established between the Vatican and
              Myanmar” at a time when Myanmar was still seeking “support for its efforts to
              democratise amid many political, ethnic and religious conflicts within the
              country”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are about 700,000 Catholics in Myanmar – roughly 1 per
              cent of the total population – mostly in the northern states, which are
              predominantly populated by minority ethnic groups.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Father Ticozzi said the visit would give them “increased
              visibility” and that such groups needed the support of the church.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The visit will be an invitation to the Bamar [the dominant
              ethnic group in the country] to solve the ongoing problems with the national
              ethnic minorities,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Rohingya, who number more than one million, have been
              denied citizenship by Myanmar, which considers them “illegal immigrants” from
              bordering Bangladesh, despite their having lived in the country for
              generations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meanwhile, in Dhaka, the first Bangladeshi Cardinal, Patrick
              D’Rozario, expressed joy at the forthcoming visit, telling the Catholic
              newspaper Crux Now that “Bangladesh is a church of the poor, for the poor, poor
              in spirit, but there is a richness in our poverty.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">About 0.5 per cent of Bangladesh’s population is Christian –
              the country is about 90 per cent Muslim. For Dhaka, a visit by the Pope after
              the terrorist attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery which left 29 people dead in
              July last year is also a way to emphasise the country is not in the throes of
              terrorism or religious fundamentalism. “Bangladesh is a land of peace,”
              D’Rozario told the Italian daily La Stampa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since ascending to the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has
              visited Asia three times: South Korea in 2014, and Sri Lanka and the
              Philippines in 2015. He has also sanctified Joseph Vaz, an Oratorian priest and
              missionary who died in 1711 and is now the first Sri Lankan saint. Last year,
              Pope Francis received Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang at the Vatican. And
              this year he approved the beatification of Takayama Ukon, the first samurai to
              be given the honour.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In all this renewed courting of Asia, the Vatican – and the
              Argentine-born pope in particular – has made no mystery of its greatest
              ambition: the hope of opening formal diplomatic relations with China. Exactly
              one year ago, press reports and Vatican statements seemed to indicate that a
              big announcement on the diplomatic relations between the two was imminent.
              Beijing and the Vatican have been estranged since 1951, when China expelled all
              missionaries and Vatican representatives from the country, and the Vatican’s
              official diplomatic mission – called a nunciature – was moved to Taipei.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Despite many attempts at a rapprochement, some key
              contentions remain unresolved. Beijing’s interest in opening its doors to full
              diplomatic Vatican representation in its territory appears moderate, at best.
              One of the main issues is the ordainment of bishops, a prerogative of the
              Vatican that China does not recognise. Instead, Chinese bishops are ordained by
              the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, a parallel church seen as
              illegitimate by the Holy See. This means that China, where Catholicism is one
              of five officially recognised religions (alongside Protestantism, Buddhism,
              Islam and Daoism), has both the Patriotic Church, and what is known as the
              Underground Church, which is faithful to the Pope but not deemed legal by the national
              authorities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When China allowed the papal plane to transit through Chinese
              air space for his visit to South Korea in 2014, Pope Francis hailed the
              decision as a major step forward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yet that remains the closest he has ever got to the country
              itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even as countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, and even
              Communist Vietnam recognise a clear diplomatic benefit to ties with the
              Catholic state, Beijing seems to have grown only more cautious in its approach
              to organised religion – and appears in no rush to grant greater influence
              within its borders to a man it considers simply as a foreign head of state.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And with observers ruling out any progress on the diplomatic
              front before the 19th Communist Party Congress this autumn, the Vatican’s hopes
              for rapprochement seem as distant as ever.</span></p>
