            <div class='col-md body'>sorie the other topic is close, so i reply here.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by path_seeker:<br>My view is that the email was written by someone who have absolutely no clue of what he's writing, as if he knew it all about Buddhist, but seems like it's not a discussion which was in his email, rather a one way criticising of Buddhism.<br><br>Anyway, agree that there's no point emailing back, because that will only turn a "discussion" into an argument.  The email is a good exhibit of the writer's level of maturity.</blockquote>ya if i criticise/argue them back..then i'll be no better than them. get wat i mean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>remember the case of Upali (a former Jain), Buddha never wish to converts Upali. okok..i re-quote:<br><br><blockquote>There is one story of Upali, a great Jain disciple and debator. See<br>what Buddha said.<br><br>quote:<br>------------------------<br>Upali was one of the chief followers of the Jain master, Mahavira. Because of his intelligence, Upali often appeared in public debates on behalf of the Jains.<br><br>There was one incident where Upali had a debate with the Buddha. At<br>the end of the debate, Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teachings that he asked to be the Enlightened One's follower. "Venerable Sir, please allow me to be your follower".<br><br>To that, the Buddha answered, "Upali, you are at the height of your emotions. Go home and reconsider it carefully before you ask me again".<br><br>Upali was extremely impressed, "If it was any other guru, he will parade a banner saying, 'Mahavira's chief lay-disciple has become my follower'. But you, Venerable Sir, you asked me to go home and reconsider. Now, I want to be your follower even more. I will not stand up until you accept me".<br><br><strong>Finally, the Buddha agreed to accept Upali, under one condition, "Upali, as a Jain, you have always given alms to Jain monks. When you become my follower, you will CONTINUE to give alms to Jain monks. This is my condition".</strong><br><br>Upali agreed to this condition.</blockquote>/\<br><br></div>

Buddha always respect all the many religions in India during that time. He never even criticize them in anyway. Rare and understanding was Buddha.

The Buddha did criticise the religious and social context of India during his time. For example he was very vocal towards aspects of extreme ascetism e.g. Dog duty ascetism, irrational worship, traditional views, caste systems as well as the lesser arts (fortune telling etc) and systems of governances. His form of criticism are usually in the form of "by engaging in such thoughts and acts, one would move to a woeful plane". It can be easily seen as a criticism.<br><br>There are easily 2 or 3 angles of interpretation of the quoted Dalai Lama's words. For example with regards to reverse psychology, the role of Buddhism as a godless religion attractive to theistic followers as well as inner reflection.<br><br>Above all, I would use Embracing Change in place of religious conversion. We can "Help" people to recognize and embrace changes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Literally all Buddha's disciples were from other religions. How can one say Buddha didn't convert people?<br><br>But from what I see, Buddha's way of converting people, unlike the nowadays method of just keep yakking and yakking. In fact, if one studies the sutra, it won't be difficult to see that Buddha only speak when there was a need to. His actions speak for himself.<br><br>Lord Buddha's way of converting people was more of like using His own action and speech as example to convince people. The metta aura the surrounded Him was due to His loving-kindness nature; His loving speech comforting others, etc.<br><br>To summarise, action speaks louder than words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is difficult to ask a christian to practise buddhism while not giving up the believes like "god can clear your sins", "non-believer go to hell" and even some evangelist thoughts. Sooner or later, they still have to face the question of whether there is karma and reincarnation.<br><br>Dalai Lama and his exile government getting much help from the western country, to maintain good relationship, he can't encourage the converting of christian to buddhism. This we have to understand.<br><br>But since our situation is different from him, we should practise the buddha's way. To let people hear the dharma and knowing the truth is a compassion act.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed with all.<br><br>remind me that Elder Moggallana and Shariputra were also from 'other cult' (practice some sort of ascetism) before they tot it was not right. then they met a Buddha's disciple and was slowly lead to Buddhadharma which was more convincing and righteous.<br>regarding on traditional views, it depends. there are still ways to bend a little. of cos if it's of breaking the precepts and harming others &amp; oneself, then it's not right.<br>there are things that are not aceptable to some countries, like collecting alms for example. in China, the emperors and people regard monks as holy, hence not allow them to go around collecting alms, like beggars per se.<br>and like in the west, bowing to monk. they also find it awkward.<br>so there are some give and take.<br><br>/\<br></div>
