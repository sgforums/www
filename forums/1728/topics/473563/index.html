              hi all, have some questions here, wonder what are your opinions and buddhism's position on them.
              
              1) is it true that the state of our ancestors has some influence on the current state of our lives? that is, if our ancestors are experiencing suffering, to what extent does it influence our lives, if at all? for example would the family undergo hardship, poverty, ill health, unhappiness etc and so on?
              
              2) is it a must to 'pray' to ancestors in order to have a smooth sailing life? 
              
              3) Do we have to seek blessings from our ancestors first, before seeking blessings from bodhisattvas? If ancestors are not at peace, we also won't be at peace. Is this true?
              
              4) Do ancestors' tablets and graves have to be taken care of in order for future descendants to live in peace? 
              
              Thanks all.

              <p>If your ancestor is suffering in hell, the descendant life won;t be too good. A monk once told me to pay respect to my ancestor first before praying to anything else.</p>

              The Buddhist position is that we have all been through countless rebirth since beginningless time. Among these countless rebirth, all sentient beings have been our parents at least once in previous lives. The cockroach/rat/pest that you see was once our parent in previous live. We are just ignorant to not see it. Or we refused to acknowledge it.
              
              From this perspective, every sentient beings is your ancestor. How you treat all other sentient beings is how you will treat your ancestor. 
              
              This may not have directly answered your query. But it has planted a perspective in your doubts. It is only whether you want to accept it. If you accept it, you will know what to do. :)

              <p>1) each of you walk your own paths, their suffering and karma is their own path and does not hinder you.<br><br>2)
                                                           no. buddhists (as opposed to ming jian xing yang or chinese ancestor 
                                                          worship, which is not buddhism) do not worship or pray to ancestors, 
                                                          however we can bow in respect to our ancestors just like we can (should)
                                                           respect our elders. unless your elder/ancestor is a very evil person 
                                                          like hitler etc, then it is different story</p>
              <p>3) not true. first
                                                           of all you do not know where you ancestor has been reborn to. in 
                                                          buddhism there are six realms of samsara in which all 
                                                          unenlightened/unliberated beings are reborn according to their karma 
                                                          after death. only enlightened + liberated beings can escape such a 
                                                          cycle.<br><br>the six realms of rebirth are:</p>
              <p>(three lower realms:)</p>
              <p>hell, animal, ghost</p>
              <p>(three higher realms:)</p>
              <p>asura, human, deva (celestial beings/heaven)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those
                                                           with wholesome karmas can be reborn human and deva realm, those with 
                                                          unwholesome karmas are usually reborn in lower realms. Now if your 
                                                          ancestors are not at peace, it generally means they have been reborn in 
                                                          lower realms - hell or ghost or animal realm. If they have ended up in 
                                                          such states of suffering, how can they bring you blessings and 
                                                          happiness? They themselves lack blessing and happiness. On the other hand even if they are suffering in their next lives, how can their suffering affect your current life? They are experiencing the effects of their own individual karmas, they will not affect your life. You have your own life and karma to live... and you are making your own life and karma (which can ripen in the future) as you live. Each person is the heir of their own deeds/karma and the results are only to be experienced by that person, not by any others.<br><br>Even if they are
                                                           reborn in deva realm, there is not much they can do about us because we
                                                           have our own life and karmas to experience. We cannot expect that devas be able to prevent us from getting old, getting sick and dying - it is just a truth of life. They cannot stop suffering from happening and they cannot prevent our karmas from ripening, because karma is a natural law. Those celestial beings themselves cannot escape the effects of karma.<br><br>Even devas themselves are not free from suffering, birth, ageing and death - they die after a very long lifespan of enjoyment, and are then reborn - perhaps somewhere else, perhaps even in the lower realms depending on their karma. Being reborn in a heavenly 
                                                          realm is certainly better than being reborn in the three lower realms, 
                                                          that is why it is important that we avoid unwholesome deeds/karmas and 
                                                          keep the five precepts, do the ten wholesome deeds etc - which is the 
                                                          cause of favourable rebirths. However this is still not the ultimate. 
                                                          Even deva realm or rebirth in heaven is not the ultimate aim of a 
                                                          Buddhist, because they are temporary births, are subject to death and 
                                                          passing away. There is no true and lasting safety and security in the six realms of samsara.<br><br>We (Buddhists) seek to be liberated from samsara, from 
                                                          suffering, from mental afflictions of craving, aggression/anger and 
                                                          delusion. We seek to be free from all sufferings and attachments... to 
                                                          find the ultimate bliss and peace of Nirvana.<br><br>That is only 
                                                          possible by learning and practising the Dharma. And that is the ultimate
                                                           blessing that no one can give you but you yourself, by learning and 
                                                          practising the Dharma. Only you yourself can find yourself the ultimate 
                                                          happiness. The state of enlightenment is greatly achievable and has been achieved by countless 
                                                          practitioners of past and present.<br><br>This isn't bestowed upon us by anyone - by any external ancestor, gods, or even by Buddha. It is only by taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), the Sangha (community of dharma practitioners) and practicing the teachings with our own effort can we hope to achieve this. We have roamed in the six realms without beginning for countless lifetimes, it is the greatest blessing to encounter the Dharma and be greatly benefitted from it, it is the greatest and most rare opportunity to attain this wisdom and liberation.<br><br>4) Just do what you need to do
                                                           regarding it respectfully and sincerely. Without them and what the have done for our family, we would not be around. Our precious life is born because of our parents and ancestors. So it is important is to be respectful and grateful to our 
                                                          ancestors. But not to be superstitious about them.</p>

              <p>Hi Peoplew,</p>
              <p>i think none of the questions are related to Buddhism... but i think chant åœ°è—�è�©è�¨æœ¬æ„¿ç»� helps to solve the problems... remember to dedicate merits to all sentient beings</p>

              <p>hi all, have some questions here, wonder what are your opinions and buddhism’s position on them.</p>
              <p>1) is it true that the state of our ancestors has some influence on the current state of our lives? that is, if our ancestors are experiencing suffering, to what extent does it influence our lives, if at all? for example would the family undergo hardship, poverty, ill health, unhappiness etc and so on?</p>
              <p>2) is it a must to ‘pray’ to ancestors in order to have a smooth sailing life?</p>
              <p>3) Do we have to seek blessings from our ancestors first, before seeking blessings from bodhisattvas? If ancestors are not at peace, we also won’t be at peace. Is this true?</p>
              <p>4) Do ancestors’ tablets and graves have to be taken care of in order for future descendants to live in peace?</p>
              <p>Thanks all.</p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Your questions are basically linked to the very important Asian value of ‘Filial Piety’ prominent traditional and cultural values of the Chinese, Korean and the Japanese. Sadly these values have lost a great deal of its importance in the current modern context. Your questions raised are also relevant to the Buddhist subject of the 'Transference of Merit'. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

In the Theravada tradition, you will find many Suttas on the subject of the transference of Merits mostly on how individual can benefit from performing good deeds. However, <span style="color: black; ">in the Khp 7. Tirokudda Kanda Sutta one do find verses on offering to deceased person. I believe rituals are also performed with the following beautiful recitation from this Sutta. <span> </span></span></span></span></p>

As water poured on mountain top must soon descend and fill the plain, so indeed what is given here will reach and bless the spirits there'.</span></span></p>

After all, it is all about our parents and ancestors. </span></span></p>
