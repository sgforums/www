              2009 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are no obstacles, just opportunities. Take them now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo was born Diane Perry</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> during the Blitz, in 1943, the daughter of an East End charlady and a
              fishmonger. She decided she was a Buddhist in 1961, at the age of eighteen,
              traveled by sea to India in search of a teacher, and met her root guru, the
              eighth Khamtrul Rinpoche, on her twenty-first birthday. She became the second
              Western woman to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun three weeks later. At
              thirty-three, with her lama’s blessing, Tenzin Palmo took up residence in a
              six-by-six-foot cave, 13,200 feet up in the Himalayan valley of Lahaul, and
              lived there for twelve years. Since then, she has given her uniquely practical
              teachings around the world in an effort to raise awareness and funds for the
              Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery, in Himachel Pradesh, India, which she founded in
              2000.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lucy Powell interviewed
              the sixty-six-year-old nun while she was in London this year, giving her final
              teaching tour before retiring to India.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">AN INTERVIEW WITH
              JETSUNMA TENZIN PALMO ON THE EVE OF HER RETIREMENT</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Your example is at once
              inspirational—that a Westerner, and a woman, could meditate in solitary retreat
              for such a prolonged period—and dispiriting: unless we can sit in a Himalayan
              cave for over a decade, we won’t make any real progress on the path.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Certainly we have to do the work.
              This is true. It is really very impressive how many excuses we can invent for
              why we aren’t sitting. This idea we have that when things are perfect, then
              we’ll start practicing—things will never be perfect. This is samsara!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I remember once I was in the cave getting all depressed
              because the snows would melt in the spring and water would run down the back
              wall, making everything wet. Finally, I thought, “But didn’t the Buddha tell us
              it was this way? What is the first noble truth, after all? What do we expect?
              Why make such a big fuss when we suffer?” After that, I didn’t have any
              trouble.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Call something an obstacle, it is an obstacle. Call it an
              opportunity, it is an opportunity. Nothing is extraneous to the spiritual life.
              This is very important to understand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So why retreat?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Retreat is, in a way, a quick fix. I
              often think of the nuns of Mother Teresa’s order: they’re not picking up the
              dead and dying all day long—half the day is spent in prayer. If one is
              everlastingly giving out without breathing in, one becomes stressed and burned
              out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Twelve years is an
              extremely long fix.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Each of us has something to do in this lifetime; we have to find out what it is
              and do it. Retreat is what I was born to do. I was extremely happy in the cave
              and very grateful to be there. It was a rare opportunity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Did you experience
              periods of doubt or fear?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> I find talking about my time in the cave extremely boring; it was a
              lifetime ago. But, no, nothing made me worried or afraid. Hundreds of thousands
              of hermits through the ages have done exactly the same thing, and ninety-nine
              percent of them were fine. You’re very busy doing your practices—you’re not
              twiddling your thumbs all day—and you get into a state of mind where you accept
              that whatever is happening is happening. Even the most awful things that
              happen, if you’re centered, you’ll be okay. If not, the most trivial thing will
              send you off. It has nothing to do with the experience or the circumstance: it
              is the attitude that’s important. We have to stop clinging to the conditioned
              path and learn to be open to the unconditioned path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How do we develop that
              attitude of openness?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> This is the question. Our fundamental problems are our ignorance and
              ego-grasping. We grasp at our identity as being our personality, memories,
              opinions, judgments, hopes, fears, chattering away—all revolving around this me
              me me me. And we believe that that self is actually a solid, unchanging entity
              that sets us apart from all the other entities out there. This creates the idea
              of an unchanging permanent self at the center of our being, which we have to
              satisfy and protect. This is an illusion. “Who am I?” is thus the central
              question of Buddhism. Do you see?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most of the time, what we do is work to try to protect this
              false me, mine, I. We think the ego is our best friend. It isn’t. It doesn’t
              care if we are happy or unhappy. In fact, ego is very happy to be unhappy. And
              we must be conscious of not using the spiritual path as another conduit for the
              ego—a bigger, better, more spiritual me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are practices we can use against this egocherishing. In
              the company of very sick people who are suffering, one can visualize that one
              is taking in their fear and pain, in the form of dark light or smoke, pulling
              out sickness and negative karmas, and directing them toward the little black
              pearl of our self-concern. And it will start to disappear, because, really, the
              very last thing the ego wants is other people’s problems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we do experience pain or suffering ourselves, we can use
              it. We’re conditioned to resist pain. We think of it as a solid block we have
              to push away, but it’s not. It’s like a melody, and behind the cacophony there
              is tremendous spaciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What do we do when
              thoughts arise in meditation? </span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The thoughts are not the problem. Thoughts are the nature of
              the mind. The problem is that we identify with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How do we learn to
              dis-identify with them?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What of emotions like
              anger?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> The Buddha
              said that it’s greed, not anger, that keeps us on the wheel. Nobody’s chaining
              us down: we’re clinging on with both hands. Many people come to me saying that
              they want to eradicate anger; it’s not difficult to see that anger makes us
              suffer. But very rarely do people ask me how to be rid of desire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We have to cultivate contentment with what we have. We really
              don’t need much. When you know this, the mind settles down. Cultivate
              generosity. Delight in giving. Learn to live lightly. In this way, we can begin
              to transform what is negative into what is positive. This is how we start to
              grow up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Can you explain a bit
              about the difference between love and attachment?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Attachment is the very opposite of
              love. Love says, “I want you to be happy.” Attachment says, “I want you to make
              me happy.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Do you detect a rising
              spiritual consciousness in the West?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> What I see is that modern society is based on what Buddha
              called the three poisons—greed and aversion arising from [delusion, which is] a
              very strong sense of self. That’s what our society encourages, believing that
              the more greedy and self-assertive we are, the happier we will be. So the very
              path to suffering is now being touted as the path to happiness. Naturally, people
              are very confused.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nonetheless, I feel that people in the West have an
              advantage. Having so much material prosperity, they have already experienced
              everything our society tells us will give happiness. If they have any sense at
              all, they can see that it does not bring happiness. At most, it gives pleasure,
              which is very short-term; genuine happiness must lie elsewhere. If you’ve never
              had those things, you can still imagine that they would give the kind of
              satisfaction their promoters assure us they do. But as the Buddha said, desire
              is like salty water—the more you drink, the thirstier you become.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So why are we still
              drinking?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> The crux
              of the matter is laziness. Even when we know what we should be doing, we choose
              what seems to be the easier path. We’re gods acting like monkeys. We’re
              standing in our own light: we don’t see who we really are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But how do we step out
              of our own light, step onto the unconditioned path, and realize our limitless
              potential?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> Our mind
              is a treasure. But it’s very absorbent, so we must also be very discriminating
              in what we hear, read, and see. And in the spiritual life, our fence is our
              ethics. If we know we are living ethically to the best of our ability, the mind
              will become peaceful. We will attract the same kinds of people we really are.
              If we have a mind full of defilements, we will attract that to us. Therefore we
              have to purify our mental state, because whatever is within we will project
              out. You bring people toward you by your work and by karma. You have to be
              ready, when someone of a higher level is in front of you, to meet them. You do
              this by connecting to your source.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But if the Buddha were here, all he could encourage you to do
              would be to practice. Nobody else can do our work for us—it’s up to us to do it
              or not. Swimming upstream toward the source takes effort and determination.
              Sorry, there is no quick fix. But in the end it is the only thing that’s
              worthwhile. The key is practice. But don’t put it on the shrine: take the key,
              open the door, and walk out of the prison. There are no obstacles.</span></p>
