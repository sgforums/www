              <div id="post-body-10755613" class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;"><strong> What is Nirvana? </strong></div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;"><br></div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;">The Buddha described two elements of Nibbana. The Nibbana element with residue remaining is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion attained by a Noble One (arahant), with the residue itself being a reference to "his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable and feels pleasure and plain". The Nibbana element without residue remaining is that which “all that is felt, not being delighted, will become cool right here” (Iti 44). The common interpretation is that the first Nibbana element is attained when the Arahant/Noble One is still alive, and the latter comes in the passing away of the Noble One.</div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;"><br></div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;">For a long time I thought along this line, but as Geoff mentions, there is an alternative interpretation:</div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;"><br></div>
              <div class="body" style="background-image: none; background-color: transparent;"><br></div>
              <p>Geoff:<br> <br> <em>To paraphrase Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, it's not that an arahant gets
                  half of nibbÄ�na upon awakening, and the other half when s/he dies.
                  Upon awakening they have already "gone out," they are "cool," and
                  they have reached "the end." Even parinibbÄ�na can be used to refer
                  to a living arahant.<br> <br> The dhamma isn't about some sort of thanatos desire to attain
                  completion in the grave. It's about realizing "the end" here and
                  now.</em></p>
              <p><br> <br> Geoff:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div><cite>retrofuturist wrote:</cite>some idea as to how
                  consciousness might "function" ... i.e. without sankhara as its
                  foundation<br></div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br> I think that there are numerous sutta references to the awakened
                  mind which explain what is not the foundation of an arahant's
                  experience. Firstly, by way of training: The seen is merely the
                  seen (diá¹­á¹­hamatta). The heard is merely the heard (sutamatta). The
                  sensed is merely the sensed (mutamatta). The known is merely the
                  known (viññÄ�tamatta). Ud 1.10 BÄ�hiya Sutta:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">‘The seen will be merely the seen,
                  the heard will be merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the
                  sensed, the known will be merely the known.’ This is how you should
                  train, BÄ�hiya.<br> <br> When, BÄ�hiya, for you the seen will be merely the seen, the heard
                  will be merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the
                  known will be merely the known, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be that.
                  When, BÄ�hiya, you are not that, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be there.
                  When, BÄ�hiya, you are not there, then BÄ�hiya, you will be neither
                  here nor beyond nor between-the-two. Just this is the end of
                  unsatisfactoriness.<br></div>
              <p><br> Secondly, the absence of specific fabrication (abhisaá¹…kharoti) or
                  volitional intention (abhisañcetayati) towards either existence or
                  non-existence. MN 140 DhÄ�tuvibhaá¹…ga Sutta:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">One does not form any specific
                  fabrication or volitional intention towards either existence or
                  non-existence. Not forming any specific fabrication or volitional
                  intention towards either existence or non-existence, he does not
                  cling to anything in this world. Not clinging, he is not excited.
                  Unexcited, he personally attains complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns
                  that, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, done is what had to
                  be done, there is nothing further here.’<br></div>
              <p><br> Cf. Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, <span style="font-style: italic;">NibbÄ�na
                  Sermon 04</span>:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">What is called the cessation of
                  consciousness has a deeper sense here. It means the cessation of
                  the specifically prepared consciousness, abhisaá¹…khata viññÄ�á¹‡a. An
                  arahant's experience of the cessation of consciousness is at the
                  same time the experience of the cessation of
                  name-and-form.<br></div>
              <p><br> And <span style="font-style: italic;">NibbÄ�na Sermon 06</span>:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">The more one sees preparations
                  (saá¹…khÄ�ras) as preparations, ignorance is dispelled, and the more
                  one dispels ignorance, the preparations lose their significance as
                  preparations. Then one sees the nature of preparations with wisdom
                  as signless, desireless, and void. So much so that, in effect,
                  preparations cease to be preparations.... The relation of saá¹…khÄ�ras
                  to ignorance is somewhat similar to the relation a drama has to its
                  back-stage preparations. It seems, then, that from the standpoint
                  of Dhamma the entire saá¹ƒsÄ�ra is a product of specifically prepared
                  intentions, even like the drama with its back-stage
                  preparations....<br> <br> The phrase saá¹…khataá¹ƒ paá¹­iccasamuppannaá¹ƒ (e.g. M III 299), 'prepared
                  and dependently arisen', suggests that the prepared nature is also
                  due to that contact. What may be called abhisaá¹…khata viññÄ�á¹‡a (S III
                  58), 'specifically prepared consciousness', is that sort of
                  consciousness which gets attached to name-and-form. When one sees a
                  film show, one interprets a scene appearing on the screen according
                  to one's likes and dislikes. It becomes a thing of experience for
                  him. Similarly, by imagining a self in name-and-form, consciousness
                  gets attached to it. It is such a consciousness, which is
                  established on name-and-form, that can be called abhisaá¹…khata
                  viññÄ�á¹‡a. Then could there be also a consciousness which does not
                  reflect a name-and-form? Yes, there could be. That is what is known
                  as anidassana viññÄ�á¹‡a, or 'non-manifestative
                  consciousness'.<br></div>
              <p><br> And thirdly, consciousness which is unestablished (appatiá¹­á¹­ha
                  viññÄ�á¹‡a). SN 22.53 Upaya Sutta:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">When that consciousness is
                  unestablished, not increasing, not concocting, it is liberated.
                  Being liberated, it is steady. Being steady, it is content. Being
                  content, he is not excited. Unexcited, he personally attains
                  complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life
                  fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further
                  here.’<br></div>
              <p><br> As for the qualm that this last passage refers to the death of an
                  arahant, the phrase: "Unexcited, he personally attains complete
                  nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, 'Birth is ended, the holy life
                  fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further
                  here,'" is the standard paricope referring to the time of
                  awakening, i.e. a statement of the attainment of arahant fruition
                  (e.g. DN 15, MN 105, etc.), and not the time of death of an
                  arahant.<br> <br> The above passages referring to the cognition of an arahant are
                  succinctly presented in AN 4.24 KÄ�á¸·akÄ�rÄ�ma Sutta:</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus, monks, the TathÄ�gata does not
                  conceive an [object] seen when seeing what is to be seen. He does
                  not conceive an unseen. He does not conceive a to-be-seen. He does
                  not conceive a seer.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] heard when hearing what is to be
                  heard. He does not conceive an unheard. He does not conceive a
                  to-be-heard. He does not conceive a hearer.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] sensed when sensing what is to be
                  sensed. He does not conceive an unsensed. He does not conceive a
                  to-be-sensed. He does not conceive a senser.<br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] known when knowing what is to be
                  known. He does not conceive an unknown. He does not conceive a
                  to-be-known. He does not conceive a knower.<br></div>
              <p><br> Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda considered the KÄ�á¸·akÄ�rÄ�ma Sutta important enough to
                  write a text on it.<br> <br> All the best,<br> <br> Geoff</p>
