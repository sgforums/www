              people want to be more compassionate, thoughtful and kind to others. But what
              if in order to treat others better, we need to start by being kinder to
              ourselves?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>In his
              book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Heart-Courage-Compassionate-Transform/dp/1594632626/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431446703&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fearless+heart+jinpa">A
              Fearless Heart: How the Courage to Be Compassionate Can Transform Our Lives</a>,” 
              Thupten Jinpa, the Dalai Lama’s English-language translator and a visiting
              scholar at Stanford University, lays the foundation for a more compassionate
              world by teaching readers how to first cultivate kindness towards
              themselves.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>“Compassion
              is a sense of concern that arises when we are confronted with another’s
              suffering, and feel motivated to see that suffering relieved,” Jinpa writes in
              his book. But if we’re not operating within a mindset of fundamental compassion
              for our own struggles, he says, “then we don’t develop adequate resources
              within ourselves to be able to give more to others.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Self-compassion
              is not self-pity, self-absorption or self-indulgence. “The more compassionate
              thing we can do for ourselves may be to not eat the whole bag of Fritos”
              he writes. (Darn.) Instead, Jinpa explains, self-compassion is the
              “instinctive ability to be kind and considerate to yourself” he shares in
              an interview, –the whole, ‘put your oxygen mask first before helping others’
              approach to self care– which makes a big difference when you are dealing with
              the demands of raising children, dealing with a difficult boss or facing a
              relationship crisis.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Artfully
              drawing from his training in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery as well as his time
              at Oxford and work developing compassion curriculum at Stanford,
              Jinpa’s book blends science, spirituality and social science in a practical way
              designed to help readers imagine a kinder world and begin creating it. But
              first, Jinpa explains, you’ve gotta be good to you.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Want
              to start working your self-compassion muscles? “The first place to start
              is to question yourself,” Jinpa says in an interview. Here’s a roadmap to
              greater self-compassion:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Listen
              to your inner voice.</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '> (But don’t always do what it says.) Is that
              voice constantly negative, stressed or judgmental?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Jinpa’s
              work suggests that first becoming more aware of the thoughts that run through
              our minds all day will allow us to understand and redirect them.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>“Try
              to be aware of any negative, self-critical thoughts and self-talk,”
              writes Jinpa. Recognizing this can create a sense of distance as you “see
              that these are just thoughts, constructs and interpretations.” You can
              then “explore ways in which you can re-frame negative judgments with more
              compassionate ones.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Make
              time to incorporate a quiet intention-setting practice in the morning</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>,
              which need only take one or two minutes. Quietly affirm to yourself, he
              encourages,<em> “This day, I will make my day meaningful. I will as much as
              possible try to bring conscious intention into my interaction with others. I
              will as much as possible when the opportunity arises, be kind to others and at
              least refrain from harming others.  I’ll be more mindful. I’ll be caring
              and concerned for other people in my life. In this way, I’ll make my day
              meaningful.”</em> By regularly setting daily intentions, Jinpa says,
              you’ll be able to act more intentionally and feel more in control and less
              viscerally responsive to negative events.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Practice
              some self-compassion exercises</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>, shared in great detail in his book.
              One involves taking several deep breaths, and pausing in silence, he
              writes, to ‘bring to mind an image of compassion that represents for you love,
              caring, wisdom and strength,” he writes. Starting with the self, you’ll move in
              “ever expanding circles of attention,” wishing others “joy, happiness and
              peace.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Imagine
              yourself as a small child</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>, “free yet vulnerable, running around
              and often knocking things over along the way” the book invites you to imagine.
              Jinpa then asks readers to invoke a sense of wonder and affection for that
              child within. “Wouldn’t you feel instinctively protective toward this child?
              Instead of negative judgment, criticism and reprimand, would you feel tender
              and caring?” he writes. Thinking of this image of yourself as a child, “lets
              these feelings of tenderness and caring toward your child-self permeate your
              heart.” He then suggests wishing that hapless child —<strong><em>you</em></strong>–well,
              by then silently repeating the phrases:</span></p>

              aware of the narratives we tell ourselves</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>, and
              how they shape our thoughts, and behaviors. Jinpa takes issue with a
              Darwinian worldview that says that humans are motivated
              solely by self-interest, saying that in turn, society, he writes,
              “suffers from a self-fulfilling prophecy of selfishness.” While he accepts
              general scientific knowledge on evolution, Jinpa adds that biological and
              social science also points to a kindness instinct: “We know that caring
              and compassionate instincts are powerful and motivate us to do things,” he
              explains in an interview. By seeing our fellow man as fundamentally
              compassionate, Jinpa argues, we can start to see ourselves as kind, too.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Remember
              that self-compassion is just the starting point for wider application,</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '> Jinpa
              explains. Compassion towards those in need,  “makes us feel good.
              It’s kind of a paradox that the highest level of joy that we can experience as
              human beings are the joys where we actually forget ourselves. If we look
              back in our memory, we will know that those moments when we were happiest there
              was the least degree of self-consciousness. I think that says
              something very profound about who we are as species, and of
              the power of that caring instinct that’s within us.”</span></p>
