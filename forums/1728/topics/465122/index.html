              <p>I watched it. The good take home point was that many people have used religion as a "give me" thing rather than a "change me" thing. In Christendom this would characterise the Prosperity Gospel preached by some of the big churches.</p>
              <p>I do take issue with the point he made about the main difference between Buddhism and monotheistic religions. He said that monotheistic religions is about accept God and everything is well whereas Buddhism is about taking responsibility for one's actions, implying that in monotheistic religions individual responsibility is shirked.</p>
              <p>I will not comment much on Judaism and Islam, but speak from a Christian point of view. Christianity is about acknowledging that one is a sinner before God just like Buddhism is about recognising that one has a huge karmic debt that requires untold lifetimes to pay. The difference is that Christianity teaches that our sins cannot be atoned by any merit or good works on our part. No amount of good works can cover the sins that we do. God demands absolute holiness and moral perfection because God is perfect and holy. Christianity is about recognising our helplessness and receiving the free gift of eternal life offered by Christ who was sinless and thus qualified to die for us and to take away our sins. If we are to take responsibility for our sins it will mean a one way ticket to hell. The analogy would be that we are all fallen into a deep well and broken our legs and hands and cannot climb out of it. The only way is for someone to come down by a rope to take us up. The Bible does not teach that good works are not needed. The Bible only teach that good works cannot merit salvation, but that good works follow from salvation. A true living faith is one that is expressed in good works. Faith without works is dead.</p>
              <p>The Bible also does not teach that accepting God marks the end of all problems. Had the monk read the Bible he would know that Christ's followers just had a new set of problems! They were persecuted and killed for their belief in Christ. Believers still fall sick and die. Nothing has changed physically except their spiritual standing before God.</p>

              <p>Well, I think we both have misconceptions about each other's faith. In Buddhism, 'good works' do not atone for any sins but generate the altruistic mind that only thinks of me, myself and I. It is the selfish mind that creates suffering.

              <p>You may have misunderstood. I am rebutting the false notion that acceptance of God means everything will be alright. The only thing that is made right is one's relationship with God. The only time when everything will be alright is when Jesus comes back to restore all things. Again, God is no genie in the box to solve our problems. Our problem is sin, which God has already solved on the cross.</p>

              <p>Hmmm ok. Our discussions always seemed to go around in circles. If you said that our problem is sin, how did God solve our problems on the cross? Solving it would mean that there's no more sin right? This is the part that is vague in Christianity to me. Perhaps, you can help clarify for me. </p>

              <p>You need to understand the big picture of salvation presented in the Bible. Furthermore, there is no such teaching in the Bible where once saved we are sinless. You have to deal with what the Bible actually teaches, and not knock down a strawman version of your own making.</p>

              <p>The work He came to accomplished. The payment for our sins. Perhaps an analogy would be that I have made payment for all of you to watch an exclusive movie by invitation only and freely offered the tickets to you. But if you want to watch it you have to come get the tickets, or perhaps open the door so that I can deliver over the tickets to you and you make your way to the cinema, make sense? Can you say you earned the right to watch the movie? Nope, you paid nothing for it. Can you say you deserved to watch that movie? Nope, the tickets were offered to everyone. The benefit of the movie was FREELY offered to everyone, but it cost me something because I have to produce the movie and finance the screening of it. So the offer was purely by grace, not because anyone deserved it, but because I choose to give it. There's nothing you can do to buy the ticket or obtain it by any means.</p>

              <p>that's kind of a good analogy! in Pureland Buddhism, we are like stuck in a mud pool and Amitabha hold out his hand to us. one can either get out by themselves or if we really want to get out faster u can hold his hand and by His great compassionate vow, He will pull us out to safety first. </p>

              <p>Well this is very interesting this thread and I would refrain from making conclusions that will upset any parties. That's why I will revert back to the original teaching which is the fact that all religions, whether it is Buddhism, Christianity and so forth is suppose to transform us. To make us better individuals and kinder too. </p>
              <p>Personally, I prefer Buddhism, not because I am a pracititioner alone but because it has a very well-developed understanding of the mind and the development of compassion and wisdom. It is very thorough because the Buddha himself gained full enlightenment and through his state gained full understanding and mastery over his mind. That is why I I take refuge in the 3 Jewels beginning with the Buddha. </p>

              Why would you think that to offer man salvation by grace is tantamount to implying that man is a worthless being? When it has already been stated that the ticket cannot be earned why do you insist on working for it? Is it one's pride and ego at work to humbly admit that a gift cannot be earned, otherwise it is not called a gift?

              <p>Since the movie has been paid for all, why the need for ticket?
              do you mean to say that space is limited and people can't go to the
              free-for-all movie without the ticke even if they travel all
              the way to go watch a free-for-all movie? i'm trust you can read
              between the lines and know what i mean. </p>

              You are stretching the analogy. Ok, even if there is no ticket to hand out, you still need to go to the cinema in good faith to watch it. That is faith at work. Heaven is not limited but the time to make a decision for God is.
