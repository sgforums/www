                              <p>Well this is very interesting this thread and I would refrain
              from making conclusions that will upset any parties. That's why I
              will revert back to the original teaching which is the fact that
              all religions, whether it is Buddhism, Christianity and so forth is
              suppose to transform us. To make us better individuals and kinder
              too. </p>
              <p>Personally, I prefer Buddhism, not because I am a pracititioner
              alone but because it has a very well-developed understanding of the
              mind and the development of compassion and wisdom. It is very
              thorough because the Buddha himself gained full enlightenment and
              through his state gained full understanding and mastery over his
              mind. That is why I I take refuge in the 3 Jewels beginning with
              the Buddha. </p>

              I do not think the choice of religion is a matter of personal preference. In any case, you may not be aware that Christianity also has deep philosophical thinkers. All thinking that is on the right track must start with the knowledge of God.

              If you insist on stretching the analogy, then I will go along with it albeit reluctantly to say that those who continue to murder and rape will not want to go for the movie at all. They prefer the worldly and lustful pleasures of this life. And it seems that you may have the wrong idea that the movie is never going to start playing! The time will come when the entrance is shut tight and the movie starts. It will be too late if you are left out. But blessed are they who are already seated when the curtains are drawn back.

              <p>Which means he too has to comply with time just like the deva realm is not permanent. Why not forever since he's almighty? And why not keep the gates open forever?</p>

              <p>Since our sins have been paid millenias ago, why aren't we back in Eden?</p>
              <p>Since we are free from the power of sin, we shouldn't be sinning. Sadly, no.</p>
              <p>Since our sins have been paid, everyone should be going to heaven regardless of one's faith and since having erroneous faith is sin against god but that too has been paid. </p>

Even when you are unable to convince, you continue to express your beliefs. Unfortunately, Buddhists who know the teachings tend to be the intellectual types that need a religion that answers more questions. You see, Christianity works better when you just believe and don't ask too much questions. While in Buddhism, it works better when you ask more questions as we achieve a better understanding. Now, I know that you will argue with these points and I just wanted to share my understanding and experiences in both religions.</p></div>

              <p>Err, didn't you just said "<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Heaven is not limited
              but the time to make a decision for God is."?</span></p>
              <p>Which means he too has to comply with time just like the deva
              realm is not permanent. Why not forever since he's almighty? And
              why not keep the gates open forever?</p>
              <p>following the thread, I'm left with more questions.</p>
              <p>Since our sins have been paid millenias ago, why aren't we back
              in Eden?</p>
              <p>Since we are free from the power of sin, we shouldn't be
              sinning. Sadly, no.</p>
              <p>Since our sins have been paid, everyone should be going to
              heaven regardless of one's faith and since having erroneous faith
              is sin against god but that too has been paid. </p>
              </div>

              <p>I don't see how you come to the conclusion that God has to comply with time. God is the creator of time. He decides when to start the movie, so to speak. Asking God to keep the gates open forever basically means the movie never gets to start, that would be rather absurd demand. And why keep the gates open forever?</p>
              <p>Now to address your questions:</p>
              <p>1. Why aren't we back in Eden? It's a matter of timing. The Bible teaches a time when the lamb would lie with the lion. Sounds Edenic doesn't it? Anyway, if you read Revelation the Bible talks about the saints who would dwell in a place where the Tree of Life is in abundant all the time! </p>
              <p>2. Free from the power of sin means that the the second death cannot touch believers. In other words, believers will not be thrown into the Lake of Fire which is reserved for the devil and his demons and those who rebel against God and refuse His offer of salvation in Jesus Christ. It does not mean that believers are incapable of sin. Again the Bible does not teach this, so this is your false idea.</p>
              <p>3. You are promoting the false idea of universalism which has been denounced as heresy. Sad to say, many Christians are promoting this idea too. The Bible teaches that salvation has been freely offered to all, Christ died for everyone. But the Bible also teaches that not everyone wants to take up the offer. God is not going to force the gift on you if you so insist on refusing it. Or would you prefer that God drag you screaming and shouting into heaven against your will? That would be hell for you, wouldn't it? And I thought most people do not like to be imposed upon?</p>

              <p>@BroInChrist - One thing is for sure, you do have an indomitable
              spirit to spread the Gospel I must say. Even when you are unable to
              convince, you continue to express your beliefs. Unfortunately,
              Buddhists who know the teachings tend to be the intellectual types
              that need a religion that answers more questions. You see,
              Christianity works better when you just believe and don't ask too
              much questions. While in Buddhism, it works better when you ask
              more questions as we achieve a better understanding. Now, I know
              that you will argue with these points and I just wanted to share my
              understanding and experiences in both religions.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your compliment. I am also aware that there are people with similar indomitable spirit to undermine the Christian faith! Even when their objections have been refuted or neutralised they still continue to press the same old canards.</p>
              <p>I don't know how you get the idea that Christianity works better when you just believe and don't ask much questions. I mean, even in Buddhism you are taught not to ask questions about whether there is a Creator God! If you entertain the view that Christianity frowns upon asking questions, then sorry to say that is your caricature of the Christian faith. Just take me for example, have you heard me telling you and fellow Buddhists not to ask too much questions about Christianity? Nope, I actually welcome them. Websites like www.gotquestions.org and creation.com have answers to hundreds and hundreds of questions. Does that sound like Christianity is all about believing and not asking questions?</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> Thank you for your compliment. I am also aware that there are people with similar indomitable spirit to undermine the Christian faith! Even when their objections have been refuted or neutralised they still continue to press the same old canards.
                                                                              I don't know how you get the idea that Christianity works better when you just believe and don't ask much questions. I mean, even in Buddhism you are taught not to ask questions about whether there is a Creator God! If you entertain the view that Christianity frowns upon asking questions, then sorry to say that is your caricature of the Christian faith. Just take me for example, have you heard me telling you and fellow Buddhists not to ask too much questions about Christianity? Nope, I actually welcome them. Websites like www.gotquestions.org and creation.com have answers to hundreds and hundreds of questions. Does that sound like Christianity is all about believing and not asking questions?</span></p>

              <p>1. Given that God is the creator of time, I don't see how you don't see that God does not have to comply with time. I suppose He only needs to comply with His own "time table"! In that case God is only bound by His own being which is hardly contradictory or paradoxical.</p>
              <p>2. I am saying that your demand that the gates remain forever open is an absurd demand just as it is absurd to insist that the doors of the cinema does not close. If not close, then how to start the movie? Forever don't close also means that the movie forever don't start. I don't see how you don't see the absurdity of this demand.</p>
              <p>3. Why would God be precluded from setting a time for us just because He created time? And you have confused eradicating sin with the atonement for sins. What Christ did on the cross was the atonement for sins. The eradication of it would take place on Judgement Day.</p>
              <p>4. Death is not sin. Death is the result/consequences/wages of sin. The first death is physical, your body dies but your soul/spirit lives on. The second death takes place after the resurrection from the dead, your body reunites with your spirit/soul and you get thrown into the lake of fire. Not cool at all.</p>
              <p>5. Yes, there is no salvation for the devil. Mind you, he doesn't want to be saved. What makes you think he wants to? Just like how you don't want to believe in God or Jesus. It's a conscious deliberate decisive act of the will. In fact, the Bible already tells us in Revelation that the devil remains the devil still.</p>
              <p>6. By saying that there are a lot of free events out there and you get punished for not going to them, you have really stretch the analogy too far that it distorts the whole picture. The fallacy you committed here is that you think the free gift of salvation is like any other free commodity offered out there in the market.</p>
              <p>7. Make no mistake about it, you are not sent to hell just because you did not believe, but it is because of your sins. Here's another analogy. You are travelling on a highway, the road sign says to turn left as the road in not completed many kilometres down and there's a hole in the ground. There's even a skull sign for visual impact. But you choose NOT to believe the road sign seeing that the road ahead looks fine. You just keep travelling and see the same road signs, and you still choose to ignore it. You think it is a prank. You think it is idiots at work setting up such warning signs for so many kilometres. Or that some idiots are trying to impose their beliefs on you by posting these warning signs repeatedly. At last you suddenly drop and splash and splatter. Who do you blame? Is it a failure to believe or a conscious act of rebellion? I'd say it is both. Either way the responsibility was yours.</p>
              <p>8. I already said clearly that free from the effects of sin means not to experience the eternal separation from God i.e. thrown into the Lake of Fire. I think you read that but somehow it did not register?</p>
              <p>9. I did not decide that universalism is wrong. God said so in the Bible. Not everyone will be saved. You need to understand that salvation is conditional upon repentance. This truth should not elude you since you also believe that attaining Nirvana is conditional upon many things. Thus your mega huh is greeted by a mega duh from me. ; p</p>
              <p>10. The Bible simply teaches that your ticket out of hell is free, why would that be a gift held at ransom? Again this truth should not elude you since you believe in Buddhism that everyone is in samsara to begin with and need to get out of it. The difference is that in your worldview you believe you can buy your way out. But in the Christian worldview, the ticket is given for free, though Christ had to pay for you. But you know, sometimes the self is just too much and we refuse to take something for free. It's often an ego or pride thing.</p>
              <p>11. I don't think it is true that Sutra necessarily means it is the sayings of the Buddha, not from here <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/abuddhistglossary/g/sutradef2.htm">http://buddhism.about.com/od/abuddhistglossary/g/sutradef2.htm</a> anyway. But what I was asking you to do is to provide specific words from the Buddha teaching, akin to what we have with Chapter and Vers. It is not very nice or helpful of me to throw you the whole NT and tell you that the teaching can be found there.</p>
              <p>12. It isn't just my perspective that you cannot earn salvation. It's what the Bible teaches. If it's just my perspective you can ignore it. And if you can earn salvation by yourself, then Christ need not die on the cross. It's like paying for bail set at $20 million. If you can bail yourself out, then you did not need help.</p>
              <p>13. Yes, you got that right. No one is going to heaven simply because no one is morally perfect. That's why the Bible teaches that we are all dead in Adam. Our ticket out is to be in Christ, who is the last Adam.</p>
              <p>14. If you dismiss my beliefs as mere hypothesis, then I can just as easily dismiss yours as well. But that's not going to make for a good discussion. The point is, can you fault the logic that a creation is not above its creator? Is the Windows software superior to the maker Bill Gates?</p>
              <p>15. Why would you think that the word "undermine" carries a militaristic connotation? Who said anything about Buddhism going to war with other religions? But that Buddhism is a missionary faith is not in question. Otherwise how did it spread?</p>
              <p>16. I was simply asking why he thinks that Christianity is about just believe and don't ask. I am actually refuting this caricature of the faih. If he has come across many Christians who espouse this notion, then it is regretable, but it certainly does not represent the Christian faith truly.</p>
              <p>17. Don't care is not the same as saying Don't know, though sometimes people can cover up their ignorance by saying they don't care. So did Buddha know the answer to whether there is a God? Don't ask. It is irrelevant. Is it irrelevant because he don't know or because he knows but don't want to tell? But why don't tell? What harm would it cause if he tells us what he knows? You may ask, what good would it do if we know? I would say "heaps!"</p>

              <p>here is my experience from this thread.</p>
              <p>before i didn't even think abou this "god". as the thread progressed, i thought "ah, maybe this god being is a deva enjoying the pleasures in heaven but limited to time". as more exchanges and replies from broinchrist, i think this god being is actually an asura. has ego, jealousy and anger yet powerful but limited in power and time, befitting the description of asura realm. how interesting!! </p>
              <p>"pray to me, me, me, everything me,  only me" -&gt; ego</p>
              <p>"don't go to others" -&gt; jealousy</p>

              <p>If there is only one God, then why pray to others?</p>
              <p>You are jealous if your wife seems to be attracted to another person. Is that a problem? I would say you have a problem if you are not jealous!</p>
              <p>Hell is indeed a place of wrath where God pours out his anger on rebellious sinners. It is right to be angry with what is wrong.</p>

              <p>1. Given that God is the creator of time, I don't see how you
              don't see that God does not have to comply with time. I suppose He
              only needs to comply with His own "time table"! In that case God is
              only bound by His own being which is hardly contradictory or
              paradoxical.</p>

              <p>If he created time, then from his point of view, there is a before creation and after creation, which implies that time already existed. So there is a contradiction, and therefore it is not possible for time to be created by him.</p>

              <p>maybe zeus29 didn't put it correctly. Buddha will answer what you don't know like "an old wise man" as i posted in another thread. unless the questions will effect one's path/ upbringing, or when He see that the person is not ready, He would not say until they are ready.  just imagine a parent teaching their children, not everything the parent can answer, the kid can understand at certain age.  eg birds and bees. eg the use of santa claus to children. if u behave, santa will reward, if u not behave, u will be punished! this is useful when the person is not matured. then when one become matured, there's really no santa claus!</p>
              <p>got oneday, Buddha took up a handful of leaves and point to the forest and say to disciples,  what i know is equivalent  to the leaves in the forests, but what u need to know for liberation is just this handful.</p>

              <p>Buddha was just not interested in discussion about retrospect but introspect is more important.</p>

              <p>immatured to me. we do not condemn one who can change to the better/good even when one had wronged due to ignorance. learned from mistake is a good thing! just like we don't condemn a child who had not matured. </p>
              <p>this part of the bible, is we people find the most unacceptable. </p>
