              <h2><span style="font-family: tahoma;">ä½›èªªæ³•æ»…ç›¡ç¶“<br>Buddha Pronounces the SÅ«tra of the Total Annihilation of the Dharma </span></h2>
              <h4><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese <br>by<br>An Unknown Person </span></h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Thus I have heard:<br>    At one time the <a href="glossary.html#buddha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddha</span></a>, together with <a href="glossary.html#bhik"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bhiká¹£us</span></a> and <a href="glossary.html#sattva"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bodhisattvas</span></a>, was staying in the city kingdom of <a href="glossary.html#kusinagara"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KuÅ›inagara</span></a>, where He would enter <a href="glossary.html#pari"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">parinirvÄ�á¹‡a</span></a> in three months. Countless multitudes came to the Buddha and bowed their heads down to the ground. Surrounded by His devotees longing to hear the <a href="glossary.html#dharma"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dharma</span></a>, the <a href="glossary.html#bhagavat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World-Honored One</span></a> remained silent, and His radiance did not manifest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">
              </span></p><p><br>    The venerable Ä€nanda made obeisance to the Buddha and asked Him, “When the World-Honored One pronounces the Dharma, His awesome radiance is always displayed before and after. Now in this huge assembly, His radiance does not appear. Why is this so? There must be a reason. I pray to hear its implication.”</p>
              <p><br>    The Buddha remained silent, not responding. After Ä€nanda asked this question for the third time, the Buddha told Ä€nanda, “After my parinirvÄ�á¹‡a, as the Dharma comes to an end, the way of the <a href="glossary.html#mara"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mÄ�ras</span></a> will thrive in this world of the <a href="glossary.html#turbidity"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">five turbidities</span></a>. MÄ�ras will appear as <a href="glossary.html#sramana"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Å›ramaá¹‡as</span></a> so as to undermine and destroy my <a href="glossary.html#way"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Way</span></a>. They will wear lay clothing and delight in the monk’s robe dyed with a mixture of five colors. To gratify ravenous appetites, they will drink alcohol, eat flesh, and kill sentient beings. Devoid of lovingkindness, they will hate and envy others.</p>
              <p><br>    “At that time, there will be Bodhisattvas, <a href="glossary.html#pratyeka"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pratyekabuddhas</span></a>, and <a href="glossary.html#arhat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arhats</span></a>, who energetically cultivate virtue and treat all with respect. Esteemed by all, they will teach and transform others impartially. They will pity the poor and old, and help the needy and unfortunate. They will teach others to revere and uphold the sÅ«tras and the holy images. Kind and benevolent in nature, they will do meritorious karmas. Never harming others, they will disregard any harm to themselves in order to help others. Kind and friendly, they will endure abuse, not protecting themselves.</p>
              <p><br>    “Although there will be such good people, all mÄ�ra bhiká¹£us will be jealous of them. They will slander, malign, and banish them. Afterward, individually and as a group, the mÄ�ra bhiká¹£us will not cultivate virtue. Temples will be deserted, falling into disrepair then into ruins. Greedy for material wealth, they will accumulate things, not using them to acquire merit. They will sell slaves to work in the fields. Devoid of lovingkindness, they will burn mountain forests, harming sentient beings. Male slaves will become bhiká¹£us, and female slaves will become <a href="glossary.html#bhikni"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bhiká¹£uá¹‡Ä«s</span></a>. Devoid of morality, they will engage in sexual debauchery and perversion, whether with men or women. Such people will cause my Way to fade away.</p>
              <p><br>    “Some of them will seek sanctuary in my Order to escape prosecution by the law. They will become Å›ramaá¹‡as but will not observe the precepts or regulations. Although they will, in appearance, recite the precepts on new-moon and full-moon days, they will be reluctant and indolent, not wanting to hear the recitation. They will omit some precepts, not wanting to recite all of them. They will not recite or study the sÅ«tras. If there are readers who do not know the words [in the sÅ«tras], they will claim that they know them. They will not consult the learned ones, but will instead seek fame for self-elevation. They will glorify themselves with fake elegant ways, expecting offerings from others. For committing any of the <a href="glossary.html#rebel"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">five rebellious sins</span></a>, after death, these mÄ�ra bhiká¹£us will fall into the hell of uninterrupted suffering. They will then be reborn as animals or hungry ghosts for as many <a href="glossary.html#kalpa"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">kalpas</span></a> as the sands of the Ganges. After their sins have been purged, they will be reborn [as humans] in a fringe country where the <a href="glossary.html#jewel3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Jewels</span></a> will not be accessible.</p>
              <p><br>    “When the Dharma is ending, women will diligently do meritorious karmas while men will be indolent and arrogant. Men, having no faith, will not use the words in the Dharma, and they will regard Å›ramaá¹‡as as feces and dirt. When the Dharma is ending, gods will shed tears. Flood and drought will ravage, and five kinds of grain will not ripen. Epidemics will be prevalent and many will die. People will endure a hard life, and government officials will exploit them. People will not follow good principles, thinking only of pleasure and strife. The evil ones will become as numerous as the sands in the sea. The good ones will decrease to one or two. As a kalpa is ending, the sun and the moon will be unstable and human lifespan will shorten. At the age of 40, one's hair will turn white. Men indulging in sexual acts may die prematurely from depletion of their semen, or may live to only 60. While men will live short lives, women will live long, to 70, 80, 90, or even 100 years. Faithless people will say that the situation can be permanent.</p>
              <p><br>    “A massive flood will suddenly rise, lasting endlessly. Various species of sentient beings, noble or lowly, will drown or drift in the waters, and they will be eaten by fish and other sea creatures. Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Arhats, driven away by the mÄ�ras, will not convene. [These holy beings of] the <a href="glossary.html#vehicle3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Vehicles</span></a> will enter the meritorious grounds in the mountains. There they will live a long life, tranquilly biding their time. They will meet with one another when the god-kings escort Moonlight Bodhisattva to appear in the world. Together they will revitalize my Dharma for fifty-two years.</p>
              <p><br>    “Then the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama SÅ«tra</em> and the <em>Pratyutpanna Buddha SammukhÄ�vasthita SamÄ�dhi SÅ«tra</em> will be destroyed, to be followed by all other <a href="glossary.html#sutra12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sÅ«tras in the twelve categories</span></a>. Their words will not be seen again. The monk’s robe will naturally turn white. When my Dharma perishes, it will be like [the flame of] an oil lamp. When it is dying, its light becomes brighter for a while then dies out. When my Dharma perishes, it will be like the extinction of a lamp. What will happen afterward is hard to describe. Eventually, after tens of millions of years, Maitreya Bodhisattva will descend to this world to become a Buddha. All toxic gases will then be eliminated, and the world will be safe and peaceful. The rains will be harmonious and the five grains will thrive. The trees will be tall, and humans will each be eighty feet tall, with a lifespan of 84,000 years. Innumerable sentient beings will be delivered.”</p>
              <p><br>    The venerable Ä€nanda made obeisance to the Buddha and asked Him, “What should we call this sÅ«tra? How should we uphold it?”</p>
              <p><br>    The Buddha replied, “Ä€nanda, this sÅ«tra is called <em>Total Annihilation of the Dharma</em>. Pronounce it to all and let them know its significance. Your merit will be immeasurable, beyond reckoning.”</p>
              <p><br>    The <a href="glossary.html#sangha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">four groups of disciples</span></a>, having heard this sÅ«tra, were distressed and downcast, but they all activated their resolve to attain the <a href="glossary.html#anu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unsurpassed bodhi</span></a>. Then they made obeisance to the Buddha and departed.</p>

              <p>As said before by Shakyamuni Buddha (<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/files/scripture_preached_by_the_buddha.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Scripture Preached by the Buddha on the Total Extinction of the Dharma</span></span></a>), in this Dharma-Ending age all Buddhist-Sutras will disappear slowly one by one, starting with <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/files/shurangama_sutra.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Shurangama Sutra</span></span></a> and the last one to be <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/files/infinite_life_sutra.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Amitabha Infinite Life Sutra</span></span></a>. After the first sutra is gone, the world will start to enter a chaotic time where evil deeds will become daily routines.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>Excerpt from Shurangama Sutra:</strong><br></span><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">..."In fifty-two years after that, the Shurangama Scripture and the pratyutpanna-samádhi will prematurely change and vanish, and shortly afterwards the twelve divisions of the Mahayana canon will also be destroyed in their entirety, and will not appear again. The robes of the monks will spontaneously turn white. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">"When my Dharma is destroyed, the process will be comparable to an oil lamp, which, drawing close to the time it will go out, will shed an even greater radiance and brilliance, and then be extinguished. When my Dharma is destroyed, it will surely be like a lamp going out....</span></em></p>
              <p><strong>Excerpt from Infinite Life Sutra:</strong><br>... <em>The Buddha further said, "I have expounded this teaching for the sake of sentient beings and enabled you to see Amitayus and all in his land. Strive to do what you should. After I have passed into Nirvana, do not allow doubt to arise. In the future, the Buddhist scriptures and teachings will perish. But, out of pity and compassion, I will especially preserve this sutra and maintain it in the world for a hundred years more. Those beings who encounter it will attain deliverance in accord with their aspirations.</em></p>
              <p><em>The Buddha said to Maitreya, "It is difficult to encounter and behold Tathagata when he is in this world. Difficult of access, difficult to hear are the Buddhas' teachings and scriptures. It is also difficult to hear the excellent teachings for bodhisattvas, the Paramitas. Difficult too is it to meet a good teacher, to hear the Dharma and perform the practices. But most difficult of all difficulties is to hear this sutra, have faith in it with joy and hold fast to it. Nothing is more difficult than this. Thus have I formed my Dharma, thus have I expounded my Dharma, and thus have I taught my Dharma. You must receive it and practice it by the method prescribed."</em>...</p>
