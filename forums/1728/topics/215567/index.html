It might also be a case of conflict of interest for some Christians... I approached a Christian friend outside the company but to no avail too.....<br><br>Therefore, the help that you can offer as a Christian would do me very little good in my case...<br><br>You see, if I wanted her sacked, I would have completed and sent off the complaint letter myself and have her reported. I probably won't need the help of anyone (Christian or not) for that.... But this is all moot as I do not wish for her to lose her job.<br><br>So, if I can't change her, why not change myself? The anger in me and my HOD's zealousness actually have the same source: delusion. I cannot eliminate her delusion, but I can try to eliminate mine.<br><br>Thing is, I am used to her antics by the time she was sacked and I have not felt offended by her for a long time. Instead, I felt very sorry for her when she got sackedÂ…. (immediate termination without notice, see her clearing her stuff and vacate her office within an hour after receiving the sack etc. etc.) Rest assured that I certainly won't judge all Christians by the actions of one.<br><br>It is however noteworthy that negative actions by a few can actually be very Â‘loudÂ’. It is for this reason that our Muslim friends have received such negative publicityÂ… Prior to me meeting my HOD, I have perhaps met only a handful of Â‘badÂ’ ChristiansÂ…. But these bad apples left a far deeper impression than the multitude of the decent ones I have met.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

I actually empatise with you, and strange as it may sound, I am also glad for you that she's sacked. If my boss is like her, I have issues, even though I am a Christian too!<br><br>in retrospect, I would have gone to the top boss over such issues. Aside from the "harassment", there is the issue of "bullying" - which means someone of a more senior position imposing his/her views onto someone junior, so much so that non-compliance is not the alternative because one's advancement depends on the superior.<br><br>a person such as you ex-HOD would not last long in the corporate world, unless she sets up her own company and employ like-minded people into the fold. Very sadly, I think she's missing the point in witnessing for God. To a person such as you ex-HOD, I would like to see her doing the same thing to her superior - that would be really fun!</div>

That's the message I derived from you. There is nothing wrong with that. It is all for the better.<br><br>If you still insist you are sad, then let me be glad for you that she is sacked. We are all better off without such characters around. If it were me I would have submitted the letter with my name boldly printed on it. I experienced the same humilitation when I was a primary five student during Health Education class. The teacher probably talked about the subject 10% of the time, the rest dedicated to her Christian preaching and criticism of other religions. Till today I regret not doing anything about it.</div>
