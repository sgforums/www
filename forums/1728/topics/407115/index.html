              <p>There are many monks and ordinary people who are vegetarian but live to a ripe old age. There are too many to name them, just name a few famous monks, Master Chin Kong who is now past 70 years old  still well and alive, Ven. Hong Choon who passed away at age past 70 or 80 years old (the abbot of Kong Meng San Buddhist Temple which is the biggest in Singapore), Ven. Shen Yan who passed away at age past 70 or 80 years old (Taiwan) etc. There are many monks who live  past 90 years old. They are proving you wrong.</p>

              <p>It doesn't have to be using less electricity OR going vegan. It could be BOTH.<br><br>If you have really gone into the UN report that Amitayus48 posted in the link, you would have realised how much the reduce in impact on the environment by going vegan. Here are some sections from the report.</p>
              <p>"Food production is the most significant influence on land use and therefore habitat change, water use, overexploitation of fisheries and pollution with nitrogen and phosphorus. In poorer countries, it is also the most important cause of emissions of greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both emissions and land use depend strongly on diets. Animal products, both meat and dairy, in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives.</span>"</p>
              <p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Currently about half of the world’s land is used for agriculture and 70% of total water use</span>" <br><br>and some where else in the report you see these 2 statements:<br><br>"Agricultural materials, especially animal products, are also a very important material flow in terms of their contribution to a large number of impact categories. Animal products are important because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more than half of the world’s crops are used to feed animals, not people.</span>"<br><br>"Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth, increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.</span>"<br><br>When economics and politics are tossed aside on food distribution, we would realise from what the report directly implies - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">basically, we are eating meat at the cost of not only the lives of animals, but also the lives of people who are starving and have little/no food to eat.</span> </p>
              <p>Advising people not to eat meat for the environment is not something we see as much publicise by the government compared to cutting electricity and conserving water. Hence not many people know about the impact of meat, fish and animal products. But the fact is, they are really detrimental to the environment.</p>

              <p>Unless it's a vegan who ate a balanced diet who tells me it will bring nutritional deficiencies, maybe I will believe. Most people saying "Vegan or vegetarian diets not enough nutrients" very likely wasn't a vegetarian before.</p>
              <p>In the vegetarian stalls I often see people buying mock meat and deep fried stuff etc. Any vegetarian who has been on a veg diet for years will tell you this will bring you a nutritional imbalance.</p>
              <p>A vegan diet is not restricted to veggies, rice, noodles, mock meat, and deep fried stuff. Anyone who eat only these everyday will get sick. In a well balanced vegan diet, you need to include a variety of foods including some of the following...</p>
              <p>Beans, lentils, legumes: black, green, red, kidney, white, soy, dhal etc.<br>Nuts: cashew, walnuts, peanuts, pine nuts etc.<br>Grains: wild rice, millet, brown rice, quinoa, oats, etc.<br>Seeds: pumpkin, flax, sesame, sunflower etc.<br>Not forgetting a healthy dose of B12.<br><br>Most of this we don't get when eating out at vegetarian places, but is necessary to include in the veg diet.</p>

              <p>i beg to differ, stereoscopic vision is not only used for hunting, it is essential for gauging distance and position, eg. jumping from tree to tree, ever seen documentaries of gibbons swinging up in tree canopies.</p>
              <p>Also take for example, examine our teeth, our canines are not very well suitable for grasping or tearing flesh from life prey; as compared to other real carnivores! What of our molars? Comparatively, they are more robust and more suited for their job than our canines are!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, our digestive system is long compared to carnivores, indicating a prediposition to digesting fibrous or vegetable matter. That we crave meat is not the issue here, but our physical attribute indicate adaptation to herbivorian/fructivorian  diet.</p>

              <p>"Blood alkalinity" is another myth. Blood has buffers that prevent its acidity from changing drastically. Otherwise, why is lemon juice good for you?</p>
              <p>Cattle, chickens and sheep that are reared in most farms are fed grains which are not part of their natural diet, hence they produce more methane and fewer nutrients. Look for free range chickens and eggs, pasture/grass-fed meat and dairy products and wild game and fish. That would improve the situation far more than a vegan diet.</p>
              <p>While you're at it, you should still eat plenty of fruit and vegetables for fibre and antioxidants, as well as nuts (if you're not allergic to them) for unsaturated fats. Oh, by the way, did you know that padi fields also produce plenty of methane?</p>
              <p>And read up about strontium. It's more effective than calcium as a bone-strengthening nutrient.</p>

              jumping from tree to tree, ever seen documentaries of gibbons
              swinging up in tree canopies.</p>
              <p>Also take for example, examine our teeth, our canines are not
              very well suitable for grasping or tearing flesh from life prey; as
              compared to other real carnivores! What of our molars?
              Comparatively, they are more robust and more suited for their job
              than our canines are!</p>
              <p>Also, our digestive system is long compared to carnivores,
              indicating a prediposition to digesting fibrous or vegetable
              matter. That we crave meat is not the issue here, but our physical
              attribute indicate adaptation to herbivorian/fructivorian
               diet.</p>

              <p>In that case the argument that we are omnivores could also be made. Our primate cousins are omnivores too.</p>

              <div class="Abstract" style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">Normal adult humans eating modern-day diets have a chronic low-grade metabolic acidosis whose severity is determined in part by the net rate of endogenous acid production (NEAP). NEAP varies mainly with diet composition. The greater the quantity of organic and sulfuric acids produced from metabolism of animal foods, and the lower the amounts of potassium salts metabolizable to bicarbonate, which come mainly from fruits and vegetables, the greater the production rate of acid. It had previously been thought that “healthy” kidneys were capable of excreting any excess acid produced by the body’s metabolism [<cite>1</cite>]; the authors’ research suggests that the normally occurring slow decline in renal function with age allows the kidneys to merely mitigate the degree of severity of the acidosis, and with increasing age, the steady-state levels of acidity in the body slowly rise [<cite>2–</cite> <cite>3</cite>].</div>

              <p>Personally, I am amiable to this concept due to the chinese concept of yin/yang principles of diet. It is typically ingrained into my psyche. Eg. when taking too much meat, which is "heaty", I will resort to taking herbal or "cooling" drinks or foods to counteract the heatiness!</p>

              <p>Being omnivores is a matter of opportunity, a animal diet  is typically rich in proteins and fats. It is desirable but not indispensable.</p>
              <p>Do you notice we masticate our food,where else carnivores tear in chunks and wolf down the meat.</p>
              <p>Also. humans are one of the few species of animals unable to produce vitamin C. Vitamin C can be found in animal protein, however, muscle and fat are not good sources of vitamin C.</p>

The response that it creates in the body, however, is extremely alkaline. Lemon and lime juice promote the release of sodium bicarbonate from the pancreas to support enzyme activity. As well as this, lemon is converted to potassium citrate in the intestine which is also alkaline.</p>
