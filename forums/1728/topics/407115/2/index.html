              <p>" 100 million acres of U.S. agricultural land is used to grow animal feed. 70% of all the wheat, corn and other grain produced in the U.S. goes to feeding factory-farmed animals! ONE acre of trees disappears EVERY eight seconds to make grazing land forï»¿ cattle.</p>
              <p>In 2006, the UN issued their report revealing that intensive factory farming is responsible for 18% all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, more than the entire transportation sector (all the worlds cars, trucks, SUVs, airplanes, ships) "</p>

              As a long-time employee of Taiwan Power Company, Jian Dong-liang knows that every bit of energy comes with a financial and an environmental cost. He knows that scientific and technological advances can minimize the environmental cost, but they alone aren’t enough to sufficiently reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He believes that living a simpler life is a more effective way to reach that goal. Jian thinks that everyone should share the burden of using fewer resources to save the earth for future generations. For him,“Returning to a simpler lifestyle hurts no one, but helps the earth tremendously.” <br><br>The Dadu River empties into the Taiwan Strait at Longjing Township, Taichung, central Taiwan. People out for a stroll saunter near the estuary and enjoy a serene picture of the setting sun and the white, foaming waves billowing in the rising wind. However, close nearby is a jarring note to the tranquil natural scene—a massive power plant that runs day and night, never stopping or slowing, its smokestacks constantly blowing smoke.<br><br>
              <div class="img_caption right" style="width: 290px;"><img class="caption" title="Mountains of coal pile up at a power station near the month of the Dadu River, Taichung, Taiwan.

              <p>Mountains of coal pile up at a power station near the month of the Dadu River, Taichung, Taiwan. Burning coal is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. The decorations on the smokestacks can’t disguise the fact that their purpose is to dump tons of carbon into the atmosphere.</p>
              </div>
              The power plant belongs to the Taiwan Power Company. It is located on a 281-hectare (695-acre) parcel of land near the estuary. Ten coal-fired generators pump out 5.5 million kilowatts of electricity an hour, supplying 15 percent of Taiwan’s energy needs. At the same time, the plant produces a huge amount of carbon dioxide waste, none of which is needed by anyone. Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that has been linked to a rise in average temperatures across the globe.<br><br>The electricity produced here has monetary value, but the towering smokestacks and mountain-high piles of coal serve as silent reminders of the true cost—the environmental cost—of the energy produced here. How to strike a sensible balance between energy production and protecting the environment is a topic that deserves everyone’s attention. Jian Dong-liang (ç°¡æ£Ÿæ¨‘) has thought much about it and has done his share to help.<br><br><strong>An energy efficient family<br></strong>Jian, a 40-year veteran at Taiwan Power, said that power station engineers have achieved a great deal in improving generator efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, he knows that such improvements can never do enough. To reach the goal of meaningful, persistent CO2 reductions, Jian advocates a lifestyle of energy conservation.<br><br>

              <p>Jian Dong-liang, Chen Ming-hui, and the family of one of their daughters in Jian’s house. There is little luxury; everything is clean, simple, and practical. Jian grew up this way, and he has brought up his children this way too.</p>
              </div>
              Jian’s wife, Chen Min-hui (é™³æ•�æ…§), shares his obsession with energy conservation. Sitting in her living room, she recounts the many techniques that her family uses to save electricity. “It takes a 30-watt light bulb 33.3 hours to use a kilowatt of electricity, the same amount that a 100-watt bulb uses in just ten hours,” she says. She points to the five-bulb light fixture on the ceiling, in which they’ve installed only three energy-saving light bulbs. They turn on just one bulb at night if nobody is reading. If they want to read during the day, they sit by a window and read by natural light. Without a doubt, frugality forms the core of this family’s energy policy.<br><br>For the Jian family, burning fewer lights and unplugging power cords when not in use is just the beginning. They also take pride in saving on big-ticket items, such as their 20-gallon water heater. Chen said that everyone in her family takes a quick shower one after another, within a short time. They turn the water heater on half an hour before shower time and turn it off when the last shower starts. They save a respectable amount of energy this way.<br><br>Jian estimates that his family of three used to use 300 kilowatts of electricity a month, although that amount has gone up slightly because the couple now has their daughter’s son at home too. They need to keep an electric hot water dispenser plugged in all the time for their grandson’s powdered milk formula. It is impractical and uneconomical to turn the hot water dispenser on and off between uses, which actually wastes more electricity than it saves. Even with this increase, the family’s electricity expenditures are minimal.<br><br>Jian and Chen save on water and natural gas too. When they bathe their grandson, they give him a final rinse after the suds have been rinsed off. Then they catch and use that water to wash themselves or their clothes.<br><br>When they cook, they don’t turn the gas jets full open, which just wastes gas. Instead, they cook with a lower flame. It cooks just as well, but they save on gas. A 16-kilogram (35-pound) tankful of gas lasts more than two months in their household.<br><br>Like many others, Chen saves the water in which she rinses rice before cooking. She then uses that water for her plants. Even her son-in-law, Sun Zhong-wei (å­«ä»²å�‰), is becoming more energy-conscious. He’s picking it up from his in-laws and incorporating it into his lifestyle. “Now I turn the faucet off when I lather my hands with soap,” Sun said.<br><br>Jian said, “If you accept energy conservation as a heaven-given duty, then you will be mindful of it at all times.” For Jian, using less electricity, water, and gas saves more than money; it also saves the environment for future generations. That’s why he insists it is everyone’s responsibility.<br><br><strong>A frugal lifestyle<br></strong>“As the standard of living improves, people tend to use more resources than necessary,” notes Jian. “Master Cheng Yen admonishes people to return to a simple lifestyle. Such a change doesn’t hurt anyone, yet it helps the earth tremendously. If this generation ruins the earth, how is the next generation supposed to live?”<br><br>The Jians have always lived frugally. Chen described the family’s earlier days: “My husband was making about 3,000 NT dollars (US$75) a month when we got married. After paying the rent and other expenses, and giving more than a thousand dollars to his parents, we had very little left. Therefore, our children were breast-fed and we used diapers made from old undershirts.”<br><br>Their children grew up to be just as resource-conscious as their frugal parents. To help the family with their expenses, son Ke-da (ç°¡å…‹é�”) chose a high school that offered him scholarships over one that was more glamorous but more expensive. For five years, he rode a bicycle to school—until his parents bought him a scooter during his junior year in college.<br><br>Even though that bicycle has been through several sets of tires in the last 20 years, it is in fairly good shape. Chen still rides it to collect monthly donations from Tzu Chi members. After a major earthquake in September 1999, Jian rode it from his home in Taichung to Wufeng, more than an hour away by bike, to help rebuild schools under Tzu Chi’s Project Hope. Tzu Chi raised funds after the quake to rebuild more than 50 schools throughout the stricken areas.<br><br>One bike, two generations of riders, 20-some years—this family doesn’t just talk frugality, they live it.<br><br>The family bought their first automobile in 2001. Jian needed it to look after his ailing mother. Before he bought the car, he visited her once a week using public transportation. The trip took about three hours each way, so he decided to buy a car to lessen the pressure on his own time. His mother has since passed away, so now he only drives the car to work when public transportation is not in service. Otherwise, the car remains parked at home, having logged less than 30,000 kilometers (18,750 miles) in eight years.<br><br>“We’ve basically lived the same simple life over the decades, regardless of how sophisticated society has become,” Jian said. “People say that we are a rare breed.”<br><br><strong>Food<br></strong>Many people, perhaps too tired to cook after work, eat out or eat takeout foods with their children. The Jian family almost never does that. They cook and eat at home as a matter of course. They never think of eating outside food, except when they attend wedding banquets from time to time.<br><br>In addition to frugality, the children have learned many culinary skills from their mom. Like their mom did for them, Chen’s children make for their own children many of the foods they eat. Ke-da often cooks at home so his parents can come home to a hot meal after their busy volunteer work.<br><br>Chen is a Tzu Chi commissioner, and part of her responsibility is to visit people in need. She often encourages families who receive aid from Tzu Chi to eat at home to cut down on expenses. She takes her own advice too. Oftentimes her visits get in the way of lunch, so she has to wait. After the visit, however late it may be, she goes home—not to an eatery—and cooks noodles for herself. That’s vintage Chen Min-hui.<br><br><br>Nowadays Jian takes an early morning shuttle bus to work at the power station near the estuary. He plans to retire at the end of next year and devote himself full-time to volunteering. Jian knows that carbon reduction is all the rage. Although Taiwan Power is planting trees and experimenting with phytoplankton as ways to battle carbon emissions, he knows that there is a simpler and more effective solution. He believes that a lifestyle that centers on simplicity and frugality is the most important and effective CO2 buster.<br><br>The Jians clearly show that our needs are few and not a source of trouble. It is our wants that have thrown the earth into disarray. He urges people to rein in their excessive wants and reduce consumption. Then humans can live in harmony with Mother Earth.<br><br>Translated by Tang Yau-yang <br>Photos by Lin Yan-huang</div>

              <div style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">Normal adult
              humans eating modern-day diets have a chronic low-grade metabolic
              acidosis whose severity is determined in part by the net rate of
              endogenous acid production (NEAP). NEAP varies mainly with diet
              composition. The greater the quantity of organic and sulfuric acids
              produced from metabolism of animal foods, and the lower the amounts
              of potassium salts metabolizable to bicarbonate, which come mainly
              from fruits and vegetables, the greater the production rate of
              acid. It had previously been thought that “healthy” kidneys were
              capable of excreting any excess acid produced by the body’s
              metabolism [<cite>1</cite>]; the authors’ research suggests that
              the normally occurring slow decline in renal function with age
              allows the kidneys to merely mitigate the degree of severity of the
              acidosis, and with increasing age, the steady-state levels of
              acidity in the body slowly rise
              [<cite>2–</cite> <cite>3</cite>].</div>

              <p>Then in that case, the nomadic tribes of Africa should see plenty of health problems - but they don't! There are plenty of pollutants in industrialised societies that affect our health in detrimental ways. A sedentary lifestyle doesn't help either.</p>
              <p>And if you want to save the planet, buy local. Think of the amount of energy that's wasted in transporting, storing and preserving vegetables and food from abroad, and the nutrients that are lost along the way. Of course, it's better if it's both local and organic.</p>

              <p>It doesn't have to be using less electricity OR going vegan. It could be BOTH.<br><br>If you have really gone into the UN report that Amitayus48 posted in the link, you would have realised how much the reduce in impact on the environment by going vegan. Here are some sections from the report.</p>
              <p>"Food production is the most significant influence on land use and therefore habitat change, water use, overexploitation of fisheries and pollution with nitrogen and phosphorus. In poorer countries, it is also the most important cause of emissions of greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both emissions and land use depend strongly on diets. Animal products, both meat and dairy, in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives.</span>"</p>
              <p>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Currently about half of the world’s land is used for agriculture and 70% of total water use</span>"<br><br>and some where else in the report you see these 2 statements:<br><br>"Agricultural materials, especially animal products, are also a very important material flow in terms of their contribution to a large number of impact categories. Animal products are important because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more than half of the world’s crops are used to feed animals, not people.</span>"<br><br>"Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth, increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.</span>"<br><br>When economics and politics are tossed aside on food distribution, we would realise from what the report directly implies - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">basically, we are eating meat at the cost of not only the lives of animals, but also the lives of people who are starving and have little/no food to eat.</span> </p>
              <p>Advising people not to eat meat for the environment is not something we see as much publicise by the government compared to cutting electricity and conserving water. Hence not many people know about the impact of meat, fish and animal products. But the fact is, they are really detrimental to the environment.</p>

              <p>Then in that case, the nomadic tribes of Africa should see
                      plenty of health problems - but they don't! There are plenty of
                      pollutants in industrialised societies that affect our health in
                      detrimental ways. A sedentary lifestyle doesn't help either.</p>
              <p>And if you want to save the planet, buy local. Think of the
                      amount of energy that's wasted in transporting, storing and
                      preserving vegetables and food from abroad, and the nutrients that
                      are lost along the way. Of course, it's better if it's both local
                      and organic.</p>

              <p>Just a sample:-</p>
              <p>Life expectancy is 43 yrs for male 46yrs for female for the Tuareg , Average life expectancy for Arabs of Chad is 50.3 yrs.</p>
              <p>For the Tuareg:-</p>
              <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Living Conditions/Community Development Status</h3>
              <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <li>Food: Milk, millet, macaroni, rice, tomatoes, onions</li>
              <li>Shelter: Tents made from palmleaf mats or goatskins; in the towns sometimes 'banco' (mud-brick) houses.</li>
              <li>Clothing: The men wear a blue or black veil, covering their mouth (6 metres or more, sometimes with indigo pounded in), loose cotton trousers, a sleeveless shirt underneath an indigo gandurah. Young men may wear western clothes. The women have a blue, black or colourful skirt with a blouse, they will wear a scarf or a black or blue veil.</li>
              <li>Health care: There are hospitals in the towns and sometimes dispensaries in bigger villiages. Although medical care is very cheap, it is still too expensive for many, especially if medicines need to be bought. Many also make use of traditional medicine (Folk Islam).</li>
              <li>Water: Villiages have wells. The water from the wells is usually clean. In the towns there are certain people that own a tap and sell water by the bucket.</li>
              <li>Other: Wood is burned for cooking. Little oil lamps are used at night.
              <h3>Children/Youth</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Education/Type of Schooling: In 1993 about 15% of the children in Niger attended school, even though six years of attendance is compulsory. The numbers for the Tuareg will be much lower.</li>
              <li>Labour/Tasks: Young girls, often not older than five or six, help their mother with the cooking, fetching water, taking care of younger children. Boys might be required to help with the animals.</li>
              <li>Problems (Morality/Family/Insurrections/Etc.): The infant mortality rate was 111 per 1000 in 1986. Life expectancy is 43 years male, 46 female.</li>
              <li>Other: The Tuareg are monogamous, but divorce is very common. (A woman of 20 might have had three divorces already.) Consequently there is a lot of moving aroung, the family unit changing all the time.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>Health Care: Poor - becoming more open to professional medical assistance.</li>
              <li>Infant Mortality Rate: 13.2%</li>
              <li>Child Mortality Rate: 22.2%</li>
              <li>Life Expectancy Rate: 50.3 years</li>
              <li>From 3,904 - 178,353 patients/per doctor (depending on location)</li>
              <li>Comments: Mortality, life Expectancy information is based on the national average (1993).</li>
              <li>Diet/Food: Basic diet is millet, leaf and meat sauces.</li>
              <li>Water: Varies in availability and quality.</li>
              <li>Shelter: Chadian Arabs live in a variety of lifestyles. Nomadic groups have huts built with sticks, covered with mats bound together with leather. Villages have straw huts with distinctive semi-circular arched roof tops, which often become permanent features in villages. Others in larger urban areas may have mud brick houses.</li>
              <li>Electricity: Except in larger cities, there is none.</li>
              <li>Energy/Fuel: Food and water for camels. Wood and charcoal for domestic fuel.</li>
              <li>Clothing: Traditional - The men wear long robes called jalabiyas, and occasionally a white turban or type of cap called a 'tagiya'. Women in villages wear dresses or 'rabott' (typical Chadian wrap around material for bottom half of the body), and short veils. For occasions and going to the market, wear a 'lafai' which is a long piece (5 meters) of lightly woven material wrapped around the body and over the head. In the villages the women are often bare-breasted.</li>
              <li>Transportation: Public transport is mostly by market truck or the occasional bush taxis. Most frequent forms of transportation are camel, donkey, ox-carts, cattle (women may ride on the back of cattle), horse (men only) or by foot. Transportation in terms of reaching villages &amp; other areas is difficult because of dirt roads which during the rainy season are virtually impassable, except for 4 Wheel Drive vehicles, and then, travel is slow. Transportation in the towns is relatively easy.</li>
              <li>Comment: Adequacy of subsistence livelihood is variable. Nomadic Arab groups benefit less from development/aid work which focuses more on settled populations. Well projects do help the nomads.</li>

              <p>"Blood alkalinity" is another myth. Blood has buffers that
                      prevent its acidity from changing drastically. Otherwise, why is
                      lemon juice good for you?</p>
              <p>Cattle, chickens and sheep that are reared in most farms are fed
                      grains which are not part of their natural diet, hence they produce
                      more methane and fewer nutrients. Look for free range chickens and
                      eggs, pasture/grass-fed meat and dairy products and wild game and
                      fish. That would improve the situation far more than a vegan
                      diet.</p>
              <p>While you're at it, you should still eat plenty of fruit and
                      vegetables for fibre and antioxidants, as well as nuts (if you're
                      not allergic to them) for unsaturated fats. Oh, by the way, did you
                      know that padi fields also produce plenty of methane?</p>
              <p>And read up about strontium. It's more effective than calcium as
                      a bone-strengthening nutrient.</p>

              <p>Your free range grown animals may sound ideal, with the pros and cons of meat vs vegetarian aside:-</p>
              <p>However, 1) It is'nt the most efficient model of production.  2) Availablity of arable lands  3) population growth 4) Rising affluence of populous such as China and India, everyone wants a piece of economic success! 5) Disposal of organic matter, excreta etc.</p>
              <p>The current economic growth  model is not sustainable, with resources depleting fast, kind of reminds me of Easter Islands!</p>
