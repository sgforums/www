              the Tibetan Buddhist festival of Lhabab Duchen</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Gregory Elder 11/02/16 Redlands
              Daily Facts  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While the rest of the
              world goes on its way with the usual secular and religious holy days of
              November — Veterans Day, All Saints, All Souls, the Day of the Dead and
              Thanksgiving — our friends in the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism have a
              wonderful festival this month known as Lhabab Duchen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It traditionally falls on
              the 22nd day of the ninth lunar month on the ancient Tibetan calendar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This year it will fall on our secular calendar’s Nov. 22.
              It’s a great and powerful day for good deeds and it is held in special
              reverence in Tibet. This year it lands only two days before our Thanksgiving.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetan Buddhists are part of the larger Mahayana Buddhist
              traditions, which elevates the Buddha to a cosmic level and places special
              veneration on the life and spiritual good deeds of the Buddha. Tibetans
              celebrate four such days, each focused on an important part of the Buddha’s
              life and work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To understand the significance of Lhabab Duchen, perhaps a
              little bit of Buddhist back story is necessary. In the sixth century B.C., an
              Indian nobleman named Siddhartha Gautama engaged on a spiritual quest in which
              he sought the meaning of human life in general, and in particular he wished to
              find the path to freedom from reincarnation. After many days of spiritual
              struggle and meditation, he became the Buddha, or the Enlightened One, who had
              found this dharma, or teaching. This much is accepted by most Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetan Buddhists add to the story, saying that in his 41st
              year of life, the Buddha ascended to the 33rd heaven, where the gods reside.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lhabab Duchen is the day when the Buddha returned to the
              earth after visiting that 33rd level of the heavens. While on that exalted
              level, the Enlightened One gave spiritual teachings to the gods. He also
              honored his mother by freeing her from Samsara, or the wretched cycle of
              endless rebirth based on karma, which Buddhists and Hindus regard as the
              difficult fate of mankind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While the gods are at this high level, there is also desire
              present. Since desire is the force that dooms all to rebirth, the Buddha
              preached to the gods to assist them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From a Western perspective it is worth noting that this
              wonderful story places the Buddha’s mother so highly that she resides with the
              gods themselves, and the Buddha is superior to the deities, which says a great
              deal about how highly he is regarded.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While in that high place, the Buddha also encountered one of
              his closest followers whom he had taught while on earth, a disciple named
              Maudgalyayana. This arhat, or perfected soul, had been murdered on earth by
              robbers, but his spiritual status was so exalted that he was free from rebirth.
              While the Buddha was in the 33rd heaven, Maudgalyayana had previously been
              preaching to the dead on how to escape the chains of karma. Now, out of
              compassion, he called on the Buddha to return to his earthly mission, so that
              he could share his teachings with men and women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After a considerable debate, the Buddha agreed to return to
              the earth at the next full moon. When this occurred, Vishvakarma, whom Tibetans
              regard as the god of machines, created a triple ladder made of beryl, gold and
              silver, on which the Buddha descended back to the earth to continue his
              mission.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This return is regarded as one of the eight greatest deeds of
              the Buddha by Tibetans, and it was done out of compassion for humanity. It is
              this descent back to our troubled world which is celebrated on Lhabab Duchen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetan Buddhists regard Lhabab Duchen as “Buddha multiplying
              day.” This means that any compassionate or righteous action performed on this
              day is multiplied by 10 million in its spiritual power. On this day in actual
              history and modern times, pilgrims will visit Buddhist monasteries,
              particularly at Lhasa, which they regard most sacred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pilgrims will there prostrate themselves on the ground before
              the sacred images and burn incense to the gods, and some will paint ladders on
              the rocks nearby. The monks will chant special prayers, which are listened to
              by the faithful with considerable devotion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For those cynics who think your professor just makes all this
              stuff up, you can watch the monks chanting for Lhabab Duchen at
              www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvG1mqTj0L4.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Compassionate acts can be done across the world, such as
              lighting sacred lamps, because when the Buddha was in the heavens the faithful
              lighted light awaiting his return.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Reciting prayers is very important because special benefits
              accrue to those who recite the “Sutra of Remembering the Three Jewels,” a basic
              creed, which includes the words, “In nirvana where all suffering is transcended
              he does not abide; his abode is in the very summit of perfection, residing in
              that place where he perceives all living beings. Such are the sublime qualities
              that are the greatness of the Buddha, Victorious, Virtuous, and Transcendent.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most of all, the Tibetans believe that being generous with
              alms for the poor brings particular good karma and blessings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the West, perhaps we might smile at the simple belief that
              on one special day, all good deeds are 10 million times more valuable than
              those done on any other day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But to some wretched soul who receives an urgently need gift
              of alms or act of compassion, perhaps the righteous act is worth infinitely
              more than words can say.</span></p>
