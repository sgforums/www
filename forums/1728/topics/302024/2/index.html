And this leads to the awakening of inner wisdom. Perfectly correct, as this is what the Buddha has said.<br><br>However, do note that there are others Masters who confess humbly in their vcds that even they could not constantly ensure that their observation of precepts is perfect at all times. And this is something that is true for those who have more than 10 years of cultivation as a monk.<br><br>Those who study precepts and their correct observation in detail will know that even if a precept is carelessly broken, confession and repentance will not totally ensure that you will not suffer from negative karma.<br><br>There are some scriptures where the Buddha directly mentioned that they will fall into the 3 evil realms and did not give further instructions on what can be done to help them avoid such fate.<br><br>For example, if you are a monk and you killed a live fish during a famine to eat, you have broken the precept of non-killing and from what I remember from the dvd titled: The life of Master Jian Zhen (a well-know Master in the teaching of precepts during Ming or Ching Dynasty, I can't remember), he could not forgive that disciple of his, who killed a live fish to eat when they were stranded on an island.<br><br>This is how serious it is for both monks and layman who formally undertake to observe precepts. I'm not saying this to frighten or discourage, but it should be made known to all, so that they can choose wisely whether to follow or not. Whatever they choose, they should not influence others with their views.<br><br>Again the above is a personal view and nothing more.<br><br></div>

              <p>"I have observed that there are many people (mostly non-Buddhists) who think that Â‘Cause and effectÂ’ is a term coined by Buddhists to restrict their way of life or something is born out of delusional or fanatic thinking."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I in a bit of Taoism. In Taoism, there is also a cause and effect, just like yin&amp;yang, positive&amp;negative,etc...eventhough the practice can be to any lay person that it tends to frighten people to do good, example; punishment met out when the dead person goes to different levels of hades (tongues being cut for telling lies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif">) So if there is cause for telling lies, the effect or risk of tongue cutting upon the cosmic karma.<br>All religions are good or taught us to be good. It's just that the material needs and wants that humans are sometime disillusion into going to the wrong path.</p>
