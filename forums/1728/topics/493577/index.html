              relevant again</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Sanitsuda Ekachai, Bangkok
              Post, March 2, 2017</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Bangkok,
              Thailand -- So the Dhammakaya Temple is a cult. So its leader reportedly claims
              to be a doomsday saviour who takes rich donors on a tour to heaven to see the
              Buddha. So it teaches its followers to buy premium spaces in heaven by donating
              to the temple. So its doctrine on the permanence of self is against Buddhism.
              So what?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              problem of Dhammakaya is not so much what it teaches. Very few Buddhist temples
              in Thailand do not cash in on superstition. But its gigantic size, extensive
              reach and its grand ambition to take over the whole clergy has engendered
              widespread public concern. Its biggest problem -- a mistake to be precise -- is
              taking the wrong side of the political divide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Thaksin card played by Dhammakaya saved its leader from a court case over
              temple theft in 2006. But this is 2017. The anti-Thaksin regime is determined
              to weed out any perceived remnants of the Thaksin stronghold. It also probably
              wants to revive its sagging popularity by showing its middle-class supporters
              that only the regime can "protect Buddhism" and get rid of the
              cultish Dhammakaya once and for all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              can it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After
              throwing out a pro-Dhammakaya elder from the clergy's top job, and after
              staging three large-scale crackdowns that ended in embarrassing failure, the
              government vows to press on unless the Dhammakaya leader, Phra Dhammajayo,
              gives himself up to face legal charges of fraud and theft. The response? One
              suicide and signs of increasing defiance. A question arises: Who will blink
              first?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Now,
              let me be clear. I don't like Dhammakaya. I don't like it cashing in on
              people's superstitions and faith. I don't like how it spins Buddhist teachings,
              how it quantifies merit in monetary terms, how it caters to the rich, how it
              buys influence in the clergy and officialdom, how the temple is entangled in a
              web of corruption such as the Klongchan Credit Union scandal which led to Phra
              Dhammajayo's legal charges, and how the ex-abbot is using his supporters to
              protect himself which may cause violence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              I don't think military might is the answer when you are dealing with religious
              beliefs -- unless you want to see blood. I don't think if you don't like
              anything, you have the right to destroy it either. Doesn't our constitution --
              the one already endorsed by the military -- ensure freedom of religious beliefs?
              The regime is now caught in a dilemma. Backing off is a huge loss of face. But
              continuing the raids cannot promise the arrest of the fugitive abbot either.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Meanwhile,
              the regime's decision to fire the head of the Office of National Buddhism,
              believed to be a Dhammakaya sympathiser, will do little to ease resistance from
              the pro-Dhammakaya authorities -- and the clergy. On the contrary, it will
              intensify the resistance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is no secret that the majority of elders in the Supreme Sangha Council (SSC)
              are Dhammakaya sympathisers. That is why the previous supreme patriarch's
              ruling on Phra Dhammajayo on theft and distortion of Buddhism -- which deserved
              defrockment -- was never implemented. Instead, the SSC ruled to absolve Phra
              Dhammajayo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is also no secret either that a large number of temples and monks have been
              benefiting from financial support from Dhammakaya for decades, thanks to the
              elders' poor job of providing systematic support for temples and the need for
              better education of young monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              resistance from the mainstream clergy goes beyond short-term financial gifts
              from Dhammakaya; they fear for their own survival.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cleaning
              up temple corruption is one of the regime's agenda items to win public support
              when it staged the coup. We may take it as mere empty rhetoric, but for those
              who prosper from this oppressive and corrupt system, the talk of reform sends
              chills up their spine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              may be unhappy with the obsolete and inefficient clergy, but it is the only
              system open for poor, rural boys to get an education and an automatically
              higher social status, thanks to public respect for the saffron robes. The
              clergy's feudal hierarchy also promises its members near-royalty status if they
              successfully climb up the ecclesiastical ranks. It's understandable why they
              want to keep this system.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              monks' fears of the domino effect are fuelled by the fact that the main drivers
              of the anti-Dhammakaya campaigns are the same fierce critics of the Sangha
              Council and ardent pushers for the Sangha's restructuring. It's why they
              believe that if Dhammakaya falls, they fall too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It's
              also probably why an online message on the alleged attempt to amend the Sangha
              Act has gone viral.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              message focuses on alleged plans to restructure the Sangha Council, to
              dismantle the Office of National Buddhism, to combine two Buddhist universities
              of the Mahanikaya and Dhammayut sects, to force monks to reveal their bank
              accounts, to audit temple donations and to prevent monks from taking temple
              donations as their own. Interestingly, the message also claims alleged
              proposals to force monks who graduate from the monks' universities from leaving
              the monkhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Whether
              true or false, this viral message reflects the clergy's deep concerns. Or could
              it even be a ploy to instigate monks to protest against the junta? Indeed, can
              it cope with the 300,000-strong clergy and millions of Dhammakaya supporters
              combined?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What
              lies ahead? Ostracising the controversial temple for distorting Buddhist
              teachings? This is highly likely. This helps calm public fears of the
              Dhammakaya taking over the clergy, but the government needs to convince SSC
              elders to take this step. Even if they agree, we are only fooling ourselves in
              thinking the move will help "purify" Thai Buddhism -- as claimed by
              the anti-Dhammakaya camp.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              fact, the idea of purifying Thai Buddhism itself is questionable. Please tell
              me who has the moral right to judge what is "true" or
              "fake" Buddhism? The clergy? The elders who are completely irrelevant
              to today's world? The monks who are loyal to racist nationalism as opposed to
              the Buddha's teachings of tolerance and compassion? The male-dominated system
              which looks down on women? The so-called Buddhists who -- despite their claims
              to be "true" Buddhists -- mocked with glee when a Dhammakaya
              supporter hanged himself to protest the raids? Is hate part of their Buddhism?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What
              to do to get out of the Dhammakaya debacle? A better question is how to make
              Thai Buddhism more relevant to society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              transparency regarding temple donations is necessary, it's not enough. The same
              goes for efficient temple management. As long as the top-down feudal structure
              remains, monks will continue to seek feudal perks and privileges, leaving their
              spiritual mission and the poor behind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              long as the clergy can still depend on state subsidies and political support,
              they will refuse to fix their flaws. The public will continue&amp;nbsp;to be
              frustrated with the clergy and -- if Dhammakaya no longer exists, which is not
              likely in the near future -- people will still seek new religious groups that
              can satisfy their needs. And as long as the SSC retains authoritarian control
              over the whole clergy, there will always be attempts to infiltrate the SSC,
              which is very easy given its weakness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              government is partly to blame. In a departure from previous charters, the new
              one by the military regime promises special support for Theravada Buddhism. It
              also promises punishment for those who "destroy" Buddhism, an easy
              tool to punish dissent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              prevent the likes of the Dhammakaya, the government should only focus on
              setting up effective mechanisms to ensure transparency of temple donations and
              management with community and civil society participation. It should not touch
              the "faith" dimension. Nor the teachings. Let the people decide. Nor
              should it lend support to Theravada monks specifically, which perpetuates
              dependency and incompetence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cut
              the privileges. Temple donations, if managed efficiently free of embezzlement,
              are enough to modernise Theravada organisations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Monks
              need to learn how to "swim" in the open sea of highly competitive
              markets for faith to regain public trust. Buddhism teaches the path toward
              inner peace. Live that path to prove it's possible. It's the only way to become
              relevant to society again. It's easy if monks let go of greed.</span></p>
