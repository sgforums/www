              <p><strong>Text:</strong><br> The eight sufferings are: birth, old age, sickness, death, the
                  suffering of being separated from objects of love, <strong>the
                  suffering of encountering objects of hate</strong>, the suffering
                  of not getting what one seeks, and the suffering of the raging
                  blaze of the five skandhas.</p>
              <p><strong>Commentary:</strong><br> The eight sufferings are:<br> Birth: We are not aware of how painful the birth process is.
                  Actually when a person is born, he feels as much pain as a cow
                  being flayed alive, or as a live turtle getting its shell pulled
                  off. When a baby is born, the first thing it does is cry, "Ku, ku,
                  ku!" [In Chinese, the word ku for 'crying' ( ? ) sounds similar to
                  the word ku for 'suffering' ( ? ).] So children experience
                  suffering when they are first born. But after a few days, they
                  forget about the suffering and mistake it to be happiness. So
                  children will also smile and laugh. They think it's pretty nice,
                  that there's no more suffering. But as they get older--passing from
                  youth into the prime of life, and then onto old age--they
                  experience suffering again. When they are old, they don't have the
                  strength to chew their food or to walk, and everything becomes a
                  hassle. That's the suffering of old age. Sickness is also a kind of
                  suffering. When one is sick, everything one eats loses its flavor.
                  But there is no suffering greater than that of death. The Buddha
                  observed these four sufferings and it prompted him to leave the
                  home-life and cultivate. There are four additional kinds of
                  suffering: the suffering of being separated from objects of love.
                  When you are separated from the person you love most dearly, that
                  is this kind of suffering. When you lose your most treasured
                  possession, you also experience this kind of suffering. If someone
                  sets fire to your house, which you love to live in, you have this
                  suffering. If someone steals your favorite outfit, you also have
                  this suffering. In general, this suffering is experienced when
                  something or someone that you are very attached to and cannot let
                  go of is taken away from you. <strong>The suffering of encountering
                  objects of hate. There may be someone you absolutely detest, so you
                  decide to go somewhere else to get away from the person. But when
                  you go to another place, you meet the same kind of person there.
                  You hate him and loathe him, but as things turn out, you keep
                  running into him.</strong> The suffering of not getting what one
                  seeks. There is something you really wish to have, but you just
                  can't obtain it. That's also a kind of suffering. The suffering of
                  the raging blaze of the five skandhas. The five skandhas are form,
                  feeling, thought, formations, and consciousness. They are like a
                  roaring fire, and they also constitute a kind of suffering,
                  although no one considers it to be suffering. Once you awaken to
                  this kind of suffering, you'll know that it's worse than
                  anything.</p>

              <p>My observation:</p>
              <p>People who are problematic, who like to cause troubles and find faults with others are usually people who have problems inside themselves that are bothering them, that is why they see the world as problematic. The world is just a reflection of what is already in them. Some demonic, bad energies, are already living inside these people. Very much like being controlled by some bad forces within them.  Agree?</p>
              <p>My way of handling these people is to let them ( memories of bad incidents) go and sit at the Feet of God. I tried to offer my bad thoughts to God and ask God to illumine these people. I try not to hold on to those bad memories for too long because I know it will affect my poise. My running helps a lot too. My running is like my vipasana because when I run, I have very few thoughts, only my breathing in and out and the awareness of the present place where I am running, very much like being aware of my present moment? I just imagine breathing in good cosmic energy and breathing out all my stresses. It helps a lot.  </p>
              <p>It seems that a lot of people, when they are unhappy, they would go out and run to feel better after that. Quite a few guys actually took up running when they broke up with their girlfriends. So next time you see a new guy running...hmmm...just maybe they just.... (just kidding. ) My own teacher Sri Chinmoy said that running is meditation for the body.  </p>

                  Vipashyana is acknowlegding, not suppressing nor bypassing .  It is about acknowlegding; bads, good and neutral  thoughts arising is co dependent on self.

              <p>   Well since so many have shared their problems , think i shall share some too . Ever since i was small , i was always rejected by pple no matter kids of my age or pple of my current age . So i tell myself why should i try so hard to make friends only to be laff or bullied upon , i tell myself i don't need friends anymore . And that has stayed until now that i have less then 5 friends that i am still in good terms .</p>
              <p>   Even when i work , i always encounter bad pple whom either bootlick superior at the expense of me , make a big hoo haa from a small mistake i make in my work , scolding me non stop for half an hour just prove that i am just another " log " or easy target to " kill off " , even tell their " minions " to be harsh with me , no need to give any respect , tell my boss that i don't know how to do anything and that i need and always rely on them to do the work just to kick me to another section of the same dept  and etc.</p>
              <p>  Even when they do all these to me even until now , i either only smiled sarcasticly at them or just tell them off . Although i do wish that all that they have done to me will go back to them but i know its almost impossible unless their retribution arrives . And until now even who used to be my colleague whom has help me seek redress before has also turned against me a few times and even tried to make use of me for his own gain . But i always try to talk to him nicely cos i know he is not that bad to the core unlike some other colleague of the other race .</p>
              <p>  Bear with it ? Forgive and forget ? I'm sorry i find it hard to do so although i do wish to do that . But i know my bad karma has yet to finish and i still have to be wary of pple around me and ... still not to make friends even if they do help me a few times . Cause eventually they always turn against me .</p>
