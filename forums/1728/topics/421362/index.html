              <p><strong>Text: </strong><br>The eight sufferings are: birth, old age, sickness, death, the suffering of being separated from objects of love, <strong>the suffering of encountering objects of hate</strong>, the suffering of not getting what one seeks, and the suffering of the raging blaze of the five skandhas.</p>
              <p><strong>Commentary: </strong><br>The eight sufferings are: <br>Birth: We are not aware of how painful the birth process is. Actually when a person is born, he feels as much pain as a cow being flayed alive, or as a live turtle getting its shell pulled off. When a baby is born, the first thing it does is cry, "Ku, ku, ku!" [In Chinese, the word ku for 'crying' ( ? ) sounds similar to the word ku for 'suffering' ( ? ).] So children experience suffering when they are first born. But after a few days, they forget about the suffering and mistake it to be happiness. So children will also smile and laugh. They think it's pretty nice, that there's no more suffering. But as they get older--passing from youth into the prime of life, and then onto old age--they experience suffering again. When they are old, they don't have the strength to chew their food or to walk, and everything becomes a hassle. That's the suffering of old age. Sickness is also a kind of suffering. When one is sick, everything one eats loses its flavor. But there is no suffering greater than that of death. The Buddha observed these four sufferings and it prompted him to leave the home-life and cultivate. There are four additional kinds of suffering: the suffering of being separated from objects of love. When you are separated from the person you love most dearly, that is this kind of suffering. When you lose your most treasured possession, you also experience this kind of suffering. If someone sets fire to your house, which you love to live in, you have this suffering. If someone steals your favorite outfit, you also have this suffering. In general, this suffering is experienced when something or someone that you are very attached to and cannot let go of is taken away from you. <strong>The suffering of encountering objects of hate. There may be someone you absolutely detest, so you decide to go somewhere else to get away from the person. But when you go to another place, you meet the same kind of person there. You hate him and loathe him, but as things turn out, you keep running into him. </strong>The suffering of not getting what one seeks. There is something you really wish to have, but you just can't obtain it. That's also a kind of suffering. The suffering of the raging blaze of the five skandhas. The five skandhas are form, feeling, thought, formations, and consciousness. They are like a roaring fire, and they also constitute a kind of suffering, although no one considers it to be suffering. Once you awaken to this kind of suffering, you'll know that it's worse than anything.</p>

              <p>In my earlier post, I did mention I avoided going to a temple because someone there made life difficult for me. I told the shifu there that the next time I see her (that person) again without anger, it means I have succeeded in my practice.</p>
              <p>I shall go to the temple again and see how I feel when seeing her. There was this young Buddhist called me the other day that she said whenever she went to that temple and saw that person, she refused to chant. She too is using her as a goal to see whether she has succeeded in her practice. We both laugh at our stupidity but what to do, afterall we are humans.</p>

              <p>my previous senior manager, human affinity not that good. does not treat the workers very good. treat client hypocritically. most ppl dislike him. think he very smart, though he do have experience in operation, but not in managing. make the working enviro very stiff and stressful. think he also scolded by the big boss regularly, so he also scolded his subordinate. somemore a prayer of Guan Yin Pusa. guess é�“ä¸�å�Œ,ä¸�ç›¸ä¸ºè°‹...tot i practice my tolerance skill, but no more chance, quited and joined another better bigger company and boss. now my director said, i hire u to have fun and enjoy and be happy, not to work ur heart out. Family and health is number one. direct opposite of previous.</p>
              <p>but here in good enviroment, it is to practice not to like it too much. as taught by MCK.</p>

              <p>What happens when you have a relative slandering you incessantly (every day or a few times a day).  And I mean real slander, as in telling <strong>untruths</strong>, causing all sorts of trouble, even to the point of ill-treating my grandmother.  But she goes and tells her sons that WE are ill-treating grandma and cause all sorts of quarrels, displeasure, distrust and HATRED among siblings.  Calling people up between 5 to 20 times a day and cause all manner of emotional turbulence. </p>
              <p>I came on the forum tonight for the first time in many, many days because I was so caught up with the duties of looking after my sick grandma in hospital.  I was literally praying that there would be a topic I can suitably post about my problem.  I didn't think there would be anywhere, or anyone I could ask for advice.  And "click", I see this thread. </p>
              <p>It was around October that in desperation I ran to Kuan Yin temple at Waterloo St. (even while knowing it's not very orthodox Buddhist) to ask for help in letting go of my dislike and hatred for this person and her sons.  And I also prayed for grandma's speedy release from this Saha world and samsara (grandma's wish).  Within days, I was led by chance to chant the Cunde Mantra.  I slept well for the first time in days ever since I chanted.  But that benefit has gone away since then, because this relative is incessantly and unrelentingly harrassing us.</p>
              <p>This has been going on for <strong>months</strong> ever since my grandfather left grandma behind (passed away). </p>
              <p>Today I've reached boiling stage where I feel almost ready to shoot someone. </p>
              <p>Don't tell me to let go.  It's not me who doesn't wanna let go.  She's biting like a mad dog.  Other relatives have also quarreled heatedly with her, to the point of wanting to hit her.  My father literally had to push her physically away when she went on a ranting, raving tirade the other day. </p>
              <p>And yes, she's already seeing a psychiatrist. </p>
              <p>Ideas.... real solutions anyone?</p>

              <p>Only those who have taken care of suffering dementia patients really know the difficulties.  Some demented patients are very mild and they become happier than they ever were previously.... but some like my grandma, become aggressive (even spiteful) and very depressed.  If my family has one such case, I can imagine that all over the world there are other old <em>amahs</em> and <em>agongs</em> like her too. </p>
              <p>... thanks for listening!</p>

              <p>i suffered from an idiot dementia old man who is totally unrelated to me in any way. Just an idiot neighbour who then used me to lure all his unfilial sons home to listen to his lies.  Police got involved.  Even went to mediation but didn't solve any problem because this idiot dementia old man could only get his attention when he created problems for me.  He was aggressive and even challenged me to a fight.</p>
              <p>I had to pray hard at my altar to let this stop.  Finally he died suddenly and this stopped.  I was harrassed for two years for this idiot's selfish purpose. I am just glad my prayer wish came true.</p>
              <p>Peace resumed and the neighbour 's unfilial sons left me alone . They got into trouble with the Police though because the old idiot kept calling the Police for no good reason and nobody could stop him. </p>
              <p>The whole family including the old wife can not look me in the eyes nowadays. </p>
              <p>I did practice tolerance in the beginning, keep finding excuses to forgive the idiot.</p>
              <p>The problem is one hand cannot clap alone and since the idiot insisted to create non-existing lies so that his sons, daughters and grandchildren would return to visit him, i had to suffer for two years before his death ended everyone's misery.</p>
              <p>I didn't get any of my family members involved because i didn't want this to become two family war.  I just kept mum about my sufferings. Even when a good friend wanted to meditate for me , i refused. I knew what the old idiot is up to and i didn't want anyone else to be involved in his selfish silly plots. </p>
              <p>Sometimes old people create more problems for others than being helpful. Especially those with dementia or suffering from loneliness.  </p>

              Actually the title of the topic already gives us the perspective, when is it that we need to forgive, and when there is'nt a need to forgive.  
                                              
              It is when we are attached to the issue at hand on a personal level, that we have attraction and aversion, what is is pleasant and what that is not to us, that arouses us us to reaction. For it is only when we  or "I" is offended, it is then that there is a need to forgive, a need to let go of our attachment to the issue. The way we react strongly to an issue, is a result from, or can also form a basis to reactionary tendencies to future adversarial encounters. Thus forms a vicious cycle, often with us being unaware of it's cause, as we are often clouded by our emotions. 
                                                              
              The basis of Buddhism is the cultivation of  "no self ", as it is the reaction in reference to self that arises the cloud of emotion, attraction to pleasantness and aversion to unpleasantness.  We forgive because there is clinging and a need to forgive, and if you are not being personally attached, is there still a need to forgive?
                          
              We practice loving kindness and compassion to allow us to empathize, to see the suffering of our fellow sentient beings so that we do not form prejudiced thoughts, behaviour  and reaction from forming within us. When we are able to empathize, we no longer regard our subject of attention as something separate and opposite us, that the self in us slowly dissolves.  Hell! it is not easy, if it were that easy, most of us will not be here right now, going round and round. 
                      
              One way, is to get ourselves ordained and leave the environment that reinforces the "self" view  and work on our residual tendencies.
                      
              The other is to practise bodhicitta, by taking the bodhisatta vows. As long as we are understand our wisdom and meaningful abilities(skillful means) are not fully developed, we work with and on what is in front of us now. 
                      
              But being compassionate does'nt means condone another wrong doings, it means seeking the most amiable solutions to the issue. This is where solutions differed due our ignorance or lack of off. The clearer our minds are, the wider our vision and probabilities of dealing are. 
                  
              Being right  or thinking we are right  and others wrong also can sometimes leads us to self righteousness, it may be pride, it may be jealousy, desire, ignorance, miserliness or anger the lead us to this line of thinking, leading to impose suffering on others. Constant vigilance is needed, both outward and inward.

                                  Change is inevitable, has always been. 
                                  
                                  Forgiveness, in this instance, is not for benefit for the perpetuator of injustice, but for  the victim. The bigger the affliction, the deeper the scarring, hence the need to let go of what's passed. For example, if you have lost someone close to you,  whether the perpetuator is punished or is not punished, if you cannot accept the loss, you will still suffer the loss, it is inevitable.  
                          
                          
                                  
                                   However, that does'nt mean the wrong doer will go scot free, he will have to be accountable and bear responsibility for his negative deeds.  We often assume that the recourse of justice is always available to us, because we live in a society with relatively higher levels of  awareness on equality and human dignity. This not always applicable.
                          
                          
                                  
                                   Buddhist are often accused of being passive, but that is not true. Doing what's right in life can be seen as courage of two kinds, the active and the passive. The active comes in doing what right and not what's getting things going for the worse and getting people hurt or killed. The passive one is about keeping peace and enduring when conditions for changes for the better are not forthcoming. Not being emotive  allows us to be more objective when confronted with issues.  Raising awareness in a calm, dignified, a non  aggressive and  non confrontational manner appeals more to a typical Buddhist, but I am just generalising.  Your interest lies mainly in the perceived hypocrisy certain parties and wishes to arouse a reaction.
                                  
                          
                          
                                   There was story of an monk on seeing the mother with her wilful child, in which he exclaimed" punish your son, punish your son", which the mother did not. Later on the monk met the mother again, this time at the son's execution. Then the monk told the mother, that were she was able to heed his advice and disciplined the son,  the son would not have met his fate.

              <p>Buddhism teaches wisdom. I guess we also have to use our wisdom to forgive. I'm not criticising Christianity but I'm quoting a real life example which happened in Singapore many years ago and you guys tell me is this the right way to forgive.</p>

I couldn't remember the family posted in her obituary or told the reporter that they had forgiven the rapist because of their religion. They said this just days after the case and before the rapist got caught ,repented or felt regretted. Don't you think the rapist will be even more daring and go round committing crimes thinking that what he had committed was nothing serious. The family's statement could even encourage potential rapists.</p>

              <p>different roles different ways to resolving problems - some things can be forgiven, some things need to be changed that leads to progresses....religions are bystanders or observers of such change</p>

                  That's what the law for! Whether the parents forgive the rapist or not, the rapist is still  incarcerated for the crime. We live in a society with laws as deterents, and if you break a law that leaves you liable for hanging, you better not break that law. 
                  The laws forms a deterence and also offer some form of recompense, but if you cannot let go and forgive, you will be still be suffering a loss even after the offender has been executed.
