              <p>What happens when you have a relative slandering you incessantly (every day or a few times a day).  And I mean real slander, as in telling <strong>untruths</strong>, causing all sorts of trouble, even to the point of ill-treating my grandmother.  But she goes and tells her sons that WE are ill-treating grandma and cause all sorts of quarrels, displeasure, distrust and HATRED among siblings.  Calling people up between 5 to 20 times a day and cause all manner of emotional turbulence. </p>
              <p>I came on the forum tonight for the first time in many, many days because I was so caught up with the duties of looking after my sick grandma in hospital.  I was literally praying that there would be a topic I can suitably post about my problem.  I didn't think there would be anywhere, or anyone I could ask for advice.  And "click", I see this thread. </p>
              <p>It was around October that in desperation I ran to Kuan Yin temple at Waterloo St. (even while knowing it's not very orthodox Buddhist) to ask for help in letting go of my dislike and hatred for this person and her sons.  And I also prayed for grandma's speedy release from this Saha world and samsara (grandma's wish).  Within days, I was led by chance to chant the Cunde Mantra.  I slept well for the first time in days ever since I chanted.  But that benefit has gone away since then, because this relative is incessantly and unrelentingly harrassing us.</p>
              <p>This has been going on for <strong>months</strong> ever since my grandfather left grandma behind (passed away). </p>
              <p>Today I've reached boiling stage where I feel almost ready to shoot someone. </p>
              <p>Don't tell me to let go.  It's not me who doesn't wanna let go.  She's biting like a mad dog.  Other relatives have also quarreled heatedly with her, to the point of wanting to hit her.  My father literally had to push her physically away when she went on a ranting, raving tirade the other day. </p>
              <p>And yes, she's already seeing a psychiatrist. </p>
              <p>Ideas.... real solutions anyone?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I can understand your anger. If she has a psychiatric problem, then there is nothing you can do because you can't talk sense to her. Just let her sons or your relatives know that she has psychiatric problem and is seeing a psychiatrist, may be they will realise what is the real problem and stop believing her words.</p>

              <p>Buddhism teaches wisdom. I guess we also have to use our wisdom
              to forgive. I'm not criticising Christianity but I'm quoting a real
              life example which happened in Singapore many years ago and you
              guys tell me is this the right way to forgive.</p>
              <p>Many years ago, there was a young lady from a Christian
              family was raped and murdered. I couldn't remember the family
              posted in her obituary or told the reporter that they had
              forgiven the rapist because of their religion. They said this just
              days after the case and before the rapist got caught ,repented or
              felt regretted. Don't you think the rapist will be even more
              daring and go round committing crimes thinking that what he had
              committed was nothing serious. The family's statement could even
              encourage potential rapists.</p>

              <p><br>That's what the law for! Whether the parents forgive the rapist or not, the rapist is still incarcerated for the crime. We live in a society with laws as deterents, and if you break a law that leaves you liable for hanging, you better not break that law. The laws forms a deterence and also offer some form of recompense, but if you cannot let go and forgive, you will be still be suffering a loss even after the offender has been executed.</p>

                  Still, he will have to keep on evading the law. When one does not have a conscience, one can only be sorry when he has to suffer the consequence of his actions. Then there consequence of karma at the next life.  But if one still have conscience, then one will still suffer the guilt even he does not get caught.

              Phenomena of coalescence and defragmentation depends on conditions being right, a grounswell perhaps. I am also partial to the peter's principle, rising to the levels of one's incompetence, but that's another story is'nt it.

              <p>I had a campmate during ns who used to shout at me over small things last time, sometimes even when the superior is around, and worse if the superior is nt around/attending meeting. Sometimes, also make fun of me together with other ppl. Somemore, i came into the dept earlier than him.</p>
              <p>My understudy and another guy also somehow 'teamed up' with him in the end coz he didnt like my work. Imagine understudy bullying and the superior dun want to do anything much about it, all in the name of 'she just wants to finish her job efficiently'. Theres once i almost wanted to punch him, but if i did that, i will end up in DB. If i shouted back at him, most likely will end up in a huge quarrel and fight. I had to tolerate it everyday for nine months till ord.</p>

              <p>Be gentle.</p>
              <p>As a zen-ish yogi, this is what I learned from my teacher, whose name he does not bother, and whom I refer as a way to address anything from a cat to a bowl of porridge to my most revered teacher.</p>
              <p>Sometimes reading nice discussions like this make me fall back to basics. What basics? The basic truth of human inner goodness. I have to push myself a little to ask this: will you, anyone, whether angry or happy, wish harm upon ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... a little kitten?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.... a little newborn?</p>
              <p>or raindrops that fall on your window pane creating a nice melody of sounds?</p>
              <p>YET!</p>
              <p>Towards fellow human beings, especially those who live immensely close and share strong hate and love with us, sometimes death we wish upon them. Evil is fuel. Good is fuel. The Buddha taught only to Abandon Evil, Do Good, Purify the Mind. Purifying the mind, i guess, i am not too sure, i have not so much experience, simply refers to a stage when... having seen that evil is well.. heck.. indeed evil, and that good is.. wow, great, but only this much, the next time we see the duckhead who somehow or rather, makes us angry... i imagine there are two approaches or more.</p>
              <p>The first one, is we imagine them to be ikan bilis, put them into our mouths, crunch crunch crunch. The second, we imagine ourselves to be ikan bilis, they want to crunch us, we put up a struggle, then somehow or rather, words won't win the argument, but experience does.</p>
              <p>If love do not separate us, and hate cannot, maybe yeah, forgiveness might.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go mind your own business! Shoo!</p>

              <p><strong>On the contrary, we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to those very persons, making them as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love — thoughts that have grown great, exalted and measureless.</strong></p>

              <p>thus i heard a touching story, when King Yao Shun was alive, people commited crimes. He saw a criminal was chained and was about to sent to imprisonment. King Yao Shun then asked him what had he commited. He said that it had not rain for a long time, and their crops cannot harvest. there were nothing to eat, hence he stole some food and commited the crime. <br>After hearing that, King Yao Shun told the soldier to release the person. and also told the soldier to cuff Him up instead saying the person is not at fault, but the King is at fault. As a King, He did not take good care of the people and offended the heaven, hence heaven did not bring about rain. King Yao Shun wholeheartedly repented. A moment there after, the sky starts to rain.</p>

              <p>i agree with sinweiy.</p>
              <p>Hence the many names for the Buddha. As an academic subject, it is not easy to grasp. But yet, some areas, ever relevant 2500 years later. It does not really matter to a Buddha, but yet it matters, to us.</p>
              <p>Took me a fair amount of time to think through a stage when I was asking, why did He attain nirvana, but not me yet? Then my teacher popped by (that's what Zen teachers do), with an email, telling me to go see a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>It is not "don't ask", it is just.. somethings the Buddha himself proclaim, somebody else can grab the sutra I have no idea which, that somethings He himself refuses to speak of. My favourite anecdote is the one where He told Ananda, the teachings I taught you are like the leaf compared to the tree. It is enough, man, it is enough for the future generations till the dharma ending age.</p>

                  any problem because this idiot dementia old man could only get his
                  attention when he created problems for me.  He was aggressive
                  and even challenged me to a fight.</p>
              <p>I had to pray hard at my altar to let this stop.  Finally
                  he died suddenly and this stopped.  I was harrassed for two
                  years for this idiot's selfish purpose. I am just glad my prayer
                  wish came true.</p>
              <p>Peace resumed and the neighbour 's unfilial sons left me alone .
                  They got into trouble with the Police though because the old idiot
                  kept calling the Police for no good reason and nobody could stop
                  him. </p>
              <p>The whole family including the old wife can not look me in the
                  eyes nowadays. </p>
              <p>I did practice tolerance in the beginning, keep finding excuses
                  to forgive the idiot.</p>
              <p>The problem is one hand cannot clap alone and since the idiot
                  insisted to create non-existing lies so that his sons, daughters
                  and grandchildren would return to visit him, i had to suffer for
                  two years before his death ended everyone's misery.</p>
              <p>I didn't get any of my family members involved because i didn't
                  want this to become two family war.  I just kept mum
                  about my sufferings. Even when a good friend wanted to
                  meditate for me , i refused. I knew what the old idiot is up to and
                  i didn't want anyone else to be involved in his selfish silly
                  plots. </p>
              <p>Sometimes old people create more problems for others than being
                  helpful. Especially those with dementia or suffering from
                  loneliness.  </p>

              <p>I can't say I don't understand your angst because my grandmother also ever inadvertently called the police against us when she talked nonsense in hospital after a fall.  She told nurses just before a much-needed surgery that there were people trying to do her in at home, when the only other person at home was my long-suffering grandfather. </p>
              <p>But I suppose, suffering at the hands of a relative with dementia is different from your case where the person was someone you didn't even have affection for.  There are mixed feelings for families with dementia patients.  You remember the love they gave you when they were more normal, but you also find it so frustrating dealing with their aggression and accusations. </p>
              <p>Our motivations for wanting her to be released from the current incarnation are more out of unwillingness to see her suffer, but admittedly also because we are exhausted and taxed.  In my better moments, I feel a lot of compassion for her and try to calm her emotionally.  At other times, I just stare painedly at her and hope for a release for all involved.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry for hijacking this thread, but for me on a personal level, this is also about forgiveness and letting go.  I can't discuss this at a theoretical or philisophical level at present, because this is what happening to me right now.  Buddha was right about the Four Noble Truths.  Spot on....</p>

              <p>I can understand your anger. If she has a psychiatric problem,
              then there is nothing you can do because you can't talk sense to
              her. Just let her sons or your relatives know that she has
              psychiatric problem and is seeing a psychiatrist, may be they will
              realise what is the real problem and stop believing her words.</p>

              <p>They are her sons.  They would surely know she has a psychiatric problem since they are paying for treatment, but I think it runs deeper than that.  Mental poisons permeate this person, and she has also very much been involved in spiritual medium and black magic type of stuff.  Often when I'm near her, I have to remind myself to chant, so as not to be sucked in by her negativity.  Admittedly, because I'm so new to chanting, my resolve é¼ŽåŠ› is not strong enough.  She's scary in her ability to cause trouble ç ´å�� and we never knew she was so scary until the past one year when bereavement and grandma's illness needed us to meet up so much more often.</p>
