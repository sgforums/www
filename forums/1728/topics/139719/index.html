            <div class='col-md body'><strong>About past lives ... Uniontown WW II flyer's memories in Louisiana boy</strong><br>By Judy Kroeger<br>DAILY COURIER<br>Thursday, April 15, 2004<br><br>James Leininger, 6, of Lafayette, La., loves airplanes.<br><br>"He has always been extraordinarily interested in airplanes," said James' mother, Andrea Leininger, by telephone from their Louisiana home.<br><br>Lots of kids love airplanes, but James' story is unique. He has memories of being a World War II fighter pilot from Uniontown -- Lt. James McCready Huston, shot down near Iwo Jima in 1945.<br><br>At 18 months old, his father, Bruce Leininger, took James to the Kavanaugh Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, where the toddler remained transfixed by World War II aircraft.<br><br>A few months later, the nightmares began.<br><br>"They were terrible, terrible," Andrea said. "He would scream, 'airplane crash, on fire, little man can't get out!' He'd be kicking, with his hands pointing up at the ceiling."<br><br>When James was 2 1/2 years old, he and Andrea were shopping and he wanted a toy airplane. "I said to him, 'Look, it has a bomb on the bottom' and he told me, 'That's not a bomb, it's a drop tank.' I had no idea what a drop tank was."<br><br>Neither of the Leiningers have ever served in the military, nor are they involved with aviation. Until James began showing an interest in planes, they had nothing aviation-related in their home.<br><br>Andrea's mother sent her a book by Pennsylvania author Carol Bowman, called "Children's Past Lives." The Leiningers started using Bowman's techniques of affirming James' nightmares and assuring him that the experiences happened to a different person, not the person he was now. "It helped. The nightmares stopped almost immediately," Andrea said.<br><br>However, the memories did not stop, but they do not come up all the time.<br><br>"I was reading him a story and he got a faraway look," she recalled. "I asked what happened to your plane? 'Got shot,' he said. Where? 'Engine.' Where did it crash? 'Water.' When I asked him who shot the plane, he gave me a look like a teenager, rolling his eyes, 'the Japanese,' like who else could it have been?<br><br>"What little kid knows about the Japanese," she asked. "He said he knew it was a Japanese plane because of the red sun. My husband and I were shell-shocked."<br><br>James provided other information. He said his earlier name was James, he flew a Corsair and took off on a boat called the Natoma, and he remembered a fellow flyer named Jack Larson.<br><br>Foods can set James' memories off, too.<br><br>"I hadn't made meatloaf in 10 years, so James had never had it," Andrea said. "When he sat down, he said, 'Meatloaf! I haven't had that since I was on the Natoma.' When we were getting ice cream one day, he told me that they could have ice cream every day on the Natoma."<br><br>Bruce began researching his son's memories and discovered a small escort carrier called the Natoma Bay, which was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima. Twenty-one of its crew perished. Bruce also discovered that only one of the Natoma's crew was named James, James Huston.<br><br>James Huston's plane was hit in the engine by Japanese fire on March 3, 1945, went down in flames and sank immediately. Flyer Jack Larson witnessed the crash.<br><br>James Huston was born Oct. 22, 1923, in South Bend, Ind., and lived in Uniontown during the 1930s. His father was James McCready Huston Sr., of Brownsville, and Daryl Green Huston, who was born in New Geneva and grew up in Uniontown. James was the only son.<br><br>According to Lt. Huston's cousin, Bob Huston of Flatwoods, the elder Huston started several newspapers and published 13 books. He was living in Brownsville when two Navy officers informed Huston of his son's death.<br><br>"I didn't know James," Bob Huston said. His parents were divorced, "but I knew his father. He stayed with us in Brownsville. James was on his 50th mission and would have come home if he'd lived another five minutes."<br><br>The Leiningers have been in touch with Bob Huston.<br><br>"I knew what happened to James (Huston)," he said. "I was excited to hear from them (the Leiningers). The boy's mother was flabbergasted when all this happened."<br><br>Andrea believes that her son is the reincarnation of Lt. James Huston. "There are so many little things. I believe in reincarnation now."<br><br>Her husband, Bruce, remains skeptical. "He started researching to disprove what James was telling us, and ended up proving it all," he said. "I think he believes that James Huston's spirit has manifested itself in our son somehow."<br><br>The Leiningers have been in touch with Natoma Bay veterans, too.<br><br>"We didn't tell the veterans for a long time," Andrea said, "but everyone has a story about having had a spirit visit them. James' sister, Anne Barron, was in California talking to him the day he was killed. Anne believes James' story, because he has provided so much information that only her brother could have known.<br><br>"Families of the 21 men who were killed are talking to each other," continued Andrea. "It's brought them together."<br><br>The Leiningers plan to attend this year's Natoma Bay reunion and bring their son, James.<br><br>Andrea doesn't know why this has happened.<br><br>"If he did come back, why? Maybe it was so my husband could write the book about the Natoma Bay," she said. "It helped turn the tide of the war in the Pacific and was one of the most highly decorated carriers, but it hasn't received much recognition."<br><br>She said her husband has been working on a chronology of what's happened to James and is researching the book. "He has flight plans from the missions and has spent a year and a half on research. In the introduction, he's writing about how he found out about the ship."<br><br>That discovery, through a toddler's fascination with airplanes and nightmares, has led to a segment on national television.<br><br>ABC contacted Carol Bowman about her work on children's past lives and James Leininger's experience was the most verifiable, Andrea said. "And we agreed to share his story."<br><br>Chris Cuomo will host the segment, which airs tonight at 10.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Judy Kroeger can be reached at jkroeger@tribweb.com or (724) 626-3538.</span><br>------------------------<br>From :  help@reincarnationforum.com <br>Sent :  Friday, July 01, 2005 1:12:03 AM<br>Subject :  ABC Primetime Special<br><br>Check your local listings for ABC --- Primetime - Thursday, June 30 at 10 p.m.<br>ET:<br><br>"Primetime Live" takes a look at "The Unexplainable":<br><br>ABC Primetime television will be rebroadcasting the story of James Leininger,<br>age 6, of Lafayette, La.

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally believe this is true. and in fact this is not the only case.... but one of out the many..<br><br>His unexplained deep interest at such a young age in airplanes without their parents involvement means he might have gotten the karmic seed with airplanes in the past life.<br><br>And having terrible nightmares about being shot, very often, might have to do with the karmic seeds from past life. He also seem to know a lot of things about airplanes and about the Japanese. etc... well there are too many things and I am quite convinced it is true, plus they even went on Interview by the ABC news agency.</div>

So that once we hear about the Buddha Dharma, we be attracted to it without knowing why.<br><br>Repenting by regression is one of the most important means for purifying ourselves. We need to think back what weÂ’d done wrong or what bad habits weÂ’d picked up in the past. And it can go way back to our past lives.<br><br>Many ppl I know can do that. For example, one remembers that he was an ox in previous life. Another knows that he was a monk once. I can also remember some too. We would have flashbacks withdrawn from Alaya consciousness while repenting in Samadhi.<br><br>The point is not to find out who we were but what weÂ’d done wrong. And the way to purify Alaya consciousness is to expose those records to others, especially to our master or the Buddha. It works best if they are exposed to the public. This is also the best way to remove self-attachment(Ã¢tma-grÃ¢ha).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rebirth happens to everyone who is still trapped within Samsara as Sentient Beings... as I have posted earlier there are 31 planes of existences which one may be reborned to. Generally speaking, there are 3 lower realms: Hell, Ghosts, Animals, and 3 higher realms: Asuras, Humans, Devas.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When people die, the six sense organs no longer function. The seventh mind-consciousness leaves the body, and carrying with it the eighth mind-consciousness in search of the conditions for rebirth. This mind-consciousness, which is invisible and an intermediate existence between death and conception to the next life, is also called a 'transient-being'. For a period of up to 49 days, this consciousness shall search for the conditions for rebirth to the next life.</span><br><br>We are reborned according to our karma, which is why before we are liberated, it is also important that we do not commit evil acts, and keep the 5 precepts to ensure that we do not fall into the 3 lower realm: Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not lie, Do not have sexual misconducts, Do not take intoxicants (drugs and alcohol), and in addition we must do the 10 Virtuous Deeds: Refrain from (1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) sexual misconduct , (4) false speech, (5) frivolous and meaningless talk, (6) double-tongue or tale-bearing, (7) slanderous speech, (<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> greed, (9) ill will, (10) ignorance or perverted views.<br><br>But even a rebirth in Heaven or Human life, however good it may be, is impermanent. Everything that has a start has an end... everything is unexpected. As long as we have a slightest bit of ignorance, it can cause us sufferings in the future. Therefore ultimately, a Buddhist seeks enlightenment to be liberated out of Samsara (world of sufferings), and to end rebirth and enter into Nirvana, the highest bliss. As long as we have any attachments, any Greed, any Hatred, any Ignorance, it is impossible for us to attain enlightenment and enter Nirvana. So apart from 'Doing good, avoid evil', a very important thing Buddhists must do is to 'Purify the mind'.<br><br>Practise, practise! Even rebirth and past life will reveal to you clearly when you have the dhyanic capacity to see it for yourself.</div>

It must be a very traumatic experience.<br><br>Violence and wars is really terrible and is something that Buddha is against. Buddhism teaches non-violence, non-hatred, peace... and unlike many religions it has never experienced religious wars in history. War is the perfect example of ignorance causing sufferings in the world, which is why my master says.. "If we are oftem mindful that ignorance does not arise, the world will be at peace." There are many stories of people converting to Buddhism after seeing the horrors of wars, a famous example being King Ashoka.<br></div>
