            <div class='col-md body'>We started of with the Guide to the Bodhisattva way of Life<br><br><img src="http://www.shantideva.net/shantideva2.jpg"><br><br>The Bodhicaryavatara<br>Chapter I: The Benefit of the Spirit of Awakening<br><br>NOTE: In copying this ancient manuscript, the BIONA Editors discovered various translations from different traditions. The reader can be comforted to know that the translations all agreed with one another in substance, however, some were easier to understand in places than others. In making this text available they worked hard to ensure that it would be comprehensible. In every case they selected the verse that was easiest to understand.<br><br>1. Reverently bowing to the Sugatas, who are endowed with the Dharmakaya, together with their children and all who are worthy of veneration, I shall concisely present a guide to the discipline of the children of the Sugatas in accordance with the scriptures.<br><br>2. There is nothing here that has not been said before, nor do I have any skill in composition. Thus, I have no concern for the welfare of others, and I have composed this solely to season my own mind.<br><br>3. Owing to this, the power of my faith increases to cultivate virtue. Moreover, if someone else with a disposition like my own examines this, it may be meaningful.<br><br>4. This leisure and endowment, which are so difficult to obtain have been acquired, and they bring about the welfare of the world. If one fails to take this favorable opportunity into consideration, how could this occasion occur again?<br><br>5. Just as lightning illuminates the darkness of a cloudy night for an instant, in the same way, by the power of the Buddha, occasionally peopleÂ’s minds are momentarily inclined toward merit.<br><br>6. Thus, virtue is perpetually ever so feeble, while the power of vice is great and extremely dreadful. If there were no spirit of perfect awakening, what other virtue would overcome it?<br><br>7. The Lords of Sages, who have been contemplating for many eons, have seen this alone as a blessing by which joy is easily increased and immeasurable multitudes of beings are rescued.<br><br>8. Those who long to overcome the abundant miseries of mundane existence, who wish to dispel the adversities of sentient beings, and those who yearn to experience a myriad of joys should never forsake the spirit of awakening.<br><br>9. When the spirit of awakening has arisen, in an instant a wretch who is bound in the prison of the cycle of existence is called a child of the Sugatas and becomes worthy of reverence in the worlds of gods and humans.<br><br>10. Upon taking this impure form, it transmutes it into the priceless image of the gem of the Jina. So, firmly hold to the quicksilver elixir, called the spirit of awakening, which must be utterly transmuted.<br><br>11. The worldÂ’s sole leaders, whose minds are fathomless, have well examined its great value. You, who are inclined to escape from the states of mundane existence, hold fast to the jewel of the spirit of awakening.<br><br>12. Just as a plantain tree decays upon losing its fruit, so does every other virtue wane. But the tree of the spirit of awakening perpetually bears fruit, does not decay, and only flourishes.<br><br>13. Owing to its protection, as due to the protection of a powerful man, even after committing horrendous vices, one immediately overcomes great fears. Why do ignorant beings not seek refuge in it?<br><br><a href="http://www.shantideva.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shantideva.net/index.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Satirical Advice for the Four Schools<br>by JamgÃ¶n  Mipham Rinpoche<br><br>Sakyapas chant with their lips,<br>Gendenpas create the melodies mainly in their throats,<br>And KagyÃ¼pas chant strongly from deep down inside.<br><br>The Gendenpas maintain the complete path of scriptural study, so they<br>are like the body of the teachings.<br>The Sakyapas bring together sutra and mantra approaches, so they are<br>like the eyes of the teachings.<br>The KagyÃ¼pas bring everything together into the single practice of<br>devotion, so they are like the heart of the teachings.<br>The Nyingmapas possess the profound key instructions of the tantras<br>and sadhanas, so they are like the life-force of the teachings.<br><br>Now for a few words in jest:<br><br>The Nyingmapas claim they have a path for accomplishing the level of<br>Vajradhara through the practice of clear light Dzogpachenpo, without<br>the need to rely upon an external consort and so on, and yet the<br>lamas say they must take a wife in order to increase their longevity,<br>improve the clarity of their vision, maintain good health, assist in<br>the revelation of termas and accomplish the welfare of beings. They<br>don't say that in order to benefit the teachings they should teach<br>and practise! That taking a wife could be a way to benefit the<br>teachings and beings, and a substitute for teaching and practice, and<br>at the same time improve clarity of vision and so on, is, I think,<br>incredible!<br><br>The Gendenpas claim the antidote to all the pains of existence is the<br>wisdom which realizes selflessness, and yet when they approach the<br>realization of no-self they are so afraid to let go of this sense of<br>identity that they can not sit still upon their cushions. In the past<br>it was said that the attainment of the path of seeing and the clear<br>experience of selflessness that precedes it are marked by special<br>feelings of joy, so I think this must be a symptom of the current<br>degenerate age!<br><br>The Sakyapas make the supreme assertion that one should not place too<br>much emphasis on conduct because inner wisdom is the most important<br>thing, and yet when they recite the LamdÃ¼ Hevajra sadhana, they<br>maintain the discipline of never leaving their seats, because to do<br>so would transgress their vow. If they ever did need to get up and do<br>something, they would have to drag their seats behind them, such are<br>their rites of purification and liberation based on time and the<br>physical body. I wonder what would happen to them if they did leave<br>their seats!<br><br>The KagyÃ¼pas assert that the Great Mudra is the wisdom which pervades<br>all samsara and nirvana, and yet they think of the word `mudra' as<br>referring to one's hands. I wonder what such an enormous hand would<br>look like!<br><br>Ha ha ha! That was all said in jest.<br><br>The teachings of the great masters are rich in meaning,<br>And each school has its own unique vision and key instructions.<br><br>Most followers of the Nyingma school shun the taking of life but<br>think that there is no need to give up women. If they are a genuine<br>yogins, I take refuge in them! But in general this ordinary sexual<br>desire is harmful to the Nyingma teachings, so take care, I pray!<br><br>Most followers of the KagyÃ¼ school dislike classical exposition and<br>logic, preferring the approach that is based purely on mind and<br>meditation. If they are those in whom realization and liberation are<br>simultaneous, I take refuge! But in general this closed-minded<br>attitude is harmful to the KagyÃ¼ teachings and must be abandoned!<br><br>Most followers of the Genden school do not see any fault in taking<br>life, but their aggression is harmful to the Genden teachings, so<br>take care, I pray!<br><br>Most followers of the Sakya school regard as supreme only those<br>empowerments and instructions they themselves have received and the<br>particular branch to which they belongÂ—be it Sakya, Ngor or TsarÂ—but<br>this strong prejudice and dogmatism is harmful to the Sakya<br>teachings, so it needs to be abandoned!<br><br>Generally, even if one has attachment to one's own tradition it is<br>important to avoid any antipathy towards other traditions. If we<br>consider just our own tradition, since we are all followers of the<br>Buddha, we can consider that we are all closely related. The<br>different systems of teachings began at the time of Khenpo<br>Shantarakshita, Guru Rinpoche and King Trisong Detsen, and, following<br>the noble traditions of the past, all the schools in Tibet accept the<br>four seals which are the hallmark of the buddhist teachings. We are<br>all equal in this respect, and what is more we all assert the great<br>shunyata free from conceptual elaboration. Not only that, we all<br>accept the mantrayana with its inseparable unity of bliss and<br>emptiness. This means that we are exceptionally close in terms of our<br>view and our tenets.<br><br>Other traditions, non-buddhist outsiders and philosophical<br>extremists, who differ even in terms of outer signs and dress, are as<br>numerous as the stars in the night sky, and by comparison we<br>buddhists are as rare as stars in broad daylight. Now, when the<br>buddhist teachings are on the verge of extinction, all who seek to<br>ensure their survival must view one another as the closest of allies.<br>Any feelings of hostility will bring only ruin, so instead we must<br>regard each other with joy, like a mother seeing her only child, or a<br>beggar discovering a priceless treasure.<br><br>Having become followers of the same teacher,<br>May all who are students of these same teachings,<br>Abandon any hostility and prejudiced views,<br>And work together with a sense of joy!<br><br>Whoever practises in accordance with the true meaning of the teachings,<br>Be they from one's own or another tradition, may they gain accomplishment,<br>So that the four great buddhist schools here within the Land of Snows,<br>Come to blaze in dazzling splendour with a wealth of Dharma teachings,<br>And gain complete success and universal victory!<br><br>This was written playfully at the request of a friend who has the<br>intelligence to follow of all four schoolsÂ—Sakya, Nyingma, KagyÃ¼ and<br>Gelug.

            <div class='col-md body'>The below is a nice, little exposition of the Seven-Limb Prayer:<br>[ The original article from which the following is extracted can be found at: http://www.geocities.com/cas_sg/articles/deity.html ]<br><br>The 7-Limbs and / or others<br>At this point, one usually generates the Teacher and the Three Jewels in the form of one's Deity in the sky above oneself.<br>Oneself, also, in the form of the deity, performs the 7-Limbs towards "real" Deity, in front of oneself.<br>The 7-Limb Prayer is extracted from Samantabhadra's Aspiration Prayers of the Avatamsaka Sutra. Practising this 7-Limb is said to be the supreme way of accumulating merit.<br><br>Limb One<br>Prostrating, taking heart-felt Refuge in the Enlightened Beings -<br>The reasons for taking refuge:<br>i) Out of fear ( most basic level ) -<br>Seek protection for oneself from the treacheries of samsara<br>ii) Out of divinely great Compassion ( the Mahayana level ) -<br>Seek protection from the Three Jewels not for oneself but for others in the sense that one can then, with refuge, be of competence to help all beings<br><br>Limb Two<br>Making total and complete offerings to the Enlightened Objects -<br>One needs to absolutely offer everything, at least with the sincerest wishes, as it is usually not possible to offer in actual, real life, one's body, one's life, one's heart, all the gold and silver in one's banks, one's beauty, strength and all, so that we can swiftly accumulate merit for the attainment of Buddhahood for the good and liberation of all. If one holds anything back, this is a sign of not possessing total renunciation of one's self-grasping at one's samsaric objects of attachments. This will lead to further wandering in samsara. If one offers with absolute sincerity, one paves the way to letting go of self-grasping and the way to liberation so that we can be a Buddha for all.<br><br></div>
