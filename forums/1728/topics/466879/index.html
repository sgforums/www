              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">I recently finished reading the British scientist Richard Dawkins’ book <em>The God Delusion</em>.
               In it, the Darwinian biologist decries theistic religion as being more 
              trouble than its worth, inspiring conflict, bigotry, and ignorance. He 
              cites many examples for each of these points, including the 9/11 attacks
               to illustrate God-inspired violence, anti- gay tirades by evangelical 
              Christians, and the Creationist denial of the science-backed theory of 
              evolution. He criticizes fundamentalists of any faith who take their 
              scriptures as absolute truth inspired by God, rejecting scientific 
              evidence in favor of dogmatic belief.</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">Dawkins criticizes those religionists that fill gaps in scientific 
              knowledge with God, giving the example of the as yet unexplained 
              evolution of the eye - although this can be accounted for to a currently
               limited degree. In a kind of simpleton’s logic, many theists claim that
               because the eye’s evolution isn’t yet completely detailed, it must have
               been God that designed and made it! This is a sort of variation on the 
              “God works in mysterious ways” declaration of religionists who can’t 
              explain certain aspects of their own faith.</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">‘The God Delusion’ also criticizes scientists that believe in God, 
              seeing them as not accepting the full implications of scientific 
              knowledge, instead ignoring those aspects of it that contradict the 
              belief in a supreme deity. In contrast to this, Dawkins promotes a quest
               for truth that involves open-minded investigation before the facts. So,
               how does Buddhism fare in all this?</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">Dawkins himself does not consider Buddhism in the same class of religion
               as Christianity, Islam and Judaism, seeing it as more of an ethical 
              system or philosophy of life. Indeed, Buddhism is only mentioned three 
              times in the whole book, about the same number of times as Hinduism, and
               Dawkins doesn’t give a definite opinion on either of them. This appears
               to be so because as the author admits himself, coming from a 
              traditionally Christian society, he doesn't know much about religions 
              like Buddhism. Never heard of research, Richard? In light of this, I’ll 
              reflect on the ways he writes (and criticizes) monotheistic religion and
               compare this with Buddhist teachings.</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">Regarding Dawkins’ criticisms of monotheism summed up above, let’s take a
               look at Buddhism. Does the Way of the Buddha promote conflict, bigotry,
               and ignorance as the British biologist says is found in the Bible and 
              the Koran? Well, the Buddha promoted pacifism of course – as did Jesus 
              Christ in the New Testament, arguably – so from the earliest Buddhist 
              texts it appears that it does not promote violence. Regarding bigotry, 
              Buddhism is a famously tolerant faith, the Buddha himself sometimes 
              credited with advising people <em>not </em>to convert to Buddhism but to 
              retain their original faith where appropriate. As for ignorance and 
              deliberately turning a blind eye to any facts that contradict one’s 
              beliefs, the Buddha taught us to investigate for ourselves whether his 
              teachings are true <em>(see below)</em>. Indeed, ignorance, or <em>avijja</em>, is seen as the cause of our suffering, and is to be banished with the light of insight.</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">What of fundamentalism in Buddhism? Do Buddhists take the Buddhist 
              scriptures literally, as absolute historical facts that must be believed
               in, say as many Christians view the Bible, or Muslims the Koran? Well, 
              some may well do this, but generally speaking Buddhists are encouraged 
              to see ancient Buddhist texts as a set of teachings to reflect on to 
              develop wisdom regarding the impermanent, unsatisfying, and selfless 
              nature of all phenomena. Whether the Buddha actually said or did <em>exactly</em> what it says in the Buddhist scriptures isn’t really the point, 
              therefore. These texts are to be used skillfully and wisely, not clung 
              to dogmatically.</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">The book contains many more criticisms of theistic religion than the 
              main points reflected on above, many of them controversial, such as the 
              claim that children should not be indoctrinated into their parents' 
              religions. Indeed, Dawkins claims that we shouldn't accept the labeling 
              of child as being Christian, Muslim etc. anymore than as being 
              Republican, Democrat or Communist. An interesting point to reflect upon 
              for any Buddhist. Elsewhere, his stance appears somewhat belittling of 
              religious people, and he seems to take great pleasure in ridiculing 
              them. This contentious nature of the book, and Dawkins' overtly negative
               attitude to religion in general, has led to much criticism in return. 
              Thankfully, Buddhism encourages us to adopt a somewhat more 
              compassionate attitude to other people!</div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="font: 17.0px 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">One way or another, <em>The God Delusion</em> has inspired a lot of 
              reflection in this Buddhist, encouraging the exact kind of investigation
               into the facts that Dawkins (like his hero Charles Darwin) has based 
              his scientific career on. This investigative spirit is totally in line 
              with the Buddha’s teaching regarding it as <em>ehipassiko</em>, inviting 
              investigation, as opposed to blind belief. For this alone, the book has 
              been a wonderful read, prompting the continued search for the truth of 
              the way things are – the Dharma. I thank Richard Dawkins for this, as 
              well as the Buddha, who has inspired millions of people through the 
              centuries to see the truth for themselves.</div>

Well, some may well do this, but generally speaking Buddhists are encouraged to see ancient Buddhist texts as a set of teachings to reflect on to develop wisdom regarding the impermanent, unsatisfying, and selfless nature of all phenomena. Whether the Buddha actually said or did <em>exactly</em> what it says in the Buddhist scriptures isn’t really the point, therefore. These texts are to be used skillfully and wisely, not clung to dogmatically.</div>

              <div style="margin: 0px; font: 17px 'Times New Roman';">The book contains many more criticisms of theistic religion than the main points reflected on above, many of them controversial, such as the claim that children should not be indoctrinated into their parents' religions. Indeed, Dawkins claims that we shouldn't accept the labeling of child as being Christian, Muslim etc. anymore than as being Republican, Democrat or Communist. An interesting point to reflect upon for any Buddhist. Elsewhere, his stance appears somewhat belittling of religious people, and he seems to take great pleasure in ridiculing them. This contentious nature of the book, and Dawkins' overtly negative attitude to religion in general, has led to much criticism in return. Thankfully, Buddhism encourages us to adopt a somewhat more compassionate attitude to other people!</div>

              <div style="margin: 0px; font: 17px 'Times New Roman';">One way or another, <em>The God Delusion</em> has inspired a lot of reflection in this Buddhist, encouraging the exact kind of investigation into the facts that Dawkins (like his hero Charles Darwin) has based his scientific career on. This investigative spirit is totally in line with the Buddha’s teaching regarding it as <em>ehipassiko</em>, inviting investigation, as opposed to blind belief. For this alone, the book has been a wonderful read, prompting the continued search for the truth of the way things are – the Dharma. I thank Richard Dawkins for this, as well as the Buddha, who has inspired millions of people through the centuries to see the truth for themselves.</div>

              <p>It's funny how scientists like to decree that religion should not to poke its nose into science yet they themselves blatantly poke their entire body into religion. People like Dawkins employ a double standard. They would insist that religion should keep out of science but not the other way round. Here's another review of Dawkin's book <a href="http://creation.com/atheist-with-a-mission-critique-of-dawkins-god-delusion">http://creation.com/atheist-with-a-mission-critique-of-dawkins-god-delusion</a> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is not buddhist purview to poke its nose into science as buddhism is not a religion, and further, not all people in the world are buddhists. And there is also this karma of the past that required science to make life easier as not all born are perfect human such as crippling, got stucked in the womb. And science, in fact is contributing to kindness to people wellness. And in the perspective of buddha, all kindness is buddhism. </p></div>
