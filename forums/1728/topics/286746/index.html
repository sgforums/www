This will then cause our body to react accordingly.<br><br>So the question is what if we get rid of this physical layer of lust mainly the chemical and electrical pulse, we are still a lustful and unenlightened person.<br>Due to the loss of the physical aspect of the lust, it will be very difficult if not impossible to get rid of our spiritual/mental lust.<br>In fact, the changes to our body in a unnatural way will cause even more harm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lust is like an addiction, one cannot get over certain thing and not easily contented thus attaching to greed, people continuously mindlessly commit the lustful thoughts and acts. it becomes a character merely self-created and also a habit that's like hypnosis. besides, competition and vanity has a link to lust as well. if you observe around there are various kinds of desires which is the same term for lust. i feel to get rid of lust or desire is a rather pessimistic solution to think of. to avoid is never the best practice or solution. neither am i encouraging it to flourish. rather to face it accept whatever comes forth and practice non-attachment as one observes the nature of conditions and situations that arouse the thoughts, therefore one learns impermanence, impartiality, see things as they are, practice samadhi and acts accordingly in mindfulness. it is not enough to see the surface of things, it is to look within deeper to the core of problems.<br>i don't rely on the thought of getting rid of lust because the idea is unreliable especially if there's no clarity in one's foundation of practice and is not stable and firm. it is like bouncing ball or one with a leg still trapped in the pit hole.<br><br>to add on... i believe it is more beneficial to be non-violence even in our practice and cultivation. getting rid is like a destruction which is not beneficial to anyone's well-being.<br>if anyone still recalls the illusory flower that vanishes into the sky as mentioned in the sutras, it was not merely destroyed or getting rid by someone. the illusion vanishes, so does lust vanishes.<br></div>

They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "This foolish man, monks, cut off one thing when another should have been cut off. Monks, one should not cut off one's own male organ. Whoever should cut it off, there is a grave offence."<br>(Vinaya Piṭaka, Mahāvagga 110.

It is like drawing a blade and trying to cut a stream of water. Yes, discipline aids oneself in controlling the lustful thoughts but sooner or later people will fall prey to it.</div>
