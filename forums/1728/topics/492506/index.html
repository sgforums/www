              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Shift the vowels slightly and
              the Sanskrit word for a trader (Vaishya) becomes the Sanskrit word for a
              prostitute (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">veshya</span></em>). The one
              sold goods and the other sold pleasure to the highest bidder. Neither was loyal.
              Naturally, feudal authorities despised them both, and turned the word<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">bazaru</span></em>, or
              commercial, into an insult.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In all societies, there are two
              main sources of wealth: land and the market. Feudalism depends on the land and
              trade depends on the market. Land-owning communities (Kshatriyas) and trading
              communities (Vaishyas) have always competed for control of society. It accounts
              for the division between old world Europe and new world America. Typically,
              feudal societies are hierarchical and value loyalty and patronage. Trading
              societies are relatively egalitarian, giving greater value to the customer’s
              wallet than to his status.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In India, we have sought to
              reject old world feudalism but we have not yet embraced new world free trade.
              We still value loyalty, over merit. We are suspicious of professionals, because
              they sell their skills for a price, and the fiercely independent, like the
              prostitutes of yore. The traditional service-providers (Shudras) were expected
              to serve without expectation, accept patronage, and never demand payment,
              resulting in their semi-enslavement. Only priests (Brahmins) could demand a
              service-fee (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">dakshina</span></em>), and
              monks (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">bhikku</span></em>) could
              demand alms (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">bhiskha</span></em>). The rest
              were expected to live on the charity (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">daan</span></em>) of the feudal master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>At the top</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Further, the priests and monks
              of India consolidated their exalted status by establishing the doctrine of
              pollution and purity. This ensured their position on top of the social pyramid,
              even above the land-owning communities, but pacified the latter by locating
              them above traders and service-providers. A land-owner could earn legitimacy
              and karmic dividends by paying priests and feeding monks, while travel was
              deemed as polluting, which is why many Indian traders stopped travelling and
              turned to moneylending. They outsourced the once-thriving sea-trade to Arabs,
              and later the Portuguese, for fear of losing one’s caste, a fear that prevented
              Indians from venturing out into the world right up to the 20th century.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Service-providers whose
              vocation brought them into contact with blood, flesh, excrement and other
              bodily waste were deemed untouchables, denied access to the village well and
              human dignity, because of the doctrine of pollution and purity. Lower than men
              were women who shed blood every month and who were recipients of semen,
              excreted by their husbands. And lower than all women was the prostitute, who
              received the bodily fluids of many men, of all castes, for a fee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>This was not always the case.
              There was a time when the prostitute was celebrated. The most beautiful woman
              in the city was not allowed to marry. She became the city-bride (<em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">nagar-vadhu</span></em>). She
              was allowed to choose a lover, but not restrict herself to one. That she chose
              the most handsome, the most powerful and, often, the richest, annoyed the less
              handsome, the less powerful and the less rich who wrote poems about her
              heartlessness, while praising her beauty and skill. She was known for her
              singing, her dancing, her skill in conversation, her wit, her humour, and her
              beauty. We hear of these courtesans in ancient Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain
              literature. Known as<span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">ganikas</span></em>, they lived
              independent lives, unlike the chaste wives who lived in the shadow of their
              husbands, and unlike nuns, who shunned all pleasure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>God’s wives</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In time, these<span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">ganikas</span></em><span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span>came
              to be attached to temples. They became wives of the enshrined deities, who
              never get widowed, and who loved all men as containers of the divine seed.
              These were the Devadasis. Their images inspired the carvings of beautiful women
              on temple walls. They challenged the old monastic orders. They were part of
              temple rituals. But eventually, the priests and the monks stripped the Devadasi
              of her independence and her agency. Slowly, she was answerable to the men in
              positions of power. The men declared how pure, or impure, she was. She was
              dirty because she had many lovers. She was dirtier because she went to the
              highest bidder. Eventually, she was just an exploited woman, with no freedom,
              her fee being claimed by a pimp and a madam.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>If not attached to a temple,
              the woman who sold pleasure for a fee became part of a king or nawab’s court,
              or a community of entertainers, the<span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">nats</span></em>. In her world, skills and wealth were inherited
              from mother to daughter. She could make the money if she had the beauty, the
              skill and the guile. She was invited to weddings and coronations and festivals.
              But status was another matter. In a feudal society, that looked down on trade
              and commerce, that created hierarchy based on purity of vocations and gender,
              she was clearly at the bottom. What little agency she had was taken away from
              her, first by colonial administrators and later by puritanical freedom fighters
              who modelled themselves on the monks of yore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Today, unlike in the 19th
              century, no one fears loss of caste when one travels across the sea. Today, we
              are comfortable talking about markets, buying, selling, trade and profits.
              Today, we seek professionals. Yet, the feudal mindset persists.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>We yearn for loyalty and are
              afraid of the commercial: those who sell their skills and expertise to the
              highest bidder. We cannot bear the thought of pleasure being a commodity that
              can be bought and sold. We prefer women who submit to the decisions of men, not
              women who make their own decisions. We prefer the loyal press, and are
              terrified of the independent one, which like the independent<span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #4c4c4c; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">ganika</span></em><span><span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> </span></span>of
              yore, believes that its dharma is to treat all customers equally, no matter how
              much they paid, and be loyal to none. That is why the press, with a mind of its
              own, becomes presstitute, and a lady politician, with a mind of her own, who
