              meditation is a spiritual dead end</span></strong></p>

              24, 2015  </span><span class="author8"><strong><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Lama Jampa Thaye</span> </strong></span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>tricycle </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One of the most insistent trends on offer in the
              spiritual marketplace has been the cult of meditation, which has had important
              implications for Buddhism. Secular mindfulness has found a place in society,
              but occupying a somewhat different cultural and spiritual space, a new Buddhism
              has emerged alongside it. Its adherents claim that the fruits of the Buddhist
              tradition can be acquired though sitting meditation alone. Contemporary
              practitioners, in other words, need not bother with study, ethical precepts, ritual
              practice (other than meditation), or merit making. The proponents of the “just
              sitting” trend often claim the mantle of traditional systems, whether Theravada
              Vipassana, Japanese Zen, or Tibetan Dzogchen. All share the assumption that
              meditation must be as non-conceptual in content as possible, and that all other
              forms of activity can be largely, if not entirely, ignored.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>While these new meditation programs are called
              Buddhist, their presentations of meditation run counter to those of the dharma
              from all periods of Buddhist history. Indeed, the most clearly defined and
              often cited status of meditation within Buddhist doctrine and practice
              positions it as one of the three trainings, the other two being ethics and
              wisdom. As the great ancient Indian Buddhist thinker Nagarjuna declared in his <em>Letter
              to a Friend</em>,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In superior moral discipline, superior wisdom<br> And superior contemplation, one must constantly train.<br> More than one hundred and fifty trainings<br> Are truly included in these three.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Without the ethical development brought about by
              training in ethics—“the foundation of all qualities,” according to
              Nagarjuna—meditation is a spiritual dead end.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When one examines the place of meditation in the
              Vajrayana in particular, one finds again that it is not considered a
              self-sufficient means of spiritual accomplishment. It comes second in the triad
              of view, meditation, and action. <em>View</em> signifies the correct vision of
              reality that the Vajrayana master imparts to the student, and <em>meditation</em> signifies the subsequent development and stabilization of the glimpse afforded
              by this introduction. Thus, it is only through both view and meditation,
              together with their enactment and testing in <em>action</em>, that one could even
              approach spiritual accomplishment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As expressed by the 14th-century lama Karmapa
              Rangjung Dorje:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Certainty in the view arises from severing doubts
              about the basis.<br> The essential point of meditation is to maintain this without distraction.<br> The supreme activity is mastery of this meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Reacting to the demand for an entirely
              non-conceptual form of meditation, Buddhist reformers have clamored to
              reimagine bare sitting as the core or entirety of Buddhism, a drive that
              animates a considerable part of the modern refashioning of dharma. While mere
              sitting may produce certain mental effects, one must nonetheless ask, <em>To
              what end?</em> Unallied with any ethical imperative and directed by unexamined
              assumptions, meditation becomes a purely internal mental technology. In other
              words, such allegedly non-conceptual meditation will, at best, be a neutral
              activity. Unmoored from the Buddha’s teachings, it cannot lead to the
              particular compassion and wisdom that he taught.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As the Nyingma master Mipham Rinpoche explains:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Most settling meditations without analysis<br> Can produce a mere calm-abiding<br> But from this meditation certainty will not arise.<br> If certainty, the one eye of the path of liberation <br> Is abandoned, the obscurations cannot be dispelled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is ignorance of this vital point that frequently
              leads neophytes to overrate their meditation experiences, occasionally with
              catastrophic outcomes. Experiences of non-conceptuality, bliss, or clarity, all
              of which are common but fleeting, leave some individuals imagining they are
              enlightened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The more fortunate subsequently discover that they
              have fooled themselves. The less fortunate, though perhaps more ambitious,
              simply proceed to redefine the actual nature of enlightenment so as to preserve
              their status. <em>Enlightenment</em> becomes merely a term for a transient
              meditation experience. This gets around the awkwardness of the fact that such
              “enlightened” meditators are still, after all, beings subject to disturbing
              emotions and ignorance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>More seriously, such free-floating meditation is
              ripe for subversion to whatever political or economic ends its proponents
              prefer. It easily absorbs the values of the most unsavory elements of our
              culture. Worse, many meditators, thinking they are practicing the essence of
              the dharma, remain completely ignorant of the ideological commitments that
              might come to underpin the meditation they practice. In our society, this is
              likely to be a ruthless individualism congenial to both the market and state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>To compensate for this, meditation in the West
              grounds itself in a mélange of self-indulgence and gesture politics masquerading
              as compassion—a “compassion,” it must be said, that cannot see beyond
              self-regard. The result is the same vapid posturing that dominates so much of
              contemporary culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If current trends continue, meditation will become
              a mere app for stress-free living. In other words, it will simply come to
              accommodate the harmful consumption-driven lifestyles that still characterize
              much of life in wealthy Western countries. In such a scenario meditation would
              serve as a reinforcing agent to stabilize delusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Sadly, we’ve been down this road before. Those
              learned in Japanese Buddhist history could perhaps cite as an example the
              subversion of Zen meditation by the samurai and its horrific reemergence in the
              Japanese militarism and imperialism of the first half of the 20th century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In any event, it seems foolish to deny that the
              severing of meditation from ethics and wisdom could produce undesirable
              consequences. Given that many of us have little education in the dharma, the
              potential for misappropriation and derailing of Buddhism is huge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One of our major problems is the difficulty of
              convincing people to take training in Buddhist ethics seriously. Knowing so
              little about the dharma, many don't have a worldview that supports such
              training.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One possible solution for this dilemma is to
              initially teach meditation alone in order to meet what seems to be a popular
              demand, and only later introduce the ethical and philosophical dimensions of
              the dharma. But unless links are made quickly and authoritatively to the other
              two trainings, a negative outcome is more likely to develop from this strategy
              than genuine spiritual progress.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Perhaps the best answer for our dilemma is to teach
              all three trainings more or less simultaneously, while being mindful of the
              logic to their sequential development. A student’s progress in one training
              will enable progress in the others. As the reordering of our life, brought
              about by moral training, creates the environment for meditation, the stillness
              of mind created by meditation will make possible the examination of reality
              that is the hallmark of wisdom.</span></p>
