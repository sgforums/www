              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Åšamatha without
                  a Sign (From Padmasambhava’s <em>Natural
                  Liberation</em>):</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">While steadily
                  gazing into the space in front of you, without meditating on anything, steadily
                  concentrate your consciousness, without wavering, in the space in front of you.
                  Increase the stability and then relax again. Occasionally seek out “What is
                  that consciousness that is concentrating,” steadily concentrate again, and then
                  check it out again. Do that in an alternating fashion. Even if there are
                  problems of laxity and lethargy, that will dispel them. In all your activities
                  rely upon unwavering mindfulness. Do that for one day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span>            </span>Then position your body like before.
                  Cast your gaze downwards, gently release your mind, and without having anything
                  on which to meditate, gently release both your body and mind into their natural
                  state. Having nothing on which to meditate, and without any modification or
                  adulteration, place your attention simply without wavering, in its own natural
                  state, its natural limpidity, its own character, just as it is. Remain in
                  clarity, and rest the mind so that it is loose and free. Alternate between
                  observing who is concentrating inwardly and who is releasing. If it is the
                  mind, ask: what is that very agent that releases the mind and concentrates the
                  mind? And steadily observe yourself. Then release again. By so doing, fine
                  stability will arise, and you may even identify </span><span lang="EN-US">pristine </span><span lang="EN-US">awareness. Do that, too, for one day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span>            </span>Then do as before. Now alternately
                  tightly concentrate your consciousness, wholly concentrating it without
                  wavering, and then gently release it, evenly resting it in openness. Again
                  concentrate, and again release. In that way, meditate with alternating
                  constriction and release. At times, steadily direct your gaze up into the sky.
                  Steadily focus your awareness with the desire to be without anything on which
                  to meditate. Relax again. At times, steadily, unwaveringly, direct your
                  awareness into the space on your right; at times, direct it to the left; and at
                  times, direct it downwards. During each session, rotate the gaze around in
                  those directions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span>            </span>Occasionally inquire, “What is that
                  awareness of the one who is focusing the interest?” Let the awareness itself
                  steadily observe itself. At times, let your mind come to rest in the center of
                  your heart, and evenly leave it there. At times, evenly focus it in the expanse
                  of the sky and leave it there. Thus, by shifting the gaze in various,
                  alternating ways, the mind settles in its natural state. As indications of
                  this, if awareness remains evenly, lucidly, and steadily wherever it is placed,
                  <em>Å›amatha</em> has arisen. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span>            </span>If awareness becomes muddled and
                  without mindfulness, that is the problem of laxity, or dimness; so clear it up,
                  inspire it, and shift your gaze. If it becomes distracted and excited, it is
                  important that you lower your gaze and release your awareness. If <em>samÄ�dhi </em>arises in which there is nothing
                  of which you can say, “This is meditation,” and “This is conceptualization,”
                  this is the problem of oblivion, so meditate with alternating concentration and
                  release, and recognize who is meditating. Recognize the flaws of <em>Å›amatha</em>, and eliminate them right away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;"><span lang="EN-US">Flawless <em>Å›amatha</em> is like
                  an oil-lamp that is unmoved by wind. Wherever the awareness is placed, it is
                  unwaveringly present; awareness is vividly clear, without being sullied by
                  laxity, lethargy, or dimness; wherever the awareness is directed, it is steady
                  and sharply pointed; and unmoved by adventitious thoughts, it is straight.
                  Thus, a flawless meditative state arises in one’s mind-stream; and until this
                  happens, it is important that the mind is settled in its natural state. Without
                  genuine <em>Å›amatha</em> arising in one’s
                  mind-stream, even if </span><span lang="EN-US">pristine </span><span lang="EN-US">awareness
                  is pointed out, it becomes nothing more than an object of intellectual
                  understanding; and one is left simply giving lip-service to the view, and there
                  is the danger that one may succumb to dogmatism. Thus, the root of all
                  meditative states depends upon this, so do not be introduced to </span><span lang="EN-US">pristine </span><span lang="EN-US">awareness too soon, but practice until there occurs a
                  fine experience of stability.”</span></p>
