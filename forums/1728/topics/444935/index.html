              Hi, as my master say å¿µç»�ä¸�å¦‚è§£ç»�ï¼Œè§£ç»�ä¸�å¦‚è¡Œç»�ï¼Œè¡Œç»�ä¸�å¦‚è¯�ç»�ã€‚
                                
              What this means is that trying to learn the meaning of the sutra is better than chanting the sutra, practicing the sutra is better than just understanding the sutra, realizing and attaining the essence of the sutra is even better than just practicing it.
                                
              You see, as my dharma teacher used to tell us, the sutras are words that came from Buddha mouth to teach us how to practice the dharma and attain the same awakening as him. He did not teach us sutras so we can recite back the same words to him. The Buddha doesn't need to hear us repeat the same words he told us, the most important point is that we try to understand his message for us and then apply it. Of course I'm not saying chanting sutra is completely useless as it is a meritorious deed, but try to go beyond just chanting sutras.
                                
              If you want to get true benefits out of buddhism, don't just devote a period of time to chanting then go back to your routine life. Rather, you must strive to learn and practice the dharma in the midst of your daily life so that you may experience, realize, benefit from it and attain awakening, wisdom, awareness, happiness, liberation from it.
                                
              My advice is go for some dharma classes. Like the dharma center I frequent, there are a lot of free dharma books and cds on the shelves also. The timetable and info is here: http://humanbliss.org.sg/forum/bbs/redirect.php?tid=485&amp;goto=lastpost#lastpost
                                
              If you are interested, we also have chanting å…±ä¿® and å¿µç»� and meditation as part of the activities.
              
              Meanwhile you can start reading up the dharma articles from the forum link (humanbliss.org.sg) above and articles in http://www.jenchen.org.sg/

              <p>All the while I have been chanting without knowing the meaning of the sutra/mantra.     Personally, I feel it is only meaningful and makes sense to know the meaning.       When I chant I chant blindly without knowing the meanings.   Sigh!</p>

              <p>Strongly agree with you and your teacher. Your teacher is indeed a true Dharma teacher. There are some Buddhists who treat chanting like reading a book. Chanting is part of ä¿®å¿ƒã€‚We have to understand and practice what we have chanted.

              <p>You should use chanting as a first step, lead you to deeper concentration.  At the same time, study the real dharma, understand the suffering in samsara and how Dharma can lead you out of suffering.  Then strive to attain liberation.  Time is always very short.  Don't delay or procrastinate.</p>

              <p>You can try meditation like stated below...</p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong>Beginning Insight Meditation</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">For the beginning meditator I believe it would be helpful to establish an order in the various steps taken in meditation. First, then, it would be wise to establish a place of quiet to which one may retire daily and not be interrupted in his endeavors. Then wash carefully face, hands and feet. Better yet, if time permits, take a cleansing shower and put on loose, comfortable clothes. It is wise to meditate at the same time daily to establish a habit. I do it at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. when the birds begin to retire in the evening. Then when you begin to meditate consider your posture. With spine erect and a spirit of awareness be mindful of sitting without strain but with complete alertness. Now you are ready to begin. But, first, some introductory thoughts.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">As Sujata states in his little book <em>Beginning to See</em>, "Meditation is the best thing you can do for yourself." However, it is far from the simple thing it may seem to beginners. It takes a strong urge to peer deeply within oneself and beyond it. It takes discipline and willingness to go farther than merely trying to escape or sidestep personal problems one may have.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Why meditate? There are many reasons. But those that stand out most strongly are learning to think clearly, and to dispel ignorance, illusion, greed, hatred and craving. This is the road to Nirvana or Nibbana through which one must lose all clinging to "self." The feeling of having a self is highly resistant to extinguishing. It is persistent and devious. Often one may feel it has vanished only to have it crop up again. Only by diligence and persistence -- and the road for many may be long -- can victory over it be achieved.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">You are seated now, cross-legged on the floor, in a quiet chamber. In lotus position, if you can, or in half-lotus, or even on a chair if disability precludes otherwise. Keep your head erect and balanced lightly on your shoulders. Still, do not strain; be comfortable, relaxed and attentive.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The first stages of meditation should be simply observation of breath. Concentrate on the nostrils where the breath flows in... out... in... out. Be aware of the touch of air as it strikes the passage through the nostrils. In fact be aware of everything and nothing. This sounds contradictory. Yet it is really not. For this is no time to daydream, to entertain vagrant and migratory thoughts. You are aware of your physical posture. Then you forget that also. You are aware that the past is dead, that it is gone. Yet specific consciousness of your whole preceding life is absent. The future does not yet exist. All you have is "right now"... the in... out... in... out rhythm of the breath of life.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The idea is to "empty the mind," to get rid of all "garbage," all fleeting and intruding thoughts. Simply to breathe -- in out -- in out, never forcing the breath. You are not even the breather, but the breathing breathing you, the you, which as time goes on, will grow more and more vague as it begins to dissipate, disappear.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Just allow the mind to feel the "touch" of breath as it flows in and flows out. In your first sessions think of nothing more. You will find the breath thinning out as it becomes more subtle and finer until in time you begin to feel you are not breathing at all. This is the calming of the breath flow. It becomes very pleasant and satisfying.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I keep a candle burning in the meditation chamber. It serves two purposes, maybe three. At first, if the mind wanders, it serves as a point of focus. The eyes, at first observing the candle, soon close, lightly, easily, by themselves. But even through closed lids one feels the presence of the light. One can see it in one's mind's eye. It restores the mind's wandering back to the present. The second purpose is symbolic: to me it signifies the <em>Light of the Dhamma</em>, the doctrine on which the meditation is based. And finally, it makes for a pleasant, lovely atmosphere. Incense, flowers, Buddha sculpture are nice but really not necessary. One can, in truth, meditate <em>anywhere</em>, any quiet place where there can be no interruption. Wherever you meditate, if it is at home and you have a telephone, it is wise to remove the receiver to avoid incoming calls.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Bear in mind that the place of meditation is not of key importance, but it is wise to return to the same place at the same time daily so that the habit of meditating becomes established. The Buddha meditated under a Bodhi tree where he achieved enlightenment. An advanced meditator can choose almost any place and it will serve his purpose -- a crowded market place, a burial ground, a cave, a park or a refuse dump. In his inward turning he becomes totally oblivious of his surroundings; or, contrariwise, makes the very surroundings, as he advances deeper and deeper into meditating, the subject of his thoughts. The important thing to remember is that these thoughts must be schooled and channeled. They must be kept "on center."</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">But you, now, are still in your beginning stages. Untoward thoughts will persist in entering your mind. This is only natural. You will be amazed at how many and how trivial these intrusions can be. You must learn, however, to treat these intruders with courtesy. Do not shove them away in anger. Be gentle, kindly. Label each one -- past -- present -- future? Worthy? Unworthy? Animosity? Vanity? Desire? Egotism? Your very act of branding them will assist in their cessation. As they begin to disappear, your mind will gently return to your nostrils, your breathing. It will grow quieter and quieter.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Other hindrances will obtrude themselves. Noises will penetrate your consciousness -- children playing and shouting, buses or airplanes passing. Label them as you do other passing thoughts. Keep centering on the breathing, the slowing inflow, outflow. In time the noises, too, will vanish. Whenever you find yourself "out there," bring yourself gently back to "here" and to "right now." When you have been able to accomplish this "no thought" for at least a half hour, your breathing will have slowed to a point of almost indistinguishable rhythm, to "it" breathing "you" and not the other way around.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I find it helps in all of this to keep a semi-smile on my face such as that of the Buddha. It aids in brightening the mind, makes it happier.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">At this point in your beginning meditation, if you have been at it a half hour or longer, you may terminate it if you wish or continue as before. Or you can go on to extend <em>metta</em> or loving-kindness. This meditation subject is good because it<em>eliminates</em> hatred, envy, anger and self-pity. It accomplishes love for all, destruction of self, sympathetic joy, and a good feeling for every being or non-being that lives or has left this life. Your extension of loving-kindness should reach out to encompass the earth, the universe. You will find it difficult in time, to snuff out the life of even the smallest insect.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">In extending loving-kindness it is of great importance that you first love <em>yourself</em>. In the right way, of course. You accomplish this by ridding your thoughts of all "impurities." Think to yourself "I will rid my mind of every defilement: anger, hatred, ignorance, fear, greed, craving. I will make my mind clear, fresh and pure. Like a transparent window is my mind. Then with my stain-free mind, I pour out thoughts of loving-kindness, of love and of kindness."</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Try to get a mental image of each one you are extending this loving-kindness to. Get <em>into</em> that person. Feel his or her personality enter <em>your own</em> being and direct your feeling straight into the mind and heart of that individual. You will find in time, that there is a sort of mental telepathy emerging. You will feel the warmth of response. Do not dwell on this. Go on to the next person and the next and next. Bring forth all the warmth and kindness of your spirit and instill this into the being or non-being it is directed toward. If you do this once or twice daily, your horizon will widen. You will find yourself directing these vibrations to <em>all</em> beings and non-beings who have entered your consciousness, without exceptions. This will include brand-new acquaintances you hardly know. People you do not even know but see pass by regularly or irregularly down the street. All who live. All who have died. Known and unknown. All animals, insects, trees. Everything organic and inorganic. And in this outflowing there will ride your <em>self</em>, vanishing into the <em>all</em>-inclusive.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">When you have completed this meditation <em>sitting</em>, later try a<em>walking</em> meditation, and, in this, think of the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha; that all beings are born to suffer, etc. Then go on to find the "way out"; the way out and the "end" of suffering. Find this secure path and incorporate it into your daily life, and, this accomplished, find Nibbana right here on earth!</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong>A Personal Observation</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">When I first came to Sri Lanka from America, I had just about given up all hope of living. The doctors in America had provided me with maybe twenty-five different drugs for a very bad heart condition and other ailments. We fled America, my husband and I, to live out our lives among peaceful surroundings -- in the heart of Buddha-land. Shortly after arrival, what with the long trip and thoughts of death, I truly<em>was</em> dying. I had a myocardial infarction and was taken to the hospital. I found the hospital conditions so deplorable, I felt it would be better to die in bed at home. Consequently, I left the hospital. My husband had found a lovely home for us and there I waited to die. After much pain and emotional upheaval my husband found an <em>anagarika</em>, a Buddhist lay brother, who came to our home and performed a miracle, or to state it better, pointed out to me the "path" that I shall follow for the rest of my days here on earth. This monk-like follower of the Buddha, the Anagarika Tibbotuwawa, instructed me in meditation.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">We went through four stages and in time I threw out all drugs, and the life "here and now" became clear and meaningful. Many strange things began to occur in the course of meditation. First I began to feel that I was on another plane of consciousness. I no longer had a self, sick or otherwise. I was at one with all, all of us in a new world, with all non-beings too. I found that the "ego" that nearly wrecked my life was now gone. I felt reborn, and extended my meditation to vibrations of loving-kindness. Thought messages I call them. Then one morning a friend called from America. On the phone he said that he had received my message. He was elated beyond belief, thanked me and promised to come here in the near future. The strangest of all was a telegram from my sister. She asked if we could accommodate her at our home in three weeks. I nearly had a heart attack! My sister is seventy-eight years old. I had heard no word from her for fifteen years. Yet I had been sending her "thought messages" of loving-kindness, and her image was growing clearer and clearer -- even before arrival. She was "with me" even before arrival. At age seventy-eight she had traveled half-way around the world to see me. When she arrived she said she had had a compelling urge to see me. We were both delighted and, to my amazement, she meditated each evening with me and said she had never known such "peace and love" as she found in our home.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">She could not remain with us, as I had hoped, but had responsibilities at home that she felt better able to cope with now. She left, adding, "I have promises to keep -- and many miles to go before I sleep."</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">These few experiences have been so uplifting that now, even though I <em>never proselytize</em>, many young people come to me for instruction in meditation. Recently a young man from Switzerland came to our home. He felt he was dying of rabies ("rabbits" he called it in broken English). I was so sure he did not have this disease that I suggested that he meditate with me and Anagarika that day, and he seemed pleased with the experience. Well, this young man came not only each evening, but also every morning at 5:30 a.m. bringing fresh flowers for the Buddha. He left, after three weeks of intensive meditation and instruction and reading of the Dhamma, well and happy and full of ideas to help suffering humanity.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">There are, of course, many ideas I have omitted which are advanced procedures in insight meditation, the three stages which usually follow the concentration on breathing. These are body, feelings, perceptions and consciousness, ultimately expressing themselves in "the mind experiencing pure mind." I feel, however, that the reader can find these steps in many publications that have been released on this subject. If this booklet helps the beginner with just a little insight into the "way" and the "why" of meditation, this will be my happiness.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong>Is Buddhism a Religion?</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">This is a question which is often asked. It really depends upon how one defines religion. If it is thought of as a belief in a supreme being to whom one prays for redemption, security, favors or relief from suffering, then, <em>no</em>, Buddhism is not a religion.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The Buddha himself never claimed divinity -- only clear-sightedness and purity of apprehension of truth through deepest intuition, leading to equanimity and enlightenment. He was a great and rare individual but not a god. If some simple and mistaken few have elevated him to godship and worship him with requests for favors and special dispensations, this does not alter the situation one bit.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">It seems that in these troubled times, as, indeed, since time immemorial, man has felt the need to have a faith in a supreme being, one who could redeem him from "sin" and relieve his suffering. This is a great fallacy. If indeed there were such a being, why should he be asked to give redemption? Isn't it more important for man to redeem himself? This is what the Buddha believed. Man, he said, is born to suffering. Life <em>is</em>suffering. That is the first of the Four Noble Truths he enunciates -- that there <em>is</em> suffering. In the Second Truth he points out that all suffering has its origins which we must learn to understand, because this is the only way we can arrive at the Third Truth, which is that cessation of this suffering <em>can</em> be achieved. His Fourth Truth clarifies the way out from suffering via the Eightfold Path which we will discuss later.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Therefore we ask, if Buddhism is not a religion, what then is it? Our reply is: Buddhism is a way of life, a philosophy, a psychology, a way of thinking, through which we may ourselves take on the responsibility of determining how our life-bearing kamma (karma) will work out for us. Meditation is one of the procedures of mental discipline and purification through which we may begin to learn such responsibility.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Many young people have come to me saying, "How can I embrace Buddhism without destroying my own beliefs and culture?" I tell the Christians among them to think about the precepts of Christ. Are they so totally opposed to, and different from, those of the Buddha? Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal or commit adultery. The ethical injunctions among the Ten Commandments -- are they not almost exactly the same as the precepts of the moral life laid down by the Buddha (the Five Precepts)?</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I tell them that the Dhamma, the sacred texts of Buddhism, are much more voluminous and explicit than those of the Old and New Testaments and commentaries. The Buddhist texts are, in fact, elevenfold as extensive and contain an enormous range of wise teachings, none of them derogatory to the faiths of other creeds. He did not deny the existence of deities, but he did reserve scepticism as to the infinity of their duration, their omnipotency, their powers to help mankind in every kind of urgency. Have these gods and messiahs, which we of Western faiths have been prone to believe in, been sublimely successful in the mitigation of human suffering, hunger, sorrow and affliction? The answer <em>is</em> open to doubt.</p>

              <p>You can chant at home but I encourage people to chant in the temple as we can concentrate better and å…±ä¿®çš„åŠ›é‡�å¤§. We are motivated to chant as a group. However, must choose a good and peaceful temple. You can search on youtube, there are many shifus giving talks on sutras. You can choose whichever sutras that you wish to understand. Chanting is important as it reminds us of Buddha's words and there are merits. As what AEN said, it is more important to understand and practice what it is being taught in the sutras.</p>

              <p>Concentration takes time. It doesn't come straight away.  When you chant faster, automatically you have to concentrate. But don't judge or think about whether you are concentrating or not, that is another distraction that will make you less concentrated.</p>
              <p>Dharma practice needs patience.  You should also read more about Dharma at the same time because then you will learn <strong>why and how </strong>you should practise the Dharma.</p>

              <p>When one heart is connected to the Buddha, everywhere is a good place for practice.</p>
              <p>Frankly, for beginner try to concentrate on a mantra and built up an affinity with it. Just set aside 10-15 miniutes, to repeat the phrase to yourself. It can be Namo Buddhaya, Om Mani Pei Me Hung, Namo Guan Shi Yin Pusa or for me (Namu Myoho Renge Kyo) depending on one preference.</p>
              <p>The time for recitation is not the time to seek theoretical understanding for the meaning of the phrase. It is a time to concentrate, one breathe one mantra. Follow up with delication of merits and personal prayer. For deeper understanding one can read up books at spare time.</p>
              <p>For sutra recitation, one can consider joining a temple where people gather for recitation. It depend what is your preference. Mahanyana or Therevada.Where one can pick up the tempo and the correct pronouncitation</p>
              <p>True to the fact as mentioned by Eternal Now. The ultimate purpose for chanting is for our own personal reflection if we live up to Buddha's way. Buddha or Bodhisattva do not need us to remind them about their teaching. Rather it is to remind us and plant good seeds in our mind so that we can understand and practice out their spirit <span style="font-family: MingliU;">ç²¾ç¥ž</span>in our daily life. </p>

              <p>Is it Christians can only propagate their religion by putting down other religions? Is this the only method? They have much to learn from Buddhism.</p>
