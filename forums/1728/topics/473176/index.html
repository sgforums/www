              without boredom, very often allowing me to feel inspired and invigorated

               You earnestly put in good and detailed research into the preparation 
              for conducting such a course, the result of which the audience 
              appreciated. This is the hallmark of a good teacher. Moreover, you 
              patiently use current examples of existing situations in daily lives to 
              make the topic as real and penetrating as possible for the minds of the 
              listeners. Good work.’ <strong>- Andrew</strong></span></p>

              lessons interesting through sharing of real stories, and for relentless

              examples to illustrate your points is very useful to me, especially as a

              appreciate very much for your teaching. The lessons are really valuable.
               The materials are well prepared and carefully written. They are very 
              useful for recap. Initially I was quite hesitant to register for the 
              course. I thought I would probably drop out mid way because it was on 
              Saturday – a day when my work schedules are tight, and the location 
              [Kong Meng San for 10th Run] is quite inconvenient for me.. but your 
              lessons were really so knowledgeable and interesting, that I wouldn’t 
              want to miss them. In fact, I had been looking forward to them. Among 
              all, I found that the topic about the interruption between each life 
              [due to death]… to somewhat have an awakening effect on me. Since then, I
               have started to <span class="gm_ gm_e4198374-802e-9e67-9d4d-4c6add6340be gm-spell">nianfo</span> everyday, and it has been consistently carried out for 3 weeks! I hope I
               have all the time to continue the practice and be mindful of Buddha 
              every moment. I will recommend your teachings to my friends and family 
              members.” – Thanks &amp; Regards, </span><strong>Mee Nah</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Thank you very much for your sharing 
              of Pure Land practice. I have enjoyed every session of the course. I had
               supposed it to be a serious and dull subject. However, you had made it 
              interesting and fun through your jokes and excellent illustrations. 
              Unfortunately, I missed the last session due to a family commitment. The
               course structure flowed very well and is very suitable for a layperson 
              to understand Pure Land Buddhism in a progressive manner. Your constant 
              encouragement to get us to clarify our doubts through email [and in 
              person] was very useful. Now, I have a much better understanding of Pure
               Land practice. I look forward to furthering my understanding and 
              practice on Pure Land Buddhism. Thank you once again.” – Amituofo, <strong>Lar Kee</strong></span></p>
              <p>“Thank you for the teaching and sharing of experiences. I also like 
              to thank Brother Steven for sharing his experience with all of us. It 
              showed us how someone practised what was learnt.” – Amituofo, <strong>Lisa</strong></p>
              <p>“Dear Bro. Shi’an, ‘The Gift of Truth Excels All Other Gifts.’ Thank 
              you for sharing the Pure Land Teachings with us. You have delivered the 
              teachings in a very concise, interesting and creative manner. We enjoyed
               the lessons very much and have benefitted a lot from them. We are glad

The lessons are well pacedand after each
               lesson, the faith in me grows a little bit more. I’m glad my hubby 
              signed me up for the course as I didn’t see the need to attend since I 
              could access to the sutra and notes of the previous round he attended. 
              After the end of last week’s 8th class and Bro. Steven’s sharing, I 
              walked out of… feeling very happy despite the drizzle… Once on the bus, 
              [using another way to practise mindfulness of Amituofo], I quickly 
              whipped out my </span><span class="gm_ gm_fe9cf0f0-8072-1d3e-4100-7e3bfa2481de gm-spell">handphone</span><span class="gmw_"><span class="gmw_"> to text ‘Amituofo, Amituofo… [in Chinese]’ and almost filled the length
               of 12 messages during the 17-minute ride. Once home, our 89 cm tall son
               fell down from a dining chair, where he was standing to drinkcereal. He
               landed sideways, unhurt and with no crying or words of discomfort. He 
              had spilt half of his drink, and was still holding the cup. Both hubby 
              and myself were 2-3 arm lengths away. We witnessed this and was 
              speechless. It was as if our son was ‘lifted’ and merely placed on the 
              floor [to break his fall]. We’re not sure if this is the blessing of 
              Amituofo’s protection, but we are sure that </span><span class="gm_ gm_c0b310ce-3ebb-acac-181f-76353f560b55 gm-spell">nianfo</span> [being mindful of Amitabha Buddha] is wonderful and great! May you have a great Amituofo day!’ </span></span></span><strong>- Emily</strong></span></p>

               material. I believe that only those with faith and passion like you 
              could conduct such classes. Academics would present and speak without 
              conviction, but your easy style and passion makes the class alive,
