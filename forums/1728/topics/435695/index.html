              so many hungry ghost stories on this Singapore weblink
                  
                  http://www.hungzai.com/spirits-at-funeral/
              
              
              This happened to my elder sister at my grandpaâ€™s funeral few years back. My elder sister who is born with so called â€œying yangâ€� eyes but as time goes by it got working lesser and lesser. But she told my mum that. At my grandpaâ€™s funeral she could see my grandpaâ€™s spirit floating on top of my grandpaâ€™s coffin. As my 2nd elder sis is afraid of such things, she never raised it up and only secretly told my mum. My mum after a few months told us.
               
              The next story also happened to my elder sister. It happened like 10 years back. When i was still in primary sch, we were moving house to our current new house. As most people would when moving house, we were busy moving and packing stuff from our house. So the house is a lot emptier den usual. But we didnâ€™t move into the house yet because of the â€œji shi a.k.a auspicious timingâ€� 
              
              She was packing half way and she noticed that thereâ€™s this dark shadow in the middle of the room. She went on to take a closer look and found that the dark shadow started to move fast in the room. She panicked, and finally the shadow stopped behind the doorâ€¦ i dunno y , but she went on to pull open the door. And just then she saw a face ZOOOOM out behind the door right at her face den n disappear. 
              
              After that, she told my mum who took her to â€œwen shen , ask godâ€� what happened. But as usual they would say luck is low and stuff. She have a lot of experience but lets save some for next time.

              Haunted house - Jurong West
              
              http://www.hungzai.com/haunted-house-jurong-west/
              
              This is based on a true story that happened when i was living in my old apartment in jurongâ€¦
               
              My apartment was on the fourth floor and directly facing an eerie looking tree.(pls note that the tree was not the problem) When my family first shifted in, everything was ok and we love the place as it was a peaceful neighbourhood and we had a good time in the house.
               
              Then it started, my sister was the first one to be affected by it. One night while sleeping she said that she felt someone waking her up. She told me that by instinct she went straight to the window and to her horror she found a figure without head was sitting on the swing at the playground (her room faces the playground and our hall faces the spooky tree). She just froze when suddenly the thing stops swinging as if it realises my sister was watching her. She then quickly snapped out of it and went to my motherâ€™s room to sleep.The second incident happened to her was one day when she was watching tv with me late at night, she said she saw a white shadow dashing pass from my motherâ€™s room to my room. As iâ€™m not a believer of the supernatural, I just brushed it aside.
               
              My mother too experienced a similar encounter while she was taking a nap in the afternoon. She felt that someone came and held her down. She claimed that she saw a black shadow but was too blurry for her to figure out what it was. She prayed hard and soon after it was gone.
               
              The final one that we had it was when my sister got slapped on the back by something. She was studying late into the night when she felt something slap her hard behind. She started to get sick after that so much that my mother got scared of the house.
               
              Soon after that my father decided to move out from that place and we shifted out of there. After a few months, i met my neighbour one day in downtown and he told me a spooky tale abt the house, it seems that there were 3 families b4 us and they all shifted out of the house in lesser than 2 months and the second family did all the renovations but never shifted in. We were the longest staying family there as we stayed for almost 2 years. I asked him why he had not told us this earlier and he claimed that since we indians were generally pious, he had a strong feeling that whatever that lurked in that house must have gone away. But i guess he felt it was not the case after I revealed to him our encounters.

The monk block my both eye so that i couldnt see anymore of those.After that, i couldnt see those â€˜dirtyâ€™ things and i didnt cried in the mid-night anymore.
               
              Till now, i began slowly to see spirit again,i was working till 12am in the mid-nite, and i was walking back to my home from my working place[as my working place is near my home]. I walked pass a â€˜bigâ€™ tree and i saw a girl wear full white squading near the tree

              <p>Nice sharing. Followings are some episodes of incredible tales which were shown on Channel 8. I believe most of the stories were true as the person involved usually appeared on screen or behind screen to tell their stories. Some have 3rd eye (yin yang yan).</p>
