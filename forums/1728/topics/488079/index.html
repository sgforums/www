                  Explaining “Why”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="date"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">March 7, 2015</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> by <span class="fn"><a title="Domyo Burk" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/myjourneyofconscience/author/dburk/">Domyo Burk</a></span>  Patheos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.45pt; text-align: justify;">If religion’s purpose is to help people find peace and
                  strength and to live good lives, which I believe it is, it makes sense that
                  people would turn to religion to explain why terrible things happen in the
                  world – particularly terrible things that happen to individuals that apparently
                  didn’t do anything to deserve it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">I think the most profound and true religions – or the
                  most profound and true forms of the various religions – refrain from any
                  definitive explanation of “why.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Our longing to know “why” is perfectly natural and
                  reasonable. We would like to understand the “why” so we can try to prevent
                  terrible things happening to people, including us and our loved ones, in the
                  future. We would like to understand the “why” so we know our own culpability in
                  the matter (ideally we find we are free of any responsibility for a given
                  event, but at a deep level we appreciate this is rarely, if ever, true).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Religions throughout time have offered up all kinds of
                  answers for why terrible things happen: the whims of capricious gods that must
                  be cajoled and pleased; the position of the stars; the will of ghosts or
                  spirits; the people affected or involved deserved their fate because of bad
                  things they did in a past life; the people affected or involved deserved their
                  fate because they were displeasing to God in their current life. Whatever the
                  answer, a religion is also obligated to provide corresponding recommendations
                  for how to avoid similar calamity via ritual, offerings, beliefs, codes of
                  behavior, or adepts who can intercede with gods or spirits on our behalf.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Thus, with the help of religion, out of the sadness,
                  confusion and fear associated with terrible events and situations there can
                  arise certainty and a plan of action. But at what cost? It’s one tiny step from
                  explanation to blame. If you are the one who is suffering right now, what good
                  does my explanation for that suffering do you, unless you agree it is correct
                  and get with my religion’s program? Far more likely that you do not do either
                  of these, and the comfort my religion provides me only serves to alienate us
                  from each other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">What if a religion offers no explanation, but instead
                  offers this: “In this world there is great suffering as well as great joy. It
                  can be very difficult to find peace and strength and to live a good life in
                  such a world, but here are some ways to do it…”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">With support, then, the religious practitioner is
                  asked to develop the spiritual maturity to tolerate ambiguity and a lack of
                  control over the fortunes of life. Without trying to come up with explanations
                  just to comfort herself, this kind of religious person can bear true witness to
                  the sadness, confusion and fear that come along with terrible things. Out of
                  this bearing witness there can arise insight into what might best be done to
                  minimize suffering now and in the future. The easy, simple refuge of an
                  explanation is foregone for a resilient ability to find a more poignant kind of
                  peace without reliance on explanations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">I respect the nod to mystery that is given when
                  religions answer the big “Why” with, “It’s part of God’s plan. We cannot
                  possible comprehend God, so we cannot always understand his plan.” This invites
                  us to let go of explanation. However, religions generally add, “Still, even if
                  you can’t understand it, you can rest assured that God has a plan, and that it
                  is a good and beneficial plan.” Oops, one step too far. Nice to think that
                  everything is going to work out well in the end, but what kind of good plan
                  involves the slaughter of innocent children?  At some point the
                  explanations religions offer become too ridiculous for people to accept – and then
                  those explanations cease to provide the peace, strength and context they were
                  intended to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.45pt; text-align: justify;">I hope religions as well as individuals will continue
                  to grow and evolve. I hope we will all work to stay with the discomfort a
                  little longer each time and postpone as long as possible explanations that
                  might bring some relief but will shut down our dialogue with the world. I hope
                  religions will begin to refrain from offering explanations when there aren’t
                  any, but instead offer support to people to find peace, strength and direction
                  in the midst of the wonderful, terrible, ambiguous world in which we find
                  ourselves.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>One of the reasons why I have my respect for buddhism is it never discourages people from asking.    Unlike a faith or religion will judge a person to have no faith when believers ask why.   Worst, believers are deem to doubt when asking, and doubting is considered sinning in that faith/religion.   ABSOLUTELY UNCALLED FOR, REPRESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE FAITH/RELIGION.   </p></div>
