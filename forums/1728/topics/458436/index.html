               outflow of unpleasantness? Compounding negativity? Or perhaps you have 
              had perceptual baseline shift/s and are experiencing 'emotions' a little
               differently? Starting to see how 'emotions' are compounded phenomena, 
              made up of a combo of sensations and mental activity? Maybe the mental 
              activity has </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">changed</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">diminished</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> somewhat but those </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">affectively</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> charged
               sensations are still arising? Affective trigger sensations, like ones 
              that may arise in the chest and throat etc. depending on your practice 
              and current perceptual baseline, may trigger emotions, moods and the 
              selfing process to varying degrees of manifestation and fabrication. </span><br> <br> <a name="more"></a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br>But
               even if the experience of 'emotions' has changed due 
              to perceptual baseline shifts, why do such trigger sensations still 
              arise? What is their cause? Even without such a baseline shift, this 
              sort of inquiry is a very good place to start becoming aware of how such
               things arise.</span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
               find yourself driving your car and a situation (an object of sight, 
              sound, thought, sensation) dominates the mind and triggers 
              a sequence that runs the 'object' through the memory banks and evaluates
               it as good, bad, meh! for who else but 'me'. Sensations arise in the 
              chest; sensations that would normally trigger a reaction of irritation 
              in the mind. A compounding of mental and physical factors that give rise
               to 'irritation'. </span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
               has a baseline shift and is able to see that such arisings are 
              compounded, and is able to observe the physical factor seeing that a 
              mental reaction may be more diminished or maybe even absent. But, the 
              trigger sensations are still arising in such situations. There may be a 
              subtler mental reaction still; an unsatisfactory movement in the mind. 
              One can then start to develop a feeling of equanimity towards such 
              trigger sensations. The mental irritation is then replaced by the 
              feeling of equanimity towards them and this feeling of being equanimous 
              will grow stronger and stronger as the same situations still occur and 
              give rise to the trigger sensations that need to be seen equanimously. 
              This may continue indefinitely. </span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But what of the trigger for the very trigger sensations themselves? Why do they keep arising in such situations? </span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Depending
               on your intent, one can begin to pull apart why they do still arise. 
              How does the mind focus in such situations where 'irritation' arises as 
              either sensations only or the whole compounding emotion? How does the 
              mind read the 'object'? Is the mental focus narrow, wide, inclusive, 
              pervasive or segregating? Is it not recognising and overlooking parts of
               the field of experience? Why is such a habitual tendency still arising?
                What of the sense contact that is ignored in favour of a singular 
              object that is reacted towards habitually with 'irritation' (whether 
              seen as simply trigger sensations or the full compounded emotion)?<br><br>When
               causes are seen clearly, this is usually enough to bring about the 
              cessation of the effects. Something one, if so inclined, should 
              investigate themselves. What are the causes? How does the cessation come
               about?</span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">QUESTION: Is paying bare attention to the senses the recommended route to realize what you mention above?</span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It
               depends on how 'bare attention' is approached. If one singles out 
              specific sense contact to mentally focus on, what does it lead to? What 
              if one drops all mentally 'forced' focus and simply allows the brain to 
              show (no-one) what it is cognising right now at whatever sense door, 
              maybe two or three or all sense doors/sense object contact 
              simultaneously?<br><br>As far as I have seen in my own experience, the 
              way the mind 'focuses', the way it lunges onto specific 'objects' in the
               field of experience, sectioning off and ignoring other parts of it, is 
              how it sets up the base for the whole naming, conceptualising, 
              evaluating and reacting sequence that leads to 'trigger sensations' and 
              whatever leaps off of those sensations. This sequence usually if not 
              always leads to something not quite satisfactory. It leads to the 
              arising of fabrications of mind that push and pull our mental landscapes
               here and there. Very dizzying.<br><br>You find yourself driving a car 
              and you notice how the mind narrows onto the car in front of you. They 
              are driving slow. The mind narrows the mental focus and lunges onto an 
              object (the slow driver) and passes it through the sequence, evaluating 
              it as 'irritating'. Aaaah, so it seems the way the mind lunges and 
              grasps at 'objects' is triggering it all. What if I train the mind to 
              relinquish such a habit?<br><br>'Bare attention' can still be practiced 
              via the 'narrow mental focus' route and it may lead to a fabricated 
              concentration but it is still a fabrication and as we know, they are 
              generally if not always subject to end, impersonal and unsatisfactory. A
               fabricated 'bare attention' is not what I would utilize unless one is 
              experimenting to see how an unfabricated 'no focus bare attention' 
              compares to it. One can then learn how to relinquish that habitual 
              tendency to 'objectify' parts of the field of experience ignoring the 
              rest of what the brain is automatically cognising.</span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I
               have found all of the following combination of approaches, when applied
               together, lead to the 'bare attention', which will show how the mind 
              without 'narrow focus' is not subject to 'irritation' nor the trigger 
              sensations for such an unsatisfactory compounding.<br><br><span style="font-size: x-large;">*</span> The
               following practice shows oneself how the mind 'lunges' and 'grasps' at 
              objects and  how to relinquish that tendency via a very effective 
              feedback mechanism: </span><a style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" href="http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/yogi-toolbox-floaters.html">Floaters</a><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">*</span> The following pointer shows how the mind may be habitually narrowing 
              its focus and not recognsing what is cognised by the brain in other 
              parts of the field of experience: <a href="http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/yogi-experiment-peripherycentre.html">Periphery/Centre</a></span><br> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">*</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> If one is also inclined to continue momentum in one's practice then asking </span><strong style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/yogi-toolbox-haietmoba.html">How Am I Experiencing This Moment Of Being Alive (HAIETMOBA)?</a></strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> now
               and then will bring the mind back to what the brain is cognising from 
              moment to moment, without the need to 'narrow focus' and lunge onto 
              'objects' within the field of experience. One trains the mind to simply 
              recognise the whole entire field of experience (all sense contact) as it
               arises, clean and pure, unwarped by the sequence that blindly follows 
              and acts as a filter, a filter of unsatisfactory mental proliferation. A
               similar pointer question could also be </span><strong style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">How Is The Brain Cognising In This Very Moment (HITBCITVM)?</strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Ask it as much as possible to bring the mind back again and again to what </span><a style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" href="http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/great-perfection.html">Namkhai Norbu</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> seems to be pointing to:</span></p>

               awareness arising at the first sudden instant (of sense contact) is 
              indeed that pure presence which arises without correction (or 
              modification) and which is uncreated (by causes)</strong></span>. This very 
              condition of existence which transcends the limitations of both subject 
              and object is the authentic self-originated primal awareness of pure 
              presence.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span></span></em></blockquote>
              <p><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">*</span> All these approaches should be practiced with the following notion informing everything one does: <a href="http://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/yogi-experiment-riding-wave.html">Unfabricated Awareness</a></span><br> <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span> <span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Combining
               all of these approaches as a practice, one will then be able to train 
              the mind to relinquish the deeply engrained habitual lunging and 
              grasping at objects, in turn allowing what is continuously and 
              simultaneously cognised and experienced by the brain to be simply 
              cognised without any interference from 'you', i.e. the desire to grasp 
              at an object and establish a relationship with it thus giving rise to a 
              sense of 'me-ness'/subject and 'not me-ness'/other/object. Then there 
              will simply be the ongoing experience of truly just seen in the seen, 
              heard in the heard, sensed in the sensed, cognised in the cognised, at 
              whatever sense door continuously. Nothing is singled out, sectioned off 
              from the field of experience to be 'subjectified', 'objectified' and 
              reacted to graspingly. Everything is recognised as it arises and passes 
              without becoming fuel for any 'triggers' or compounding fabrications. A 
              wondrously freeing and liberating simultaneous recognition of continuous
               moment to moment to moment to moment etc. pure unfabricated stress-free
               sense contact.<br><br>Our 'slow driver' will then just be part of the ongoing experience of just the seen in the seen, cognised in the cognised, <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.than.html">bahiya style</a>, as opposed to the mind habitually making an 'object' out of the them and evaluating them as 'slow' and 'irritating' for 'me'. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
               whole combination of approaches  can then be applied to all perceived 
              'objects' (thoughts/images, sight, sound, touch/sensations-surface and 
              within. taste and smells), in any situation, with any arising phenomena,
               at any time of the day, in any position, in any life situation and any 
              condition of mind and body.</span></span></p>
