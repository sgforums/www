"There are four places, Ananda, that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.42 What are the four?<br><br>17. "'Here the Tathagata was born!'43 This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.<br><br>18. "'Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment!'44 This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.<br><br>19. "'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma!'45 This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.<br><br>20. "'Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains!' This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.<br><br>21. "These, Ananda, are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. And truly there will come to these places, Ananda, pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, reflecting: 'Here the Tathagata was born! Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment! Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma! Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains!'<br><br>22. "And whoever, Ananda, should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith, at the breaking up of the body, after death, will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness."<br><br>23. Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "How, Lord, should we conduct ourselves towards women?"<br><br>"Do not see them, Ananda."<br><br>"But, Lord, if we do see them?"<br><br>"Do not speak, Ananda."<br><br>"But, Lord, if they should speak to us?"<br><br>"Then, Ananda, you should establish mindfulness."<br><br>24. Then the Venerable Ananda said: "How should we act, Lord, respecting the body of the Tathagata?"<br><br>"Do not hinder yourselves, Ananda, to honor the body of the Tathagata. Rather you should strive, Ananda, and be zealous on your own behalf,46 for your own good. Unflinchingly, ardently, and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own good. For there are, Ananda, wise nobles, wise brahmans, and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the Tathagata."<br><br>25. Then the Venerable Ananda said: "But how, Lord, should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata?"<br><br>"After the same manner, Ananda, as towards the body of a universal monarch."47<br><br>"But how, Lord, do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch?"<br><br>26. "The body of a universal monarch, Ananda, is first wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron48 oil vessel, which is enclosed in another iron vessel, a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods, and so the body of the universal monarch is burned; and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch. So it is done, Ananda, with the body of a universal monarch. And even, Ananda, as with the body of a universal monarch, so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata. And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there Â— it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time.<br><br>27. "There are four persons, Ananda, who are worthy of a stupa. Who are those four? A Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa; so also is a Paccekabuddha,49 and a disciple of a Tathagata, and a universal monarch.<br><br>28-31. "And why, Ananda, is a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa? Because, Ananda, at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Blessed One, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And so also at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha!' or 'This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' or 'This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma!' Â— the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And it is because of this, Ananda, that these four persons are worthy of a stupa."</div>
