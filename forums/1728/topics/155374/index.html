In fact it is impossible for me to list them all now. Yes, Da Bei Zhou (great compassion mantra) is quite popular. Another popular one is 6 Syllabus mantra (om mani padme hum). It is also common to chant Namo Amituofuo. In fact you can chant any buddhas and bodhisattvas names - e.g Namo Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa, Namo Wen Shu Shi Li Pu Sa (manjusri), so on.<br><br>7 qing, 6 yu, hmm what else?

Emptiness [sunyata] is form. The action [karma] of form is not other than emptiness, nor is the action of emptiness other than form. Of this nature are also feeling, cognition, conception, and consciousness.<br><br>"Sharibu, in this way all dharmas are empty; without essential characteristic, not born, not ceasing, without defilement or expiation of defilement, undiminished, uncompleted.<br><br>"Sharibu, in this way, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no cognition, no conception, no consciousness.<br><br>"There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind, no shape, no sound, no color, no flavor, no feeling, nor any property.

There is no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment.<br><br>"Sharibu, in this way all buddhas, because of their non-attainment, abiding firmly by Prajnaparamita, are without mental obscurations ard are unafraid; they are truly passed beyond confusion, and are finally passed beyond suffering.<br><br>"All buddhas residing in the past, present, and future, through firmness in Prajnaparamita, have become buddhas of supreme and complete enlightenment.<br><br><strong>"Thus the Prajnaparamita mantra, the mantra of great knowledge, the unexceeded mantra, the unequaled mantra, the mantra that truly assuages all suffering, true and wise.<br><br>"The Prajnaparamita mantra spoken:<br><br>"Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi swaha.<br><br>"Sharibu, this is how boddhisattvas teach Prajnaparamita."</strong><br><br>Thereupon, the Victorious Conqueror arose from deep meditation and blessed Boddhisattva Avalokitshvara thus: Well done, well done!<br><br>"Noble son, that is so; noble son, that is ever so.<br><br>"By thus adhering to Prajnaparamita you shall become accomplished. You will look at everything this way, and therefore rejoice."<br><br>The Buddha having thus spoken, Saradwatibu and Boddhisattva Avalokitshvara and the sangha and the gods and men and asuras and devas were joyful, and praised the Buddha's speech.<br><br>: The end.<br></div>
