              Students of Buddhism Also Forced From Larung Gar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">2016-12-29 Radio Free Asia</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Hundreds
              of Han Chinese and Western students living at Sichuan’s Larung Gar Buddhist
              Academy have been quietly ordered to leave as Chinese authorities continue the
              forced, and better publicized, removal of larger numbers of Tibetan monks and
              nuns, sources say.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Several
              hundred Han Chinese, many of them living at Larung Gar as lay practitioners but
              some also monastically ordained, have already been evicted from the center, a
              local source told RFA’s Tibetan Service.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Many
              of them had lived in Larung Gar for many years, while others joined later in
              order to study and practice,” RFA’s source said, speaking on condition of
              anonymity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“They
              came from different parts of China,” the source said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“There
              were also many students from Western countries, including the United States and
              countries in Europe, who were studying at the center, and they too were forced
              to leave without any publicity,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tibetan
              monks and nuns have so far made up the largest number of Larung Gar residents
              forced to leave, though, RFA’s source said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“The
              brunt of the hardship was faced by the monks and nuns who were sent back to
              their home counties in the Tibet Autonomous Region,” the source said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“They
              were not allowed to go straight back to their family homes but first had to
              undergo a month of patriotic reeducation programs, after which they were
              allowed to return.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">More nuns expelled</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Following
              the eviction last week of hundreds of monks and nuns who had come to Larung Gar
              from counties in Golog (in Chinese, Guoluo) in neighboring Qinghai, another
              large group of nuns was sent away by bus on Dec. 28, the source said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“At
              that time, many other nuns who had gathered at the station cried out in pain
              and distress at the departure of their friends.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Chinese
              work crews are still carrying out the destruction of monks’ and nuns’ houses at
              Larung Gar, he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Many
              thousands of Tibetans and Han Chinese once studied at Serthar (Seda) county’s
              sprawling Larung Gar complex, which was founded in 1980 by the late religious
              teacher Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok and is one of the world’s largest and most
              important centers for the study of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Many
              have already been expelled from the makeshift dwellings that once lined the hillsides
              around Larung Gar as authorities seek to reduce the center’s population by
              about half to a maximum level of 5,000 by next year, sources told RFA in
              earlier reports.</span></p>
