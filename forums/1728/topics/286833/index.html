Knowing how the universe began can contribute nothing to this task.But since you have asked we will discuss it briefly here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>All religions have myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when many simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the god-idea. What does the Buddha say about the origin of the universe? It is interesting that the BuddhaÂ’s explanation of the origin of the universe corresponds very closely to the scientific view. <span style="color: darkblue;">In the Aganna Sutta, the Buddha described the universe being destroyed and then re-evolving into its present form over a period of countless millions of years.</span> The first life formed on the surface of the water and again, over countless millions of years, evolved from simple into complex organisms. All these processes are without beginning or end, and are set in motion by natural causes.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Infinite Causes is so named because of the belief that there are an infinite number of causes and conditions that made the world the way it is. There is no Â‘first causeÂ’ or Â‘one causeÂ’ because all things are intertwined in an endless web of causality with no beginning and no end.</span> Both natural and supernatural forces may be involved.<br><br>There are many universes, of many possible types. We happen to be in one. There may be both natural and supernatural causes that set the physical conditions of our universe the way they are and allowed life of our type to come into being. However, there is no need to believe that this is the best possible universe<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">An infinite web of causes and conditions affects the development of every instant in our lives and the world we live in. This includes our own actions. Karmic theory is based on the unseen bonds between living sentient beings, whereby every action we take has consequences. These consequences have an impact not only on all around us but also, through stress on the interconnections between us and everything else, reflect back on ourselves as well (either in this lifetime or in the future)</span>. However, this is not fate, because you can change your own karma, or by acts of compassion and mercy, alleviate the negative karma of those you help. In a Buddhist worldview, we help create our own reality. The discoveries of quantum physics do not trouble Buddhists the way they do members of Â‘divine planÂ’ based faiths, because the transitory nature of each moment was well understood by the Buddha, as was the interconnected condition of our existence.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Quantum physics theory reveals a universe of constant change, where events are only probabilities until there is an interaction with an observer. This effect of an observing mind on the future of the universe is consistent with Buddhist concepts that we are all interconnected and our actions and even presence can affect everyone and everything around us. </span><br><br>The Buddhist view of the world allows changes that occur over eons measured in millions of years or even billions of years. <strong>The Buddhist view of the world is that nothing that arises is permanent; all things are temporary and transitory. Because there is no design or plan</strong>, there is no objection to the idea that the worldÂ’s ecosystems have changed so dramatically that whole species have died out.<br><br>The evolution of life is, of course, the aspect of science that is causing the most vicious debate in theological and philosophical circles (since it deals with our direct ancestry, not obscure math like quantum theory or the theory of relativity). However, the fossil record clearly shows organisms existed that mix characteristics of fish and amphibians, amphibians and reptiles, reptiles and mammals, reptiles and birds, and so on, none of which would exist in a Creationist universe.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The Buddhist view that many beings in many universes would be capable of sentient thought and potentially capable of being affected by karmic bonds means.There is no objection to common ancestry with other species on Earth and no belief that such ancestry Â‘lowersÂ’ the value of human life at all </span><br><br>The idea of the evolution of life has been tested with two completely independent sources of information. One is the fossil record. The other is the DNA sequence evidence that all life known on Earth has common roots. Again, there would be no similarity between molecules in a human body and an ape, let alone a mouse, if these organisms had been built uniquely for their specific niches and tasks in a divine plan. Instead, each is clearly a modification of a common set of parts, stretched by expanding gene families and altering gene regulation and development.</div>

This includes our own actions. Karmic theory is based on the unseen bonds between living sentient beings, whereby every action we take has consequences. These consequences have an impact not only on all around us but also, through stress on the interconnections between us and everything else, reflect back on ourselves as well (either in this lifetime or in the future)</span>. However, this is not fate, because you can change your own karma, or by acts of compassion and mercy, alleviate the negative karma of those you help. In a Buddhist worldview, we help create our own reality. The discoveries of quantum physics do not trouble Buddhists the way they do members of Â‘divine planÂ’ based faiths, because the transitory nature of each moment was well understood by the Buddha, as was the interconnected condition of our existence.<br>............ </div></blockquote>Makes a lot of sense. Parallel my observations. There are other life forms out there in this vast Universe, not just Earth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi...<br><br>for all who are interested &amp; dun mind spending some time reading ...<br><br>..................................<br><br>Here an objection can be raised as to what was the <strong>first cause </strong>or where does the <strong>process of causation end</strong>?<br><br>In primitive times,people saw the wonders of nature and became curious to get some satisfactory explanation of them.Being ignorant and out of fear of the unknown forces of nature,they naturally tried to explain them by superstitous belief in gods or goddesses.The primitive man belived that the wind blows because the Wind God goes in a procession to get married or fire was caused by fire god.If science had accepted it we would not know that the movement of winf is due to differences of atmospheric pressure.<br><br>It is common for people who are exploring religion to ask questions regarding the origins of the world. Since time immemorial people have speculated about this question. Most religions will teach that the world was created by a Creator. For many people, this seems to be satisfactory.<strong> However, if one seriously thinks about it, this answer is merely a placebo - something that does not have any real value other than to satisfy the incessant queries of a questioner. </strong>To say that the world started with a Creator is no better than to say that the origin of yoghurt is milk, or the origin of a plant is the seed. <strong>Simplistic minds do not seem to have a need to see further back beyond that. </strong><br><br>Everything has a cause, that there must be a first cause, and that God is the first cause. This old argument contains its own refutation, for if everything has a first cause then the first cause must also have a cause.These are the basic ingredients of all religions even today..<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A theistic or superstitious explanation puts an end to all free inquiry.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Does Buddhism share this viewpoint?</span>No,Buddha did not recognise such concept but teaches the principle of <strong>Dependent Origination</strong> The purpose of this topic is<strong> <span class="large">NOT to argue but just to share the ideas </span></strong>and views from Buddhism. <span style="color: red;">(The principle of Dependent Origination is one of Buddhism's most important and unique teachings.Due to the profundity of the principle of Dependent Origination only the very basic rather than the advanced concepts will be discussed)</span><br><br><strong>Please click to read</strong><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=204975" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part I)-Dependent Origination  vs First Cause</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205683" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part II)-Where Is The Cracker?</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205686" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part III)-Who Am I ?</a><br><br></div>
