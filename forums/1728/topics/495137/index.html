              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor Global | 2018-01-26 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chinese people across the world gathered at their local
              Buddhist temples on Wednesday to celebrate the Laba festival by eating
              specially prepared congee. The festival falls on the eighth day of the 12th
              month of the lunar calendar—24 January this year—which, according to the
              Mahayana tradition, is the day the Buddha attained enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The word Laba comes from the Chinese name for the 12th lunar
              month “La” (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">è‡˜</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">) and “ba” (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å…«</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">), the
              Chinese word for “eight.” On this day, Chinese people traditionally worship
              their ancestors, and pray for a bountiful harvest, good health, and fortune,
              although it was only later in its history that the festival was attributed
              Buddhist significance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The festival is also known as Laba Zhu, where zhu has a
              similar pronunciation to zhou, which means rice porridge. However, this is not
              the reason why the festival is celebrated by eating congee; just before
              attaining enlightenment, the Buddha, who was on his last legs in terms of health,
              was given some curd by a shepherd girl. As Buddhism spread from India to China,
              the curd was replaced with rice porridge (congee) common in China. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eight-treasure congee usually consists of at least eight
              different types of rice, beans, fruits, and nuts. Some of these ingredients
              have to soak for a day before they can be cooked. From sbs.com.au</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eight-treasure congee usually consists of at least eight
              different types of rice, beans, fruits, and nuts. Some of these ingredients
              have to soak for a day before they can be cooked. From sbs.com.au</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The special rice porridge eaten on this day is known as
              eight-treasure congee, and usually consists of at least eight different
              vegetarian ingredients, including rice, beans, fruits, and nuts. The exact
              ingredients depend on what is grown locally or what is locally available, and
              therefore ties in closely with the old tradition of praying for a good harvest
              during the festival. Along with the glutinous rice that makes up the staple
              ingredient of the congee, a local community might add lotus seeds, black-eyed
              beans, chickpeas, Chinese mushrooms, carrots, red dates, peanuts, and yams.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Laba festival is celebrated across China, and everyone
              eats Laba congee. Buddhist temples cook the congee in bulk and many make the
              journey to temples to collect their bowl of rice porridge. The temples also
              distribute free congee at construction sites, communities, hospitals, nursing
              homes, and welfare houses. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The festival grew in popularity during the Qing dynasty
              (1636–1912), when the emperor, empress, and princes would offer Laba congee to
              ministers, or imperial maids. As for the common people, families would get
              together and cook Laba congee to worship their ancestors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Laba festival is also considered to be part of the
              preparation for Chinese New Year, which follows soon afterwards. Laba therefore
              serves as a reminder to begin preparations for the lunar new year celebrations
              and for travelers to return home to reunite with their families.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The festival is also popular with overseas Chinese
              communities. At Nan Tien Temple in Wollongong, Australia—the largest Buddhist
              temple in the Southern Hemisphere—Venerable Miaoyou observes that the festival
              is celebrated by the entire Chinese community and has, to some extent,
              surpassed its religious intent. Such is its popularity that those who are not
              religious also join in the festival, in the much the same way that many
              non-Christians like to celebrate Christmas. This year, devotees at Nan Tien
              Temple cooked more than 1,000 bowls of porridge, which were offered to the
              public for free.</span></p>
