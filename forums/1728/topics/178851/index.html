Do you have a dhamma master?<br><br>From what I heard from Ajahn Brahm talk, meditation is good and is beneficial.<br>When you are deep in meditation, you lose sense of your body and your surroundings.

Then I had this experience, I seem to leave my body and watch the "I" that was sitting there meditating. I fellt very light like floating in the air. All went well until a question pop up in my mind. "If I am sitting there meditating, then who is the one watching "me" meditating". With that I came out from the mediation trying to grab the "I" that represent "me". It seems very much like the out of body experience but I am very aware of what was going on.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

It was when I meditated and became peaceful, very peaceful, incredibly peaceful, that something told me that this was the most profound experience of my life. I wanted to experience this again. I wanted to investigate it more. Why? <strong>Because one deep experience of meditation is worth a thousand talks, or arguments, or books, or theories.</strong> The things you read in books are other people's experiences, they are not your own. They're words and they might inspire, but the actual experience itself is truly moving. It's truly earth shattering because it shatters that which you've rested on for such a long time."<br><br>here's the link:<br><a href="http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed065.htm" rel="nofollow">edited version of a talk by Ajahn Brahmavamso</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the Body Disappears.......<br><br>Remember "con men," "con women" as well. These con men can sell you anything! <strong>There's one living in your mind right now, and you believe every word he says! His name is Thinking.</strong> When you let go of that inner talk and get silent, you get happy. Then when you let go of the movement of the mind and stay with the breath, you experience even more delight. Then when you let go of the body ,all these five senses disappear and you're really blissing out. This is original Buddhism. Sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch completely vanish. This is like being in a sensory deprivation chamber but much better. But it's not just silence, you just don't hear anything. It's not just blackness, you just don't see anything. It's not just a feeling of comfort in the body, there is no body at all.<br><br>When the body disappears that really starts to feel great. You know of all those people who have out of the body experiences? When the body dies, every person has that experience, they float out of the body. And one of the things they always say is it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful. It's the same in meditation when the body disappears, it's so peaceful, so beautiful, so blissful when you are free from this body. What's left? Here there's no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch. This is what the Buddha called the mind in deep meditation. When the body disappears what is left is the mind.<br><br>What you're seeing in such deep meditation is that which we call "mind," (in Pali it's called Citta). The Buddha used this beautiful simile. When there is a full moon on a cloudy night, even though it's a full moon, you can hardly see it. Sometimes when the clouds are thin, you can see this hazy shape shining though. You know there is something there. This is like the meditation just before you've entered into these profound states. You know there is something there, but you can't quite make it out. There's still some "clothes" left. You're still thinking and doing, feeling the body or hearing sounds. But there does come a time, and this is the Buddha's simile, when the moon is released from the clouds and there in the clear night sky you can see the beautiful full disc of the moon shining brilliantly, and you know that's the moon. The moon is there; the moon is real, and it's not just some sort of side effect of the clouds. This is what happens in meditation when you see the mind. You see clearly that the mind is not some side effect of the brain. You see the mind, and you know the mind. The Buddha said that the mind released is beautiful, is brilliant, is radiant. So not only are these blissful experiences, they're meaningful experiences as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good to know that you're interested in and have been experimenting with meditation.<br><br>If you're interested in the "good and special" feelings/effects that one experiences through meditation, then I'd say you're doing very well. You probably don't need a teacher, because you can just continue replicating those experiences and building on them.<br><br>If you're interested in true liberation and realization of the true nature of reality, then I'd say those that you mentioned are not important. (Not based on my own words, coz I'm not a good meditator, but based on advice from many of my Buddhist meditation teachers of various traditions). If you are keen to gain enlightenment, then you have to let go of the attachment to these experiences, and also to let go of the fear of not having such experiences.<br><br>The various pleasant/unique experiences that you said, one of my teachers calls it "meditative moods". He said that, meditative moods are not realization. Because once you're out of meditation, it's not there. It's just a meditative mood that arises because of the various causes and conditions were present for it to arise, and therefore it would subside and disappear when the causes and conditions are absent. Just like ice-cream can make us temporarily happy, but doesn't give us ultimate happiness; similarly such meditative experiences can make us happy for the moment, but it doesn't give us ultimate bliss. Instead, the danger is that, once you start to fall in love with such experiences, you'll keep wanting them - and these experiences become your goal of pursuit, and distract you from the actual goal which is Complete Liberation/Enlightenment.<br><br>Another of my teachers used an eg. Like if you stand on a stage and look down from it, and you see many heads below... and then you exclaim "Wow I see so many heads! Incredible! Unimaginable! This is wonderful, miraculous." Well, that's silly... because actually it's normal...nothing special.... that when we stand on the stage and look down we'll see many heads. Nothing special to be delighted about.<br><br>Similarly, when we meditate, it is normal and nothing special to have certain experiences... and it would be equally silly to revel in it when these experiences appear or feel disappointed when they don't.<br><br>Pls don't be mistaken, I'm not trying to say you're silly *grins* Most of us do get excited when we have such experiences. That's where the trap lies actually... that's why the meditation teachers often warn us again and again not to hold on to these experiences, not to hope for them, not to pursue them. When they come, let them be. When they go, let them be.<br><br>As what the other forumers suggested, it is extremely important for us to obtain ongoing guidance from qualified meditation teachers. Meditation cannot be learnt just from reading.<br><br>Besides going to Jen Chen (where the forum owner goes to); other places include Cakkavala Meditation Centre (they have regular meditation sessions at Cheng Beng Buddhist Society, on Saturdays 7.15pm); Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery (www.kmspks.org).<br><br></div>

You probably don't need a teacher, because you can just continue replicating those experiences and building on them.<br><br>If you're interested in true liberation and realization of the true nature of reality, then I'd say those that you mentioned are not important. (Not based on my own words, coz I'm not a good meditator, but based on advice from many of my Buddhist meditation teachers of various traditions). If you are keen to gain enlightenment, then you have to let go of the attachment to these experiences, and also to let go of the fear of not having such experiences.<br><br></div></blockquote>hi wanderer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>thanks for commenting, advices, compliments.....<br><br>before u post this, i have already thought of not wanting to keep a diary of my experiences because letting go starts from the very 1st experience. i dont wanna have so much bubble foams to clear at the base at the end of the day... hehee....<br><br>wow u really think i don't need a teacher? wow great foresight and intuition u have over the protocol!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  amazing....... u could tell..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>great thinkers and achievers perform best alone yeah? a great example is shakyamuni buddha, don't u agree, wanderer? but the willingness &amp; motivation to seek advice and guidance is good too. instead of clinging on to ego-centered self or proudness. agree, wanderer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>every experience comes naturally if u have been meditating u would be able to understand what i mean. i'm not practicing daily, i just discovered. i know its hard to be comprehended by some. i treasure the lessons learnt in every experience if u disregard even the small before the huge ones occur then how to attain enlightenment?even that is also an attachment. composure and consistency is needed all the time. agree? this my 1st small experiences. whats realisations? whats the actual meaning to it? u know? everything comes naturally isn't it just as u said. u get my point? hehee.....<br><br>a meditator is a meditator. the minds like to wander thats why differentiating occurs, then what is yr mind for? even that is an attachment. its your mind thats thinking assuming..... examining....<br><br>theres no right and no wrong......<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>to be continued.... as i'm working at my desk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you heard of Vipassana meditation?<br><br>It is known as insight meditation, observing the flow of the breath when you breathe in and then breathe out. You also observe your thoughts when you breathe in when they arise, and then breathe out when that thought perished or no more, just like the law of impermanance.<br><br>For example, when your skin is itchy, just observe the sensation and tell yourself that the itch will only last a few moments and it will not last forever.<br>When the itch does disapper, you realise it is the same with the law of impermanence, arising for a moment, and then disappear totally after a while.<br>That is the contemplation of Impermanency, Anicca.<br><br>Or you meditate observing the flow of your breath only. If you find that a kind of peace envelope you, do not be too attached to the peace either cos if you do, its attachment.<br><br></div>
