              <p>Chene Lhundup Rinpoche was born in 1932 at Minphel Khang Tsheldang Central Bhutan He studied and practiced under the late Holiness Penlop Khen Rinpoche<br>and Eminence Geshe Pema Thinley Rinpoche His father the great Yogi Drupchu Dorji was a long time follower of the great lama Togden Sacha Sherig from Tibet Because of his pure mind, inner dedication and devotion towards his master he was the only one to recieve a most sacred Phurba a hidden treasure of Guru Rimpoche discovered by a terton</p>
              <p>The Phurba has been the sole relic in Rinpoche's community and has cured many people from hazardous diseases One of Rinpoche's main practice is Vajrakilaya and he is highly adept in a vast repertoire of sacred skills and methods as was predicted by  Holiness Penlop Khen Rinpoche and Eminence Geshe Pema Thinley Rinpoche Ocvercoming many hardships he bulit Tsheldang Gompa In 1970 and Urgyen Choling Monastery to preserve and transmit Buddhist teachings Chene Lhundup Rinpoche was bestowed many karma and terma teachings by the late Holiness Dudjom and Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in all 4 Vajrayana traditions</p>
              <p>Chene Lhendrup Rimpoche has long held plans to build a retreat centre The centre will be constructed in an isolated area four hours walk from Orgyen Choling Monastery, at Lingtang. The retreat centre will be called Orgyen Kunzang Shedrup Choling. The practices of the Longchen and Pema Lingpa lineage will be lead by Rimpoche in the traditional three year, three month, three day retreat. Currently there is no retreat centre in the vicinity, therefore all monks must leave their monastery and teacher and go to another district.</p>

              <p>Orgyen Chholing Monastery is located on the mountain between two native villages Tsheldang and Nakhar under Zhemgang Dzongkhag, East Bhutan The Monastery has been in place since early 1920s preserving and propagating the lord Buddha’s teaching. Despite the isolation of monastery from modern amenities and road networks, people live in peace and harmony with dharma in every man’s heart.</p>
              <p>Initially late Drupchoe Dorji the father of the founder of the monastery has started and blessed the sites with small retreat house in place. Though Drupchoe Dorji couldn’t upgrade from small retreat house, it was then in Mysore while the founder of the monastery Chene Lhendup Rimpoche was attending the teaching from His Holiness Polo Khen Rimpoche .</p>
              <p>There in Mysore His Holiness Polo Khen Rimpoche directed and prophesized Chene Lhendup that there is a special elephant sleeping shaped mountain surrounded by male on right and female dragon shaped mountains on left. Building monastery in the center would benefit all sentient beings and create enormous pleasant situation for dharma preservation in future.</p>
              <p>In 1940s, H. E Khechen Dazar Rimpoche from Tibet visited the place and blessed it. Later in his visit there were so many unbelievable signals like rainbow rising on the hill of Monastery. He then said that it was the blessing and secret place of Bayu Lama Shakaya Ozer who had the rainbow body and other yogis during the 18th century.</p>
              <p>Later many great masters like Thuktse Rimpoche, Gyshe Pema Thinley and others great teacher had been here to have retreat. H.H Polo Khen Rimpoche and Khenpo Dazar Rimpoche had predicted the place for the quality to accomplish the retreat and to preserve the Buddha Dharma.</p>
              <p>With the great intent of Lord Buddha and all great masters, Chene Lhendup Rimpoche realized the importance of the presence of monastery and the order of Sangha to preserve and propagate the holy dharma to benefits the beings around.Consequently with the great perseverance and with the support from his followers and people from those two villages, he started the work in 1970 and progressively came up with small temple.</p>
              <p>Later in 90s Chene Lhendup Rimpoche offered the monastery to His Holiness Gangtey Tulku (lineage holder of Pema Lingpa in Bhutan. It was then from that moment immense development and changes took place. Besides tending to everyday running of the monastery he has been the central supporter for coming up of new temple. Today H.H Gangtey Trulku is chief adviser for all Pema Lingpa lineage in Bhutan</p>
              <p>Today Orgyen Chholing Monastery has one old and a new temple supporting 36 monks with one Khenpo and two teachers. The great terton Pema Lingpa, (hidden treasure revealer from Bhutan tradition has been the main root practices since the beginning. The monastery also practices Longchen Nyingthicg of Longchenpa tradition. These two are the main practice in the Kheng region in the central Bhutan</p>
