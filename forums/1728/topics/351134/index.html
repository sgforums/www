              <p>Never heard of it.</p>
              <p>Just heard that all authentic teachers, like the Dalai Lama, can be considered as the embodiment of the Buddhas.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said of the following:</p>
              <p>The Buddha's body = Sangha</p>
              <p>The Buddha's speech = Dharma</p>
              <p>The Buddha's mind = Dharmakaya</p>
              <p>And a highly realised dharma practitioner is as such:</p>
              <p>The Lama's body = Sangha</p>
              <p>The Lama's speech = Dharma</p>
              <p>The Lama's mind = Dharmakaya</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama is said to be the embodiment of Compassion, so he is taken as the emanation of Chen Re Zig because there is no difference between his compassion and Chen Re Zig. Having faith in this, one arises a strong devotion towards the Dalai Lama, so that one will benefit from his teachings.</p>
              <p>It is similar to when we have faith, devotion and confidence in someone, we are inspired to follow in his footsteps and accomplish what he has accomplished by following his teachings and practiced his instructions and advice.</p>
              <p>It is taught by Garchen Rinpoche that devotion is like the sun that melts the snow of our defilements covering the firm mountain of our Buddha Nature. I have faith in this because my devotion to my Root Guru, the late Venerable Drubwang K. N. Rinpoche, have benefited me spiritually tremendously. It helps me in times of obstacles, in making important decisions in life and in spiritual progress.</p>
              <p>To know what is devotion to one's guru and the benefits that it brings, you may wish to read on the Lifestory of Milarepa and use Milarepa and Marpa relationship as a guide or use Venerable Ananda and Buddha Shakyamuni relationship as a guide.</p>
              <p>Strong devotion to one's guru means practicing the dharma one has received from one's guru with diligence, enthusiasm and perseverance, with the intention of benefiting others.</p>
              <p>Everyone needs to have at least 2 gurus as support; one outer and one inner. Outer gurus includes dharma books, the Buddha, the spiritual master giving teachings, etc. Inner guru refers to our Buddha Nature, which through the proper practicing of the dharma will pop out occasionally to guide us spiritually. Through the outer guru, we can reach out to our inner guru and experience glimpse of it.</p>
              <p>Hope this is hopeful to you in some ways.</p>
              <p>May you experience swift spiritual progress and be never separated from the Triple Gem.</p>

              <p>Buddha tried to prevent but also failed in the end. It was their karma to fight/get killed.</p>

              <p>Prayer cannot alter karma.<br>It can create the good condition for our good karma to ripen faster.<br>But it can't totally remove our bad karma, if prayer or supernatural power can do that, we already become buddha long time ago already.</p>
              <p>HH Dalai Lama doesn't ask for independence, since Tibet was part of China long ago. What he ask for is autonomy. Anyway, this is political issue, let's not dwell further on this.</p>
