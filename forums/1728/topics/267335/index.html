            <div class='col-md body'>Hello... just now I had a thought of wanting to find some peace... and so I was just about to pick up some spiritual, dharma books to read in hope that I can get 'peace'.

Instead of running away from it which just increases the momentum of the negativity, the aversion and suffering, and as a result being a tremendous waste of energy, why not FEEL and BE whatever our experience is at that moment -- that is reality.

That's why I'm not knocking calmness, and I do emphasize the importance of sitting meditation, chanting, etc.<br><br>But the problem arises when we hold onto an image on what 'peace' is all about. We see that peace is a state absent of all the various "bad" conditions happening in life, somehow a split-off peaceful refuge we can hold onto. We see it as an escape from our situation. Such an idea is an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">illusion</span></strong>. True stillness arises when we do NOT run away from whatever situations that are arising, whatever arises is arising in spontaneous clarity by itself... any dualistic action to try to get rid of whatever is arising is itself suffering.<br><br>Insight practise is about this, every moment is seen as luminous-emptiness, whatever that is arising is just as empty as 'peace'... and this 'peace', being empty, is ungraspable. Seek escape and peace, peace eludes you, there is only struggle.</div>

Buddhism gives the practitioners strength to carry on in the world.. it has to do with how 'willing' the practitioner is to face reality as it is moment to moment, neither running away from what is at this very moment, or to become attached in seeking something else in the future, thus taking the moment as a means to an end.<br><br>It has to do with awareness penetrating the nature of all things. As the Buddha said in this sutra about the <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=262231" rel="nofollow">The Eight Worldly Winds</a>, the difference between an instructed disciple and an uninstructed 'run-of-the-mill person' is that an instructed disciple clearly discerns with awareness that all eight worldly winds are transient - changing moment to moment, and is Dukkha (suffering). He discerns with awareness whatever arises as it is, and his mind does not get consumed in suffering and in gain and loss.<br><br>Whereas, the uninstructed 'run-of-the-mill' person does not discern what is arising as it is, and as the Buddha said of such a person:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"He welcomes the arisen gain and rebels against the arisen loss. He welcomes the arisen status and rebels against the arisen disgrace. He welcomes the arisen praise and rebels against the arisen censure. He welcomes the arisen pleasure and rebels against the arisen pain. As he is thus engaged in welcoming &amp; rebelling, he is not released from birth, aging, or death; from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, or despairs. He is not released, I tell you, from suffering &amp; stress."</span></span><br><br>That's the problem with materialism... those attached to materialism is always trying to 'get something better in the future', and such a person can never have peace of mind. His mind will never leave 'gain or loss', constantly seeking something in the future and if he loses or does not get what he wants, aversion arises.<br><br>So the Buddha said:<br><br><strong>Â“Let not a person revive the past<br>Or on the future build his hopes;<br>For the past has been left behind<br>And the future has not been reached.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instead, with insight let him see<br>Each presently arisen state;<br>Let him know that and be sure of it,</span></strong><br>Invincibly, unshakeably.<br>today the effort must be made;<br>Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?<br>No bargain with mortality<br>Can keep him and his hordes away,<br>But one who dwells thus ardently,<br>relentlessly, by day, by night -<br>It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,<br>Who has one fortunate attachment.Â”</div>

But still doesn't mean you can't enjoy them... there has to be balance.<br><br>But honestly speaking I don't think a practitioner with certain levels of practise, would spend too much time on these things. Not that they can't... but life is just too short, we'd better be making use of all the time to practise. There is much greater bliss in clarity than in materialism, because material things are all fleeting, ungraspable, of the nature of dukkha.<br><br>As for whether you want a relationship, ultimately its conditions (such as meeting somebody you like) + your choice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>I have found a wonderful text by the 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng regarding my topic.<br><br>Here's it, chapter 5 of Platform Sutra: <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng5.html</a><br><br><strong>Chapter V. Dhyana</strong><br><br>The Patriarch (one day) preached to the assembly as follows:--<br><br>In our system of meditation, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we neither dwell upon the mind (in contradistinction to the Essence of Mind) nor upon purity. Nor do we approve of non-activity</span>. As to dwelling upon the mind, the mind is primarily delusive; and when we realize that it is only a phantasm there is no need to dwell on it. As to dwelling upon purity, our nature is intrinsically pure; and so far as we get rid of all delusive 'idea' there will be nothing but purity in our nature, for it is the delusive idea that obscures Tathata (Suchness). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we direct our mind to dwell upon purity we are only creating another delusion, the delusion of purity. Since delusion has no abiding place, it is delusive to dwell upon it. <span style="color: red;">Purity has neither shape nor form; but some people go so far as to invent the 'Form of Purity', and treat it as a problem for solution. Holding such an opinion, these people are purity-ridden, and their Essence of Mind is thereby obscured.</span></span></strong><br><br>Learned Audience, those who train themselves for 'imperturbability' should, in their contact with all types of men, ignore the faults of others. They should be indifferent to others' merit or demerit, good or evil, for such an attitude accords with the 'imperturbability of the Essence of Mind'. Learned Audience, a man unenlightened may be unperturbed physically, but as soon as he opens his mouth he criticizes others and talks about their merits or demerits, ability or weakness, good or evil; thus he deviates from the right course. On the other hand, to dwell upon our own mind or upon purity is also a stumbling-block in the Path.<br><br>The Patriarch on another occasion preached to the assembly as follows:--<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learned Audience, what is sitting for meditation? In our School, to sit means to gain absolute freedom and to be mentally unperturbed in all outward circumstances, be they good or otherwise. To meditate means to realize inwardly the imperturbability of the Essence of Mind.</span></strong><br><br>Learned Audience, what are Dhyana and Samadhi? Dhyana means to be free from attachment to all outer objects, and Samadhi means to attain inner peace. If we are attached to outer objects, our inner mind will be perturbed. When we are free from attachment to all outer objects, the mind will be in peace. <strong>Our Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure, and the reason why we are perturbed is because we allow ourselves to be carried away by the circumstances we are in. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He who is able to keep his mind unperturbed, irrespective of circumstances, has attained Samadhi.</span></strong><br><br>To be free from attachment to all outer objects is Dhyana, and to attain inner peace is Samadhi. When we are in a position to deal with Dhyana and to keep our inner mind in Samadhi, then we are said to have attained Dhyana and Samadhi. The Bodhisattva Sila Sutra says, "Our Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure." Learned Audience, let us realize this for ourselves at all times. Let us train ourselves, practice it by ourselves, and attain Buddhahood by our own effort.</div>

That's why not everyone is into real spirituality. They're after some mundane benefits, or some inner peace, or whatever, but they are not interested in reality. It's not exactly for the faint hearted either... there has to be fearlessness to face reality as it is... to become enlightened to the timeless reality.<br><br>Interestingly I just quoted this from Longchen days ago:<br><br>Dear friends, what are your thoughts and experiences on this subject? Do you treat spirituality as an escape?</div></blockquote>Well back to the topic.. sometime, i'm not even sure what i am feeling sometime.. Even if it is a piece of sh!tty feeling. Feeling will disappear as soon as it comes. The context of the feelings will changed frequently, from bad to so bad blah blah blah.<br><br>What is then this reality that one perceived ?<br><br>My 2 cent of view is that... one needs to seek solace in dharma teaching is becos one is not enlightened yet. Ultimately, it is not the words of the teaching that gives you the peace, it is the realization of the teachings that naturally set you at ease...  the peace that you allows for yourself.<br><br></div>
