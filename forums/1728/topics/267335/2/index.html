I do think many people want and seek spirituality to escape from mundane things... including myself, sometimes.<br><br>But then time and time again experience will tell that it's not possible... cos reality presents all sorts of mundanity that you have to face it. So in the end... you have to learn how to face reality and grow spiritually from there... and then eventually you'll begin to appreciate how all the mundane settings are actually a great spiritual ground for practise.<br><br>From the true viewpoint of our Buddha Nature, like 6th Zen Master Hui Neng said, is beyond purity and defilement of samsara. That is the 'Transcendental Purity' of Dharmakaya... it is ever shining and ever unstained.. like a non stick realm where consciousness does not abide in anything, yet everything appears miraculously. The problem is only that we are 'moved' by our circumstances, our mind forms perceptions of them, whereas in reality they are empty... so all such mental perceptions must be deconstructed.<br><br>6th Zen Master Hui Neng said (in the previous post I posted): <span style="font-style: italic;">Our Essence of Mind is intrinsically pure, and the reason why we are perturbed is because we allow ourselves to be carried away by the circumstances we are in. He who is able to keep his mind unperturbed, irrespective of circumstances, has attained Samadhi.</span><br><br>I think if we can face reality every moment, mindful and aware, and not run away from it, and not seeking something else, and have fearlessness in that state, soon there will be insight into what is non-duality...<br><br>In terms of living in the mundane world, we should have wisdom not to engage in unwise activities and behaviors, and yet use prajna wisdom to deal with every situation.. this requires mindfulness and thoughtful consideration. At the same time we remain liberated at all times, and we are not creating any negative karma...</div>

Giving can be anything... even something as simple as smiling. That's giving.. because when you smile, others smile, everyone becomes happy.<br><br>That is one form of giving... we should be mindful at all moments and be rather to give and share... if we can give something we hold on dearly to someone who needs it more, then all the more thats better.<br><br>Wisdom is one paramita but there are many others and we should all practise until Buddhahood... this is v impt.
