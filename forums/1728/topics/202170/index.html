            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding Jesus, it is true that healing is possible. My Master has healed 4 cancer patients by blessing them, but he has to suffer himself quite a while to clear the karma. Therefore he said, "If I bless too many people, I may even have to visit the doctor to 'clear karma'." Similarly, LZLS used to bless her mother and healed her of a long term illness, but she has to suffer for some time. Her sister tell her "Hey! Your blessings work so well, why don't you bless everyone" But of course they don't know that it isn't so simple, and master shen kai instructed her not to give public blessings for that reason.<br><br><a href="http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/056-1986.html" rel="nofollow">Supernormal Power</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Throughout history, people who have used supernormal powers have found themselves in dangerous situations or met tragic ends because of their power. Even one of the Buddha's disciples died for this reason. People who use supernormal power must contend with the law of karma. When you help someone who is sick or in danger, you intercede in the karma that was affecting that person, and the karma now becomes directed towards you. It's like assuming someone else's debt. Now you have to pay.<br><br>Supernatural powers should not be used lightly. The account in the New Testament of Jesus is an example of redirected karma. I believe that Christ had supernormal powers -- the ability to heal the sick, make the blind see, and to drive out demons. You might think that with such powers, when he was nailed to the cross, he would have been able to make it disappear with a wave of his hand. But no, he had to die. You could say that Jesus died because of the sins of other people, because he had supernormal power, because he intervened in matters affecting other's lives.</span> - Master Sheng Yen<br><br>Of course, this is from the perspective of Buddhist, Christians may not necessarily share this understanding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(partially pasted from the same url)<br><br>Mahayana and Theravadan (Hinayana) Buddhism differ in their classification of enlightened beings. There are four levels in Theravada, ten or sometimes eleven in Mahayana. Someone who is at the the first level, "stream-entry," according to the Therevadan classification, can truly hold to the precept of not killing. We might take this precept, but it is more than likely that we will inadvertantly step on an insect or somehow crush a bug during the course of the day. But the psychic power of a "stream-enterer" is such that when he walks, creatures move out of his way.<br><br>The last level in Theravada before Buddhahood is that of Arahat. You may have read that someone can attain this level without acquiring psychic powers. But Arahats can accomplish almost anything they wish to do. However, they may be unaware of their power. There is a story of a group of monks who arrived late one night at a vihara, an Indian temple. Their lamp had run out of oil and the night was pitch black. One of the monks said, "We can have light if there is an Arahat here." Sure enough, a monk stepped forward and said that he was an Arahat. The first monk suggested that he point his finger and illuminate the area. The Arahat did just that and the area was bathed in light. He was simply unaware of some of the powers he had attained.<br><br>In the literature of many cultures there are references to heavenly beings who answer the prayers of mortals with silver gold, or precious jewels that have been transformed from ordinary objects or substances. Buddhist sutras acknowledge this power, but caution that a transformed substance can revert to its original form. It may take eight, eighty, even five hundred years, but it will eventually change back. However, if an Arahat transforms something into gold, it will remain for a great kalpa.<br><br>Many people are curious about past and future lives. Devas and gods can know the past and future, but their power is limited to perhaps ten lives in either direction. The most powerful deva may be able to see one hundred lives in either direction, but no further. Arahats have even greater power. They can remember lives for ten thousand kalpas, but not even they can go back to their origins. They can, however, tell exactly what will happen in the future.<br><br>Now I will compare the power of an Arahat with that of a Buddha. Of all Arahats, the strongest in psychic power was Maha Maudgalyana. Once the Buddha said to him, "There is a world that lies to the west. If we go there together, you will not be able to keep up with me, so you start the journey before me." It took Maha Maudgalyana three months to reach his destination. When he arrived, the Buddha was already there. Maha Maudgalyana asked him when he had departed. The Buddha replied that he had just left a moment ago. For the Buddha there is no distance. This world or that world is close by, no matter how far it may seem to us. There is no time for the Buddha -- he sees limitless lives in the past, limitless lives in the future, all seen in the same instant.<br><br>A god can have jurisdiction over a particular region, or country. A deva who had power over this planet would be powerful indeed. But this is a small planet among myriads. An Arahat's power extends over thousands of world systems. He has the ability to know what transpires anywhere in his domain.<br><br>But the Buddha is everywhere at every time. The Bodhisattva Manjusri is very close to Buddhahood, so his power is comparable. He, too, is everywhere at all times. The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara can respond effortlessly to a thousand different beings at a thousand different places at the same time.<br><br>There was a Ch'an master who decided to urinate in front of a statue of the Buddha. Another monk rushed over and asked him what he was doing. The master said, "If you can show me where there is no Buddha, I'll go there."<br><br>The power of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas exists at all places and at all times, and far surpasses the power of other beings: Arahats, deities, and common people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Supernatural power should not be the focus in Buddhism. Although there were indeed rare displays of miracle power.<br><br>But what I wanted to point out is that with all the miracle power one has, cannot and will not overcome his own and others karmic consequences. Just look at what is happening out there.<br><br>According to Master Chin Kung. Buddha is indeed intelligent, because He did not focus his teaching on supernatural powers, but on wisdom. Buddha knew demons/devils can also perform such supernatural power acts, but not the wisdom.<br><br>According to Ajahm Brahm, supernatural powers and miracles do happen in all religions.<br><br></div>
