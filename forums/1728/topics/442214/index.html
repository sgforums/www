In this way, the beliefs in rebirth would not contradict the Buddha’s doctrine of Not-self as the controversy of a migrating ‘self’ would not exist in the whole equation. And if one, is at the same time living a moral life by the ten good deeds in actions of body, speech and mind, have no doubts in the Buddha’s Teaching of the efficacy of Kamma and the Four Noble Truths, than the beliefs in mental rebirth alone can also be a safe bet as well.

              <p>It;s true that there is no rebirth in buddhism, purely buddhaness.
