                      what he wrote was that it is like a chain, all link up, which he
                      mean is a continuous flow of life, and should not be divided up
                      into a three lifetime existences. In your opinion, what useful
                      purposes can an interpretation of a three lifetime dependent
                      origination serve for a practicing Buddhist by the way? After all,
                      moral causation itself can be achieved by practicing the Noble
                      Eightfold Path. Moreover, Arahanthood in theory can be achieved in
                      one lifetime and the understanding and concern of Paticcasamuppada
                      should be for the present lifetime itself for the cessation of
                      suffering.</span></span></p>

              <p>All models of dependent origination are valid in their own contexts.</p>
              <p>If you deny three lifetime, rebirth, and karma, that is problematic and in disaccord with Dharma.</p>
              <p>If you deny rebirth you also deny freedom from rebirth/next life.</p>
              <p>In other words by accepting ignorance caused your present life, you also accept that the ending of ignorance therefore leads to the end of future births.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Three Lifetimes or One Moment?</h3>
              <p>Picking up on a theme in several of the comments, I'd like to jump into 
                  the very hot water of the perennial debate about dependent origination. I
                   like to say that when I was in Thailand, I saw only two topics that 
                  would be sure to generate heated debate among the monks; the correct 
                  interpretation of the dependent origination and the allowability of 
                  cheese in the afternoon.<br><br>(Not wanting to get lost in the legalistic minutiae of vinaya, we'll leave the latter aside for now.)<br><br>The twelve-fold <a href="http://www.arrowriver.ca/dhamma/deporig.html">dependent origination</a> is a cornerstone of the Buddhist teaching, essentially a detailed 
                  elaboration of first and second noble truth, or in the scriptural 
                  phrase, "an explanation of how this whole mass of suffering comes to 
                  be."<br><br>The teaching itself is a subtle and difficult one, and as so
                   often, the original texts are quite terse and formulaic. These factors 
                  have led to various attempts at detailed elaboration. Two of these have 
                  gained prominence in the Theravada world.<br><br>The traditional model, 
                  sometimes called the "three lifetime model," is the one established in 
                  the orthodox tradition by Buddhaghosa in the 5th century A.D. (The 
                  explanation of <a href="http://www.arrowriver.ca/wheel/wheel.html">dependent origination on my web-site </a>is
                   based on this model.) The term "three lifetimes" is a bit of a 
                  misnomer, it should really be "many lifetimes." The model supposes that 
                  some of the factors refer to events from previous lifetimes, some to 
                  this lifetime, and others to future lifetimes. For example, the crucial 
                  link sankhara -&gt; vinnana (formations to consciousness) is interpreted
                   as past karmic formations causing rebirth-linking consciousness.<br><br>The
                   other popular model is sometimes called the "momentary" model. Although
                   some version of this interpretation was known to Buddhaghosa, as he 
                  mentions it in passing, it has only come into prominence in recent 
                  decades through the work of the great Thai teacher Ajahn Buddhadasa. 
                  This model prefers to see the dependent origination as occurring in it's
                   full cycle in every single moment of consciousness. Thus, the links of 
                  birth and death are interpreted metaphorically, rather than literally. 
                  (Here is a site dealing with <a href="http://www.suanmokkh.org/archive/ps/index.htm">Buddhadasa's interpretation</a>.)<br><br>Without
                   coming to any definite conclusion (although in the interests of full 
                  disclosure I'll say that I lean toward the traditional model) I'll make 
                  the following observations;<br><br>1. I don't think the two models are 
                  mutually exclusive, despite what some partisans on both sides would have
                   us believe. The process of cause-and-effect detailed by the dependent 
                  origination can, and probably do, occur on several time scales. We are 
                  coming into birth every moment as we take new objects of consciousness 
                  and run the gamut of feeling, craving and clinging. But we also go 
                  through the  processes of actual  physical death followed by rebirth 
                  periodically. The dependent origination serves as an explanation for 
                  both inter-related processes.<br><br>2. While some of Ajahn Buddhadasa's
                   disciples have gone so far as to actually deny that there is any 
                  rebirth in the traditional sense, this does not appear to have been the 
                  Ajahn's view. I don't believe there is any place in his writings where 
                  he categorically denied the reality of physical rebirth. He did say 
                  something like "rebirth has nothing to do with Buddhism" but what he may
                   have meant is that Buddhism should be about attaining nibbana (and 
                  thereby ending rebirth) rather than seeking a fortunate rebirth. This 
                  may have had a lot to do with the milieu of Thai Buddhism at the time, 
                  which in his view was neglecting the higher teachings.<br><br>I have 
                  also heard that when he was asked point-blank about this, he would say 
                  "What do the suttas say?" When the reply came back that the suttas 
                  clearly teach the actuality of rebirth (as they indisputably do) he 
                  would say, "Well, we musn't go against what the Buddha said." Make of 
                  this what you will.<br><br>3. From my reading of Ajahn Buddhadasa's 
                  writing (not comprehensive) it seems that the main reason he taught the 
                  momentary view was it's utility for practice. It is no simple matter to 
                  practice with factors spanning several lifetimes, but we can all watch 
                  the mind go through it's changes in the here and now. There is a lot to 
                  be said for this way of looking at it. In particular, watching the mind 
                  go through the sequence contact to feeling to craving to clinging to 
                  becoming is a very important aspect of developing insight.<br><br>4. 
                  Finally, whatever the merit of the two models practically or 
                  theoretically, it is quite clear which one is closer to the original 
                  texts. Whenever the Buddha gave detailed descriptions of the twelve 
                  factors, he always described birth and death in literal, not 
                  metaphorical language. Birth is coming into existence in one of the six 
                  realms, through one of the four modes of generation etc. and death is 
                  the failing of the faculties, the destruction of the body, the passing 
                  out of this realm of being etc.<br><br>------------<br><br>POSTSCRIPT on Rebirth;<br><br>A correspondent alerted me to another web-site dedicated to promulgating <a href="http://www.buddhistsagainstreincarnation.com/">Buddhism without Rebirth</a>.
                   Without getting into a detailed critique, it should be enough that this
                   character quotes  "the Buddha" using Paul Carus' Buddhist Gospel as a 
                  source. I've dealt with the <a href="http://bhikkhublog.blogspot.com/2007/01/check-your-sources.html">dubious influence of this book</a> before.</p>

              <p>1) There are different kinds of realisation. With regards to two emptiness: one is emptiness of person, one is emptiness of dharmas. They are about emptiness but the object of refutation is different.</p>
              <p>2) This is about facts - the Buddha taught the emptiness of dharmas, yet the Arhants continue to posit the existence of dharmas (wrong) while rejecting a soul (correct). That is why Prajnaparamita Sutras need to be taught - the emptiness of self and dharmas.</p>

              <p><br> 1) is this not what was being taught by the Buddha,
                      dhamma.</p>
              <p>2) in that case, how can they even attain enlightenment and be
                      arhat?</p>
              <p>3) are you even sure this is in the pali canon? how
                      knowledgeable are you in theravada tradition?</p>
              <p>4) Prajnaparamita Sutras was not expounded by the Buddha,
                      so it was not in the Pali canon. that said, I am not doubting the
                      veracity of the truth though.</p>

              <p>1) Well it is. He never said there is only one kind of insight.</p>
              <p>2) Because they realized the emptiness of persons/atman.</p>
              <p>3) What are you asking is in the pali canon? Emptiness of dharmas, as I have said, can be traced to Phena Sutta and Kaccayanagotta Sutta of the Pali Canon.</p>
              <p>4) I did not say Prajnaparamita Sutras are expounded by historical Buddha (despite legends that they were kept by nagas, etc). They were clearly authored down by unknown authors, and display an evolution over time. They are however undoubtedly the earliest of all Mahayana sutras.</p>
              <p>Prajnaparamita Sutras are necessary because Arhats only realize emptiness of persons but not emptiness of dharmas. It arose in reaction to that to clarify the twofold emptiness.</p>

              <p>Well maybe one life D.O. is 'more practical', but that does not deny that D.O. can span lfetimes, and does span lifetimes, and because of this ignorance ceased in this life means no more future lives, karma from past lives ripen in this life, and so on.</p>
              <p>By the way karma is an important doctrine in Buddhism too so lets not downplay that.</p>
              <p>The most practical thing about D.O. imo is to apply this view in our daily experience so that we do not see things as being controlled or experienced by an agent but rather as a causal process, whether at issues of rebirth to more mundane everyday life issues, and also so that we are able to realize emptiness.</p>
              <p>To deny one model of D.O. is to apply arbitrary limitations to the ways D.O. can manifest. That is why I say all models of D.O. are valid in their own context and should not be seen as contradictory.</p>

              <p>yes agreed. Buddha's purpose is to expound dhamma to the gods and men so that they can end their suffering from samsara. well said.</p>
              <p>but then mahayana said that even if they were to attain enlightenment, they would be aroused from Buddha to strive for Buddhahood. I very much doubted this.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is stated in the Alagaddupama Sutta (MN22) that when Right View is grasped and cessation of suffering attained, all dhammas is to be let go just like a raft should be abandoned once its purpose of using to cross a river have being accomplished. So I believe in your opinion, whether individual dhammas are considered to be real or not should not make any difference as eventually all teachings are to be abandoned once cessation of suffering is attained. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But to a Mahayanist, the Doctrine of Emptiness is considered to be more 'advance' as it when a step further to points out not just the self but also all things themselves are empty of any characteristic. This means that the realization of Emptiness is even more complete and the attainment of arahanthood is of a lower order. Besides, the attainment of an arahant is basically an individual achievement. To a Mahayanist, this would mean there is still the notion ‘self’ in the person unlike the ideals of a Bodhisattvaship which is a saving of all sentient beings.</span></span></p>

To justify this view, appeal is generally made to these three statement of the Buddha's, which occur in the Suttas in many places: <a name="p2"></a></p>
              <p><em>Sabbe sankhárá aniccá.<br>Sabbe sankhárá dukkhá.<br><strong>Sabbe dhammá anattá.</strong></em><br>(Anguttara III,134; Dhammapada 277-279; &amp;c.)</p>

              <p><a name="p3"></a>They are interpreted in this way. <em>Sabbe sankhárá</em> means everything that is <em>sankhata</em>, or formed; or, in other words, everything excluding the <em>asankhata</em>, the unformed, <em>nibbána</em>. <em>Sabbe dhammá</em> means both <em>sankhata</em> and <em>asankhata</em>; that is to say, everything, <em>nibbána</em> included. <em>Nibbána</em> is thus <em>anattá</em>.</p>

              <p>Have a look at this:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">
              </span></p><p>So any thoughts and beliefs you have are just conditions. But I'm not saying that you shouldn't believe in anything, I'm just pointing out a way to see things in perspective so you're not deluded by them. We won't grasp the experience of emptiness or the Unconditioned, the Deathless, as a personal attainment. Some of you have been grasping that one as a kind of personal attainment, haven't you? I know emptiness. I've realised emptiness' - patting yourselves on the back. That's not sabbe dhamma anatta - that's grasping the Unconditioned, making it into a condition. Me' and Mine'. When you start thinking of yourself as having realised emptiness, you can see that also as a condition of the mind.</p>
              <p>Now sabbe dhamma anatta: all things are not-self, not a person, not a permanent soul, not a self of any sort. That's very important to contemplate also, because <strong>sabbe dhamma includes all things, the conditioned phenomena of the sensory world and the Unconditioned, the Deathless.</strong></p>
              <p>Notice that Buddhists make no claim for Deathlessness as being a self either! I have an immortal soul, or God is my true nature!' The Buddha avoided any statements of that nature at all.<strong> Any possible conceiving oneself as anything at all is an obstacle to enlightenment, because you attach to an idea again</strong>, to a concept of self as being part of something. Maybe you think there's a piece of you, a little soul, that joins the bigger one at death. That is a conception of the mind - isn't it? - that you can know. We're not saying it's untrue, or false, but we're just being the knowing, knowing what can be known. We don't feel compelled to grasp that as a belief, we see it as only something that comes out of the mind, a condition of the mind, so we let even that go.</p>
              <p>Keep that formula all conditions are impermanent, all things are not-self' for reflection. And then in your life as you live it, whatever happens you can see sabbe sankhara anicca, sabbe dhamma anatta. It keeps you from being deluded by miraculous phenomena that might happen to you, and it is a way of understanding other religious conventions.</p>

              <p>first of all, isnt the dhamma taught by the Buddha. during the Buddha era, there is no hinayana or theravada or mahayana. so a century or so later, schools  or traditions aroses due to split of interpretation. to me, sorry I make no distinction between arahants or Buddha, theravada or mahayana or vajrayana. its a contradiction to say mahayana's ideal is higher when such distinction is being made very strongly.</p>
              <p>second if there is a self notion, how to even be an arahant in the first place? so your question is wrong.</p>
              <p>I always believed the Buddha's aim is to expound the dhamma and lead to as many people to cessation of suffering. as possible. anything more is a pointless exercise.</p>

It is up to individuals reading it to doubt or believe, agree or disagree on the points stated. As far as I am concerned, the points raised are just for academic interest only. So long as there is no conflict on the core and basic tenets between the different schools of thoughts, then just follow the practices and teachings of the school one is most comfortable with. That would be a good start already. The rest is up to the individual to decide for themselves which direction they intended to take.<span> </span></span></span></p>

              <p>yes but then a masters supposed to be enlightened. enlightened masters view all dhamma as empty, hence there should be no distinction made. I preter the era of the Buddha's time, when there is just practising of the dhamma, no traditions nor schools of hinayana or mahayana.</p>
              <p>as for arahant, of course their knowledge and power of course is so much inferior to that of a Buddha, who spent aeons practising perfections before they are ready to be a Buddha. you dun have to be a genius to know this.</p>
              <p>as for arousal of arahant to strive for Buddhahood, again there is a split of opinions. once you attained enlightenment, this will be your last life, cessation of sufferings. same also goes to Buddha who attained Nibbana already. so why is there arousal after Nibbana?</p>

              <p>So..Aik and AEN,what do you think of 'sabbe dhamma anatta' ? does it come from a mahayana source? talking about being more advanced when one have realised all dhamma is anatta is there such thing as an indiviudal achievement? and last but not least, in the pranjapramitta sutta, where by there is a conversation between the bodhisatta and the arahant sariputta,are all of you so 101% certain that the bodhisatta was trying to preach to sariputta and not that he was trying to explain to sariputta what he have understood?</p>
              <p>I think very simply from this thread there is indeed 2 level of emptiness; emptiness at the theory level and emptiness at the realisation level.I below to the first type thus i do see the need to improve myself more on the 2nd level and im sure many of you do know which level of emptiness you yourself are instead of playing with concepts.</p>
