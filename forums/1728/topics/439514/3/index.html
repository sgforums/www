              <p>first of all, isnt the dhamma taught by the Buddha. during the
              Buddha era, there is no hinayana or theravada or mahayana. so a
              century or so later, schools  or traditions aroses due to
              split of interpretation. to me, sorry I make no distinction between
              arahants or Buddha, theravada or mahayana or vajrayana. its a
              contradiction to say mahayana's ideal is higher when such
              distinction is being made very strongly.</p>
              <p>second if there is a self notion, how to even be an arahant in
              the first place? so your question is wrong.</p>
              <p>I always believed the Buddha's aim is to expound the dhamma and
              lead to as many people to cessation of suffering. as possible.
              anything more is a pointless exercise.</p>

              <p>Arhants realize persons are empty, no atman. This is enough to attain arhant. But they treat dharmas to have svabhava or inherent existence. So they realize first emptiness but not second.</p>
              <p>Secondly, from the Mahayana pov only when all sentient beings suffering are liberated is our job done. Our scope is therefore much larger.</p>

              <p>So..Aik and AEN,what do you think of 'sabbe dhamma anatta' ?
                                  does it come from a mahayana source? talking about being more
                                  advanced when one have realised all dhamma is anatta is there such
                                  thing as an indiviudal achievement? and last but not least, in the
                                  pranjapramitta sutta, where by there is a conversation between the
                                  bodhisatta and the arahant sariputta,are all of you so 101% certain
                                  that the bodhisatta was trying to preach to sariputta and not that
                                  he was trying to explain to sariputta what he have understood?</p>
              <p>I think very simply from this thread there is indeed 2 level of
                                  emptiness; emptiness at the theory level and emptiness at the
                                  realisation level.I below to the first type thus i do see the need
                                  to improve myself more on the 2nd level and im sure many of you do
                                  know which level of emptiness you yourself are instead of playing
                                  with concepts.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Anatta can be taken to mean empty of persons - no soul or atman in or outside the five aggregates. So there is no subjective person (atman). But each of the aggregate can still be taken to have inherent, objective existence, as per Abhidhamma analysis. The latter is also rejected in Mahayana (as described in heart sutra). Of course, this is also rejected by Buddha even in Pali suttas as I have said before, but it is not realized or emphasized by the Arhants.</p>
              <p>Both emptiness of person and emptiness of objects are not theory realisation, they are two levels of experiential realisations, as countless masters have showcased. If emptiness of objects were of mere theoretical value, Buddha would not have taught it.</p>
              <p>I and Thusness have also shared our experiences about it:</p>

              <p>I reckoned that in order to attain enlightenment, how can monks

              <p>The Buddha has exhorted to his disciples to even let go of the

                  the end.</p>
              <p>Mahayana claimed that theravada doesnt realise the emptiness of
                  dhamma, but they themselves also have distinction of theravada and
                  mahayana. since all forms and dhamma are empty, why have

              <p>Realizing emptiness of dharmas doesn't mean you can't make distinctions on the conventional level.</p>
              <p>Do you think the Buddha will say "oh since everything is empty, Christianity is the same as Buddhism"?</p>

              <p>what about mindfulness of Dharmas...? Coz we all know there is no lasting entities in all Dharmas... that means the arhats also treat dharmas for the 2nd point too? But is this a common understanding throughout Thera or Maha...?</p>

              <p>Theravada sees existence of dharmas which nevertheless arise and subside.</p>
              <p>Mahayana sees dharmas are fundamentally illusory and empty, while they are impermanent they have fundamentally no birth and no death, i.e. "No production and no extinction; No permanence and no annihilation; 
              No unity and no differentiation; No coming and no going."</p>

              <p>Oh... what I meant was better not to ask which is 'better/superior', but instead to ascertain validity from the standpoint of direct experience. </p>
              <p>Actually AEN already replied earlier that these are two reproducible, verifiable levels of insight.  His reply from earlier was:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Anatta can be taken to mean empty of persons - no soul or atman
                                      in or outside the five aggregates. So there is no subjective person
                                      (atman). But each of the aggregate can still be taken to have
                                      inherent, objective existence, as per Abhidhamma analysis.</p>
              <p>The
                                      latter is also rejected in Mahayana (as described in heart sutra).
                                      Of course, this is also rejected by Buddha even in Pali suttas as I
                                      have said before, but it is not realized or emphasized by the
                                      Arhants.</p>
              <p>Both emptiness of person and emptiness of objects are not theory
                                      realisation, they are two levels of experiential realisations, as
                                      countless masters have showcased. If emptiness of objects were of
                                      mere theoretical value, Buddha would not have taught it.</p>
              <p>I and Thusness have also shared our experiences about it:</p>
              <p>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>So actually both views accord with experience... just different stages of insight.</p>
              <p>One says, there are just dharmas, no <em>atman</em>.</p>
              <p>Another further realises: no <em>atman</em>, and also no dharmas.</p>

              <p>that is why I am more inclined towards theravda, not cos of any reasons or inclination, but cos I can trust their authenticity of the dhamma being transmitted by the Buddha. it is said that theravada is as close to the original words of the Buddha.  how is it that during the Buddha's time, there were no theravada or mahayana, just dhamma. when the Buddha passed away, he also did not appoint a successor. his successor will be the next Maitreya Buddha. let the dhamma be your teacher and guide once I am not around, Buddha said this.</p>
              <p>all those debates on the ideal path such as arhat or bodhisattva are philosophical differences. but buddhism is not meant to be like this. it is meant for one to practise the here and now and experience it thru meditation.</p>

Practice beats any talk in the sense that one should find out for oneself.  Base one's path not on blind faith but preferably on faith supported by knowledge.  Of course, a basic amount of faith is necessary or one will not be able to even believe the Buddha's words that enlightenment is possible and that practice leads to fruition.</p>
              <p>The sutras, the commentaries, the Dharma talks, etc. that we listen to serve to provide the theoretical framework from which to base our practice.  Without theoretical framework, practice also cannot begin.  Even if you go to a very practice-oriented teacher, it won't happen that only the method is taught without basic premises being laid out. </p>
              <p>Which we are going to believe is also very much based on personal inclinations and propensities.  This is slightly off-topic, but my family member and I used to ponder why some people 'die, die' also cannot accept Buddhadharma and for that matter why some people subscribe to certain religions and not to others.  The conclusion we came to is that we all have different affinities and propensities .... so back to which teacher one is going to believe.  I think the way to ascertain is by returning to the sutras and seeing if what a particular teacher says is in accord with the sutras. </p>
              <p>And yeah, I know that at this juncture, there may immediately be people wanting to point out their tradition to be the one and only correct one.  My response to that is, don't be so quick to judge and jump to conclusions.  Let those who have propensity to be purists be purists, and let those who agree with the second and third turning of the Dharma wheels also practice according to their traditions. </p>
              <p>In anycase, it doesn't mean that one believes something now, that one cannot later redefine one's views at a later stage.  I myself find that I am constantly refining, or should I say redefining, my views as time goes by.  This redefinition could go in any direction really; some may even decide that Buddhadharma is not for them and leave for other pastures. </p>
              <p>At the beginning of one's practice, one has more sheer faith and less direct knowledge, but as time goes by one's faith based on direct knowledge increases.  I tell myself to just keep practicing such that we can one day speak with the certainty and conviction of personal experience and not just theory. </p>
              <p>If I've spoken too much already, my apologies.  /\</p>
