              <p>What comes into my mind of this doctorine is that it teaches non attachment and the idea that all things originates is dependant on another whether rebirth or mind. Then they can break away from the cyclic "birth" by breaking the cycle.</p>
              <p>Some believe that if one can truly understand the D&amp;O doctrine, one can attain nibbana. However some ended up thinking that by chanting this discourse can also lead to the way</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt;  '>The standard interpretation of the Dependent Origination which is generally taken to be the authority comes from the Visuddhimagga written by Buddhaghosa around the 5<sup>th</sup> century AD. This is the three lifetime format. It is a more of a moral causation, useful to laymen who are looking more into a better rebirth in their next life than the state of Arahanthood. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt;  '>But the three lifetime format also implies the present of an Ego or a Self that is being reborn. This interpretation goes again the Buddha’s doctrines of Anatta and Anicca. Beside, rebirth in any realm of existences is not what the Buddha preaches or encouraged.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt;  '>For a Buddhist who has little ‘dust’ in their eyes, this interpretation is of no, or little significant or implication to their practice. It is not that moral practices in everyday lives are not encouraged. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt;  '>Paticcasamuppada is the Buddha’s teaching on the Second Noble truths, which is the arising and causes of suffering, in reverse it is the cessation of suffering, the Fourth Noble Truths. With the cessation of suffering, the state of Arahanthood can be attained in this very lifetime. The whole of the Dependent Origination cycle, both in the arising of suffering and in its cessation, is concerned with this present life i.e. in one lifetime itself.</span></p>

              <p>Yes. Countless suttas have testified about karma and rebirth. How can we deny this?</p>
              <p>One of the three knowledges of Buddha upon his enlightenment is the intricate effects of karma and its effects on sentient beings, as well as his countless past lives.</p>

              <p>By the way, rebirth and karma are ultimately empty, but it is because dependent origination is synonymous with emptiness - under Madhyamaka analysis, based on the insight into emptiness and dependent origination. It does not deny that relatively cause and effect plays out over time, for example.</p>
              <p>But if you want to speak in ultimate terms, even one life dependent origination is equally empty as three lives dependent origination.</p>
              <p>If you want to speak in conventional terms, three lives dependent origination is as valid as one life dependent origination.</p>

If we try to use conventional terms to explain the doctrine it is likely to be misunderstood. When we talk of occurrences as a process of dependent arising, it is like a chain linked together. There is no ego present, no entity that is born or dies and nobody that is receiving karmic ramification and it is also in accordance to the concept of a continuing existence. It is not nihilism because at very instant, no person has died. In every instant there is only dependent arising. </span></span></p>

In your opinion, what useful purposes can an interpretation of a three lifetime dependent origination serve for a practicing Buddhist by the way? After all, moral causation itself can be achieved by practicing the Noble Eightfold Path. Moreover, Arahanthood in theory can be achieved in one lifetime and the understanding and concern of Paticcasamuppada should be for the present lifetime itself for the cessation of suffering.</span></span></p>
