              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Want a
              better 2016? Try thinking more about your impending demise.<br> <br> Years ago on a visit to Thailand, I was surprised to learn that Buddhist monks
              often contemplate the photos of corpses in various stages of decay. The Buddha
              himself recommended corpse meditation. "This body, too," students
              were taught to say about their own bodies, "such is its nature, such is
              its future, such its unavoidable fate."<br> <br> Paradoxically, this meditation on death is intended as a key to better living.
              It makes disciples aware of the transitory nature of their own physical lives
              and stimulates a realignment between momentary desires and existential goals.
              In other words, it makes one ask, "Am I making the right use of my scarce
              and precious life?"<br> <br> In fact, most people suffer grave misalignment. In a 2004 article in the
              journal Science, a team of scholars, including the Nobel Prize winner Daniel
              Kahneman, surveyed a group of women to compare how much satisfaction they
              derived from their daily activities. Among voluntary activities, we might
              expect that choices would roughly align with satisfaction. Not so. The women
              reported deriving more satisfaction from prayer, worship and meditation than
              from watching television. Yet the average respondent spent more than five times
              as long watching TV as engaging in spiritual activities.<br> <br> If anything, this study understates the misalignment problem. The American Time
              Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, in 2014, the average
              US adult spent four times longer watching television than "socializing and
              communicating," and 20 times longer on TV than on "religious and
              spiritual activities." The survey did not ask about hours surfing the web,
              but we can imagine a similar disparity.<br> <br> This misalignment leads to ennui and regret. I'm reminded of a friend who was
              hopelessly addicted to British crossword puzzles (the ones with clues that seem
              inscrutable to Americans, such as, "The portly gentleman ate his cat,
              backwards"). A harmless pastime, right? My friend didn't think so — he was
              so wracked with guilt after wasting hours that he consulted a psychotherapist
              about how to quit. (The advice: Schedule a reasonable amount of time for
              crosswords and stop feeling guilty.)<br> <br> While few people share my friend's interest, many share his anxiety. Millions
              have resolved to waste less time in 2016 and have already failed. I imagine
              some readers of this article are filled with self-loathing because they just
              wasted 10 minutes on a listicle titled "Celebrities With Terrible
              Skin."<br> <br> Some might say that this reveals our true preferences for TV and click bait
              over loved ones and God. But I believe it is an error in decision making. Our
              days tend to be an exercise in distraction. We think about the past and future
              more than the present; we are mentally in one place and physically in another.
              Without consciousness, we mindlessly blow the present moment on low-value
              activities.<br> <br> The secret is not simply a resolution to stop wasting time, however. It is to
              find a systematic way to raise the scarcity of time to our consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> Even if contemplating a corpse is a bit too much, you can still practice some
              of the Buddha's wisdom resolving to live as if 2016 were your last year. Then
              remorselessly root out activities, small and large, that don't pass the
              "last-year test."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There are
              many creative ways to practice this test. For example, if you plan a summer
              vacation, consider what would you do for a week or two if this were your last
              opportunity. With whom would you reconnect and spend some time? Would you
              settle your soul on a silent retreat, or instead spend the time drunk in Cancun,
              Mexico?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">If this year
              were your last, would you spend the next hour mindlessly checking your social
              media, or would you read something that uplifts you instead? Would you compose
              a snarky comment on this article, or use the time to call a friend to see how
              she is doing? Hey, I'm not judging here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Some might
              think that the last-year test is impractical. As an acquaintance of mine joked,
              "If I had one year to live, I'd run up my credit cards." In truth, he
              probably wouldn't. In a new paper in the science journal PLOS One, two
              psychologists looked at the present value of money when people contemplated
              death. One might assume that when reminded of death, people would greatly value
              current spending over future spending. But that's not how it turned out. Considering
              death actually made respondents less likely to want to blow money now than
              other scenarios did.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Will
              cultivating awareness of the scarcity of your time make you grim and serious?
              Not at all. In fact, there is some evidence that contemplating death makes you
              funnier. Two scholars in 2013 published an academic paper detailing research in
              which they subliminally primed people to think about either death or pain, and
              then asked them to caption cartoons. Outside raters found the death-primed
              participants' captions to be funnier.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There's
              still time to rethink your resolutions. Forget losing weight and saving money.
              Those are New Year's resolutions for amateurs. This year, improve your
              alignment, and maybe get funnier in the process: Be fully alive now by meditating
              on your demise. Happy 2016!</span></p>
