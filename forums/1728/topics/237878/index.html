Following many auspicious signs including rainbows and there was much speculation as to who this child might be the rebirth of even before he was born. It was the terton and wisdom dakini, Tare Khandro (Tare Lhamo), the daughter of another great terton in Golok, Aphang Terton who first recognised him as the tulku of HH Dudjom Rinpoche. Ven. Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche III came to see Yangsi Rinpoche in Kyegudo and gave him the name "Pema Osel" (Lotus Light).  While Dzongshar Rinpoche performed important initiations for Dudjom Yangsi Rinpoche, three layers of rainbows appeared above the roof of the house. After receiving a letter from Tare Khandro, His Holiness Chatral Sangye Dorje Rinpoche said he believed the child to be the Dudjom tulku and wrote to HH Dudjom RinpocheÂ’s eldest son, HH Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche who agreed with his view and visited the young tulku in Chengdu, Sichuan to meet Yangsi Rinpoche in 1993.<br><br></div>

Many past incidents shaped her vision and she felt a higher calling. When her father had died of a heart attack, she felt guilty. In his passing, she felt that she had erred in caring for him. Later, at a hospital, she witnessed a penniless, aborigine woman be denied medical attention while bleeding on the floor. Another time, a Catholic missionary said to her, "You Buddhists are a passive group and ignore the needs of others." Master Cheng Yen was determined to serve all humanity. She envisioned a world of kindness, compassion, joy and equality.<br><br></div>

A teacher, author, and peace activist, Nhat Hanh was born in central Vietnam on October 11, 1926. He joined a Zen monastery at the age of 16, studied Buddhism as a novice, and was fully ordained as a monk in 1949. Commonly referred to as Thich Nhat Hanh, the title ThÃ­ch is used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha) clan.[1] He coined the term Engaged Buddhism in his book Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire.[2]<br><br>In the early 1960's, he founded the School of Youth for Social Services (SYSS) in Saigon, a grassroots relief organization that rebuilt bombed villages, set up schools and medical centers, and resettled families left homeless during the Vietnam War.[3] He traveled to the U.S. a number of times to study and later teach at Columbia University, and to promote the cause of peace. He urged Martin Luther King, Jr. to oppose the Vietnam War publicly, and spoke with many people and groups about peace. In 1967, King nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.[4] Nhat Hanh led the Buddhist delegation to the Paris Peace Talks. One of the best known Buddhist teachers in the West, Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings and practices appeal to people from various religious, spiritual, and political backgrounds. He offers a practice of mindfulness that is often adapted to Western sensibilities.[5]<br><br>He created the Order of Interbeing in 1966, and established monastic and practice centers<br>....<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thich_Nhat_Hanh</div>

Sie ist eine Emanation von Vajrayogini, die die VerkÃ¶rperung von Weisheit und MitgefÃ¼hl aller Buddhas ist. Sie ist die gÃ¶ttliche Mutter der Buddhas und manifestiert sich aus MitgefÃ¼hl heraus in der Form der Dakinis der FÃ¼nf Buddha-Familien. Um den Wesen im Samsara zu helfen, zeigt sie grenzenlos viele Manifestationen zu verschiedenen Zeiten und in verschiedenen Dimensionen des Raumes. Die Belehrung der Reinen Vision von Achi ChÃ¶kyi DÃ¶lma ist eine Schatz-Belehrung, die der vorherigen Inkarnation von S.E. Trisab Gyabra Rinpoche 1967 inmitten der Kultur-Revolution in Tibet offenbart wurde. In Rinpoches Reiner Vision gab Achi ChÃ¶kyi DÃ¶lma ihm direkt diese Belehrung, die den FÃ¼nffachen Pfad von Mahamudra, Ngaden, beinhaltet, dem vollstÃ¤ndigen Pfad, der, praktiziert man ihn inbrÃ¼nstig und voller Hingabe, in einem einzigen Leben zur Erleuchtung fÃ¼hrt. Diese Belehrung Ã¼bertrug Rinpoche dann in einen Text, der von groÃŸem Segen fÃ¼r jeden ist, der mit ihm in Kontakt kommt. Rinpoche wird die Einweihung, die Belehrung, die Text-Ãœbertragung (Lung) und die Praxis-Anweisungen fÃ¼r diese Sadhana der Reinen Vision von Achi Ã¼bertragen.<br><br>S.E. Trisab Gyabra Rinpoche ist eine Reinkarnation des zweiten Drikung KagyÃ¼d-Thronhalters Khenchen Tsultrim Dorje (1154-1220), der eine sehr starke Verbindung zu Kyobpa Jigten SumgÃ¶n hatte. In der Geschichte der Drikung-KagyÃ¼d-Linie gehÃ¶rt S.E. Trisab Gyabra Rinpoche zu den Lehrern, die die grÃ¶ÃŸten BeitrÃ¤ge zur Entwicklung der Linie erbracht haben.In der vorherigen Reinkarnation (1921-1979)war er der HerzensschÃ¼ler von S.H.Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche und S.H.Drikung Kyabgon Chungsang Rinpoche. Nach deren Tod wurde er zum amtierenden Oberhaupt der Drikung-KagyÃ¼d-Linie. Nachdem die Reinkarnation der beiden gegenwÃ¤rtigen Heiligkeiten erkannt worden waren, Ã¼bernahm er die Verantwortung fÃ¼r ihre Ausbildung. Der gegenwÃ¤rtige Trisab Rinpoche ist die 7.Reinkarnation und wurde 1981 in Indien geboren. Dem Vorbild der groÃŸen Meister der Vergangenheit folgend, fÃ¼hrte er das Drei-Jahres-Retreat in der Zeit von 1996-1999 durch, um die Aufgaben zu Ã¼bernehmen, allen fÃ¼hlenden Wesen zu nutzen. 2001 erhielt er die vollen MÃ¶nchsgelÃ¼bde. Im gleichen Jahr gab S.H.Chetsang Rinpoche bekannt, dass ihn S.E.Trisab Gyabra Rinpoche in der Zukunft in allen Angelegenheiten der Drikung-KagyÃ¼d-Linie vertreten wird.<br></div>
