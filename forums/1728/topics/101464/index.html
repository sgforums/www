It does not falsely pull us into living in a fool's paradise, nor does it frighten and agonize us with all kinds of imaginary fears and guilt-feelings.  It calls us exactly and objectively what we are and what the world around us is, and shows us the way to perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness.Â”<br><br><strong>Ven. Dr. W. Rahula </strong><br><br><strong>The Buddha's Mission </strong><br><br>Â“The mission of the Buddha was quite unique in its character, and therefore it stands quite apart from the many other religions of the world.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Buddhism will remain unaffected </strong><br><br>Â“The doctrines of Buddha Dhamma stand today, as unaffected by the march of time and the expansion of knowledge as when they were first enunciated.  No matter to what lengths increased scientific knowledge can extend man's mental horizon, within the frame work of the Dhamma there is room for the acceptance and assimilation of further discovery.  It does not rely for its appeal upon limited concepts of primitive minds nor for its power upon the negation of thought.Â”<br><br><strong>Francis Story, "Buddhism as World Religion" </strong><br><br><strong>Joyful religion </strong><br><br>Â“Buddhism is quite opposed to the melancholic, sorrowful, penitent and gloomy attitude of mind which is considered a hindrance to the realization of Truth.  On the other hand, it is interesting to remember here that joy is one of the seven 'Factors of Illumination', the essential qualities to be cultivated for the realization of Nirvana.Â”<br><br><strong>Ven.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No assumption in Buddhism </strong><br><br>Â“It is a glory of Buddhism that it makes intellectual enlightenment an essential condition of salvation.  In Buddhism morality and intellectual enlightenment are inseparable from one another.  While morality forms the basis of the higher life, knowledge and wisdom complete it.  Without a perfect understanding of the law of causality and transformation (Pratityasamutpada), no one can even be said to be truly moral if he does not possess the necessary insight and knowledge.  In this respect Buddhism differs from all other religions.  All monotheistic religions start with certain assumptions, and when these assumptions are contradicted by the growth of knowledge it increase sorrow.  But Buddhism starts with no assumptions.  It stands on the firm rock of facts, and can therefore never shun the dry light of knowledge.Â”<br><strong><br>Prof. Lakhsmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism" </strong><br><br><strong>Buddha has seen deeper than modern idealists </strong><br><br>Â“Gautama got rid of even that shade of a shadow of permanent existence by a metaphysical tour de force of great interest to the student of philosophy, seeing that it supplies the wanting half of Bishop Berkeley's well-known idealist argument.  It is a remarkable indication of the subtlety of Indian speculation that Gautama should have seen deeper than the greatest of modem idealists.  The tendency of enlightened thought of all today all the world over is not towards theology, but philosophy and psychology.  The bark of theological dualism is drifting into danger.  The fundamental principles of evolution and monism are being accepted by the thoughtful.Â”<br><br><strong>Prof. Huxley.  "Evolution And Ethics" </strong><br><br><strong>Religious Revolution </strong><br><br>Â“Twenty-five centuries ago India witnessed an intellectual and religious revolution which culminated in the overthrow of monotheism, priestly selfishness, and the establishment of a synthetic religion, a system of light and thought which was appropriately called Dhamma - Philosophical Religion.Â”<br><br><strong>Anagarika Dharmapala, "The World's Debt to Buddha" </strong><br></div>

The Buddha was interested in the happiness of men.  To him happiness was not possible without leading a pure life based on moral and spiritual principles.  But he knew that leading such a life was hard in unfavourable material and social conditions.<br>Buddhism does not consider material welfare as an end in itself; it is only a means to an end - a higher and nobler end.  But it is a means which is indispensable, indispensable in achieving a higher purpose for man's happiness.  So Buddhism recognizes the need of certain minimum material conditions favourable to spiritual success - even that of a monk engaged in meditation in some solitary place.Â”<br><br><strong>Ven. Dr. W.

Rahula, "What the Buddha Taught" </strong><br><br><strong>A genuine pride </strong><br><br>Â“A religion or a way of life is judged not merely by the truths it proclaims but also by the change that it brings about in the life of its followers.  So far as this test is concerned Buddhism has a record of achievements in which we can take a genuine pride.Â”<br><br><strong>D. Valisinha. General Secretary, Maha Bodhi Society, "Buddhist way of life"</strong><br><br><strong>Unconsciousness </strong><br><br>Â“It can also be said that India discovered the unconsciousness earlier than the Western psychologists.  For them the unconscious consists in the totality of the impressions which slumber in the individual as the inheritance from his previous existence.  The buddhist technique of meditation, which is concerned with the latent forces, is thus a fore-runner of modem psychoanalysis, of autogenic mental training, etc.Â”<br><br><strong>Prof. Von Glasenapp, A.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Five Precepts </strong><br><br>Â“These five precepts, indicate five arterial directions in which the Buddhist self-control is to be exercised.  Thus, the first rule calls upon him to control the passion of anger, the second, the desire for material possessions, the third, the lust of the flesh, the fourth, cowardice and malevolence (the causes of untruthfulness) the fifth, the craving for unwholesome excitement.Â”<br><br><strong>Edmond Holmes, "The Creed of Buddha" </strong><br><br><strong>Man who achieved a great victory </strong><br><br>Â“One of the first scholars to begin the work of translating the Pali Literature into English, was the son of a well-known clergyman.  His object in undertaking the work was to prove the superiority of Christianity over Buddhism.  He failed in this task but he achieved a greater victory than he expected.  He became a Buddhist.  We must never forget the happy chance which prompted him to undertake this work and thereby make the precious Dhamma available to thousands in the West.  The name of this great scholar was Dr. Rhys Davids.Â”<br><br><strong>Ven. A. Mahinda, "Blue Print of Happiness" </strong><br><br><strong>Human destiny </strong><br><br>Â“Over great areas of the world it still survives.  It is possible that in contact with Western science, and inspired by the spirit of history, the original teaching of Gotama, revived and purified, may yet play a large part in the direction of human destiny.Â”<br><br><strong>H.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Parliamentary system borrowed from Buddhism </strong><br><br>Â“It is probable that the tendency towards self government evidenced by these various forms of corporate activity received fresh impetus from the Buddhist rejection of the authority of the priesthood and further but its doctrine of equality as exemplified by its repudiation of caste.  It is indeed to the Buddhist books that we have to turn for an account of the manner in which the affairs of the early examples of representative self-governing institutions were conducted. It may come as a surprise to many to learn that in the assemblies of Buddhists in India 2500 years and more ago are to be found the rudiments of our own parliamentary practice of the present day.<br>The dignity of the assembly was preserved by the appointment of a special officer - the embryo of "Mr. Speaker" in our house of commons.  A second officer was appointed to see that when necessary a quorum was secured - the prototype of the Parliamentary Chief Whip, in our own system.  A member initiating business did so in the form of a motion which was then open to discussion.  In some cases, this was done once only, in others three times, thus anticipating the practice of Parliament in requiring that a bill be read a third time before it becomes law.  If discussion disclosed a difference of opinion the matter was decided by the vote of the majority, the voting being by ballot.Â”<br><br><strong>Marquess of Zetland, former Viceroy of India, "Legacy of India" </strong><br></div>

Words would fail me if I attempted to express how necessary I think knowledge of this high faith and philosophy is to leaven the materialism of the West . . . It is, at all events, a truth which influenced not only the mightiest thinkers of Greece and Rome, but also the beginnings of Christian teachings - which it antedated by five or six hundred years.  It may well claim kindred with all the great faiths, persecuting and opposing none which differ with it, and this for reasons which are easily seen in the teachings themselves. In relation to its noble and scientific austerity no words are needed.<br><br><strong>L. Adam Beck<br>An American Traveler and author</strong><br><br>To the Christian, Love is the highest virtue; to the Buddhist, Wisdom, for they hold that ignorance is the root of all evil. Love, all the same, ranks high ......Tolerance and loving kindness, both based on Buddhist wisdom, are perhaps the chief reason why the middle way of Gotama has come down through 2500 years.<br><br><strong>Sir Charles Bell KCIE, CMG ( 1870-1945)<br>British Diplomat and Lexicographer</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lord Buddha's message of truth, peace, compassion and tolerance is as relevant as it was many centuries ago. The passage of time has made its flame shine with greater luminosity. Rampant materialism and the pursuit of individual success at all costs have eroded the ties of brotherhood and community. In these circumstances, it is necessary to remember and propagate the message of compassion of Lord Buddha so that hatred can be replaced by love, strife by peace and confrontation by co-operation.<br><br><strong>Dr. Amadou-Mahtar M 'Bow<br>Director - General, UNESCO</strong><br><br>The only one of the great religions which makes any appeal to me is Buddhism; and that, as I understand it, is rather a philosophy of the world, and a way of life for the elite founded upon it, than a religion in the ordinary sense of the word.<br><br><strong>C D Broad (1887-1971) British Philosopher</strong><br><br>The recent evolution of man certainly begins with the advancing development of the hand, and the selection of a brain, which is particularly adept at manipulating the hand. We feel the pleasure of that in our actions, so that for the artist the hand remains a major symbol; the hand of the Buddha, for instance, giving man the gift of humanity in a gesture of calm, the gift of fearlessness.<br><br><strong>J.Bronowski (1908-1974)<br>American Author and Philosopher of Science</strong><br><br></div>
