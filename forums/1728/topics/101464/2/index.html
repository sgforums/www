            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the Westerner who first approaches the Buddha's teachings be accustomed to modern scientific or to Christian terminology, he should always bear in mind that the Buddha was not interested in the existence or non-existence of a Supreme Being or any other abstract philosophical proposition. He was interested only in the Way, the practical way, by which suffering may be ended, both here and hereafter.<br><br><strong>Marie B. Byles (1900-1979)<br>Australian author and mountaineer</strong><br><br>Buddha's message of compassion and devotion to the service of humanity is more relevant today than at any other time in history. Peace, understanding and a vision that transcends purely national boundaries are imperatives of our insecure nuclear age.<br><br><strong>Javier Perez De Cuellar<br>Peruvian Diplomat from 1982 and  Secretary General of United Nation</strong><br><br>It cannot be denied that there is a real beauty of an Oriental kind in the various expressions which the Buddhists use; and that there was real grounds for the enthusiasm which gave them birth. Never in the history of the world had such a scheme been put forth, so free from any superhuman agency, so independent of so even antagonistic to the belief in a soul, the belief in God, and the hope of a future life...<br><br>Whether these be right or wrong, it was a turning point in the religious history of man when a reformer, full of the most earnest moral purpose and trained in all the intellectual culture of his time, put forth deliberately, and with a knowledge of the opposing views the doctrine of salvation to be found here, in this life, in an inward change of heart, to be brought about by perseverance in a mere system of self culture and self control.<br><br>Buddhist or non-Buddhist, I have examined every one of the great religious systems, of the world, in none of them I have found anything to surpass, in beauty and comprehensiveness, the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Truths of the Buddha.<br><br><strong>Prof. T.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like the other teachers of his time, Buddha' taught through conversation, lecturers and parables. Since it never occurred to him, any more than Socrates or Christ, to put his doctrine into writing, he summarised it in sutras (threads) designed to prompt the memory.<br><br>As preserved for us in the remembrance of his followers these discourses unconsciously portray for us the first distinct character of India's history: a man of strong will, authoritative and proud, but of gentle manner and speech, and of infinite benevolence. He claimed enlightenment but not inspiration; he never pretended that a god was speaking through him. In controversy he was more patient and considerate than any other of the great teachers of mankind.<br><br>Like Lao-tze and Christ he wished to return good for evil, love for hate; and he remained silent under misunderstanding and abuse . . . Unlike most saints, Buddha has a sense of humour, and knew that metaphysics without laughter is immodesty.<br><br><strong>Will Durant (1885-1 981)<br>American Historian and Pulitzer Prize Winner</strong><br><br>The individual feels the nothingness of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvellous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought. He looks upon individual existence as a sort of prison and wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole, the beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear in early stages of development - e.g. in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets.<br><br>Buddhism, as we have learnt from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer especially, contains much stronger elements of it. The religion of the future will he a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should he based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism.<br><br><strong>Albert Einstein (1879-1955) German physicist, mathematician.<br>Winner of the Nobel Prize</strong><br><br>But Eliot's attraction to Buddhism was not simply a philosophical one. Nirvana is extinction* the annihilation of desire, the freedom from attachments - and there was, as can he seen from his poetry, an over-riding desire in the young Eliot to be free.<br><br>The absolutism of Buddhism is quite as relentless as anything he had found in Maurras and, although he was perhaps attracted to it for much the same reasons, the Eastern religion had more romantic affiliations for someone who wished to break free from the familial bonds which otherwise held him.<br><br><strong>Peter Ackrayd's comments on English poet T.

            <div class='col-md body'>At the back of the shrine outside the temple, grows the sacred tree under which, or rather the ancestor of which, Buddha sat. Squares of gold leaf have been stuck on to the trunk and boughs. The temple, together with several acres of garden full of trees and flowers and votive stones, chapels, hells, and statues, lies on a deep courtyard below the level of the surrounding country. The view when one drives up and sees everything suddenly from the edge of the embankment is, as the books say, 'not easily forgotten'. There can't be anything like it in the world.<br><br><strong>E.M. Forster (1879-1970)  British novelist</strong><br><br>Man gave up the illusion of a fatherly God as a parental helper - but he gave up also the true aims of all great humanistic religions: overcoming the limitations of an egotistical self, achieving love, objectivity, and humility and respecting life so that the aim of life is living itself, and man becomes what he potentially is. These were the aims of the great Western religions, as they were the aims of the great Eastern religions.<br><br>The East, however, was not burdened with the concept of a transcendent father - saviour in which the monotheistic religions expressed their longings. Taoism and Buddhism had a rationality and realism superior to that of Western religions. They could see man realistically and objectively, having nobody but the 'awakened' ones to guide him, and being able to he guided because each man has within himself the capacity to awake and be enlightened. This is precisely the reason why Eastern religious thought, Taoism and Buddhism - and their blending in Zen Buddhism* assume such importance for the West today.<br><br>Zen Buddhism helps man to find an answer to the question of his existence, an answer which is essentially the same as that given in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, and yet which does not contradict the rationality, realism, and independence which are modern man's precious achievements. Paradoxically, Eastern religious thought turns out to be more congenial to Western rational thought than does Western religious thought itself.<br><br><strong>Erich Fromm (1900-1980)<br>German American Psychoanalyst and Social Philosopher </strong><br><br>There may be a great significance in the fact that Pythagoras in Greece and the Buddha in the Orient occur at the same time in the sixth century B.C. Both are powerfully, perceptively thinking and acting human individuals who, coming out of a past in which only mystically ordained kings counted and humans were omniexpendable pawns, produced mathematical tools and philosophis forever thereafter to employ.<br><br><strong>R.Buckminster Fuller (1895-1984)<br>American Inventor, Social Engineer and Philosopher</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no hesitation in declaring that I owe a great deal to the inspiration that I have derived from the life of the Enlightenment One. Asia has a message for the whole world, if only it would live up to it. There is the imprint of Buddhistic influence on the whole of Asia, which includes India, China, Japan, Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay States. For Asia to be not for Asia but for the whole world, it has to re-learn the message of the Buddha and deliver it to the whole world. His love, his boundless love went out as much to the lower animal, to the lowest life as to human beings. And he insisted upon purity of life.<br><br><strong>Mahama Gandhi ( 1869-1948 )<br>Indian Thinker and Apostle of Non Violence</strong><br><br>It was when I was up at Oxford in the early 1970's that I became interested in Buddhism. My life was full of confusion and distress of every kind, and I found in Buddhist philosophy a way of thought that enthralled me by its calm and radical analysis of desire, its rejection of all the self-dramatisiting intensities by which I lived, and its promise of a possible strong and unsentimental sincerity.<br><br><strong>Andrew Harvey British author, poet and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford</strong><br><br>I left India and returned to Colombo, where I was the guest of a Singhalese student I knew in Perth. They were Buddhists, their house was in the grounds of a temple, and the atmosphere of the household was very peaceful and unbelievably gentle. I talked a lot about Buddhism with them, and they took me up to a temple in the hills, in Kandy, where I met the monks and talked to a very old abbot, who explained more about Buddhism to me. found Buddhism fascinating. Their concept that you progress towards the Ineffable through a number of existences seemed to me much more intellectually satisfying than the Christian belief that you come just once and are cast into circumstances maybe of great wealth or of great moment, but that you come to God or don't come to God on the basis of that one life. The logical attraction of Buddhism after the devastating experience of India was a further part of my breaking down. I was never on the point of embracing Buddhism but I found, and still find, it infinitely more satisfying than the Judeo-Christian philosophy.<br><br><strong>Robert J.

            <div class='col-md body'>Now in this realm Buddha's speeches are a source and mine of quite unparalleled richness and depth. As soon as we cease to regard Buddha's teachings simply intellectually and acquiesce with a certain sympathy in the age-old Eastern concept of unity, if we allow Buddha to speak to us as vision, as image, as the awakened one, the perfect one, we find him, almost independently of the philosophic content and dogmatic kernel of his teachings, a great prototype of mankind. Whoever attentively reads a small number of the countless speeches of Buddha is soon aware of harmony in them, a quietude of soul, a smiling transcendence, a totally unshakeable firmness, but also invariable kindness, endless patience. As ways and means to the attainment of this holy quietude of soul, the speeches are full of advice, precepts, hints.<br><br>The intellectual content of Buddha's teaching is only half his work, the other half is his life, his life as lived, as labour accomplished and action carried out. A training, a spiritual self training of the highest order was accomplished and is taught here, a training about which unthinking people who talk about "quietism" and "Hindu dreaminess" and the like in connection with Buddha have no conception; they deny him the cardinal Western virtue of activity. Instead Buddha accomplished a training for himself and his pupils, exercised a discipline, set up a goal, and produced results before which even the genuine heroes of European action can only feel awe.<br><br><strong>Herman Hesse (1877-1962)<br>German author and winner of the Nobel Prize </strong><br><br>The more I studied satipathana*, the more impressed I became with it as a system of mind training. It is in line with our Western scientific attitude of mind in that it is unprejudiced, objective and analytical. It relies on personal, direct experience, and not on anyone else's ideas or opinions. It is exceedingly simple and makes use of 'bare attention' basically as simple as a sustained 'ah look' but within a carefully chosen and disciplined system. It therefore explores all premature judgements, all talking 'about it and about,' all arguments, discussions and such waste of time as we in the West are inclined to be fond of. In fact, it gets you out of the rut and bondage of yourself, your prejudices, your clichÃ©s, your blindness and your self-opinionatedness, to set you free to see and prove a real world .<br><br><strong>Dr E. Graham Howe MB. BS. DPM.<br>Eminent British Physician</strong><br><br>The way of Buddhism is Middle Way between all extremes. This is no weak compromise, but a sweet reasonableness which avoids fanaticism and laziness with equal care, and marches onward without that haste which brings its own reaction, but without ceasing. The Buddha called it the Noble Eightfold Path to Nirvana, and it may be regarded as the noblest course of spiritual training yet presented, in such a simple form, to man. Buddhism is neither pessimistic nor 'escapist'. It is a system of thought, a religion, a spiritual science and a way of life which is reasonable, practical and all-embracing. For 2,500 years it has satisfied the spiritual needs of nearly one third of mankind. It appeals to those in search of truth because it has no dogmas, satisfies the reason and the heart alike, insists on self-reliance coupled with tolerance for other points of view, embraces science, religion, philosophy, psychology, mysticism, ethics and art, and points to man alone as the creator of his present life and sole designer of his destiny<br><br><strong>Justice Christmas Humphreys (1901-1983)<br>Eminent British Judge </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is much less a matter of organized and institutional orthodoxy than a state of mind. Buddhism does not aim directly at theological salvation but a total clarification of consciousness. It is not so much a way of worshipping as a way of being. Exterior cultural accretions are much less important than they may seem, and the Buddhist cultural awareness is endowed with mercury like formlessness, which erodes the statistical eye of the Western scholar.<br><br><strong>Father Thomas Merton (1915-196<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>American Catholic Priest, Author and Social Crtics</strong><br><br>Of all the great religious teachers of the world, none has incarnated and lived the idea that ultimate reality is beyond the grasp of the ordinary mind with such purity and concentration as the Buddha. This, in part, explains why the Buddha's discourses say nothing about the existence of a Supreme Being, for example, or about immortality . . Its strategy of negation has misled many Westerners into thinking Buddhism is pessimistic and anti-life. Some have even thought of Nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhist discipline, as a sort of spiritual suicide. Nothing could be further from the truth and, in fact, there is no religion which has a higher estimation of human possibility.<br><br><strong>Prof. Jacob Needleman Scholar,<br>Author and Professor for philosophy at San Francisco State College</strong><br><br>Whenever one thinks of the Buddha, one inevitably thinks of His great teaching; and I often feel that, perhaps, if we think more of that basic teaching of the avoidance of hatred and violence, we may be nearer the solution to our problem. In this world of storm and strife, hatred and violence, the message of the Buddha shines like a radiant sun: Perhaps at no time was that message more needed than in this world of the atomic and hydrogen bombs . . . Let us remember that immortal message and try to fashion our thoughts and actions in the light of that teaching . . . and help a little in prompting right thinking and right action. . . . If any question has to be considered, it has to be considered peacefully and democratically in the way taught by the Buddha.<br><br><strong>Jawaharlal Nehru  (1889-1964)<br>Indian Prime Minister</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here it is grasped that one must not hate even evil, that one must not oppose it, that  one not hate even oneself; that one should not merely acquiesce in the suffering that such a way of lie entails, that one should live entirely in positive feelings, that one should take the side of one's opponent in word and deed, that and through a supersfetation of the peaceable, good natured conciliatory, helpful ad loving states one impoverishes the soil in this standpoint is possible only when no moral fanaticism prevails, i.e. when evil is hated, not for its own sake, but only  because it opens the way to states that are harmful to us ( unrest, work, care, entanglements, dependence).<br><br>This is a Buddhist standpoint : here is sin is not hated, there the concept  in lacjking. Buddhism is hundred times more realistic than other religions. It has entered upon the inheritance of objectively and coolly putting up with problems. It came to life after several hundred years of philosophical development. The notion of God is done away with as soon as it appears, prayer is out of the question. So is asceticism. No categorical imperative. No coercion at all, not even within the monastic community. Hence it also does not challenge to fight against those of different faiths. its teaching turns against nothing so impressively as against the feeling of revengefulness, animosity and resentment.<br><br><strong>Frederick Nietszche (1884-1900)<br>German philosopher</strong><br><br>If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.<br><br><strong>J Robert Oppenheimer ( 1904-1967)<br>American Physician</strong><br><br>Anyone from a king to a barber who wished to listen to the Buddha's teachings, or follow him in his missionary wanderings, or join the Sangha, the formal fellowship of Buddhist disciples, was free to do so. Even women, after some hesitation were admitted to the Sangha, whose establishment is often counted as one of the Buddha's most practical achievements, in large measure responsible for the eventual spread and continuity of Buddhist doctrine in the Asian world. The founding of an Order appears also to illustrate still further the Buddha's psychological acumen, for though he taught that each human being must trend the path to "awakening" or "deliverance" alone, he also realized what sustainment there could be in daily association with others working towards a common goal. Of the establishment of the Buddhist Sangha, Arnold Toynbee has said that it was a greater social achievement than the founding of the Platonist academy in Greece.<br><br><strong>Nancy Wilson Ross (1901-1986)<br>American Journalist, War Correspondent and Author.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of the great religions of history I prefer Buddhism, especially in its earliest forms, because it has had the smallest element of persecution.  Buddhism is a combination of both speculative and scientific philosophy. It advocates the Scientific Method and pursues that to a finality that may be called Rationalistic. In it are to be found answers to such question of interest as "What is mind and matter? Of them which is of great importance? Is the universe moving towards a goal?<br><br>What is man's position? Is there living that is noble?" It takes up where science cannot lead because of the limitations of the latter's instruments. Its conquests are those of the mind.  I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some people known to history. I think I should put Buddha and Socrates above him in those respects.<br><br><strong>Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) British Mathematician, Philosopher,<br>Author and Social Critic</strong><br><br>We find the doctrine of metempsychosis, springing from the earliest and noblest ages of the human race, always spread abroad in the earth as the belief of the great majority of mankind, nay, really as the teachings of all religions with the exception of that of the Jews and the two which have preceded from it: in the most subtle form, however, and coming nearest to the truth, as has already been mentioned, in Buddhism. It almost seems that, as the oldest languages are the most perfect so also are the oldest religions. If I were to take the results of my philosophy as a yardstick of the truth, I would concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence of all religions of the world<br><br><strong>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)<br>German philosopher</strong><br><br>While the materialist is mainly interested in goods, the Buddhist is mainly interested in liberation. But Buddhism is 'The Middle Way' and therefore in no way antagonistic to physical well-being. It is not wealth that stands in the way of liberation but the attachment to wealth; not the enjoyment of pleasurable things but the craving for them.<br><br>The keynote of Buddhist economics, therefore, is simplicity and non-violence. From an economist's point of view, the marvel of the Buddhist way of life is the utter rationality of its pattern amazingly small means leading to extraordinarily satisfactory results.<br><br>It is in the light of both immediate experience and long term prospects that the study of Buddhism economics could be recommended even to those who believe that economic growth is more important than any spiritual or religous values.<br><br>For it not a question of choosing between "modern growth" and "traditional stagnation". It is a question of finding the right path of development, theMiddle Way between materialist heedlessness and traditonalist immobility, in short, of finding 'Right Livelihood'.<br><br><strong>Dr E.

            <div class='col-md body'>I ever believe that the mark of a truly educated and imaginative person facing the twenty-first century is that he feels himself to be a planetary being. Perhaps my own Buddhist upbringing has helped me more than anything else to realize and to express in my speeches and writings this concept of world citizenship. As a Buddhist, I was trained to be tolerant of everything except intolerance. I was brought up not only to develop the spirit of tolerance, but also to cherish moral and spiritual qualities, especially modesty, humanity, compassion, and, most important, to attain a certain degree of emotional equilibrium.<br><br><strong>U Thant (1910- 1974) Burmese Educator,<br>Diplomat and Secretary General of the United Nations </strong><br><br>I know that some will have hard thoughts of me, when they hear their Christ named beside my Buddha.

            <div class='col-md body'>The period between the seventh and fifth century BC, was a time of spiritual searching throughout the ancient world. It saw the beginning of Greek philosophy, the rise of the prophets of Israel, Confucius in China and (according to Parsi tradition) the time of Zoroaster in Persia. This period saw the birth of the Jain and Ajivika teachings, with the greatest of all, 'the Light of Asia' Gautama the Buddha . . . A doctrine of annihilation* in which an omnipotent God has no place, might seem one of profound pessimism, yet Buddhism was saved from being negative by the emphasis placed on free-will and humility. The importance of compassion, of charity and alms giving, all combined to generate a religion of warmth and love. Together with Jainism, Buddhism helped to create a revolutionary concept, that of 'ahimsa' or harmlessness; the idea of respect for others which evolves from a self-respect. *Annihilation of greed, hatred and delusion.<br><br><strong>Prof. Hugh Tinker  Professor of government and<br>politics at the school of Orient and African Studies, London University</strong><br><br>In divining that, the experience of pain was an inseparable concomitant of consciousness and will, the Buddha has shown a penetrating psychological insight.   Hinduism regards man's universe as being an illusion; the Buddha anticipating some of the schools of the modern Western psychologists by about twenty-four centuries, held that the soul is an illusion too.<br><br><strong>Arnold Toynbee (1889-1 975) British historian</strong><br><br>Rightly or wrongly - and here I am not defining a thesis, I am only describing the state of mind of a Victorian girl in her teens, the Buddha and his philosophy seemed logically and ethically superior to the Christ and the teachings of the New Testament. Further, Buddhist metaphysics had at least a superficial likeness to the philosophy of modern science. The agnosticism of Buddha as to an ultimate cause was even more complete than that of Herbert Spencer. Unlike the crude eternal bliss and eternal damnation of the Christian Church, the doctrine of Karma seemed in harmony with such assumptions of modern science as the universality of causation and the persistence of force.<br><br><strong>Beatrice Webb (1881-1943) British social reformer,<br>Economist and Fabian Socialist.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is the most colossal example in the history of applied metaphysics.<br><br><strong>Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947)<br>British mathematician and philosopher</strong><br><br>It was because he showed in his life what he taught was both practical and reasonable that he exerted such a mighty influence upon mankind. He sought to put a new temper into men, to imbue them with a new spirit, give that a new heart. It was more than could be achieved in only 2,500 years. But mankind is still young and impressionable. The impression Buddha made was deep. Reinforced by like impressions made in different ways by other religious leaders it will surely work itself out and its effects be felt in ever increasing degree. The heart of men will indeed be cleansed. From the joy in that heart will spring compassion fixed in an instant in the race. All hardness will be melted - conflict turned to composure.<br><br><strong>Sir Francis Younghusband (1863-1942)<br>British explorer, geographer and dipolmat.</strong><br><br>Buddhism has conquered China as a philosophy and as a religion, as a philosophy for the scholars and a religion for the common people. Whereas Confucianism has only a philosophy of moral conduct, Buddhism possesses a logical method, a metaphysics and a theory of knowledge. Besides, it is fortunate in having a high tradition of scholarship in the translation of Buddhist classics, and the language of these translations, so succinct and often so distinguished by a beautiful lucidity of language and reasoning, cannot but attract the scholar with a philosophical bias. Hence, Buddhism has always enjoyed a prestige among Chinese scholars, which so far Christianity has failed to achieve.<br><br><strong>Lin Yutang (1895-1976) Chinese writer,thinker, journalist and playwright </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok last one, by the person who put together these quotes. Happy Deepavali to all.<br><br><strong>Venerable Shrasvasti Dhammika</strong> is a Distinguished Lecturer and Buddhist Monk from Australia. He has spoken on Buddhism and Asian religions in universities and on television and radio in Australia and throughout Asia<br><br>Famous People comment on The Buddha and His Teachings<br>By Ven. S. Dhammika<br>Published By The Buddha Dhamma Mandala Society<br>ISBN 981-00-0332-3<br>Fifth Edition 1991<br><br><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong><br><br>Anyone who is considering changing their religion, or adopting a religion for the first time is about to do something that may have a profound effect upon their life. It is not the sort of thing that should be done in a rush, nor should it be done under the influence of heightened emotions. If the truth is to be discovered time must be taken, all the facts must be examined and questions must he asked and different points of view considered. We try to do all this before making most important decisions in our life, so why shouldn't we do it before making the most important decision in our life - that concerning our religious convictions?<br><br>To blindly and unquestionably accept the opinions of others would, be foolish but to neglect their opinions altogether would he foolish also. The insights and experiences of others, especially the wise, may help us deepen our understanding and put us in a better position to make the right choice. With the increased knowledge of Buddhism in the last hundred years a large number of Western intellectuals, including many Nobel Prize winners, have expressed a deep interest in and admiration for this ancient religion. A small but growing number are actually becoming Buddhists.<br><br>Some have been impressed by Buddhism's clear, rational thought, others by its gentle tolerance. Some have been surprised by how closely it resembles the discoveries of modern science while others have been attracted by its idea of an ethical life without the need to believe in a supreme god. The quotations collected in this booklet are of interest for several reasons.<br><br>Firstly, they show the universal appeal of Buddhism, its ability to speak to psychologist and poet, philosopher and mathematician. Is it not telling that the words of a man who lived so long ago could still he relevant and meaningful to a scientist like Einstein, a poet like Eliot or a philosopher like Russell? Again, they tell us as much about the people who wrote them as they do about Buddhism itself.<br><br>We read what some of the great minds of our time have to say about the Buddhist concept of detachment and love, about the rational element in Buddhism and about the Buddha's place in human history. They compare Buddhism with other religions, highlight its emphasis on reason and tell us how it may influence modern psychology. It is hoped that what is said in this booklet and who said it will motivate the reader to look deeper into the teachings of the Buddha, and, if intellectual satisfaction results, put its principles into practice.<br><br>As the Buddha himself says:<br><br><strong>When you yourself know:<br>'These things are good; these things are not blameable;<br>These things are praised by the wise;<br>Undertaken and observed,<br>These things lead to your welfare and happiness',<br>Then enter upon and abide in them. </strong><br><br></div>
