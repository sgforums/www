                            vegetarians, He strongly encouraged us to be. In the Bodhisattva 
                            practice of minimising harm to all beings and benefiting them as 
                            much as possible, the practice of vegetarianism as far as possible 
                            plays an essential role. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">We 
                            can see this in many of the Buddha's recorded teachings.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><br> </span></p>

                            beings." <br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000cc; font-size: x-small;"><strong> -King Asoka's Edicts </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">All true practitioners 
                            of the Bodhisattva path eventually relinquish meat-eating. In His 
                            previous lives, the Buddha as a Bodhisattva would rather cut His 
                            own flesh to feed an eagle than let it eat a smaller bird. All advanced 
                            practising Bodhisattvas are thus necessarily vegetarians, since 
                            they cannot bear the pain of sentient beings.<br> <br> While nothing we eat makes us impure, our choice of diet is an action 
                            with implications. If our choice of diet arises from greed, sustaining 
                            the greed obviously makes us impure.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>If being vegetarian is so important on the Bodhisattva path, <br> why was the Buddha not one?</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Buddha and 
                            the Sangha in His time were not total vegetarians as they consumed 
                            alms food offered by lay followers, whom they encountered “randomly” 
                            from place to place. Though the Buddha never requested specific 
                            food to be offered, He spoke against the intentional acquiring of 
                            meat for Him and the Sangha. In this way, the Buddha neither directly 
                            nor indirectly cause the death of any being for His food. On the 
                            other hand, we have the freedom of the choice of our diet, since 
                            we do not eat alms food. Why not make the kinder and wiser decision?<br> <br> <strong>Can’t I be a good Buddhist who is not vegetarian?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Of course we 
                            can. One who eats meat can cultivate a pure heart just as one who 
                            is vegetarian might have an impure heart. But why not cultivate 
                            a pure heart while making the extra effort to further the practice 
                            of Compassion by being vegetarian? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>*But didn’t the Buddha say there is pure meat?</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Buddha advised 
                            monks that meat should only be accepted when certain conditions 
                            are met. Meat may be eaten by one who does (1) not see, (2) hear 
                            of, (3) or doubt about the animal having been killed purposely for 
                            him to eat, (4) but is certain that it either died naturally, (5) 
                            or that its flesh had been abandoned by birds of prey.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>Isn’t meat from the markets and restaurants considered pure meat?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">No, because 
                            demand creates supply. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once, a disciple 
                            of the Buddha asked a man why he kept buying meat. The man replied 
                            that he did so since the meat-seller kept selling meat. When the 
                            meat-seller was asked why he kept selling meat, he replied that 
                            he did so since the man kept buying from him. When the Buddha was 
                            consulted as to who was the unskillful (in Compassion and Wisdom) 
                            one, He replied that both were unskillful.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Supply and demand 
                            is an obvious vicious cycle. The whole universe of meat eating and 
                            animal slaughtering is an intricate web of interdependence, of related 
                            cause and effect. When we buy meat, we play a part in the circle 
                            of life and death of other beings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>What is real pure meat then?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Here are some 
                            forms of meat that can be considered pure meat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. Meat ordered

                            at least 16 hours <br>     (The number of hours is to ensure the consciousness 
                            has left the body).<br> 4. Meat from random alms rounds as practised in the Buddhist tradition.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yes. However, 
                            plant life is not sentient life- they are not beings with reason 
                            and emotion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>Doesn’t growing vegetables kill many insects too?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This is not 
                            true if we choose organic food, which are grown without the use 
                            of pesticides (which can be harmful to humans too). In comparison 
                            to eating non-organic vegetables, pesticides are used fifty times 
                            more when we eat meat- to kill pests to produce animal feed. It 
                            takes ten kilos of vegetable protein to produce only one kilo of 
                            animal protein!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Much of our 
                            daily products also involve animals- such as leather shoes, milk 
                            from cows, honey from bees, soap from animal fat, drugs with animal 
                            serum (that might be tested on animals)… However, there are 
                            many new products today that are free from animal derivatives. Given 
                            more choice, we are at liberty to make wiser decisions on how to 
                            live life in a more harmless way. Consider becoming a vegan! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Despite all 
                            we can do, merely to live is to deprive other beings of their food, 
                            habitat and/ or life to a certain extent. Therefore, Buddhists practising 
                            the Bodhisattva path should do all they can in their ability to 
                            avoid killing, and to protect life instead. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>Can you further convince me to be a vegetarian?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Here are some 
                            good reasons to be a vegetarian.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. Personal 
                            well-being- No disease can come from a balanced vegetarian diet. 
                            Medical proof states that all kinds of diseases can spring from 
                            meat-eating, while having a vegetarian diet can not only prevent, 
                            but help cure many diseases. Our body constitution is also not designed 
                            for meat digestion. For example, our teeth and intestine structure 
                            are virtually identical to that of herbivorous, not carnivorous 
                            animals. Eating animals which die in great fear and hatred, we devour 
                            along their toxins of fear and hatred, which affects both our spiritual 
                            and physical health.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2. Well-being 
                            of animals- Animals live imprisoned and tortured lives before the 
                            final horror of being slaughtered. While alive, they suffer from 
                            overcrowding, castration and countless other cruelties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3. Well-being 
                            of the environment- Animal-rearing depletes the Earth’s resources 
                            of energy, land, crops and water. It also creates large amounts 
                            of harmful animal sewage and greenhouse gases..</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">4. Well-being 
                            of fellow humans- More than two-thirds of the Earth’s cropland 
                            is used for cultivating animal feed for animals to be slaughtered 
                            as meat. No human starvation would exist if animal rearing for the 
                            rich meat-consumers was lessened, converting the crops as food for 
                            citizens of the Third World Countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">5. Peace on 
                            Earth- Wars, racial riots and other forms of related human unrest 
                            are collective karmic results of generated hatred when group-slaughtered 
                            animals, which die in great fear and hatred, are reborn as humans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000cc; font-size: x-small;">“For 
                            hundreds of thousands of years<br> the stew in the pot has brewed hatred and resentment<br> that is difficult to stop.<br> If you wish to know why there are disasters of armies and weapons 
                            in the world,<br> listen to the piteous cries from the slaughterhouse at midnight.”</span></p>

                            Chinese Verse translated by Gold Mountain Monastery Staff</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">6. All beings 
                            have at one point or another been reborn as our kin. The practice 
                            of vegetarianism is thus the practice of filial piety. It is the 
                            practice of the Loving-kindness, Compassion and Equanimity to all 
                            beings, recognising that they have Buddha Nature (the potential 
                            to become Buddhas) like us.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>What if vegetarian food is hard to find?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another reason 
                            why the Buddha never made vegetarianism a compulsory rule is His 
                            understanding that the living and karmic conditions of different 
                            people are different. For example, it would be downright impossible 
                            for all Tibetan Buddhists to have vegetarian diets when Tibet can 
                            hardly grow vegetables. However, at least three major Tibetan monasteries 
                            have become totally vegetarian today with the aid of imported food. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What happens 
                            if you cannot find vegetarian food readily? Does it mean you have 
                            no choice but to eat meat? Think again carefully... the path of 
                            Compassion is not always easy to tread. It involves making many 
                            sacrifices. Being a committed vegetarian might mean having to go 
                            the extra mile to get vegetarian food. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Did 
                            you know the Buddha is a vegetarian at heart?</strong><br> <br> The Buddha remarked that the meat He consumed in His entire life 
                            was manifested by His great compassion and psychic powers. That 
                            is to say, not only does the meat in theory already exist as pure 
                            meat, it isn’t even real meat! In other words, the Buddha was 
                            a full vegetarian at heart!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is worth 
                            mentioning that the Buddha did not die from eating meat (poisoned 
                            or putrid pork), as it is so often mistaken. His last meal consisted 
                            of "sukara-maddava"- which is correctly translated to 
                            be (1) a pig's soft food, ie. food eaten by pigs, (2) "pig's 
                            delight," ie. a favourite food of pigs, (3) "pig-pounded," 
                            ie., food trampled by pigs. It was actually a kind of mushroom called 
                            truffles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Why 
                            do some well-known practitioners not vegetarian?</strong><br> <br> Some of these practitoners are advanced practising Bodhisattva, 
                            who eat meat out of skillful means and compassion to benefit more 
                            beings indirectly. In fact, they might even be enlightened beings 
                            who are able to manifest "fake" meat like the Buddha. 
                            If one wishes to follow the practices of these masters, one has 
                            to be sure of one's motivation. If it is not compassion and wisdom, 
                            it is greed and ignorance at play- nothing other than selfish rationalisation. 
                            <br> <br> It is also a mistake to think that by eating meat, one will generate 
                            a karmic Dharma connection with the deceased being, so as to help 
                            it in future. These beings would rather us to connect with them 
                            while alive- not when they are on your dinner plate! <br> <br> On a related note, animal liberation (life-releasing) is easily 
                            practised when we practise vegetarianism- which is simply liberating 
                            animals from our dinner table. If one thinks carefully, it is actually 
                            spiritually hypocritical to liberate animals from captivity when 
                            we eat them. This is especially so when animal liberation is at 
                            times done in an ignorant random manner, endangering environmental 
                            balance, the animals themselves and other animals.</span></p>

                            were open and flexible on this subject, and each practitioner has

                            why are you putting off vegetarianism when it so obviously has all 
                            the plus points? Is it due to plain greed for the taste of meat? 
                            If you want to be sure you are not vegetarian not because of greed, 
                            the best solution is to be vegetarian and prove it to yourself.

                            Buddhist-<br> His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama (1989 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate):</strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;">In
              the mid 1960s, the Dalai Lama was impressed by ethically vegetarian
              Indian monks and adopted a vegetarian diet for about a year and a half.
              Apparently he consumed primarily nuts and milk. Unfortunately, he
              contracted Hepatitis B and his liver was seriously damaged. For health
              reasons, he was advised by his personal physicians to consume meat.
              While he has eaten meat in moderation ever since, the Dalai Lama has
              repeatedly acknowledged that a vegetarian diet is a worthy expression
              of compassion and contributes to the cessation of the suffering of all
              living beings. However, he eats meat only on alternate days (six months
              a year). He is a semi-vegetarian, though he wishes to be a full one. By
              making an example of cutting his meat consumption in half, he is trying
              to gently influence his followers. <br> <br> "While many of the great Tibetan teachers did and do eat animals, the
              Dalai Lama has broken new ground by publicly stating his case for
              vegetarianism. If we seriously consider the compassion inherent in His
              Holiness’ advice and actions, Buddhist meat-eaters could similarly try
              to eat vegetarian at least every other day to start out with. Since
              Buddhists have taken vows not to kill, they should not support a
              livelihood that makes others kill. Even if one does not have great
              compassion for animals this would meritoriously save humans from
              performing heinous deeds. The power of each human being becoming
              vegetarian releases the most intense suffering of the animal realm—the
              agony of factory-farmed animals. This profound action can help slow the
              grinding wheels of samsara, bringing to a halt the cycles of suffering
              of the entire animal realm and influencing their eventual liberation.
              When animals are not just looked upon as creatures to fill our
              stomachs, they can be seen as they really are—beings who have the same
              Buddha nature as we all do."<br> <br> - <a href="http://www.serv-online.org/Eileen-Weintraub.htm">http://www.serv-online.org/Eileen-Weintraub.htm</a> <br> <br> "This Thanksgiving, staff of the Fund for Animals are thanking 
                            the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, for recent 
                            statements in support of animal rights. In an audience with representatives 
                            of The Fund for Animals earlier this month, the Dalai Lama commended 
                            the animal rights movement for working to end the suffering of animals, 
                            and urged everyone who can to adopt a vegetarian diet. Speaking 
                            with The Fund for Animals' national director, Heidi Prescott, and 
                            program coordinator, Norm Phelps, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize recipient 
                            said, "People think of animals as if they were vegetables, 
                            and that isn't right. We have to change the way people think about 
                            animals. I encourage the Tibetan people and all people to move toward 
                            a vegetarian diet that doesn't cause suffering." His Holiness 
                            also condemned the abuse and killing of animals for entertainment 
                            purposes, such as the practice of hunting wild animals for sport. 
                            The Dalai Lama invited the Fund for Animals to work with his government 
                            in exile in India to help encourage people to become vegetarian 
                            and to protect animals from suffering." <br> <br> <strong>-AmeriScan: November 25, 1998</strong><br> <br> "According to Buddhist teaching, there is a very close interdependence 
                            between the natural environment and the sentient beings living in 
                            it. Some of my friends have told me that basic human nature is somewhat 
                            violent, but I have told them I disagree. If we examine different 
                            animals, such as tigers or lions, we learn that their basic nature 
                            provides them with sharp fangs and claws. Peaceful animals, such 
                            as deer, which are completely vegetarian, are more gentle and have 
                            smaller teeth and no claws. From that viewpoint we human beings 
                            have a nonviolent nature." <br> <br> <strong>-Ecology and the Human Heart</strong><br> <br> "Whenever I visit a market and see the chickens crowded together 
                            in tiny cages that give them no room to move around and spread their 
                            wings and the fish slowly drowning in the air, my heart goes out 
                            to them. People have to learn to think about animals in a different 
                            way, as sentient beings who love life and fear death. I urge everyone 
                            who can to adopt a compassionate vegetarian diet." <br> <br> <strong>-In an audience granted to Norm Phelps and Heidi Prescott <br>   of The Fund for Animals, Washington, D.C., November 10, 1998</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000cc; font-size: x-small;">"One day I went 
                            to visit a small lake to offer food to the fish that we had previously 
                            freed there. On my way back someone said, "By the way, did 
                            you see the poultry farm?" All of a sudden I had a vision where 
                            I saw large groups of chickens marching along carrying banners on 
                            which it was written, "The Dalai Lama not only saves fish, 
                            but even feeds them. What does he do for us poor chickens?" 
                            I felt terribly sad and sorry for the chickens . . . We no longer 
                            raise poultry in our settlements."<br> <br> <strong>-The Dalai Lama, in Imagine All the People: A Conversation with

              human diet when there are so many substitutes. After all, man can live
              without meat. It is only some carnivorous animals that have to subsist
              on flesh. Killing animals for sport, for pleasure, for adventures, and
              for hides and furs is a phenomenon which is at once disgusting and
              distressing. There is no justification in indulging in such acts of
              brutality. <br> <br> In our approach to life, be it pragmatic or otherwise, the ultimate
              truth that confronts us squarely and unmistakably is the desire for
              peace, security and happiness. Different forms of life in different
              aspects of existence make up the teeming denizens of this earth of
              ours. And, no matter whether they belong to the higher group as human
              beings or to the lower group, the animals, all beings primarily seek
              peace, comfort and security. Life is as dear to a mute creature as it
              is to a man. Just as one wants happiness and fears pain, just as one
              wants to live and not to die, so do other creatures. </span></p>

                            is best. I was deeply impressed the other day when I heard on the 
                            BBC radio that the number of vegetarians in this country (Great 
                            Britain) is growing. This is good news."<br> <br> <strong>-The Meaning of Life from a Buddhist Perspective (pg 72-73</strong>)<br> <br> "Vegetarianism is very admirable. In the case of those living 
                            in Tibet in the past, because of the climatic conditions and the 
                            scarcity of green vegetables, it is perhaps understandable that 
                            people generally adopted a non-vegetarian diet. Now, however, particularly 
                            in countries where there is an abundance of fresh vegetables and 
                            fruits, it is far better to reduce our consumption of non-vegetarian 
                            food as much as possible."<br> <br> <strong>-The World of Tibetan Buddhism (pg 111</strong>)<br> <br> "I think that from a Buddhist point of view it is very important 
                            to be vegetarian. I always say that even if on an individual level 
                            one does not always manage to stick to a vegetarian diet, when large 
                            numbers meet for a party, a conference, or any other gathering, 
                            it is indispensable that the group avoids eating meat. As for myself, 
                            I have tried my best to introduce vegetarianism to Tibetan society...<br> <br> According
              to Buddhism the life of all beings--human, animal or otherwise--is
              precious, and all have the same right to happiness. For this reason, I
              find it disgraceful that animals are used without being shown the
              slightest compassion, and that they are used for scientific
              experiments. <br> <br> ...I have also noticed that those who lack any compassion for animals
              and who do not hesitate to kill them are also those who, sooner or
              later, show a lack of compassion toward human beings. Inversely, the
              more compassion we have toward animals, the more we regard their lives
              as precious, then the more respect we have for human life."<br> <br> <strong>-Beyond Dogma (pg 28</strong>)<br> <br> "The suffering of animals is immediately apparent, for example, 
                            in goats and lambs slaughtered by the butcher, unable to save their 
                            own lives. Animals are harmless, they are totally powerless, possessing 
                            nothing but the bit of water and food we give them. They are so 
                            simple, so stupid, ignorant, and defenseless, that men really have 
                            no right to hunt and kill them for food. Cows, horses, mules and 
                            other animals have a dismal life and a dismal fate."<br> <br> <strong>-Essential Teachings (pg 43</strong>)<br> <br> "If
              you adopt questionable methods to become richer, such as selling arms
              or building poultry farms, then your livelihood becomes a source of
              negative energy and karma. By investing your money in the poultry
              industry, for example, you may become richer but at the expense of
              other beings' lives...<br> <br> Although from a spiritual point of view, we can say that human beings 
                            are the most precious of all living beings, seen from other angles 
                            we are the most destructive species our planet has known. Not only 
                            do we create pain for other species-- the millions of fish, chickens, 
                            cows and others we consider to be our righful food -- but we use 
                            our intelligence even to plan the total destruction of the planet 
                            on which we live!"<br> <br> <strong>-The Dalai Lama on Money, Politics, and Life As It Could Be (pg 
                            15, 29-30</strong>)<br> <br> If you are paying particular attention to observing practices of 
                            the three lower tantras it is important to maintain a vegetarian 
                            diet. Although it was reasonable for Tibetans to eat meat in Tibet, 
                            because of the climatic conditions and the scarcity of vegetables, 
                            in countries where there are vegetables in abundance, it is far 
                            better to avoid or reduce your consumption of meat. Particularly 
                            when you invite many people to a party, it is good if you can provide 
                            vegetarian food. <br> <br> <strong>-A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism<br> <br> </strong> <strong>HE Kyabje Lati Pinpoche 
                            is one of HH the Dalai Lama's spiritual advisers</strong> and the Root 
                            Guru of Trijang Rinpoche Yangsi- Trijang Rinpoche is the present 
                            Dalai Lama's junior tutor. This interview was conducted by Kunga 
                            Nyima on 26 December 2000 at Sakyamuni Dharma Centre, Singapore. 
                            <br> <br> Q: In recent years, we heard that there are 
                            plans to convert the diet of the three great Gelugpa monasteries 
                            into full vegetarianism. What is Rinpoche's view of this plan and 
                            for that matter, for Buddhist monasteries in general, to become 
                            full vegetarian?<br> A: I am happy the monastic authorities want to make this huge change. 
                            That is really appreciable. I really support this type of change 
                            coming up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Q:Why does Rinpoche 
                            feel that it is better to be vegetarian?<br> A:If the number of people who consume meat is reduced, it then automatically 
                            reduces the number of people who kill the animals to meet the demand. 
                            In this way, by becoming vegetarian, we contribute, to some extend, 
                            the reduction in the number of animals killed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Q:Why is it then in 
                            old Tibet that the monasteries are rarely fully vegetarian?<br> A:In Tibet, there are many people who are strict vegetarian. Even 
                            in the big monasteries where there are huge gatherings of monks, 
                            they never eat non-vegetarian food. In the monk's individual quarters, 
                            though, there might be some monks who eat meat as food.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Vegetarianism is something 
                            not very new in Tibetan society. Generally, in the old Tibetan society, 
                            most of the people try to avoid taking meat specifically killed 
                            to feed individual person. This is evident in very level of Tibetan 
                            society. Even in the scriptures of the Buddha, we have to avoid 
                            taking such meat which is killed specially just to feed ourselves. 
                            The texts prohibit us from taking this type of meat. That is the 
                            common way of practice and instructions in the Buddha's teachings. 
                            Especially in the Mahayana teachings when a person does intensive 
                            practice of Bodhicitta, they are advised or prescribed to avoid 
                            taking meat.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><br> <br> May all beings be free from fear, harm and danger.<br> May all beings be well and happy.</span></p>

              <p>Louis, yes, as I quoted above the Buddha have stated in a number of sutras about recommendation of not eating meat.</p>
              <p>In fact there is an entire chapter on this in Lankatarava Sutra which you can find off the net.</p>

              <p>Louis, it very much depends on which tradition you are inclined to. Vegetarianism is much stressed in Mahayana but it is seen differently in Theravada. Theravada Cannon does not have any Sutta or Vinaya rules that forbid meat to be consumed. However, the Buddha did make some conditions for meat to be eaten.</p>
              <p>It's about being practical during the olden days. The monks who took the alms from the Laity cannot choose what they want to eat, and it would be very difficult to impose a vegetarian rule for both the Sangha and the Laity. This was the reason why the Buddha refused to implement the vegetarian rule when it was suggested by Devadatta, his cousin who tried to usurp the Sangha. (who died and went to Avicci hell after that).</p>
              <p>Having said this, it cannot be seen that Theravada 'encourages' meat-eating. It just means " it's OK to consume meat and one does not have to beat his chest about it and thinks he has accumulated demerit and going to hell by doing so. There is a Sutta when the past Buddha debated with a vegetarian ascetics. I can give you the link if you want to read about it.</p>
              <p><br>However, if becoming a vegetarian helps you in your practice of buddhism , why not? We all know vegetarianism is good for our health and our eco-system.Just don't get too attached to it.</p>

              In the theravadin sutras vegetarianism is not mandatory. In fact during
              Buddha's time a huge conflict broke out between devadatta and Buddha.
              Devadatta wanted Buddha to imposed a dietary restriction of
              vegetarianism saying that it is only compassionate to do so. Hinduism
              and many vedic-based religion also encourages vegetarianism. If you go
              to south india you could hardly find any shop selling meat. You can but
              you have to travel very far. Devadatta lead away from Buddha a group of
              monks who were sympathetic to devadatta's position of vegetarianism.</p>
              <p>    Devadatta's purpose was done more out of jealousy than real compassion. He tried to kill Buddha shortly after the split.</p>
              <p>    Buddha then taught what we now call white meat.</p>

              <p>    
              Buddha knew how we create karma and this was why white meat criteria
              was recommended. If we are a direct party to the killing of the animal
              then our karma would be heavy. If the meat is purchased off the shelf
              and the meat was not killed EXPLICITLY for us then the meat is just
              protein. Any mental projections we have on it is entirely from our
              delusions.</p>
              <p>     The karma created in consuming meat within a
              community setting is one of collective karma.  Buddha did not teach
              explicitly or directly what collective karma could do to us but in
              several sutras, particularly the jatakas he did mentioned how a group
              of people taking a particular set of actions will also face group
              consequences. The slaughtering of his clansmen was a good example of
              collective karma.</p>
              <p>     By and large most collective karma,
              unless it is very grave such as mass murder or harming arahants,
              buddha, pacceka buddha etc. are very weak in nature.  If I am not
              mistaken it came under the category of ahosi karma. These karma are
              very weak and its effects could easily be annulled by having kind and
              loving thoughts and actions.</p>
              <p>    Why was it that in mahayana
              sutras that vegetarianism was so actively promoted ? It goes to the
              heart of the practice that you use. Some mahayana deities emphasised
              strongly the heart energy and anything that promotes compassion - real
              or not- would help the practice. Mahayana practised if it does not
              promote vegetarianism would look hypocritical as a mahayanist took a
              vow to help all sentient beings. The 6 paramitta is the basis and path
              that is adopted for liberation. This is the path of service or bakti in
              hinduism.</p>
              <p>Theravadin's path and basis is one of wisdom and compassion. </p>
              <p>Having
              said this let me state that vegetarianism is a lot better for health
              than consuming meat. But vegetarianism practised wrongly will cause a
              lot of harm and I am speaking from experience here.  Indian
              vegetarianism is very healthy and if chinese vegetarianism were to
              adopt some of the philosophy and foundation of ayurvedic vegetarian
              cooking the health of vegetarians would be a lot better.  I have seen
              how many vegetarians are quite sickly mainly because they do not know
              how to choose their food correctly.</p>
              <p>It was to Buddha's wisdom that he had allowed his followers to decide for themselves.</p>

If a meal is offered to a Buddhist monk or nun which contains a lot of meat, then it is not permissible for the monk or nun just to pick out the non-meat portions and leave the rest: the whole meal must be rejected - so strictly does the Buddha wish his injunction against meat-eating to be upheld.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Here is the whole relevant section – a mini-seminar between the Buddha and his Bodhisattva follower, “Maha-kasyapaika-gotra” - on vegetarianism, from the Tibetan version of the Mahaparinirvana Sutra:<br><br><br><br>Then Maha-Kasyapaika-gotra asked, “If it is very important to uphold the <br><br>impropriety of meat-eating, would it not then be wrong to give meat to those<br><br>who do not want meat?”<br><br><br><br>[The Buddha replied:] “Excellent, noble son, excellent! You have understood<br><br>my intention. One who protects the authentic Dharma should not do that. <br><br>Noble son, henceforth I do not permit my sravakas [disciples] to eat meat. If I <br><br>have said that [one should view] the country’s alms-food as the flesh of one’s <br><br>son, how could I permit the eating of meat? </em><em><strong>I teach that the eating of meat <br><br>cuts off Great Loving-kindness [maha-maitri].”</strong><br><br><br><br>“Blessed One, why did you permit the eating of meat that was blameless in<br><br>three respects?”<br><br><br><br>“Because I stipulated these three types of blameless as a provisional basis of <br><br>training; I now discard them.”<br><br><br><br>“Blessed One, what was your intention in talking of the ninefold great benefit<br><br>and the abandoning of the ten types of meat?”<br><br><br><br>“Because those pronouncements were stipulated to restrict the eating of<br><br>meat; they are also withdrawn.”<br><br><br><br>“Blessed One, what was your intention in stating that meat and fish are<br><br>wholesome foodstuffs?”<br><br><br><br>“I did not say that meat and fish are wholesome foodstuffs, but I have said <br><br>that sugar-cane, winter-rice, ordinary rice, wheat, barley, green lentils,<br><br>black lentils, molasses, sugar, honey, ghee, milk and sesame oil are<br><br>wholesome foodstuffs. If I have taught that even the various garments for<br><br>covering the body should be dyed an unattractive colour, then how much<br><br>more so [i.e. undesirable] attachment to the taste of meat foods!”<br><br><br><br>“In that case, does it not follow that the five milk products, sesame, sesame <br><br>oil, sugar-cane sap, conch-shell, silk and so forth also violate the precepts?”<br><br><br><br>“Don’t cleave to the views of the Nirgranthas [Jains]! I have imposed the <br><br>bases of training upon you with a different intention: I stipulate that you <br><br>should not even eat meat blameless in the three respects.

Thus there will appear [bogus] sramanas, sons of <br><br>Shakyamuni [the Buddha], who will claim that, ‘According to our vinaya, the<br><br>Blessed One has said that alms of meat-stuffs are acceptable’ and who will <br><br>concoct their own [scriptures] and contradict each other.<br><br><br><br>“Moreover, noble son, there will also be those who accept raw cereals, meat<br><br>and fish, do their own cooking and [stock-pile] pots of sesame oil; who <br><br>frequent leather-makers, parasol-makers and royalty …<br><br>The person I call a monk is one who abandons those things.”<br><br><br><br>“Blessed One, what should be done by monks, nuns, upasakas [male lay<br><br>followers of Buddhism] and upasikas [female lay followers of Buddhism],<br><br>who depend upon what is offered to them, to purify alms-food that contains<br><br>meat in such places where the food has not been verified?”<br><br><br><br><strong>“Noble son, I have taught that it does not contradict the vinaya in any way if<br><br>they wash it [i.e. the non-meat food] with water and then eat it. If it appears<br><br>that the food in such places contains a lot of prepared meat, it should be<br><br>rejected. There is no fault if one vessel touches another but the food is not<br><br>actually mixed together. I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and<br><br>scraps of meat left over by others constitute an infraction.</strong> <strong>Previously,I taught <br><br>this in cases arising from the needs of the situation. Now, on this occasion, I<br><br>teach the harm arising from meat-eating.
