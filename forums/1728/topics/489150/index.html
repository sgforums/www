              Middle East really motivated by religion?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/author/23053/William-Hamblin-and-Daniel-Peterson.html"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">William Hamblin and Daniel
              Peterson</span></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">, Deseret
              News July 11 2015 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Suicide
              terrorism is routinely cited as a parade example of the evils caused by
              religious fanaticism — or, as some atheists say, by religion, period. But close
              analysis of the evidence fails to support this view.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The so-called “New Atheists” differ from
              previous generations of vocal unbelievers (e.g., Bertrand Russell and Antony
              Flew) by not merely repudiating the existence of God but aggressively denying
              the moral legitimacy and cultural value of religious faith. They’re fond of
              citing the great 17th-century mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal: “Men
              never do evil so completely and cheerfully,” he said, “as when they do it from
              religious conviction.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">And nothing has played so well into the
              hands of the New Atheists in this regard than the violence associated over the
              past couple of decades with fundamentalist Islam. It’s believers in God,
              partisans of the New Atheism observe, who strap bombs to their backs and fly
              airplanes into buildings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">“For good people to do evil things,” the
              outspokenly atheistic Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg has famously
              said, “that takes religion.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Of course, matters aren’t quite so
              simple as some imagine. Pascal himself, for instance, was a very devoted
              Christian, and Weinberg shared his 1979 Nobel Prize with Mohammad Abdus Salam,
              a devout Anglo-Pakistani Muslim who quoted the Quran in his acceptance speech.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">But the fundamental problem with blaming
              religion for suicide bombings may surprise many readers: The data simply don’t
              support the charge. Not by a long shot.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #464646;">In 2005, Robert Pape of the University
              of Chicago published a vitally important book titled “</span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Dying-Win-Strategic-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/0812973380"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dying to Win</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #464646;">: The Strategic Logic of Suicide
              Terrorism.” It’s based upon meticulous analysis of every suicide attack
              occurring anywhere in the world between 1980, when modern suicide terrorism
              began, and 2003.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Pape’s case is factually rich and
              rigorously argued. “The data show,” he concludes, “that there is little
              connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of
              the world’s religions. In fact, the leading instigators of suicide attacks are
              the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a Marxist-Leninist group whose members are from
              Hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">He continues: “Rather, what nearly all
              suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic
              goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory
              that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. Religion is rarely the root
              cause, although it is often used as a tool by terrorist organizations in
              recruiting and in other efforts in service of the broader strategic objective.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Even in the Middle East, at least half
              of the suicide attacks between 1980 and 2003 had little, if any, link to
              Islamic fundamentalism; indeed, many such attacks were undertaken by
              Communists, secular nationalists and even Christians. The motivations were
              this-worldly, tied to national liberation. Those who carried them out weren’t
              impelled by poverty, alienation, psychological dysfunction, hopelessness or a
              pathological desire for death. On the contrary, by a very wide margin, suicide
              attackers turn out to have been relatively prosperous, exceptionally well-integrated
              within their communities, healthy and in no conventional way suicidal. Their
              acts were oddly altruistic and idealistic, however depraved others outside
              their community might judge them to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #464646;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #464646;">Why have we so misunderstood what’s
              going on? For one thing, we’ve paid disproportionate attention, in a sense, to
              suicide attacks in the Middle East; after all, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
              target that nation’s Sinhalese Buddhist majority, not us. The West has no vital
              interests there, and little representation, and we seldom hear reports about
              Sri Lanka on the nightly news. So our sample is skewed. Moreover, although
              they’ve spoken openly, we’ve paid curiously little attention to what suicide
              attackers have actually said about their motives and goals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #464646;">The fundamental point of Robert Pape’s
              argument is strikingly congruent with the entirely distinct case made by Graham
              Fuller in his brilliant 2010 book </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Islam-Graham-Fuller/dp/0316041203"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“A World Without Islam</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #464646;">.” We’ve summarized that 2010 book in a
              previous column: Fuller observes that today’s divisions between the (Islamic)
              East and the (Christian) West regularly trace the same geographical and other
              lines that divided East from West long before the rise of Islam in the seventh
              century (see </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865610336/Is-Islam-a-primary-cause-of-international-violence.html?pg=all"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Is Islam a primary cause
              of international violence?</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #464646;">"
              published Sept. 6, 2014).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In other words, what we typically
              understand to be a fundamentally religious conflict in the Middle East may, at
              its root, have relatively little to do with religion. And that, if true, has
              major ramifications for — among many other things — the way in which the United
              States and the West should conduct their foreign policy in and about the
              region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #464646; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">“It isn't what we don't know that gives
              us trouble,” Will Rogers once quipped, “it's what we know that ain't so."</span></p>

              <p>Suicide is against Islam.  Martyrdom is not. </p>
              <p>"Suicide bomber" is a derogatory term invented in the West to
                try and describe what in Islam is known as a Fedayeen or Shahid - a
                martyr.  The point of the bomber isn't suicide - it is to kill infidels
                in battle.  This is not just permitted by Muhammad, but encouraged with
                liberal promises of earthy rewards in heaven, including food and sex.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Each week, there are about ten attempted suicide bombings
                - all by Muslims.  The reason why Muslims are prone to self-detonation
                has nothing to do with genetics, desperation or suicide.  It is the
                ideology that promotes martyrdom by promising paradise to those who lose
                their lives for Allah.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A suicide bombing is really an act of homicide.  When
                Muslim apologists in the West say that Islam is against suicide bombings by
                pointing to the hadith that oppose killing oneself, such as<a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/023-sbt.php#002.023.446">Bukhari
                (23:446)</a>, they are being disingenuous.  Muslims in the Arab world,
                who are less concerned about public relations, celebrate and revere suicide
                bombers, knowing that martyrdom in battle is glorified by their
                religion.  As the Ayatollah Khomeini once put it,<span> </span><em>"The purest joy in Islam is
                to kill and be killed for Allah."</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">CAIR's Jamal Badawi, often held up as an example of<span> </span><em>moderate</em><span> </span>Islam, says<span> </span><em>"Suicide out of despair is
                not acceptable…Giving one’s life in a military situation is different and can
                be heroic if there is no other way of resisting…Killing civilians should be
                avoided<span> </span><strong>if possible</strong>, but
                not everyone out of uniform is a civilian.”<span> </span></em> (One
                wonders how families of the<span> </span><a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/09/04/12000-Iraqis-died-in-war-by-suicide-bombs/UPI-26551315145805/">12,000
                Iraqi civilians</a><span> </span>killed by
                suicide bombers would feel about Badawi's armchair analysis).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another prominent CAIR figure, founder Omar Ahmad,
                actually praised suicide bombers to a youth convention in 1999:<span> </span><em>"Fighting for freedom,
                fighting for Islam, that is not suicide.  They kill themselves for
                Islam."</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As for the argument that innocent Muslims are often
                casualties, the prominent Sunni cleric<span> </span><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/175360">explains</a>that<span> </span><em>"Allah will also accept as
                martyrs those killed by mistake."</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A<span> </span><a href="http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/international-relations-and-jihad/jihad-rulings-and-regulations/174723-martyr-operations-carried-out-by-the-palestinians.html?Regulations=">2014
                fatwa</a><span> </span>by the mainstream
                OnIslam.net site states that suicide operations are actually an "<em>obligatory</em><span><em> </em></span><em>form of Jihad that has
                nothing to do with terrorism or suicide.</em>"  They quote Sheikh
                Faysal Mawlawi, deputy chairman of European Council for Fatwa and Research,
                who calls suicide bombings<span> </span><em>"a
                sacred duty carried out in form of self-defense and resisting aggression and
                injustice. So whoever is killed in such missions is a martyr, may Allah bless
                him with high esteem."</em>  (The same scholar encourages<span> </span><em>"every Palestinian"</em><span> </span>to this type of violence for the
                sake of religion).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Muhammad was quite shrewd in making suicide a crime while
                at the same time painting paradise in the most prolifically decadent terms -
                an endless orgy of sex, food, and aesthetic comfort.  The frustration of
                the young believer, who is convinced that such eternal gratification lies
                just on the other side of death, but is forbidden from attaining it directly
                by his own hand, therefore comes to think of martyrdom as a relief -
                particularly if he is deprived of these comforts in life.  Given this,
                it's a wonder that suicide bombings aren't more common than they are.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>As a side note:</em><span> </span>the
                first suicide bomber in history may well have been Amalda de Rocas, a
                Christian teenage girl who was captured by the Turkish armies that were sent
                to conquer Cyprus in 1570 for no other reason than that they were not
                Muslim.  During the campaign, the Muslims slaughtered entire towns
                (after promising them safe passage) and captured about 2,400 children for
                transport back to the robust sex slave market in Islamic Turkey.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Amalda, one of the older girls, realized the hell that
                awaited them and threw a burning torch into a powder keg, blowing up the ship
                and sparing several hundred Christian children the indignity of sexual
                exploitation at the hands of the Muslims of the day.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is probably unfair to compare Amalda's noble and
                desperate act to the homicidal mass-murder sprees of Muhammad's modern-day
                Fedayeen, who heap misery onto innocent people simply for the purpose of
                achieving a gluttonous paradise for themselves... but we thought that it
                makes for an interesting note.</p>
