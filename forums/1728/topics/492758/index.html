Well, their loving bliss is restricted to their own interest and not based upon the truth. Secondly, their understanding of religion on cause and effect is squarely on Lord and not all living beings are equally created by God regardless of language, religions and races. And their attachment of belief for hell is certainly belonging to non faith or faith other than theirs. Theirs kind deeds doing to their own faith is true kind deeds, and their kind deeds are from command by Lord and not sincerely that all beings are creation of Lord<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>

              <p>There are universal values, and there is syncretism of beliefs.</p>
              <p>Then we have the right view, each according to our professed faith.</p>
              <p>We can take an overall helicopter view, or we can be down in trenches having a situational view.</p>
              <p>We can say both views are relevant , one impersonal,emotionally detached, the other, very personal, and  emotionally, very heavily invested. Both is completely irrelevant once on a different standpoint. It is all relative, is'nt it?</p>
              <p>Very often  we incorporate different systems of beliefs to make our world view more inclusive, more "complete". Perhaps more adherents may result.</p>
              <p>But does it constitute " Right View", if you wish to adhere to Buddhist ultimate destination?</p>
              <p>Now, my point for holding the right view is does each faith leads to the final destination?</p>
              <p>What is the final attainment? </p>
              <p>From my shallow understanding, there are thirty one planes of existence that are documented.  These are planes of existence one can attain with achieving Nirvana.</p>
              <p>I believe that one can achieve even the highest state sans Nirvana with many Dharmic systems with deep absorption. We can can address these beings of such attainments as paccaka buddhas.</p>
              <p>We accrue great respect for such beings but nevertheless, it is not the our ultimate goal as a Buddhist.</p>

              <p>The Thirty-one Planes of Existence</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>© 2005</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scattered throughout the suttas are references to as many as thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during their long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily grim and painful hell realms all the way up to the most exquisitely refined and blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is temporary; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to their past kamma. When they pass away, they take rebirth once again elsewhere according to the quality of their kamma: wholesome actions bring about a favorable rebirth, while unwholesome actions lead to an unfavorable one. And so the wearisome cycle continues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The realms of existence are customarily divided into three distinct "worlds" (loka), listed here in descending order of refinement:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Immaterial World (arupa-loka). Consists of four realms that are accessible to those who pass away while meditating in the formless jhanas.The Fine-Material World (rupa-loka). Consists of sixteen realms whose inhabitants (the devas)experience extremely refined degrees of mental pleasure. These realms are accessible to those who have attained at least some level of jhana and who have thereby managed to (temporarily) suppress hatred and ill-will. They are said to possess extremely refined bodies of pure light. The highest of these realms, the Pure Abodes, are accessible only to those who have attained to "non-returning," the third stage of Awakening. The Fine-Material World and the Immaterial World together constitute the "heavens" (sagga).The Sensuous World (kama-loka). Consists of eleven realms in which experience — both pleasurable and not — is dominated by the five senses. Seven of these realms are favorable destinations, and include our own human realm as well as several realms occupied by devas. The lowest realms are the four "bad" destinations, which include the animal and hell realms.</p>

              <p>Thanks Indeed. Most Christians and Muslims quite staunched. Actually, I have chanced upon Christian and Muslim who attempted to impress and challenge their holy understanding. In fact, I have been even treated like extremely unwisely, sort of slave, but my doubt of themhaving same nature as Buddha never shaken abit. And I have to tweet Buddha is all and thus all is buddha, liken to All is Allah and Allah is all, never give a damn in the name of Jesus and Allah for wellness and world peace. However, I have to impress it with them on a relax, jovial and serene mindfulness. In fact, most learned buddhists aware that many muslims and Christians did not die peacefully and to desired destination.</p>

              <p>Is so very saddening that a might be Buddha to be suicided at the age of Primary 5 just because of school result. Students should encourage to study diligently but must not be result oriented. Even the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew could not scored all subject 100 percents and no students pursuing in academic excellence scored 100 in every subjects and every years. If suicide ends suffering life or spur of unhappiness, mostly all have already enjoyed it and why mother still so happy giving birth</p>
