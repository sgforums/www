              <p>The Supplication To Dispel Obstacles On The Path</p>
              <p>Namo Guru!<br>(Homage to the spiritual master!)<br>On the tenth lunar day of the first winter month of the Male Earth Monkey Year (768), the embodiment of the body, speech, and mind of the indestructible wisdom of all buddhas of all times, the great Master from Oddiyana, Lotus-Born, lived in the resplendent, auspicious place that provides a source for any spiritual teachings one desires, the grove dense with tamarisk trees at Red Rock. On this occasion, the Master sat in the room called Shining Turquoise, on the second of the three stories of the great, glorious Samye Monastery.<br>His face radiated with a smile of pleasure, his body’s dazzling marks and signs of perfection outshone any other appearance. His voice, melodious as Brahma’s, opened innumerable gateways to spiritual paths. His mind never wavered from the limpid depths of the non-material expanse or primordial purity, yet his talents, based in wisdom, love, and capability, spontaneously accomplished all forms of enlightened activity. He appeared as a great sovereign of all beings within the wheel of life and of enlightened ones within the realm of perfect peace.<br>At that time, a group of us with pure propensity gathered in Guru Rinpoche’s presence: the sovereign of supreme understanding, the Buddhist King Trisong Detsen; the one who embodied Glorious Heruka, Namke Nyingpo; he who embodied Gentle Splendor Heruka, Sangye Yeshe; he who accomplished Great Power, Galwa Chok-yong; he who gathered the four rivers of secret Mantra’s transmissions, the monk Drime Dashar; the powerful magician, Longdro Translator, Konchok Joungne; the lord of all those who carry ritual daggers in Tibet and Kham, Dorje Doodjom; he whose wisdom equaled that of the Master, Illuminator of Form, Berotsana; the princes who were emanations of great bodhisattvas, the sons of Heaven; and she whom the Master chose as vajra consort, me, Yeshe Tsogyal. Together we offered prostrations to the Master and in unison made this request:<br>Oh Great Master! You unite the mysteries of all buddhas’ body, speech, and mind, and you reign as the chief of infinite sacred circles of deities. Therefore we request that, without reference to other tantric transmissions and meditations, you bestow upon us tantras and teachings that arise directly in spontaneous wisdom from the great luminous expanse of your mind.<br>Guru Rinpoche laughed with a glowing happy smile and with the melodious voice of Brahma replied:<br>It is very good that you see things in this way and make such a request! You worthy ones led by the king can ask for whatever you wish: I’ll answer your questions.</p>
              <p>These words moved us to respect, joy, and supreme self-confidence. We asked further:<br>Oh Precious master! You are exceedingly kind to agree to bestow upon us your vajra word tantras in the form of pith instructions. Therefore we ask this: For those who practice Buddhism now and in the future, how can obstacles that arise be dispelled? How can attainments be accomplished? How can all spiritual paths be traversed?<br>Guru Rinpoche replied:<br>Although those who practice correctly the authentic spiritual teachings might face myriad forms of obstructive forces, supplications to the spiritual master constitute the only means to dispel them. Better advice than this has never been given, is not given, and will never be given, even by all buddhas of all times. The removal of obstructive forces brings attainments and that accomplishment will lead you to traverse all spiritual paths. Therefore, from the outset, it is essential to beseech the spiritual master to dispel all your outer, inner, and secret obstacles.<br>At that moment, Son of Heaven Yeshe Rolpa Tsal was inspired by the inconceivable great power of his previous pure acts and aspirations. He offered the master a large mandala of gold and precious jewels, upon which he arranged heaps of shining turquoise. He prostrated before the Master respectfully many times, then made this request:<br>Oh Great Master! Although in general we are sure to receive whatever we wish when we pray to the spiritual master, we now need a supplication that expresses the essence of our wishes. Please give us a special way of praying to you, Guru Rinpoche, so that you will dispel all our outer, inner, and secret obstacles.<br>Guru Rinpoche replied:<br>Very good, very good, Son of Heaven! In general, any master who shows you the spiritual path is the sole embodiment of all buddhas’ activity. Specifically, the spiritual master who gives you instruction in Secret Mantra is greater than all the buddhas of all times;if your devotion to him or her is insincere, your spiritual life will rot at its core. In particular, I am the sole spiritual master of all who practice Buddhism in Tibet. My mind is inseparable from all buddhas’ ultimate enlightenment; all buddhas of perfect rapture radiate from me and are reabsorbed into me; my wisdom, one with that of all buddhas’ manifest body, reveals itself in different appearing forms that guide others throughout the world in general and in this land of red-faced people, Tibet, in particular.<br>Therefore those who are alive today–the Buddhist king, translators, scholars, and other outstanding individuals – and those of the future – holy persons who uphold the Buddha’s doctrine for as long as it lasts in Tibet – all appear from my, Lotus-Born’s, great wisdom in a magical display to guide others.</p>
              <p>Remember to pray to me continually, considering me as the embodiment of all Buddhist sources of refuge, a single form that unites all your root and lineage masters. If such prayers do not result in the accomplishments of the attainment you wish, I will have deceived all buddhas of all times. In particular, recite this supplication to dispel every obstacle.<br>He then placed his right hand on the king’s head, his left hand on mine [Yeshe Tsogyal], and touched his forehead to that of the Son of Heaven. In the innate indestructible sound of the melody of the nature of reality, he spoke this supplication:<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>Boundless Light, body of ultimate enlightenment, to you I pray.<br>Great Compassion, body of perfect rapture, to you I pray.<br>Lotus-Born, body of manifest enlightenment, to you I pray.<br>My spiritual master, this wondrous manifestation of enlightenment,<br>Was born in India, where he studied and contemplated.<br>When he came to central Tibet, he subdued the arrogant spirits.<br>Now he dwells in Oddiyana, where he works for beings’ benefit.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>When your amazing body was first seen,<br>Your right hand made the sword-gesture;<br>Your left, the gesture of summons.<br>Your mouth was open; your teeth bared; your gaze raised.<br>Victors’ heir, you are beings’ lord protector.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.</p>
              <p>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>When you received the precious, sacred Teachings,<br>Your body was luminous and brilliant.<br>You bore the Three Collections’ texts in your right hand;<br>Vajra Dagger’s text in your left.<br>Learned one of Parping.<br>You gained comprehension of the profound Teachings.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>In the sublime sacred place of pure delight,<br>You bound guardians under oath.<br>When you arrived at the border of India and Tibet<br>To give your blessing,<br>On the sweet-smelling Fragrant Mountain<br>Flowers bloomed, even in winter,<br>And springs flowed with nectar of awakening.<br>In that happy, sublime sacred place,<br>You wore the religious robes of a sublime person.<br>In your right hand you bore a nine-pronged vajra;<br>In your left, a jeweled container<br>Filled with rakta nectar.<br>You bound dakinis and spirits under path,<br>Saw the deities, and gained accomplishment.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>When you established the Victor’s doctrine,<br>You meditated in Yari Mountain’s forest.</p>
              <p>Your practice dagger rose in space.<br>With a vajra gesture, you grabbed and rolled it.<br>Rolling it, you flung it to a sandalwood forest.<br>It burst into raging flames, and the lake dried up.<br>The land of evil non-Buddhists burned<br>And noxious harm-bringing spirits were eradicated.<br>You are an incomparable slayer of demons.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>While suppressing cannibal spirits,<br>You appeared as a young manifestation of enlightenment –<br>A wonderful, excellent body, with fine complexion,<br>Straight teeth, and beautiful golden hair –<br>A youth of sixteen years of age.<br>You wore rich jewelry,<br>You suppressed demons and spirits<br>With a bronze dagger in your right hand.<br>You protected your devoted spiritual children<br>With an acacia dagger in your left hand.<br>At your throat you wore an iron dagger,<br>Indivisible with the deity.<br>You are non-dual manifest enlightenment, ornament of the world.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>When you cared for demons’ land,<br>They made a blazing pyre<br>Which you filled with a lake an arrow-shot wide.<br>On the lake, in a cool lotus</p>
              <p>You sat, meditating.<br>Known by the name of Lotus-Born,<br>You are truly the perfect Buddha incarnate,<br>A marvelous manifestation of enlightenment.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>When you brought sunlight to Tibet,<br>You acted as the illustrious leader of the faithful.<br>You presented yourself in ways to guide beings.<br>On the pass at Tsong-kha<br>You bound under oath the genyen war-gods.<br>In the region of Tsawa Tsasho<br>You bound under oath<br>Twenty-one arrogant genyen gods.<br>At Mong-youl, in a cloud of love,<br>You bestowed accomplishment upon four monks.<br>You are an outstanding sublime awareness holder.<br>Bless me with your compassion!<br>Lovingly guide me on the path!<br>Grant me accomplishment!<br>Dispel our obstacles with your power!<br>Dispel outer obstacles without;<br>Dispel inner obstacles within;<br>Dispel secret obstacles to the absolute expanse.<br>I respectfully bow and take refuge in you.<br>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung<br>On the splendid plain of Pol-tong<br>You bound the twelve tenma goddesses under oath.<br>At Tibet’s Kha-la Pass<br>You bound Gong-kar Sha-me under oath.<br>Beside the Lha-bu Nying at Dam-sho<br>You bound Tong-lha Yar-zhu under oath.<br>On Hepori Mountain<br>You bound all gods and cannibal spirits under oath.<br>Among the gods and demons,</p>

              <p>Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hung</p>

              <p>Colophon<br>The indisputable, great treasure revealer appropriate for this time, Orgyen Chok-gyur Dechen Lingpa, drew from under the foot of Great Glorious One at the gate of Da-nyin Rong the treasure text Oral Teachings, the Heart Proclamation, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, part of the Heart-Meditation on the Spiritual Master, Dispelling All Obstacles. This supplication constitutes the outer stage of that meditation. May this fully dispel the obstacle and frailty of the doctrine and beings, and may it be a cause for the complete accomplishments of the benefit of others and myself.</p>
