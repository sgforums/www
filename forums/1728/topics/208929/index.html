            <div class='col-md body'>I find this great and thought of sharing with the forum, it's a priceless work by the 3rd Zen Patriarch and I think this translation is quite well done.<br><br><a href="http://www.selfdiscoveryportal.com/cmSengTsan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.selfdiscoveryportal.com/cmSengTsan.htm</a><br><br><strong>Seng-Ts'an</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.selfdiscoveryportal.com/SengTsan2a.jpg"><br><br>Seng-Ts'an was a Buddhist layman over forty years of age when he came to the second Patriarch, Hui-k'o, with a request that the master purify him of his sins. The response (see Hui-k'o on the Other Ch'an Masters page) inspired Seng-Ts'an to become a monk under Hui-k'o, leading to his enlightenment and succession as Patriarch. He died in 609, leaving us the priceless stanzas titled Hsin Hsin Ming, which are variously identified in English as Inscribed on the Believing Mind, On Trust in the Heart and The Mind of Absolute Trust. The full text appears in the column to the right, with other translations of sections appearing below. You'll see that he's giving directions on living in the Way, or Tao.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Hsin Hsin Ming<br>Inscribed on the Believing Mind</span></strong><br><br>The Great Way is not difficult<br>for those who have no preferences.<br>When love and hate are both absent<br>everything becomes clear and undisguised.<br>Make the smallest distinction, however,<br>and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.<br>If you wish to see the truth<br>then hold no opinions for or against anything.<br>To set up what you like against what you dislike<br>is the disease of the mind.<br>When the deep meaning of things is not understood<br>the mindÂ’s essential peace is disturbed to no avail.<br><br>*<br><br>(to be continued...)</div>

Turn the mind inwards to its origin... because you can only be the truth, you cannot know it as an object. Thoughts arise and dissolve in our True Mind.<br><br><blockquote><strong>True Mind</strong><br><br>There are not many arts to Zen study: it just requires knowing your own true mind. Now observe that within this body the physical elements combine temporarily, daily heading for extinction: where is the true mind?<br><br>The flurry of ideas and thoughts arising and passing away without constancy is not the true mind. That which shifts and changes unstably, sometimes good, sometimes bad, is not the true mind. That which wholly depends on external things to manifest, and is not apparent when nothing is there, is not the true mind.<br><br>Suppose you turn the light of awareness around to look within, and sense tranquility and oneness; do you consider this the true mind? You still do not realize that this tranquility and calm oneness are due to the perception of the false mind: there is subjective mind perceiving and the object perceived. This tranquility and oneness belong to the realm of inner states. This is what is meant by the Heroic Progress Sutra when it says, "Inwardly keeping to tranquility is still a reflection of discrimination of objects." How could it be the true mind?<br><br>So if these are not the true mind, what is the true mind? Try to see what your true mind is, twenty four hours a day. Don't try to figure it out, don't try to interpret it intellectually, don't try to get someone to explain it to you, don't seek some other technique, don't calculate how long it may take, don't calculate your own strength, just silently pursue this inner investigation on your own: "Ultimately what is my own true mind?"</blockquote></div>
