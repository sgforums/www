              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Buddhism started with a minute analysis of the human personality (the pudgala) into the elements (dharma) of which it is composed. These elements were divided into good and bad, those that can be purified or defiled and also those that are considered to be neutral.<span>  </span>Ordinary life was considered as a condition of degradation and misery. The purifying elements were those moral features that led to Nirvana - an unconditioned element. The defiling ones led one to a life of suffering. That then was our mental life. There was no Ego, no Soul and Personality. The so called personality was a collection of ever changing, interrelated elements. It was the Lord Buddha’s teaching as interpreted by the Theravadins, the “Doctrines of the Elders”.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">With the emergence of the Mahayanist, all physical and mental elements which were interrelated, dependent on each other were view as unreal. The real, ultimate existence or ultimate reality is a reality that is free of all relations and interdependence, it was unconditioned. It was a No-Elements doctrine, a doctrine of relativity and unreality of all elementary data into which existence has been analyzed.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sutra opens with the early Buddhist understanding of what constitutes the individual Self; the form and the remaining four other mental aggregates. It then when on to discuss other early Buddhist teachings and how it is view and interpreted from the Mahayanist perspective. The language of negation is used to describe what ultimate reality is, as it is something beyond concepts and can only be grasped by intellectual intuition only. But when one have ‘arrived’ at that state of realization, there are certain qualities that will become evident in the person which can be described. This is expounded in the later part of the Sutra when it dwelled on the paramitas of the Mahayanist. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span>      </span></span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">When Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara was practicing the profound Prajna Paramita, he illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they are all empty, and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So too are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shariputra, all Dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure; and they neither increase nor diminish. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or Dharmas; no field of the eyes up to and including no field of mind consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, and no Way, and no understanding and no attaining.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva through reliance on Prajna Paramita is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana! All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi through reliance on Prajna Paramita. Therefore know that Prajna Paramita is a Great Spiritual Mantra, a Great Bright Mantra, a Supreme Mantra, an Unequalled Mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the Mantra of Prajna Paramita was spoken. Recite it like this: </span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Gaté Gaté Paragaté Parasamgaté Bodhi Svaha!</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"> </span></span></em></p>

On the other hand, the Mahayana practice is aimed not just for the benefit of self but is also for others as well. Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was chosen to demonstrate to the followers of the Theravada the full dimension of the Mahayana teaching. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"> </span></span></strong></p>

With the perceived object, mental states such as our feelings and volitions too arises, these provides the occasions for craving and clinging to develop in the self. Craving and clinging comes about due the present of an Ego. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The perfection of Wisdom (Prajna) is <em>profound</em>, as it required the practitioner to go beyond our thought construction, beyond discriminating knowledge, beyond duality of mind to realized and attain Truth itself, and the abandoning of our Ego. It is to go beyond birth and death.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"He illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they are all Empty."</span></strong><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;  "></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Buddha taught that an individual is a combination of five aggregates of existence, called the Five Skandhas (aggregates). These are: Form, Feeling, Cognition, Mental formations and Consciousness.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The first is our physical form. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The second is made up of our feelings, both emotional and physical.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The third, cognition which is when a sense organ comes into contact with an object, be it physical, mental, or an idea, causes thoughts to arise follows with conceptualization and reasoning. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fourth skandha, mental formations, includes habits, prejudices, predisposition, volition, and other mental states both virtuous and not virtuous. The causes and effects of karma are of this aggregate.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The fifth skandha, consciousness, is awareness of or sensitivity to an object, but without conceptualization. Once there is awareness, the third skandha might recognize the object and assign a concept-value to it, and the fourth skandha might react with desire or revulsion or some other mental formation. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Buddha taught that our egos, personalities and the sense that the “self” are just illusory effects of the skandhas. Through mindfulness contemplation, we should see these aggregates of existence as they rise and fall and not cling on to them. Once our clinging to the skandha diminishes, so too the notion of a separate “self” and the Ego. It will lead us to apprehend that these aggregates as having no intrinsic reality.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, does not allow his mind to discriminate: Seeing is seeing, hearing is hearing, smelling is smelling, tasting is tasting, knowing is knowing, understanding is standing; They arises when right conditions are there, ceases when these conditions disappear, they are relative, they are empty, empty of all self existence.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>

Desire is craving for pleasure, material goods, and immortality, and can never be satisfied. As a result, desiring them can only bring suffering. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;  ">With the realization that the Skandhas are relative and empty of any self existence, our ignorance and wrong views of existence is abandoned and with it the clinging to an Ego and the notion of a separate “I”. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Buddha taught there are three main kinds of Sufferings (dukkha). These are:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Suffering or Pain - </span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ordinary suffering, in the form of physical, emotional and mental pain.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Impermanence or Change -</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Thing that is subject to change, such as happiness, sadness, worries and even the state of bliss experienced in spiritual practice, its rise and fall with passing time.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Conditioned States -</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> To be conditioned is to be dependent on or affected by something else. According to the teaching of dependent origination, all phenomena are conditioned. Everything affects everything else. This is also suffering as it gives rise to the clinging to the skandhas with all its accompanying ills and difficulties. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  ">When </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;  ">Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  "> perceived that all the five skandhas are void, he had transcended all suffering and its accompanying difficulty. It does not mean that suffering of pain in the form of physical, emotional and mental are not there, it is just that we do not cling or be overwhelmed by it. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">"Sariputra, Form Does not Differ from Emptiness, Emptiness Does Not Differ From Form. Form itself is Emptiness and Emptiness itself is Form; so too are Feelings, Cognition, Formation, and Consciousness."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sariputra was the best, the most advanced disciple of Theravada Buddhism, renowned for his wisdom. This part of the sutra is thus directed at the adherents of the Theravadins.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Words and names are indirect knowledge obtain from our memories, thought construction and concepts. They are also dual in nature. The word “Blue” come about after our intellect has run through all that is consider as “not-Blue” and “other than Blue” before arriving at the conclusion that what we saw is called “Blue”.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The paradox nature of the above passages is difficult to explain in words, more so when the word “Emptiness” is used to describe a realization that is non-dual in nature. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To say Form is empty of any self existence can be intellectually analyzed and understood. It is another matter altogether to become “aware and feel” that it is so as it require one to go beyond our dualistic intellectual thought process. It is like saying, “if you open your mouth you are already wrong, if you give rise to a single thought you are in error."</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  "> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is the silence that follows after the sound of discussion has ceased and when the role of thought is over. The result of this realization will eventual leads us on to the path of letting go of our clinging and grasping of the Self. This realization can only be designate a term; in this case, “Emptiness” is assigned. Of course we can also call this realization “a leave” or “a flower” if one has not as yet designate “leave” and “flower” to some other things already.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Form is not just empty of any inherent existence, what is percept by the senses are momentary flash of energy only and have the character of being instantaneous, of being spit in discrete moments, and they disappear as soon as they appear. Matter does not exist apart from sense-data and everything necessarily must have an end. We would have notice by observation, that such thing as fire, changes every moment, so do our thoughts, even our body is constantly changing. This is the true nature of all things when it is perceive by a mind that does not try to grasp and cling on to everyday objects which have been constructed by our imagination and stabilized. “Form is Emptiness”, is a realization that the nature of all things are void of all inherent self existence. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  "></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is motion always going on in living reality, but what we noticed are only some special moments which we stabilized in our imagination. This is the function of our understanding which differentiated these sensations into subject and object. This is the first construction of our mind and in which further cognition is accompanied by an Ego. Ego is always emotional, be it in very slight degree. Objects perceived can give rise to desirable or undesirable, pleasant or unpleasant feelings. The stronger these emotions are, the stronger will be the present of the Self in us and the more it will cling on to the existence of the physical body without the individual realizing that it is the body that goes through the cycle of birth and death and what is deathless is the pure mind. It is in this mind that all things arise and cease. “Emptiness is Form”, is the realization that it is in this</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;  "> imperishable and indestructible</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> mind that all Form takes shape. Mind itself when polluted by passions and ignorance is phenomenal life, that very Mind when empty of it is deliverance. There is no “Is” or not-“Is”; it is devoid of all duality. <span> </span></span></span></p>

It is only when discriminating thought no longer arises that liberation can be attained.

The series is conditioned by the central element of Ignorance. (1) Due to our Ignorance, we cling on to a self, (2) Our pass karma then, provide the conditioning factors for the next life, (3) Consciousness arises, which again carries the sense of self, (4) It give rise to name and form, the individual mental and physical constituents, (5) Follow by our six senses, (6) Accompany by our sensations, (7) And the Feeling of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral states, (8) Which give rise to our Desires, (9) Allowing free actions of clinging, grasping, (10) Which brought about future becoming again, (11) New birth in the six realms, (12) Follow by old age and death. The whole series of process is only interrupted, when the element of Ignorance is extinct. This is the Theravada special law of moral causation.</span></span></p>

When ignorance is eliminated, all delusory activity ceases. Without grasping there can be no becoming, which means that all future rebirths are extinguished. Without birth there is no aging and death and that is the end of pain, grief, lamentation and anguish.</span></span></p>

To see one's Self Nature enables the attainment of buddhahood, because when the ignorance of the existence of a permanent self is dispelled and recognized as empty of any such self existence, there is nothing left to cling on. Therefore the sutra says "also there is no ending of ignorance", as originally, there is no such thing as old age and death and ending of old age and death. They are just the product of our conceptual mind. </span></span></p>

The Truths are stated as; there is Suffering, Causes of Suffering, Cessation of Suffering and the Way to the Cessation of Suffering. The teaching transcends the mundane and provides access to sainthood. A saint from the Theravada tradition attains the path and the fruit on the basis of one’s practice of The Four Noble Truths. The Mahayana attainment is in the realm of the supra-mundane. The suffering spoken of is the suffering in this world. Its causes are, likewise, of this world, the path is operative in this world and Nirvana or cessation of suffering is our exit from this world. The path, which is the Noble Eightfold Path provides for the practice aimed toward enlightenment.</span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></strong></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Conditioned States -</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> To be conditioned is to be dependent on or affected by something else. According to the teaching of dependent origination, all phenomena are conditioned. Everything affects everything else. This is also suffering as it gives rise to the clinging to the skandhas with all its accompanying ills and difficulties. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></strong></span></p>

Numerous causes come together, and we know that our present suffering is the effect of previous causes. Likewise, our present behavior is the foundation for future effects. The cause of suffering is a cluster of six root defilements: Greed, hatred, ignorance, pride, doubt and heterodox views and together with the lesser defilements cause all the suffering in the world.</span></span></p>

If craving is removed or transcended, there will be no more suffering. Cessation means calmness and extinction, or Nirvana, yearning for Nirvana, will made one resolve to practice and attain the path and the fruit, i.e., Nirvana.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></span></p>

Those who focus their desire on attaining the supra-mundane Nirvana can break off the causes of suffering and practice toward enlightenment. The practice of discipline removes the obstacle of greed, meditation reduces delusion and the two combined foster wisdom. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></span></p>

In the later teaching, the Buddha taught the Dharma of Emptiness to promote the understanding of the supra-mundane Emptiness of True Existence. We have seen the emptiness of the five skandhas, the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths is also empty as well. There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no cessation of suffering and no path. They are just like the reflection on a mirror. The reflection is not separate from that which reflects it; the reflective surface and the reflection are one. To understand this means to be close to enlightenment.</span></span></p>

Allowing one's actions to be guided by the paramitas, one will surely attain the path and the fruit. Each of the six paramitas is an antidote for each of the six fundamental defilements </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></span></p>

The Mahayana doctrine of action and principle differs from the Theravada as to its intention. Besides cultivating the paramitas, one should endeavor to liberate all sentient beings by leading them toward an upward path while seeking one’s own enlightenment. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">According to the Buddha, "there is no understanding and there is no attainment". It means that the paramitas and the bodhisattva action are not entities to be grasped, conceptualized, and manipulated. The six paramitas and the bodhisattva action are like the reflection in the mirror, since they are all amenable to change and therefore empty of self. The true nature of a mirror is its capacity to receive and relinquish all that goes on in front of it without holding on to any part of it. If the paramitas are practiced with the understanding that they are rooted in Emptiness, the great enlightenment can be attained. Non-wisdom is the true wisdom, non-attainment is the true attainment. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></span></p>

The first of the impediment to break off is the <em>impediment of retribution</em>. Since the infinite past, we have accumulated much heavy karma in our past existences. Unless we embrace the True Law, we will be obliged to carry such a karmic debt and to suffer karmic retribution in this present life and perhaps in future lifetimes as well. Therefore, when we encounter various hardships in the course of Buddhist practice, we can consider them as the retribution of slanderous deeds in the past, effects that would otherwise have had to be experienced to a greater degree and over a much longer period of time. A bodhisattva would have already discarded this obstruction, and anxiety would also vanish from his mind.</span></span></p>

With its sound it calls forth its content into a state of immediate reality. Mantra is power. It is not mere speech which the mind can contradict. The words are deeds, acting immediately. The power and the effect of a mantra depend on the spiritual attitude, the knowledge and the responsiveness of the individual. The sound of a mantra is not a physical sound but a spiritual one. It should be heard by the heart and uttered by the mind. Mantra has power and meaning only to one who has gone through a particular kind of experience connected with the mantra and gives power only to those who are conscious of its inner meaning. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Its power and its strength are operative in realms not amenable to manipulation. Its effect can manifest itself instantaneously, transcending the worldly, attaining holiness. When Prajna is here link with a Mantra, it also suggests that the theme and the essence of the Heart Sutra transcends concept.</span></span></p>

The teaching of the Heart Sutra includes some exoteric parts, such as the sutras, and some esoteric ones, such as the mantras. Exoteric Teachings are accessible to rational understanding and can be explained, but the meanings of the esoteric or mystic forms of prayer such as mantras are not within the reach of the intellect. During recitation, mantras enable the one reciting them to control both the sound and the timing, but any recognizable words and meanings which would normally hold in one’s mind captive are not there. One has then an opportunity to experience the expanse or space of one’s mind, it being one of mind's very special characteristics.</span></span></p>

              <p>Madhyamaka is said to be a higher view than Yogacara. The reason 
                                          being, in Yogacara mind is still taken to be real (though empty of 
                                          self), while objects are said to have no existence apart from the 
                                          six/eight consciousnesses (mind), but in Madhyamaka all internal and 
                                          external phenomena including mind are said to be empty.</p>
              <p>However, Yogacara is not the same as the view of substantialist 
                                          non-dualism. Why? Yogacara conceives of mind as being a momentary 
                                          process without a substantial self. In other words, in Yogacara, 
                                          consciousness itself is real - it exists as a series, or stream, of  
                                                          successive momentary awareness of events, each 
                                          immediately replaced by  
                                                          consciousness in the next moment, and is  dependent on 
                                          the consciousness of the preceding instant, and therefore has no 
                                          substantial, permanent, independent Self-essence.</p>
              <p>The author however, is holding the view of a permanent, independently existing Awareness/Mind.</p>
              <p>Substantialist non-dualism is a view held by Advaita Vedanta, 
                                          Kashmir Shaivism, Vajrayana's Shentong, and many teachers in Zen etc 
                                          (but not all). Such teachers, especially in Buddhism, may have an (not 
                                          yet experiential) understanding of D.O. and emptiness but fails to 
                                          realize Anatta.</p>
              <p>If you read <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a> - I AM (Stage 1 &amp; 2) is the first insight into Mind, but at this 
                                          phase Mind and phenomena are still conceived as separate. At Stage 4, 
                                          non-dual is realized but it is still substantialist non-dual - non-dual 
                                          is conceived as the inseparability of an inherent Mind with its 
                                          reflections/objects. At Stage 5 - there is no mirror, no subject, no 
                                          inseparability of subject and object because there is no subject to 
                                          begin with - only a self-luminous stream of manifestations. At Stage 6, 
                                          emptiness of objects and D.O. is experientially realized (in contrast to
                                           theoretically understood).</p>

              <p>The author still conceives of a subjective Awareness that is nevertheless inseperable from phenomena.</p>
              <p>The author also wrongly misunderstood the Arhant's realization as
                                           being only the I AM stage (Mind separate from phenomena), aka Thusness 
                                          Stage 1 or 2.</p>
              <p>The author then wrongly misunderstood the Bodhisattva's realization as being substantialist non-dual, aka Thusness Stage 4.</p>
              <p>In reality, Stage 1 to 4 is found in non-Buddhist contemplatives 
                                          (such as Advaita Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, Taoism, Christian mysticism,
                                           Islamic sufism, Jewish Kabbalah etc). Luminosity is realized, non-dual 
                                          is realized, but the inherent view is not removed via insight into 
                                          anatta and shunyata.</p>
              <p>An arya (an enlightened being in Buddhism - sotapanna to arhant, 
                      or bodhisattva of various bhumis, etc) must give rise to the insights of
                       anatta and shunyata, the twofold emptinesses - which correspond to 
                      Thusness Stage 5 and 6.</p>
              <p>Arhants (or even a Sotapanna) are said to realize emptiness of self/anatta, while Bodhisattvas are said to realize the twofold emptinesses (emptiness of self + emptiness of objects), though it could be argued 
                                          that Arhants also realize the emptiness of objects (nevertheless the 
                                          Theravadin commentaries made the mistake of giving the elements of 
                                          skandhas substantiality thus showing the insight into anatta but not the
                                           insight into emptiness of objects, thus giving rise to the need for 
                                          prajnaparamita literatures).</p>
              <p>The twofold emptiness are corresponded with Thusness's stages, Stage 5 = "anatta"/emptiness of self/first fold emptiness, Stage 6 = emptiness of objects/second fold emptiness.</p>

The Idealism of the Yogacara doctrine comes about as a reaction against what appeared to some, as the Madhyamaka extremism and unqualified negation of phenomena. To the Yogacara, what appears is real but not the manner of its appearance. The rope is inherently devoid of the ‘snake’ appearance, but it is not devoid of its own intrinsic nature as a rope. The reality of Vijnana (consciousness) cannot be denied.<span>  </span>The reality of subject and object which it is infected is considered as non-existent; emptiness applies to this unreal aspect. To the Vijnanavadin, consciousness is real, not apparent; consciousness alone is real, not the object. <span> </span></span></span></p>

Objectivity itself is the work of creative thought. Object cannot stand by itself; it is nothing without consciousness on which it is super-imposed. It is consciousness that can undergo modification, and it can purify itself by getting rid of the superimposed duality. One can analysed away everything as an illusion, but illusion itself implies the ground on which the illusory construction can take place. The Vijnanavadin give substance to emptiness by identifying it with Pure Consciousness that is devoid of duality.</span></span></p>

              <p>Yogacara view of mind is being non-dual, and real, but due to the belief in subject &amp; object the eight consciousnesses arises. The eight consciousness arises due to the false apprehension of reality. When the view of subject and object dissolves through knowledge and vision, the eight consciousnesses transforms into the five wisdoms. This is the basic stance of Yogacara.</p>
              <p>In view of these, all are simply forms of non-dual consciousness, but due to the view of duality, consciousness is "modified" into the eight consciousness.</p>
              <p>Yet, this is not the non-Buddhist view of what I call substantialist non-dualism. Why?</p>
              <p>The non-Buddhist view of consciousness is that of an ultimate, independent, unchanging, unified and fundamental and over-arching cosmic consciousness. This metaphysical essence, called in many names like God, Brahman, etc, is shared by all forms and beings, and is the ground of being out of which all forms arise.</p>
              <p>The Yogacarin's view of consciousness is that of a non-dual, changing, personal and unique consciousness. In other words, there is no cosmic source of all phenomena and beings, there is only individual mindstreams which are however non-dual in nature.</p>
              <p>Also, substantialist non-dualism as I and Thusness puts it isn't really no-dualism but a form of monism. It is the view that there is an ultimate Subject, but this ultimate Subject is unified with all its contents such that there is no real division between subject and object. Brahman and the World, Awareness and the contents of Awareness are thus seen as an inseparable seamless unity.</p>
              <p>Yogacara is different, there is no ultimate consciousness apart from the process of personal non-dual cognitions. In Yogacara, the nondual mind, the flow of perceptions prior to the dualizing of subject and object, is what is ultimately existent.</p>
              <p>Note that even though there is no objectivity and everything is simply the modification of consciousness according to the latent tendencies and karma, unlike non-Buddhist traditions like Advaita or Kashmir Shaivism, consciousness is not the ultimate subject of all perceptions that is the oneness of all (unified without division between subject and object). There is no Subject and Object in yogacara, period. It is not that there is an ultimate Awareness unified with all its contents. There can be no inseparability or unity if there is no Subject ot begin with. Consciousness is not a Subject.</p>
              <p>Some reification is happening in Yogacara as consciousness is given some reality, and thus is not the complete understanding of emptiness like Madhyamaka, though Yogacara is skillful in pointing out certain aspects of experiential reality. But in Yogacara, consciousness is not reified into an ultimate, fundamental, over-arching and unchanging consciousness like Hinduism's Atman or Brahman.</p>
              <p>So it is this process of personal, unque and non-dual mindstream, empty of subject and object, that is taken to be real in Yogacara. Therefore it is not merely the non-Buddhist substantialist non-dualism. It is not merely Thusness's Stage 4 (substantialist non-dualism).</p>
              <p>By the way, Madhyamaka does not deny the appearance of consciousness, but it denies the permanency, selfhood, and inherent existence of consciousness. Emptiness does not deny luminosity, and appearance, it denies a self-existing independent substance. Emptiness and luminosity are fundamentally inseparable. The inseparability of emptiness and luminosity is buddha-nature.</p>
              <p>As Buddha himself said in Phena Sutta about the emptiness of consciousness (which is a Pali sutta, which shows that emptiness teachings actually start from the original teachings itself):</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.095.than.html</a></p>
              <p>Form is like a glob of foam;
                                      feeling, a bubble;
                                      perception, a mirage;
                                      fabrications, a banana tree;
                                      <strong>consciousness, a magic trick</strong> —
                                      	this has been taught
                                      	by the Kinsman of the Sun.
                                      However you observe them,
                                      appropriately examine them,
                                      <strong>they're empty, void
                                      	to whoever sees them
                                      	appropriately. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, loads of practitioners in Buddhism still get stuck at substantialist non-dual phase, or the I AM phase.</p>

My usual daily practice consists of a morning session on the recitation of the Metta Sutta, the Heart Sutra (both of English translated format) and some Mantras with the aid of prayer beads. I would normally spend an hour before bedtime on sitting contemplation on any teaching of the Buddhist doctrine that come to mind. This practice do at time <span> </span>go on to two and up to three hours in one sitting if both body and mind are supple and willing on that day, though it happens only occasionally. These are the occasions when the mind is as its most lucid moment, and understanding and insight on the contemplated subject do tend to just flow in with amazing speed. </span></span></p>

I have recently turn to writing as I find that it requires a more in-depth understanding and insight of the subject matter than just reading up on the subject. It is also a way to share the dharmas with other Buddhists. Posting one’s writing on the ‘Wisdom Bliss’ site has the advantage of other fellow believers and moderators correcting one’s mistake and <span> </span>misinterpretation, and also addition information and insight on the subject other may have as well. </span></span></p>

              <p>From what I have realised the Heart Sutra indeed contains a lot of Buddhist principles although it is only 260 words long.

              Hi manjusaka,
              
              That is quite a deep topic. Do you practice any particular tradition at the moment? For a start may I recommend you to read these two articles carefully first, and if questions still arise feel free to ask:
              
              http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html
              
              Second article is not an article but a conversation I had with two forummers, see my first reply in http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/427556
              
              My suggestion is either you start with self inquiry first, or you start with vipassana first. Self-inquiry is a direct path leading to a direct realization of I Amness. It is the direct realization of luminosity and can serve as an important condition for non dual realization. From there you can practice a form of direct contemplation such as contemplating on Bahiyya Sutta so that realization of Anatta arises. Afterwards you can start contemplating on emptiness. This is my own approach and I have documented it in my e book and e journal, http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html
              
              Another way is to practice Vipassana such as the instructions in the above url. That also leads to the realization of Anatta.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My understanding is that you should have direct experiential realisation of luminosity and anatta first, otherwise your understanding of emptiness will remain theoretical. That is why it is important to first have a glimpse of the luminous essence and then contemplate on anatta.</div>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Heart Sutra is very popular and is chant at services in temples very often. My take is that, for most devotees, they just go through the motion of chanting it without any idea of what actually they are chanting about. The beauty of this sutra is that it covers the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teaching from the Theravada and concluding with Tantric Buddhism.</span></span></p>

If one is to do just that without going into the meaning of what it is trying to impart to us, it would be a waste of time except maybe, hopefully we will carried the imprint of the sutra with us into our next life and continue with our cultivation again from there.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The foundation of any religious practices starts with the cultivation of virtues, without which one would certainly make little progress in our spiritual cultivation. We can be very intelligent and understand most of the Buddhist teachings, but when it come to such realization as no-self and emptiness, a certain level of purification of our virtues are necessary for one to reached these levels.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I read somewhere in this forum where someone said that their relatives are practicing Buddhists, they go to temple to offer prayers on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> but on the other remaining days of the month they are back to their normal self, gambling, doing all the other ‘normal things’ in life and of course progressing nowhere in their cultivation and asking why. I also read somewhere, where an Indian devotee asked a holy man whether it is true that washing oneself in the Ganges will removed all the sins of a life time. Well, his answer was that, before one submerged oneself in the water all one’s sins will turn into a crow and flew off onto a branch of a tree, and when one emerges from the water, the crow will revert back to its original forms and return back into the person. How true.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddhist five precepts may sound very simple, but to strictly practice it would required the used of the faculty of mindfulness to its maximum. That is why mindfulness is considered to be one of the factors required for enlightenment. To start out with, try to carry out the practice of the five precepts as much, and as often as possible and couple with regular meditation, one should come to understand the Buddhist teachings and scriptures including the Heart Sutra in a much clearer and deeper manner with time. Of course the way to enlightenment for most of us is a gradual and slow process of learning and experiencing, but eventually, be it the realization of no-self or emptiness, one should be able to arrive to these stages in our own little way eventually.</span></span></p>

              <p>Heart sutra is about emptiness and if you can see through that everything is emptiness and impermanent ( I think heart sutra is more profound than these), it will help you to let go  a lot of worldly worries and things. You will be a happier person.</p>

              @an eternal now i do not practice any tradition of Buddhism at the moment because i don't know which form of Buddhism is suitable for me. I will look through your links first and try to grasp as much as possible before coming back to discuss about what I have managed to learn.
              
              @Aik TC thank you for your suggestion. the Ganges river example is a good analogy about how one needs to be continuous in one's practice of Buddhism.
              
              @Dawnfirstlight  for some reason, I was overwhelmed with guilt and cried when i listened to the Heart Sutra. Haha but mine is of the negative reaction, as compared to your master's. The line that i appreciate the most is "å¿ƒç„¡ç½£ç¤™ ç„¡ç½£ç¤™æ•… ç„¡æœ‰æ��æ€–" because I feel that there is a sense of empowerment in those words.
              
              Thank you every one.

              @manjusaka: btw a relevant thread is this: http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/424358
              
              Read the last two posts on that page on pegembara. It is about the right view of emptiness however the realization of luminosity and anatta has not arisen. See the next page for thusness's comments

              <p>This sutra is good cos It's easy to read.</p>
              <p>250 words and this sutra also sumarises the essense of diamond sutra.</p>
              <p>Diamond sutra is longer.</p>

              <p>Hi Manjusaka,</p>
              <p>-off-topic abit... There was once i also felt guilt and "watery eyes" when chanting. It's not Heart Sutra but another one.</p>
              <p>I was thinking why am I doing "here"? Why have I done in the "past"?</p>
              <p>Now I have a human body which is already very lucky. To have the chance to learn Dharma is even harder... When I know this, i try to maintain fitness for healthier mind. Luckily I also did not made any rash decisions like tattooing my body...</p>
              <p>But this body also must eat to survive. Need to work for food... lol</p>
              <p>And sleep... Waking up in the morning to work is sooo tiring lol (desire)</p>
              <p>Due to this body, i have the chance to learn Dharma, but also due to this body i can't do the things i want to do like sleeping haha... work work... life of a peasant</p>
