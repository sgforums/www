            <div class='col-md body'>Here it is:<br>From "Naked Awareness: Practical Instructions on the<br>Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen"<br>by Karma Chagme; with commentary by Gyatrul Rinpoche,<br>and translated by B. Alan Wallace.<br><br>From the Conclusion Chapter:<br>Bodhisattvas who voluntarily serve the needs of<br>sentient beings do not cringe at the miseries of the<br>cycle of existence. We, on the other hand, fear the<br>suffering of samsara, so if we wish to attain<br>spiritual awakening in a state of joy and happiness,<br>without experiencing suffering, we should pray to be<br>born in the realm of Sukhavati (Tib. Dewachen,<br>Bliss-Endowed--ktt). If we pray to be born<br>there--except in cases of sins of immediate<br>retribution and the abandonment of Dharma--our birth<br>there will be due to the power of Amitabha's prayers.<br>If we are reborn there, we will not have even the<br>slightest suffering, and our joy and happiness will be<br>abundant. We will be able to go miraculously to<br>Abhirati (Buddha Akshobya's pure land, usually needing<br>to be on 1st Bhumi...ktt), the Glorous Copper-colored<br>Mountain, and Tusita, meet [the buddhas there] and<br>receive the Dharma. With unimpeded extrasensory<br>perception and paranormal abilities, we will be able<br>to lead those with whom we have a connection out of<br>the intermediate state. For countless hundreds of<br>millions of eons, there will be no illness, no aging,<br>and no death. We will behold the face of Buddha<br>Amitabha and listen to Dharma. Incalculable clouds of<br>offerings will be emanated from the palms of our hands<br>and be offered to the buddhas. Thus, the qualities of<br>the grounds and paths will be perfected, and we will<br>become enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How easy is it to be born there? It is said that if<br>one earnestly prays ten times, one will take birth<br>there. There is no point is doubting whether or not<br>you will be born there. If you nurture doubts, you<br>will be born in that pure realm, but the lotus flower<br>[in which you are born] will not open for five hundred<br>years. It is said that during that time, you will<br>experience joy and happiness, and you will hear the<br>voice of the Buddha; but unfortunately there will be a<br>delay in seeing his face. Therefore, without harboring<br>doubts, tonight when you are about to sleep, you<br>should dedicate whatever spiritual practice you have<br>done today to be reborn there. If you know them,<br>recite The Prayer of Fine Conduct and The Sukhavati<br>Prayer, but if you do not know them, it is enough to<br>say, "May I be born in Sukhavati!" By so doing, when<br>you die--whether or not you are able to sustain your<br>spiritual practice, or succeed in the practice of<br>transference, or recognize the assemblies of peaceful<br>and wrathful deities in the transitional process of<br>reality-itself---two weeks after your death, you will<br>determine that you have died; and before the<br>messengers of Yama arrive, and before the verdict is<br>made concerning your actions and their karmic<br>consequences, with defiled extrasensory perception you<br>will be aware of your past and future lives and the<br>intermediate states. You will be able to demonstrate<br>various paranormal abilities, and you will have great<br>freedom to go where you will. At that time, hold<br>Buddha Amitabha in mind, and go to Sukhavati. There is<br>no doubt that you will go there simply by thinking of<br>it. (end of quote).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>--The author of this text, Karma Chagme Rinpoche, was<br>born in 1613. He took refuge, novice ordination, and<br>eventually full ordination from the Karmapa at Tsurphu<br>Monastery. He then entered Thupten Nyingling Monastery<br>of the Zurmang tradition.<br>In his 21st year he was given a public examination<br>during the Monlam of the Karma Kagyu order before a<br>gathering of 12,000 monks, which increased his already<br>considerable renown as an outstanding scholar.<br>Karma Chagme spent 13 years in retreat during which he<br>meditated on the form of Avalokitesvara known as<br>Jinasagara (Tib. Gyalwa Gyatso) as his chosen deity.<br>Karma Chagme passed away in the year 1678 after<br>announcing to thousands of his disciples that the time<br>had come for him to depart to another realm. He<br>revealed amazing signs at his death. It is said that<br>he dissolved his mind into the heart of Buddha<br>Amitabha, and after the cremation of his body many<br>images of Avalokitesvara Jinasagara were found to be<br>embossed on his bones.<br><br></div>
