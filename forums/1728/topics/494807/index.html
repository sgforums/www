              Palace in Tibet</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-11 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A “large-scale” 10-million-yuan (US$1.5 million) renovation
              project is planned for Tibet’s iconic Potala Palace, Chinese state media
              announced. The initiative, approved by the State Administration of Cultural
              Heritage (SACH), will focus on preserving the palace’s gold-plated roof and
              improving onsite security and surveillance systems at the complex, Xinhua News
              Agency reported.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sitting atop Red Mountain in the center of the Lhasa Valley
              at an altitude of 3,700 meters, the Potala Palace, named after Mount Potalaka,
              the mythical abode of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, was originally
              constructed during the 7th century and has since undergone several major
              reconstructions. Considered a masterpiece of Tibetan architecture, the complex
              is a major landmark and symbol of Tibetan Buddhism because of its central role
              in the traditional administration of Tibet and remains a major pilgrimage site
              for Tibetan Buddhists. The existing structure, which was listed as a UNESCO
              World Heritage Site in 1994, was completed in 1694 following a 45-year
              construction effort initiated by the 5th Dalai Lama, and later expanded to its
              current size by the 13th Dalai Lama in the early 20th century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">An official from the SACH noted that the renovation project
              would focus on protecting and extending the life of the palace’s ornate roof,
              which has been damaged by prolonged exposure to the harsh Himalayan climate.
              The SACH is an administrative agency under the Ministry of Culture charged with
              the management and development of museums, and the protection of sites and
              relics of national cultural significance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Originally the official winter residence of the Dalai Lama,
              the Potala Palace complex, which comprises more than 1,000 rooms and halls
              spread over 13 floors of the Red and White Palaces and numerous chapels and
              ancillary buildings, has since been converted into a public museum housing 698
              murals, nearly 10,000 thangkas, some 10,000 shrines, and more than 200,000
              statues, carpets, canopies, curtains, porcelain, jade, gold and silver objects,
              as well as an extensive library of sutras and historical documents.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The imposing walls, gates, and turrets, constructed from
              rammed earth and stone, are built to withstand earthquakes as the Himalayan
              region is prone to seismic disturbances. The White Palace houses the main
              ceremonial hall containing the throne of the Dalai Lama, with his private
              residence and audience hall at the uppermost level. The Red Palace, which
              contains gilded burial stupas of past Dalai Lamas, is devoted to Buddhist study
              and prayer, comprising halls, chapels, libraries, as well as smaller galleries
              and passages. Situated in the west of the complex is Namgyel Dratshang, the
              private monastery of the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The nearby 7th century Jokhang monastery, considered the most
              sacred Buddhist temple in Tibet, and the 18th century Norbulingka, the former
              summer residence of the Dalai Lamas, were added to the UNESCO World Heritage
              Site in 2000 and 2001, respectively.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The palace is the most popular and recognized tourist
              attraction in Tibet: an estimated 1.37 million domestic and international
              tourists visited the landmark in 2016, according to Xinhua. Earlier this year,
              four squat toilets built some 300 years ago and located at either end of the
              complex were replaced by modern washroom facilities inside wooden structures
              designed to blend in with architecture of the neighboring buildings. The news
              agency stated that the central government has spent close to 3 billion yuan
              (US$455.9 million) protecting the cultural heritage of the Tibet Autonomous
              Region over the past two decades.</span></p>
