              <p>Don't worry too much, but it is good to repent for any passion, aggression (anger, etc) and ignorance.<br><br>Because we repent for our unwholesome behaviours and thoughts, and vow not to commit the same mistakes again, in this way we will learn to be more patient, we will learn non-anger and this is helpful to our practice. If we don't repent we won't learn.</p>

              <p>I recall a talk by Ajahn Brahm - There was this man who did something wrong in his monastery. Then he sincerely came to Ajahn Brahm and asked to be punished for it. Ajahn Brahm said no need lah but there man insisted. So Ajahn Brahm has no choice and he gave the man his punishment of 50 strokes of cane. The man's face instantly went white. ha ha. He was also new to Buddhism. Then Ajahn Brahm broke a smile and just tell him jokingly. He meant 50 strokes of the cat. There are two cats in the monastery. Find one of the cat and stroke them 50 times</p>
              <p>He said to the man. Forgive yourself. we all make mistakes sometime. Learn from the mistakes.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, God put you in a certain situations as a test. There is no way he can come down and ask you to do a written exam but he can create situations whereby you have to self examine and able to self learn from.</p>

              <p>As long as you repent for your mistakes sincerely, make ammendments and practice the dharma, you can avoid the effects of karma even if the karma is originally very very serious.<br><br>e.g. Buddha said,<br><br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.070.than.html</p>
              <p>Then, throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One's feet, 
                      Ven. Susima said to the Blessed One, "A transgression has overcome me, 
                      lord, in that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, &amp; so unskilled as 
                      to go forth as a thief of the Dhamma in this well-taught Dhamma &amp; 
                      Discipline! May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my 
                      transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the future."</p>
              <p>"Yes, Susima, a transgression overcame you in that you were so 
                      foolish, so muddle-headed, &amp; so unskilled as to go forth as a thief 
                      of the Dhamma in this well-taught Dhamma &amp; Discipline. Suppose, 
                      Susima, that a robber, an evil-doer, having been caught, were shown to a
                       king: 'This, your majesty, is a robber, an evil-doer. Decree what 
                      punishment you want for him.' And so the king would say, 'Go and — 
                      having bound him with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against 
                      his back, having shaved him bald — march him to a harsh-sounding drum 
                      from street to street, crossroads to crossroads; evict him out the south
                       gate of the city and there, to the south of the city, cut off his 
                      head.' Then the king's men, having bound the man with a stout rope with 
                      his arms pinned tightly against his back, would march him to a 
                      harsh-sounding drum from street to street, crossroads to crossroads, 
                      evict him out the south gate of the city and there, to the south of the 
                      city, cut off his head. What do you think, Susima? Wouldn't that man, 
                      for that reason, experience pain &amp; distress?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>"However much the pain &amp; distress that man would experience for 
                      that reason, Susima, the Going Forth of a thief of the Dhamma in this 
                      well-taught Dhamma &amp; Discipline is still more painful in its result,
                       more bitter in its result, in that it leads even to the lower realms. 
                      But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in 
                      accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For, Susima, it 
                      is a cause of growth in the Dhamma &amp; Discipline of the noble ones 
                      when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance 
                      with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future."</strong></p>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Not long ago an
                  elderly man came to my temple and asked if he could do some cleaning for me. I
                  said he would be most welcome and he started coming once or twice a week.
                  Diligently but without hardly ever speaking  to me, he vacuumed, scrubbed and
                  generally made himself useful. However, he always looked rather sad, as if he
                  was carrying some heavy inner burden. One day as we sat sharing a 10 o’clock
                  tea, I asked him about himself and why he was volunteering to clean. After some
                  equivocation he told me his story. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">He was poor man
                  with little education. For much of his life he did backbreaking work unloading
                  cargo on the Singapore River. Some 15 years<span>  </span>previously his father died<span>  </span>leaving<span>  </span>his house to him  and his
                  sister. She maneuvered<span>  </span>him out of the
                  house and for the next 10 years he lived on the street; begging, dodging the police and eating out of
                  garbage cans. During this time he stole a bunch of bananas from one temple and
                  $100 from another. Eventually things turned around for him and he got a job, a
                  place to live and since then he has been okay. Except for one thing. He still
                  felt<span>  </span>profoundly ashamed and guilty<span>  </span>for having stolen from temples and feared <span> </span>that he will have to suffer what he called <span> </span>“kammic retribution”<span>  </span>in his next life.<span>  </span>After telling me about his thieving he
                  quickly reassured me that as soon as he got his first pay packet he put $10 in
                  the donation box of the temple where he had<span>  </span>stolen the bananas and made a $100 donation to the other one.<span>  </span>He was cleaning my temple he said because he
                  was trying to ‘clean away’ the “evil kamma” he had made. I told him that his
                  thieving was to some extent understandable <span> </span>given <span> </span>his circumstances at the time, and the fact
                  that he has made amends for it as soon as he was able indicated that he was
                  basically a good person. This did nothing to brighten him so I changed to
                  subject and asked him about his life as a navvy. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">During his
                  reminiscing he mentioned in passing that once he had <span> </span>saved two people who had fallen off a boat
                  from drowning. This interested me and I asked him for the details. Apparently
                  his bold and quick actions in saving the people had briefly made him a minor
                  celebrity and he even got his picture in the paper. It fascinated me that he
                  was still torturing himself over his thieving<span>  </span>but had barely remembered that he had once saved two lives. I mentioned
                  this to him and<span>  </span>added: <span> </span>“If<span>  </span>you
                  had a large pair of scales and you put a bunch of bananas and a $100 note on
                  one<span>  </span>pan and two people you saved on the
                  other, which do you think would be heaviest?” <span> </span>“The two people” he replied. I continued: <span> </span>“It is quite possible that those people you
                  saved still remember you and bless you for what you did for them. And yet you
                  hardly remember this noble deed. Stealing is not good, but saving a life is
                  good enough to cancel out that bad many times over. And you saved not one life but
                  two!”<span>  </span>Over the next weeks I reminded him
                  of this when we talked and even started jokingly referring to him as Lifesaver
                  Cheng (Cheng was his name). He started to become more talkative, smiled a bit
                  more and the last time I saw him he seemed to have become noticeably less
                  morose. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US"><span> </span>I am often amazed and saddened by the way some
                  people fixate on their mistakes, their failings, the wrong they have done, and
                  dismiss as unimportant their good deeds, if they remember it at all. If ruminating
                  on the negative changed their behavior for the better perhaps it would be

              <p>i watched <em>a korean movie called "Little Monk". The little monk have been living in the monastery from very young, and the Abbot have to enforce the 5 precepts on the little monk. Little monk recite the sutras everyday. And since he still do not understand what's the use of keeping precepts and do not know the real meaning (ie unenlighten yet)... few occasions, the little monk broke the precepts such as hunting rabbits and lying to the Abbot. The Abbot keep scoding and even punish the little monk, but he still don't get it. Until the end of the story (bad ending), the little monk cannot tolerate the attitude of the Abbot and left the monastrey to seek for his mother, which he long for, when seeing other kids have a mother.</em><br><em><br></em><em>Now, it's the little monk wrong, due to his ignorance/unenlightened?</em><br><br><em>we even as adults praxis are like the little monk, even though we recite /study the sutras and all, yet sometimes we still commit wrong, ...why? because we still are not enlightened. If we are enlightened, we would not be doing it.</em><br><br><em>In other word , are an unenlightened wrong, because they are unenlighten? no.</em><br><em>From this i no longer see that there's wrong in others even if they commit wrong, as they are not enlighten as yet, just like the little monk in the story.</em><br><br><em>Was touch by this realisation. </em></p>

              <p><br>i saw a car plate with a quote: "God governs/owns everything, we govern/own nothing". if u see"God" as a form of Tao/Way/Nature/Karma/Dharmakaya rather than an entity figure, then it's agreeable in Buddhism and in a final realisation that we are eventually "empty"/"nothing".</p>
