              <p>Hi there -</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In Buddhism, it is said that there is nothing in this world that is permanent (not even an unchanging universal "soul"/consciousness) whereas in Hinduism, there exists the concept of Brahman - that one eternal unchanging Awareness.  Is this a major contradiction/disagreement between the two religions or am I understanding it wrongly?  Could someone please explain?  </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thank you in advance.</span></p>

              <p>You don't need to have universal soul in order to have compassion. <br><br>I wrote in 2011:<br><em><br>In attempting to find and locate where thought comes from, reside, and go to, it is realised that thought is ungraspable, unfindable, unfathomable... A magician’s magical apparition, like everything (the experiential universe) is... A wonderful display of luminous emptiness, dependent origination. Yet after this is seen, it is nothing resembling nihilism or non-existence... When someone lights up his lighter to burn an innocent ant, compassion just arise... A magical universe demands magical response and compassion from no one to no one</em><br><br><br>Later I found another article that said about the same things:<br><br>http://luminousemptiness.blogspot.sg/2007/11/gampopa-and-compassion.html<br><em><br></em>Excerpt:<em><br><br>The third form of Compassion Gampopa talks about is that of 'Compassion 
              without Reference Point'. This is where we have developed sufficiently 
              that we see something of the true nature of things. We have some 
              experience of Shunyata, of Emptiness, and therefore we no longer cling 
              to the notion of person, of illness, of helping as solidly existent 
              'things'. As a result of seeing the play of mere appearances in mind, we
               don't attach to these illusory notions, and therefore we don't suffer 
              whilst helping alleviate suffering. We see this play of appearances, 
              which are ultimately empty, but at the same time, we recognise that the 
              'person' before us does not see this. <br><br>We also see that the 
              difference between seeing things as they are, and of grasping onto the 
              solidity or reality of things, is, in a sense, razor thin. The 
              difference is so slender between seeing, and not seeing. <br><br>When 
              the experience of emptiness arises, we see that seeing how things are, 
              and seeing with ignorance is the most subtle shift, in a sense, (and yet
               the most enormous shift, in another sense!!!!). We see how easy it is 
              to lose this 'view', both during, and between meditations. We slip into 
              it and out of it so easily. So, we have an appreciation of how small a 
              shift it is, in a sense, and how 'easy' it could be for those suffering 
              beings to see in accordance with the nature of things, to act in 
              accordance with the nature of things, and therefore not suffer. That 
              recognition of how 'easy' it would be for them to not suffer becomes the
               cause for a great compassion to arise in us. The recognition of how 
              unnecessary that suffering is, indeed, how unnecessary and how easily 
              thrown off.<br><br>Further, the recognition from the previous stage (and
               classification) that we ourselves self-cause our own suffering is 
              deepened here - with the addition of now seeing the potential 'ease' of 
              throwing it off. <br><br>At this stage, our compassion arises without 
              having an object, as we no longer 'see' any being to be the object of 
              our compassion. Indeed, we no longer see 'ourselves' as being 
              compassionate, nor see the 'act' of compassion either. We see the play 
              of empty appearances - and yet, and yet ... we act. How is this? How can
               we act, when we no longer see sentient beings, as such? Well, from my 
              very limited experience, this Compassion is the natural response, the 
              natural outpouring of the mind that sees things as they are. It's as if 
              when we take all this mistaken understanding and seeing out of the way, 
              what lay beneath - the sun behind the clouds - can pour forth its 
              energy, which had been previously obscured and dammed up.<br><br>- an 
              attempt to clarify in my own mind my own confusion, and previous 
              potentially confusing post ... in the hope it might also be of help to 
              others -<br><br>may we all give rise to the Compassion that has no reference point ... </em></p>
