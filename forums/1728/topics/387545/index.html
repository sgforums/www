              <p>  ------------------------------------------<br>          What do Buddhists consider Wisdom<br>          Venerable Mahinda<br>          --------------------------------------------------<br>          Abridgement of Unibuds Dhamma talk given on Friday,<br>           August 20th 1993 at the University of NSW.<br>          -----------<br><br>          Wisdom is a very important quality to possess. Wisdom is<br>          very clearly spelt out in the teachings of the Buddha,<br>          in the Noble Eightfold Path. The Noble Eightfold Path<br>          consists of 1 Right Understanding, 2 Right Thought, 3<br>          Right Speech, 4 Right Action, 5 Right Livelihood, 6<br>          Right Effort, 7 Right Mindfulness, and 8 Right<br>          Concentration.<br><br>          Panna (wisdom) comprises Right Understanding and Right<br>          Thought. Right Understanding means to know and<br>          understand the Four Noble Truths.<br>          Right Thought means to think three kinds of thoughts:<br>          - Thoughts of renunciation or thoughts which do not have<br>          lustful desires.<br>          - Thoughts of goodwill to others as opposed to thoughts<br>          of illwill.<br>          - Thoughts of harmlessness as opposed to cruelty.<br><br>          The Noble Eightfold Path can lead us to the end of<br>          suffering and all conflicts. However in order to get<br>          into this path it takes us a certain amount of wisdom.<br><br>          Right understanding refers to our understanding of<br>          fundamental truths about life and the world around us.<br>          We should try to understand two laws; the Four Noble<br>          Truths and the law of cause and effect - karma. This is<br>          very basic and fundamental to Buddhism.<br><br>           Every action has a reaction just like Newton's 3rd law<br>          of motion. Karma has both physical and moral effects.<br>          Good begets good and evil begets evil. A good doer<br>          experiences evil as long as the good karma ripens not.<br>          There are people who indulge in wrong things and appear<br>          to have good lives. The results of their actions will<br>          come back to them sooner or later. Also those who<br>          perform unwholesome or bad actions are reborn in<br>          unfortunate states.</p>
              <p><br>           When you practice with a higher, more peaceful state of<br>          mind, your higher understanding of karma allows you to<br>          transcend worldly existence. You must train your minds.<br>          For example, you hear me now, the vibration of my voice<br>          box - this is the cause. The sound hits your eardrum...<br>          The process of hearing involves so many individual<br>          causes and effects If you understand this, that when<br>          causes arise, affects also arise, your wisdom for<br>          responding to other events in your life will improve.<br>           We must understand dhukka. Dhukka is suffering, or<br>          unsatisfactoriness. Associating with conditions<br>          or unfulfilled desires, subjects you don't<br>          like, people you don't enjoy, is dhukka. For example,<br>          how long can you laugh? One day? Two? Three? Even<br>          laughter is dhukka. You cannot maintain your laughter.<br><br>           The Five grasping Aggregates are also dhukka. These<br>          five characteristics of self-awareness are; 1 Physical<br>          form which has given rise to the body, 2 Feelings and<br>          sensations, 3 Perception, 4 Mental formations, thoughts<br>          and imagination, and 5 Conciousness.</p>
              <p><br>           If you don't grasp the aggregates, they come and go. If<br>          you grasp the aggregates, that is, if you grab your<br>          thoughts, objects and you think it is real, it will<br>          <em>condition</em> some emotions in you. Then you will attach<br>          yourself to the feelings/emotions you have generated to<br>          the sensations/object you have grasped. After you have<br>          attached yourself to something and you lose it, you get<br>          very upset.<br><br>          To overcome suffering you need to overcome your craving.<br>          You should follow the Noble Eightfold Path and try to<br>          always see things as they are. Whether you are Buddhist, Christian, or<br>          Muslim, this change will happen to you!<br><br>          The truth of existence is that everything is changing.<br>          Anything that is changing is dhukka. Is your body yours?<br>          Can you keep your body? Your hair, which you love so<br>          much keeps falling out. Also your nails, your teeth,<br>          your skin... They are all dying cells, but you cling to<br>          them, cling to your eyebrows, and you give them pastel.<br><br>           Delusion is looking in the mirror and thinking you can<br>          keep your beautiful looks. The body is made up of<br>          elements. When you die and they put you in a box, your<br>          body will be reduced to carbon and perhaps a few <br><br>           But wisdom is not the pure accumulation of knowledge<br>          and theories. These dhamma talks you attend I hope will<br>          help compliment your university studies. Tell me which<br>          Faculty teaches you how to overcome your craving ? Which<br>          Faculty helps you overcome your anger ? Everytime you<br>          radiate thoughts of loving kindness to all sentient<br>          beings, you are building your wisdom. Your compassion<br>          helps others, removes their fears, and anxieties and<br>          gives them confidence. I hope you have all gained some<br>          wisdom this evening !<br><br>          Abridgement of Dhamma talk given on Friday, August 20th<br>          1993 at the UNSW as reported by Mick Kiddle.</p>
