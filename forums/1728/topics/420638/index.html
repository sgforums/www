              <p> My question is how to do it as we are living in a society
              where there are times when there are absolute right and wrong.
              Later I realise what shifu meant is not for us to behave like a
              stone. What he meant is we still can have views of right and wrong
              but let go of the thoughts once the matter is settled.</p>
              <p> There is a Buddhist story, can't remember exactly but it
              is something like that : A young monk and an old monk met
              a young lady while crossing a river. The young lady asked the old
              monk to carry her across the river. The old monk carried her across
              the river and let her down after crossing the river.</p>
              <p>The young monk was very puzzled and asked the old monk why he
              carried the young lady as he was a monk. Monks are supposed to
              distance themselves from è‰². The old monk replied he had already let
              go of the lady just now and why the young monk was still carrying
              her till now.</p>

              <p>84000 dharma doors... how to answer you?</p>
              <p>My answer is: whatever suits you...</p>
              <p>Personally, I used self-inquiry and it has bore results in a rather short time (two years). The practice of asking yourself, 'Who am I?' As taught by certain Zen masters like Ch'an Master Hsu Yun.</p>
              <p>There are also many other zen koans and meditation techniques... I will not elaborate too much at the moment.</p>
              <p>But here is something for you to ponder:</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/self-liberation-through-seeing-with.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/self-liberation-through-seeing-with.html</a><br><br>7.<br><br>Now, when you are introduced (to your own intrinsic awareness), the method for entering into it involves three considerations:<br>Thoughts in the past are clear and empty and leave no traces behind.<br>Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.<br>And in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own condition without constructing anything,<br>awareness, at that moment, in itself is quite ordinary.<br>And when you look into yourself in this way nakedly (without any discursive thoughts),<br>Since there is only this pure observing, there will be found a lucid clarity without anyone being there who is the observer;<br>only a naked manifest awareness is present.<br>(This awareness) is empty and immaculately pure, not being created by anything whatsoever.<br>It is authentic and unadulterated, without any duality of clarity and emptiness.<br>It is not permanent and yet it is not created by anything.<br>However, it is not a mere nothingness or something annihilated because it is lucid and present.<br>It does not exist as a single entity because it is present and clear in terms of being many.<br>(On the other hand) it is not created as a multiplicity of things because it is inseparable and of a single flavor.<br>This inherent self-awareness does not derive from anything outside itself.<br>This is the real introduction to the actual condition of things.</p>

              <p>Letting go is super important... but letting go alone doesn't lead to illumination. Some form of contemplative practice is necessary... a direct looking into your own nature.</p>

                  is not a matter of ‘will’, it is a matter of prajna wisdom and only
                  in Buddhism this is pointed out and for this I am grateful to
