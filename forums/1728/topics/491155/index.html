              matter like appointing a new Supreme Patriarch has become deeply politicised.
              In the name of religions, anything is possible -- violence, random killings,
              invasions, wars, repression, you name it. Even one of the supposedly most
              peaceful religions on earth, Buddhism, is no exception. Thailand is only
              extremely unfortunate that the two most divisive forces -- politics and
              religions -- are showing their worst sides at the same time.</span></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 18.25pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>My intent here is not to deplore the politicisation of the quest
              for a new Sangha leader. What I want to know is how Buddhism in Thailand, which
              proudly considers itself a haven of the "true dharma", has shifted
              from "detachment" to absolute selfish intolerance. On display in the
              ongoing showdown between supporters of different candidates for the country's
              top ecclesiastic post is almost everything that was renounced by Lord Buddha.
              Are we a "Buddhist" nation, or simply a country full of clueless
              acolytes?<br> <br> Let's take a look at the Supreme Patriarch controversy in parallel with
              Buddhism's core principles, one by one.<span> </span><br> <br> First, we have "detachment". The doctrine stemmed from the Buddha's
              fundamental belief that nothing belongs to us, least of all the titles bestowed
              by society or religion. Buddhists are encouraged to let go of all material
              goods, luxuries, pain, bitterness and even glory. The goal is to realise that
              nothing lasts, so we won't waste our time chasing what is at root impermanent
              and delusory.<br> <br> Are you practising detachment by threatening turmoil if your preferred choice
              for Supreme Patriarch is rejected? In other words, is that a "Buddhist
              thing" to do?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18.25pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'> The next doctrine is the "middle path". Lord Buddha discouraged his
              followers from taking up extreme or fanatical positions. At the same time he
              warned them against being lax or complacent in their behaviour. He wanted them
              to be flexible and alive to the constantly changing world. One analogy familiar
              to Buddhists is the strings of a musical instrument: Too tight and they will break;
              too loose and they become unplayable.<br> <br> Have the different camps taken the middle path in setting a collision course
              over the Supreme Patriarch affair? You tell me.<br> <br> Then we have the Noble Truths of "suffering and its causes". Love,
              greed, anger and lust are sure-fire ways, Buddhists are warned, of becoming
              stuck in the cycle of worldly misery. In other words, they are detachment's
              greatest enemies. While non-Buddhists might balk at the notion of
              "love" as an obstacle to enlightenment (although the Buddha was
              likely not referring to love in its truest, ultimate form), it has played no
              part in the current confrontation anyway. The other three causes, however, are
              dictating the course of the controversy.<br> <br> Another decidedly un-Buddhist trait on display in the Supreme Patriarch fiasco
              is perhaps not given a name in Lord Buddha's teachings. It's the urge to
              control, to suppress others, and to be omnipotent. It's the opposite of
              selflessness. What we are witnessing is vanity running amok.<br> <br> Genuine Buddhism has never been about control or domination. It requires no
              holy war, as Lord Buddha never aspired to forcibly convert the world. Every
              follower is encouraged to scrutinise and test his teachings and granted
              absolute freedom to do so.<br> <br> You don't go to hell if you turn away from the religion. Buddhists parents are
              not obliged to have their children profess the same belief. (It's true that
              Buddhism is the state religion in some countries, but only because it has
              become enmeshed in politics and degraded there.)<span> </span><br> <br> Simply put, you are either a Buddhist or not, and the Lord Buddha was equally
              tolerant of either condition. In other words, you can be a Buddhist in a
              community that embraces another religion or you can hold a separate faith in a
              community of Buddhists. This principle means that you can be a true Buddhist no
              matter who is the Supreme Patriarch.<br> <br> In fact, the concepts of letting go, impermanence and the causes of suffering
              undermine the significance lent to the title of Supreme Patriarch. While
              Buddhists do organise their clergy by rank, becoming so obsessed with rank, as
              is the case in Thailand at the moment, goes against everything Lord Buddha
              stood for.<br> <br> On the surface, the concept of the middle path sounds simple to the point of
              being facile, so much so that it has been mocked by non-Buddhists. They believe
              that the path between extremes is for the weak and non-adventurous, a choice
              made by those who want to "play it safe".<br> <br> What escapes their attention is how difficult it is to walk the thin line that
              separates the noble from the selfish. Those under the sway of fear, anger or
              the urge to dominate will pass on those vices through their actions. So-called
              Thai Buddhists at each other's throat over who should be next Supreme Patriarch
              are angry, fearful, virtually blind, and standing on the threshold of the dark
              side.</span></p>
