AEN, can u share with what u know abt this if u know ?</div></blockquote>IMHO, would appreciate others comments too,<br><br>Certain habitual tendencies are good... and not necessarily all habits are bad. However most habitual tendencies are also a form of mental defilements... they are caused by a form of attachment that has deeply rooted in our consciousness.  Habitual tendencies... which can be a whole different range of different habits... are usually due to our mental defilements of craving and attachment.<br><br>Regarding mental suffering caused by 'myself'... At first hand it seems like its the OTHER party that is causing MY mental suffering... but when we look deeper we realise that this is due to our fundamental dualistic assumption, that there is a self and other... and the self gets hurt by the other. This dualistic, egoic assumption is what we call our basic ignorance... and we are completely bonded by this habitual, karmic momentum or karmic propensities... such that we are bonded to the "I" thought not only in everyday lives but lifetime after lifetime. We invest in the "I" thought all the time because we do not know about liberation... we do not know about anatta (no-self).. and so we identify with images and ideas and stories of "who I am" and constantly try to protect this image of "who I am" or perhaps the "other party" failed to give "who I am" happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self... and we suffer when "who I am" got hurt by the other party or our demands are not met. If we dwell on this kind of ignorant dualistic thinking... there can be no end to suffering. But if we were to deeply investigate... there really is no self to be found. 'Self' is merely just a fictitious notion of the mind.<br><br>If there is no identification, we are completely transparent, there is just resting in whatever is happening without dwelling in mental content.. just thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations arising and passing with no agent experiencing and suffering from them. What is it like? First we have to ask.. what is the "me" in reality? Like Toni Packer said... <span style="font-style: italic;">Now, is there such an entity as me or I? Or is it just like the weather - an ongoing, ever-changing stream of ideas, images, memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creation and destruction, that thought keeps calling I, me, Toni, and thereby solidifying what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I merely think and believe I am?</span> Rather than dwelling on our thoughts and mental suffering on the assumption of a separate self that is getting hurt, can we just watch the extraordinary phenomena, or 'clouds of the 5 skhandas' unfold on its own? <span style="font-style: italic;">The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness, our true being, is here all the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Light is here in spite of cloud cover.</span> And when we are truly transparent, how can we be hurt? Our Buddha Nature is sometimes described as space-like... can space be hurt?<br><br>But as Thusness said this supposed bond, in reality doesn't exist anywhere... it is really just the ignorance itself. It is really that lack of clarity itself (and can still persist even after glimpses of no-self until the insight has penetrated deeply enough and stabilised). Mental suffering is caused by identification with the self... which is called the ego. However there is something important worth mentioning...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ego is a process of<br>identification, not a thing in and of itself. It is like a bad habit, but it doesn't exist as something that can be found. This is important, as this bad habit can quickly co-opt the language of egolessness and come up with phrases as absurd as: Â“I will destroy my ego!Â” But, not being a thing, it cannot be destroyed, but by understanding our bare experience, our minds, the process of identification can stop. Any thoughts with Â“I,Â” Â“me,Â” Â“myÂ” and Â“mineÂ” in them should be understood to be just thoughts which come and go. This is not something you can talk yourself out of. You have to perceive things as they are to stop this process.<br><br>~ Dharma Dan</span><br><br>So as you can see... it's the bad habit of ignorance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Now to go back to your question is mental suffering caused by myself... from the viewpoint of Anatta it is neither caused by myself nor others... there never was a dualistic relation in the first place.. neither is it caused by the 'ego' as if it has inherent existence... but only ignorant dualistic identification, apparently reacting to 'being hurt by others', and when this is seen for what it is rather than continued being identified, there is liberation.<br><br>Do also read: <a href="http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1677" rel="nofollow">What is this me?</a> by Toni Packer</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think.. People tend to causes unnecessary suffering for themselves. Most of us are actually born quite fortunate in singapore; not suffering from poverty or hunger and born healthy. Since we are actually living in a quite an alright environment, what is then the cause of this mental suffering and dissatisfaction/unhappiness that we are feeling now?<br><br>I think.. when we hurt others, we are actually hurting ourselves. It is actually not the person or thing that cause the pain and suffering to you. It is own anger/delusion/greed  aka defilement that arises in you that causes the mental and emotional disturbances.<br><br>So where does this defilement arises from? Habitual tendency to react in a  certain matters or should i say it is the karmic seeds that has been imprinted in your mind since aeons of lifetime. It just needs the right condition to present for the defilement to arise and disappear.<br><br>I remember replying this in another thread in BMB<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">I think firstly, you have to work with yourself.

However most habitual tendencies are also a form of mental defilements... they are caused by a form of attachment that has deeply rooted in our consciousness.  Habitual tendencies... which can be a whole different range of different habits... are usually due to our mental defilements of craving and attachment.<br><br>Regarding mental suffering caused by 'myself'... At first hand it seems like its the OTHER party that is causing MY mental suffering... but when we look deeper we realise that this is due to our fundamental dualistic assumption, that there is a self and other... and the self gets hurt by the other. This dualistic, egoic assumption is what we call our basic ignorance... and we are completely bonded by this habitual, karmic momentum or karmic propensities... such that we are bonded to the "I" thought not only in everyday lives but lifetime after lifetime. We invest in the "I" thought all the time because we do not know about liberation... we do not know about anatta (no-self).. and so we identify with images and ideas and stories of "who I am" and constantly try to protect this image of "who I am" or perhaps the "other party" failed to give "who I am" happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self... and we suffer when "who I am" got hurt by the other party or our demands are not met. If we dwell on this kind of ignorant dualistic thinking... there can be no end to suffering. But if we were to deeply investigate... there really is no self to be found. 'Self' is merely just a fictitious notion of the mind.<br><br></div></blockquote>mm i havent see the non-self yet as i haven't start the insight meditation thingy but i have already see so much sufferings caused by this notion called self.

This is what I experienced during financial crisis in 1997.  Before that I thought I was not that attached to $$$ but when threaten by bankruptcy all sort of thoughts arised, including very evil ones.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>To live in present moment from a practice perspective is to be in naked awareness, where awareness is completely clear, non-dual and unmolested.  It is not seeking anything and awareness rest in its orginality.  Puting this mind state into daily activities is known as non-action and does not carry karma and this is the difficult part.  This is different from those '1 second manager' sort of concepts that train one to be effective and efficient in achieving goals.<br><br>With regards to ur exams and utube example, it is a matter of being focus that requires u to 'jing and ding' in order to concentrate.  In this case both are still attachment. If u study with ur best effort yet not affected by the  the outcome, you are non-attached.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
