            <div class='col-md body'>i read up sometime in those legends books from library couple of years back ago, i remember something abt the story of garlic.<br><br>a long time ago, when "time" existed, time seems to be alive at that time. there was this great demon king. there was some dispute or a great war, i cant rem, and the whole land was at war with the demon king .<br>someone or something or some metaphor slain the demon's head and thus conquer great evil and the universe was saved.<br>but the demon vapourised, remains are garlic.<br><br>well, remains of demon kings. shouldnt be any good if it help prevent any cancer or disease.<br>---------------------------------------------------<br>In the Shurangama Sutra (Mahayana school), The Buddha explains how the "Five Pungent Spices", including garlic and onions, are forbidden:<br><br>Beings who seek samadhi should refrain from eating [the] five pungent plants of this world. If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire; if they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger. (2)<br><br>Furthermore, the gods "will stay far away from them because they smell bad, [and] hungry ghosts will hover around and kiss their lips". (2) Being around ghosts will hinder one's quest for enlightenment. These demons have the power to appear as false Buddhas and speak false Dharma. The Buddha further warns that in the Dharma-ending Age (the age in which we are now) there will be an abundance of false prophets, or ghosts and demons who will appear as Bodhissatvas. Those who are so far off the path might believe in or be possessed by ghosts or demons mascarading as enlightened masters. These demons might talk the misguided ones into consuming "excrement and urine, or meat and wine" and justify it.<br><br>1) Garlic<br>2) Onions<br>3) Shallots<br>4) Leeks<br>5) Asafoetida (hing)<br>--------------------------------<br>The Shurangama Sutra, Volume 7, Part One, discusses the process of overcoming the basic cause of random thoughts that fill the mind and eliminate attentiveness.<br><br>"...Beings who seek samadhi should refrain from eating five pungent plants of this world.<br><br>"If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire; if they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger.<br><br>[Note: The scriptures do not warn against all pungent plants, only those in the garlic/onion family. There is no advice against ginger, for example.]<br><br>If this simple, straightforward rationale fails to sway the samadhi-seeker the sutra, like many other religious texts, makes its point with no lack of imagery:<br><br>"Therefore, even if people in this world who eat pungent plants can expound the twelve divisions of the Sutra canon, the gods and immortals of the ten directions will stay far away from them because they smell so bad. However, after they eat these things the hungry ghosts will hover around and kiss their lips. Being always in the presence of ghosts, their blessings and virtue will dissolve as the days go by, and they will experience no lasting benefit.<br><br>"People who eat pungent plants and also cultivate samadhi will not be protected by the Bodhisattvas, gods, immortals, or good spirits of the ten directions; therefore, the tremendously powerful demon kings, able to do as they please, will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak Dharma for them, denouncing the precepts and praising lust, rage, and delusion.<br><br>"When their lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon kings. When they use up their blessings as demons, they will fall into the unintermittent hell.<br><br>"Ananda, those who cultivate for Bodhi should never eat the five pungent plants. [1]<br><br>So, to summarize, the scriptures warn that pungent plants are to be avoided because obstacles to the spiritual path increase when they are eaten.<br><br>well, the story i posted might be true. who knows..?  just aviod eating the pungent plants</div>

In their search for SamÃ dhi, they<br>should abstain from eating five kinds of pungent roots (i.e.<br>garlic, the three kinds of onions and leeks); if eaten cooked,<br>they are aphrodisiac and if raw, they cause irritability.<br>Although those who eat them may read the twelve divisions<br>of the MahÃ yÃ na canon, they drive away seers (Ã§Ã¹i) in the ten<br>directions who abhor the bad odour, and attract hungry<br>ghosts who lick their lips. They are always surrounded by<br>ghosts, and their good fortune will fade away day by day to<br>their own detriment. When these eaters of pungent roots<br>practise SamÃ dhi, none of the Bodhisattvas, seers and good<br>spirits come to protect them, while the mighty king of<br>demons takes advantage of the occasion to appear as a<br>Buddha as if to teach them the Dharma, defaming and<br>breaking the precepts and praising carnality, anger and stupidity;<br>at their death, they will join his retinue, and at the end<br>of their time in his realm, they will fall into the unintermittent<br>hell. Ã¢nanda, practisers of SamÃ dhi should never eat these<br>five pungent roots. This is the first step of gradual practice.[/b]</blockquote>Did the Buddha really uttered this?<br><br>If I remember correctly, Dr K Sri Dhammanda said Buddha did not uttered the above, abt eating garlic and other stuff.<br><br></div>
