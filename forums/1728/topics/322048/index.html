              <p>It seems that this monk"Miao Fa" had some sort of psychic power which he uses to help others.As to cross-generational karmic effects,personally I do think they exist,though I can't find any scriptural support yet.It may have something to do with bloodline,maybe like certain hereditary diseases(haemophilia?)that pass down from generation to generation in a bloodline.If one has done a considerable amount of good works in one's lifetime,I don't think  the descendants do not benefit one iota at all.If there is collective karma,perhaps there is bloodline karma too.What is more important is that this monk could help others ,with concrete results.I also don't think he would lie as a monk,or utter something that he himself had not experientially known to be true.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This story sounds like telling people that ancestor's karma pass to descendants.<br>My opinion is if the ancestor make some bad karma and deem to suffer from it, for example bankrupt for many lifes.<br>Then the condition will be that only those beings that has similar karma or habitual tendency will be born as his children. æ‰€è°“ç‰©ä»¥ç±»è�š. Just like people who like to have fun talk more often with fun loving people. Coz they click. Of coz these beings must have some karmic relationship with this guy in order to be naturally attracted to his family.<br><br>However, this can be overriden if the person to be born has strong vow. For example a bodhisatva who want to go to a poor family to help the people. Or let's say a being that want to take revenge vow to born in his enemy's family to destroy what he has. Sometimes they don't need to make any "official" vow, they just deeply feel it, that's it.<br>That's why purelanders should abolish their hatred and greed on worldly stuffs.<br><br>Our mind is a very powerful tool. There was a research done in a university, and it shows that when a person think something, this can affect people around him even without any word spoken. The effect multiply if more people have same thinking at the same time. If I remember correctly the formula, it is like 100 * (mind * number of people) square.<br>Got this time I chat face to face with some high venerables, I just feel that they very compassion and nice, don't know why.<br><br>So back to the story, the bad karma that his ancestor done is in a loop coz there are still people who read this ghost stories. That's why my master told me if one so strongly hates a person and think about it everyday, the bad karma can be more serious than killing a person.</p></div>

              <p>In my understanding, karma cannot be passed down from ancestor to descendent.</p>
              <p>Karma is individual, and karma means actions/volition or a momentum that forms imprint in our 8th consciousness. If the seed is not there, committed by the individual through his action from mind/speech/action in his past life or a past time, he will not have such karma at all. And he will not have such karmic ripening.</p>
              <p>First of all <strong>we must understand that there is no such thing as a collective 8th consciousness</strong>. There is only individual streams of 8th consciousness, individual mindstreams, no collective mind. A collective mind/consciousness is a non-Buddhist, å¤–é�“ concept. This does not mean that supernatural powers and mind reading (and so on) cannot occur, they occur due to the non-locality/emptiness/dependent arising nature of consciousness, but has nothing to do with a collective mind... and the true nature of all being's consciousness is luminous and empty.</p>
              <p>Conventionally speaking, we MUST take it that mindstream, karma, and various physical-mental conditionings are separate, individual streams, (i.e. not 'collective') even though ultimately they are empty of self and phenomena, merely dependently arisen appearances, each moment is spontaneous and absolute in itself, and inseparable from causes and conditions. Why do I say they are individual? Because there are different sets of causes and conditionings, producing different sets of experiences. There is no shared entity or consciousness of any sorts -- consciousness is inseparable from causes and conditionings. Due to karmic vision, human sees red flower, dog sees black and white, ghost sees river as fire, and so on. Nothing 'shared' at all -- only causes and conditionings producing illusory appearances, fundamentally empty, yet a vivid appearance of luminosity. Every experience is different due to different conditionings, there is no such thing as a 'same' or 'shared' consciousness, even though all diverse phenomena have one taste -- luminous-emptiness.</p>
              <p>However, it is possible that a group of people, committing the same deeds, plant the same kind of seeds, and as a result create what we call collective karma.</p>
              <p>That means, in each individual 8th consciousness mindstream, through the same sort of actions they performed together, they each form the same kind of imprints in their 8th consciousness. As a result, some time in the future when conditions are ripen, they will 'collectively' ripen together.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, this has nothing to do with ancestors passing down karma into descendents. This is because the ancestor and the descendent are separate mindstreams, and if the descendents have not had the same karmic seed as the ancestor in their 8th consciousness, they cannot possibly have the same sort of occurences.</p>
              <p>But, it is possible that through the karma of an individual, i.e. the conditions are there, to conceive a child with illnesses and things like that due to the karma of his own action. This is not because his own karma caused the child to have illness, but because somehow the causes and conditions are there, both the parent and child have the same resonating causes and conditions to be born in the same family.</p>
              <p>For example, there is a true story about two parents who had been good in their whole life, but conceived a retarded child. They found a venerable to ask about the karmic causes, the venerable told him that this child was a druglord in his past life. The parents ask why do they have to be born in my family? The venerable answered that you two were his accomplice in his past life. So now you have to take care of him for your whole life. Because of the various karmic conditionings, they all appear in the same family. It is not because of their ancestors, or not because of one person's personal actions, but due to every single person's karma that such congregation is possible.</p>
              <p>Therefore good ancestors can get good descendents, but in the case of a 'great grandfather' or 'great great grandfather', I can't really see how that is possible. It could be possible that the person himself is the great great grandfather in his past life.</p>

              <p>i was wondering,</p>
              <p>let's say this cult leader, preaching/influencing his unwholesome idea to his followers. and then his followers accepted this idea, go and commit unwholesome action. yes, the unwholesome Karma is commit individual by the followers. they'll reap what they sowed. yet, the cult leader having also responsible for the unwholesome Karma commited by his followers, will too have his karma reap in the lowest realms.  so cult leader reap what he sowed.</p>
              <p>i think a group of individual (ie individual +individual +individual ..) makes a collective. and within collective, there's individuals. collective does not negate individual, non do individual negate collective.<br>the idea of individual and collective are non-dual.</p>

              <p>So this monk was wrong?</p>
              <p>But from the book ,it does appear that the "remedies" he prescribes are efficacious.</p>
              <p>Wouldn't he have broken the precepts if he utters false words as a monk?</p>
              <p>This particular monk proves that he is not a mere Dharma theoretician,but can actually</p>
              <p>help people with day-to-day troubles.</p>
              <p>   Anyway,I happened to pick up this book from a public book rack,and browsed through</p>
              <p>it.Friends here can read the original Chinese version posted in this thread by sinweiy.I think such books do have value as they teach aspiring Dharma leaners not to create</p>
              <p>bad karma in their thoughts and acts.</p>

              <p>   My translation above has some errors.</p>
              <p>  Such Buddhist literature are not canonical,but for beginners,they are valuable as they can nudge them to delve deeper into the Dharma.</p>
              <p>For the convenience of readers here who can read Chinese,I have cut and paste sinweiy's post.I hope AEN don't mind.(This is supposed to be an English forum.)</p>

              <p>Hi Uncreated,</p>
              <p>Had read through the chinese text that you had posted, I don't see it inspiring in anyway. Rather it seems to cross the fine-line from pre-conditioning to predetermined.</p>
              <p>And there's no ISO certificate or whatsoever that gives guarantee that monks don't lie.</p>
              <p>Especially coming to Mahayana tradition where sometimes the characteristic of expedient means may be abused.</p>
              <p>Just to say upfront, I'm not saying whether this monk is lying or not, however I believe buddhists who know the proper Buddha-Dhamma would know how kamma actually works.</p>
              <p>But of course, some would actually enjoy such stories.</p>
              <p>Regards.</p>

              <p>yah, personally, i agree that one has to suffer the effect passed down by generation. But its quite not believable that Mr B is the one suffer, why not the ones immediately after the ancestor who wrote the book? Maybe Mr B has not done enough good deeds to shield himself from the effect?</p>
