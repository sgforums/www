              <p>I posted in <a href="http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/discussion/-/message_boards/message/2075348">http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/discussion/-/message_boards/message/2075348</a></p>
              <p>There are two benefits, in my experience, to no-self realization and experience.<br><br>1) liberation<br><br><br>By
               liberating the view that there is a real self, it stops clinging. To 
              what? Clinging to a sense that there is a 'me', a solid subject, or more
               subtly a sense of being or awareness... apart from the flow of sensate 
              phenomenality.<br><br>All sufferings come from clinging (clinging to 
              something as 'me', something as 'mine'), and all clingings/attachments 
              basically come down to two views: 'is', and 'is not'. If there is no 
              self or agent, then 'is' and 'is not' of a self does not apply. For 
              example: imagine you are deluded about the nature of wind, and you think
               that there is a windness behind the blowing, so you grasp onto this 
              construct of an inherent windness and obviously when the blowing changes
               from what you want or see it to be, 'you' suffer. But when you truly 
              see that there is no 'windness' of wind, that 'wind' is merely a label 
              for an ungraspable process of blowing, then what is left is simply the 
              blowing activities. There is no more clinging to 'windness' or relating 
              particular activities as 'belonging to a wind'.<br><br>Relating back to 
              'self': there is no 'self', 'awareness', 'subject' being 'here' to be 
              clung to. There is no me, no I, no ownership... only the aggregates that
               simply 'flows'. There is nothing that is inherently 'me', or 'mine'. 
              There is no more clinging or relating things back to a self or owner 
              which results in craving and aversion, and this is very liberating.<br><br>What's left: referenceless, ownerless, disjoint, bubble-like, insubstantial, self-releasing and self-luminous experience.<br><br>As
               you progress from the initial no-self realization by transforming the 
              five skandhas to eighteen dhatus (discussed in some of my earlier 
              posts), you will also see that fetters (craving, fear, anger, etc) begin
               to lose hold and disappear from your life. However the overcoming of 
              subtler fetters be an immediate effect and the insights and experience 
              may not sink in so deeply as to remove all the latent tendencies and 
              habits (it also depends on whether he has former meditative practice, 
              for RT their experience may not be as stable due to the nature of the 
              direct path which is to result in direct insight quickly without 
              necessarily having the meditative foundation, as they do not have years 
              of vipassana and samadhi practice as a foundation). I consider the 
              no-self realization as Buddha's Sotapanna, since it entails the end of 
              'self-view', and the further stages to Arhantship are the removal of 
              remaining fetters.<br><br><br>2) happiness<br><br><br>Most people are 
              not really enjoying their experience. They are always either in aversion
               of the moment, or in desire of something better, therefore they can 
              never be truly happy even if they get a billion dollars. The resting of 
              dualistic and self-referencing tendencies leaves us with simply 
              immersing in selfless pure sensate clarity which results in great bliss.
               There is a sense of perfection in the here and now and a non-contingent
               happiness. The bliss/happiness (I am using both terms synonymously 
              here) of pure sensate enjoyment without clinging to a separate 
              experiencer is beyond imagination. Everything ordinary becomes intensely
               alive and wonderful.</p>
