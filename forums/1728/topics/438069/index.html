              <div class="post-body entry-content">
              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Padmasambhava</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;"><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Advice from the Lotus-Born</span><br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;"><span style="color: #cc0000;">While the great master Padmasambhava was staying in Great Rock Hermitage</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000; font-family: trebuchet ms;"> at Samye, Sherab Gyalpo of Ngok, an uneducated sixty-one year old man 
              who had the highest faith and strong devotion to this master, served him
               for one year. All this while Ngok didn't ask him for any teachings, nor
               did the master give him any. When after a year the master intended to 
              leave, Ngok offered a mandala plate upon which he placed a flower of one
               ounce of gold. Then he said, "Great master, think of me with 
              kindness.First of all, I am uneducated. Second, my intelligence is 
              small. Third, I am old, so my elements are worn down. I beg you to give a
               teaching to an old man on the verge of death which is simple to 
              understand, can thoroughly cut through any doubt, is easy to realize and
               apply, has an effective view, and will help me in future lives."<br><br>The
               master pointed his walking staff at the old man's heart and gave this 
              instruction: Listen here old man! Look into awakened mind of your own 
              awareness! Such has neither form nor color, neither center nor edge. At 
              first, such has no origin but is empty. Next, such has no dwelling place
               but is empty. At the end, such has no destination but is empty. This 
              emptiness is not made of anything and is clear and cognizant. When you 
              see this and </span> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000; font-family: trebuchet ms;"> recognize this, you know your natural face. You understand this nature 
              of things. You have then seen this nature of mind, resolved the basic 
              state of reality, and cut through doubts about topics of knowledge.<br><br>This
               awakened mind as awareness is not made out of any material substance; 
              such is self-existing and inherent in yourself. This is the nature of 
              'things' which is easy to realize because such is not to be sought 
              elsewhere. This is nature as mind which does not consist of a concrete 
              perceiver and something perceived to fixate on. Such defies limitations 
              of permanence and annihilation. In such is no thing to awaken; awakened 
              state as enlightenment is your own pure awareness, naturally awake. As 
              this, here is no thing which goes to the hells; awareness is naturally 
              pure. As this, within is no practice to carry out; our nature as such is
               naturally cognizant. This great view as this natural state is present 
              within yourself. Resolve this: such is not to be sought elsewhere.<br><br>When
               you understand view in this way and would like to apply this in your 
              experience, wherever you stay is the mountain retreat of your body. 
              Whatever external appearance you perceive is a naturally occurring 
              appearance and a naturally empty emptiness; let this be, free from 
              mental constructs. Naturally freed appearances become your helpers, and 
              you can practice while taking appearances as path.<br><br>Within, 
              whatever moves your mind, whatsoever you think, has no essence but is 
              empty. Thought occurrences are naturally freed. While remembering (being
               mindful of) your mind-essence, you can take thoughts as path and 
              practice is effortless and easy! As for innermost advice: no matter what
               kind of disturbing emotion you feel, look into the emotion and such 
              tracelessly subsides. The disturbing emotion is thus naturally freed. 
              This is simple to practice.<br><br>When you can practice in this way, 
              your meditation training will not be confined to some kind of 
              'sessions'. When you know everything is a helper, your meditation 
              experience is unchanging, this innate nature is unceasing, and your 
              conduct is unshackled. Wherever you stay, you are never apart from this 
              innate nature.<br><br>Once you realize this, your material body may be 
              old, but awakened mind doesn't age. Such knows no difference between old
               and young. This innate nature is beyond bias and partiality. When you 
              recognize such awareness, innate wakefulness, is present in yourself, 
              here is no difference between sharp and dull facilties. As you come to 
              understand this innate nature, free from bias and partiality, is present
               within yourself, here is no difference between small and great 
              learning. Even though your body, this support for mind, falls apart, 
              dharmakaya of awareness wisdom is unceasing. As you come to have 
              stability revealed in this unchanging state, here is no difference 
              between a short or long life span.<br><br>Old man, practice this true 
              meaning! Take practice to heart! Literally! Do not mistake words and 
              meaning! Do not part from your good friend diligence! Embrace everything
               whatsoever with mindfulness! Do not indulge in such idle talk and 
              pointless gossip! Don't become involved with common aims! Do not disturb
               yourself with worry of offspring!<br><br>Don't excessively crave food 
              and drink! Intend to die an ordinary man! Your life is running out, so 
              be diligent! Practice this instruction for an old man on the verge of 
              death!<br><br>Because of his pointing his staff at Sherab Gyalpo's 
              heart, this is entitled "The Instruction of Pointing the Staff at the 
              Old Man". Sherab Gyalpo of Ngok was liberated and attained 
              accomplishment. This was written down by the Princess of Kharchen for 
              the sake of future generations. This is also known under the name "The 
              Instruction of Pointing the Staff".</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;"><br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;"><br><br><span style="color: #009900;">Dakini Queen Tsogyal from Padmasambhava in</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: trebuchet ms;"> <span style="color: #009900;">"Advice from the Lotus-Born", 1994, RYP</span>.</span></span></p>
