              <p>The Myth of ‘Doing Nothing’
              <br> <br> Colin Drake
              <br> <br> I recently was talking to a friend who was complaining of existential 
              anxiety; which was dispelled by reading a good book on nonduality or 
              attending an inspiring satsang, but which always returned. So I asked 
              him what he ‘did’ on a daily basis to establish himself in nondual 
              awareness, whereupon he grinned sheepishly indicating that he did 
              nothing. Which made me ponder the teachings of many modern teachers of 
              nondualism who say there is nothing to ‘do’ and everything just ‘happens
               by itself’. Indeed even in my book Beyond the Separate Self  there is a
               chapter entitled ‘Nothing to Achieve, Find or Get’ which could give the
               impression that there is nothing that one needs to do … However I can 
              assure you that if one continues to live in the same headspace without 
              ‘doing anything’ then there will no change in one’s outlook and anxiety 
              levels. For as I say in the book: 
              <br> <br> At a deeper level than this flow of fleeting objects (thoughts and 
              sensations) we are this constant subject, awareness itself; this is 
              already the case and as such cannot be achieved. All that is required is
               to realize this! 
              <br> <br> So awareness is central to our being, whilst thoughts and sensations are
               peripheral. This is self-evident for without awareness our thoughts and
               sensations would pass unnoticed. Thus we cannot lose this awareness; we
               just need to stop overlooking it. 
              <br> <br> It is impossible to get that awareness which you already are, and thus 
              have in full abundance. All that is required is to recognize this. In 
              this respect you do need to ‘get’ this, but this is in fact nothing as 
              it is not a thing but the ‘ground’ from which all things arise, in which
               they exist and back into which they subside. So there is in fact ‘no 
              thing to get’ and you do need to ‘get’ nothing(ness)!  
              <br> <br> So although there is:
              <br> <br> ‘nothing to achieve,’ we do need to realise the deeper level of pure 
              awareness, for this to be the case.
              <br> <br> ‘nothing to find’, we do need to stop overlooking the awareness that is 
              always present.
              <br> <br> ‘nothing to get’, we do need to recognize that we already have this 
              awareness. 
              <br> <br> This realization, or recognition, of the deeper level of pure awareness 
              is easily accomplished by directly investigating our own 
              moment-to-moment experience. My book aims to provide a simple 
              straightforward framework in which this investigation can take place. 
              However even after the recognition of this deeper level we do need to 
              cultivate, and establish, this by further investigation/contemplation 
              for as it says in The Tibetan Book of the Dead: 
              <br> <br> All those of all [differing] potential, regardless of their acumen or 
              dullness, 
              <br> <br> May realise [this intrinsic awareness]. 
              <br> <br> However, for example, even though sesame is the source of oil and milk 
              of butter, 
              <br> <br> But there will be no extract if these are unpressed or unchurned, 
              <br> <br> Similarly, even though all beings actually possess the seed of 
              buddhahood, 
              <br> <br> Sentient beings will not attain buddhahood without experiential 
              cultivation. 
              <br> <br> Nonetheless, even a cowherd will attain liberation if he engages in 
              experiential cultivation. 
              <br> <br> For, even though one may not know how to elucidate [this state] 
              intellectually, 
              <br> <br> One will [through experiential cultivation] become manifestly 
              established in it. 
              <br> <br> One whose mouth has actually tasted molasses, 
              <br> <br> Does not need others to explain its taste.
              <br> <br> <br> Even after one has ‘tasted molasses’ this taste will dissipate after a 
              time, requiring further ingesting for the taste to reappear. In the same
               way the effect of ‘awakening’ to the reality of the deeper level of 
              pure awareness will dissipate if one ‘nods off’ again and re-identifies 
              with the mind/body. So one needs to continually inquire 
              into/investigate/contemplate the nature of Self and Reality for this 
              ‘awakening’ to become established. It is only in this established 
              awakening that all existential anxiety is banished.</p>
