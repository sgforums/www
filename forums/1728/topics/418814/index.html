              <p>how can going for almsround be considered as ascetic ways of life? asceticism involved standing under the sun for days without rest, or eating a grain of rice a day, with no emphasis on meditation and training of the mind at all.</p>
              <p>even Buddha and his disciples went for alms from followers. that was life then, which is very different from now. The Buddha once said when his father, learned that his son was begging and thought it was a disgrace for a royal family to do alms.

              <p>Lord Buddha is considered a sramana, a wandering ascetic, except he did not advocate performing austerities, instead practise the middle way. Meditational practice exists for rishis and yogis but without the insight part. It takes great mental and physical fortitude.</p>

              <p>going on almsround is done so that the lay followers can acquire merit in doing so. the monk do not have to worry about their meals and concentrate on their practises and meditation, following the Buddha's tradition. unfortunately this tradition is almost dying out.</p>

              <p><br>then have you found out who is Devadatta ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His sole objectives is to create a split in the Sangha ,to create the "New Buddha" ,Devadatta objectives isnt about the vegetarianism , He have a greater diabolical agenda</p>
              <p>Mr Rooney , i suggest you read more about Devadatta</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forcing people to vegetarianism will cause Buddhism to extinct in India from the galaxy of Indian mainstream .Buddha already know Devadatta intention so He did not agree to any of the new rules suggested Devadatta .Devadatta isnt interested in vegetarianism .He is more interested about replacing Buddha as He wanted Power.Greed of Power have consumed Devadatta as He become jealous alot of royalty paid homage and contribution to the Tathagatha.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enough said ,now do you think Devadatta suggestion should be approved .If He is approved , i think Buddhism wont survive till today , as throughout the century ,Vegan also suffer from some meat deficiency illness , if milk isnt allowed to be consumed .</p>
              <p>When You read about Buddha story, please stop thinking the world havent changed , and everything must be perfect .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest you meditate  or enter chanting samadhi ,then just keep posting to pick up so-called Buddha "fault" in His teaching .It would be a miserable task if you keep picking up on His fault rather than His Wisdom .cause eventually the person who suffer imprisonment of thoughts is you,not Him .</p>

              <p>i recently saw a documentry on India history and it's religion. from what i gathered the majority (like about 90%) of entire India population seldom eat meat in the past. Brahmin like Jainism used to be vegetarian as written in their scriptures too. what they eat are like flour-based pancake, curry sauce etc. but due to the coming wars, the people/soldiers start to consume meat for strength. then later on people then start to eat meat.</p>
              <p>so in Buddha time, most people around are already about 90% vegetarian. even for those who eat meat are for a "valid" reason, eg for hunger and special occasions and eaten by the rich people. can imagine there's not much to say then. but nowaday, i think it's too over already.</p>

              <p>I agree, in rural areas, livestock is a form of wealth where the family reluctant to slaughter animals. Usually, an animal is slaughtered in honour of a guest, or on the onset of winter, where most of the carcass is preserved, smoked cured and dried, to last through winter and beyond.</p>
              <p>There are certain tribes in China where smoke cured meat are left hanging for many years!</p>
