But perhaps someone more knowledgeable can share on what I do not know.. I think it also depends on how well the children will respond to various punishments.. for example the method of punishment used at certain age (like when the child is younger) may not work well when the children grow to a different age. Have to use wisdom to judge. Cane can only be used for so long.. but may be necessary at certain times.<br><br>The alternative way without using corporal punishment is to speak to the child of all the possible consequences and outcome for not obeying your warnings so they will understand why you ask them not to do this or that.. i.e if you continue to eat so much chocolates then you will get very sick. And tell them they eventually have to learn to make the choices for themselves and understand the consequences. They have to learn the basics of cause &amp; effect. If need to, let them taste the consequences themselves for once.. then they will know what to do the next time. Of cos it depends on what situation it is and not all situations is suitable.<br><br>Because I am not a parent.... and I have little experiences in these things so most of the others wld be more experienced and suitable to answer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all for sharing. I am mindful not to let any negative emotion lead to me caning my child, but it didn't occur to me that the caning, though not resulting from my own negative emotion, actually generates these emotion when I carry the pain afterwards.<br><br>I don't have to cane my girl very often as she is receptive to verbal warnings and explanatins. My son, on the other hand, only understands the cane.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>
