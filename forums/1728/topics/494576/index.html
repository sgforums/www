              chaplain and dharma teacher Pamela Gayle White discusses the meaning of belief.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              look upon the judgment</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">of
              right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of
              beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">–Buddha’s
              Zen, story #101 in Zen Flesh Zen Bones</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Virginia a while back I met with a young college student who was interested in
              Buddhism. Recently arrived from China, Han Longwei was beautiful, articulate,
              and deeply curious. We had spent a good deal of time discussing Buddhist ethics
              and philosophy when he looked at me, head tilted, and said,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“May
              I ask you an unrelated question?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Sure,”
              I answered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Why
              doesn’t one ever see dragons?” Han Longwei inquired.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“What
              do you mean?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I’ve
              been to many zoos in Asia and the United States, but I’ve never seen a dragon.
              I’ve seen paintings and sculptures of them, but no photographs. Why is that?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Unprepared
              for this, I replied without thinking, “Well, because they’re not real.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              troubled him. “What do you mean, not real?” he asked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              did I mean, not real? If you believe that dragons exist, if they’re real for
              you, does your perception of them differ from my perception of, say,
              pterodactyls?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              question of belief is central to my work as a chaplain, in an obvious way, and
              also to my life as a Buddhist student, teacher, and practitioner. But it goes
              further than that. Belief is about how I interact with my physical world, how
              my emotions manifest, my social life, and the sense I make of spiritual
              insights. In fact, the more I ponder belief, the more it seems to permeate
              every aspect of my life save, perhaps, that very first instant of experience
              that precedes interpretation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thoughts
              are fleeting; faith belongs to intangibles and is not necessarily determined by
              critical thinking; but belief is the framework that embraces our thoughts,
              opinions, convictions, perceptions, and views. Belief, simply put, is what we
              hold to be true or real. It can be explicit (“I believe in elves”) or implicit
              (“I believe I exist”). Assumptions are implicit beliefs. There are beliefs we
              debate about, endlessly, and beliefs shared by mentally sound people the world
              over. Belief is a distinctly human noun; I don’t imagine that other animals are
              defined by their beliefs in quite the same way. And although beliefs and
              assumptions are, arguably, the substratum of existence, if you prompt a dinner
              table conversation about belief, you might be surprised by the effort required
              to contextualize it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              its least subtle manifestation, belief is political and societal worldview.
              I’ve known Bhutanese lamas living in the West who were certain that males of
              any species were superior to females in every way; that the Buddha didn’t walk,
              he glided on those wheels beneath his feet; and that the cosmos physically
              resembled the scriptural description: flat, four continents, eight
              subcontinents of specific geometric shapes, all laid out around Mount Meru, the
              axial point. They’d become very agitated if anyone tried to tell them
              otherwise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              in my work with patients and families in central Virginia, I meet people who
              take the Bible very literally, who delight in rebutting evolution, and who
              earnestly tell me that their family misfortunes are the work of Satan. Signs on
              their lawns exhort me to “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
              According to them, most of humanity is on a fast track to damnation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a species, we use our beliefs—in a view, in a rigidly defined higher power and
              in how the faithful must serve that power, in the superiority of one tribe or
              culture over others, in forms of government, in our entitlement as humans, in
              our having been wronged, and on and on—to justify every imaginable abomination.
              On the basis of our beliefs we create stained-glass windows and space stations
              and hospitals, march peacefully for a just cause, help others, overthrow
              despots, chant, and plant trees. On the basis of our beliefs, we study,
              contemplate, and practice the dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              root teacher and retreat master, Gendun Rinpoche, reminded us often that what
              we believe determines how we experience our world. Without question, most of us
              assume that our perceptions present us with a reasonably accurate portrait of
              reality. We function on the basis of our senses and the processing of those
              senses: the thoughts and emotions, habits and reactions that arise. Of course,
              we need to filter, process, and categorize to make sense of our world and
              thrive in it. But without a deep appreciation for the subjective nature of our
              experience and the fragility of our constructs, we naturally interpret and
              judge the beliefs and actions of others according to our own worldview.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our
              perceptions and knowledge are exceedingly partial; we tend to notice and retain
              that which validates our preconceptions. In other words, we see and believe
              what we already think. Nowadays we call this “confirmation bias,” and it
              operates in tandem with a whole range of psychological habits—cognitive
              biases—that hamper the freedom with which we might tune into and work with the
              bigger picture. Four hundred years ago, the English statesman and philosopher
              Francis Bacon described confirmation bias to a tee:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the
              received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to
              support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of
              instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and despises,
              or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects, in order that by this great
              and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may
              remain inviolate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              can easily find such biases in my own habits. And I know that nearly everyone I
              meet in my role as a chaplain, or while I’m walking the dog, or when I lead
              meditation practice, harbors assumptions—those tacit beliefs—about me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Acknowledging
              these shared cognitive biases can help us accept others’ views and actions. Our
              current embattled political landscape is so riddled by partisan opinions that
              it can be difficult to believe in the goodness of the people behind them. But
              in my work I am constantly called to step over surface inclinations in order to
              relate to a person on a deeper level. A few months ago one of my favorite
              patients, a kindly and lovable old Tinkerbell who always wore purple, looked at
              me wide-eyed from her bed in an upscale assisted-living facility and lamented,
              “Isn’t it just awful what the press is doing to the president? He says that all
              they do is lie about him.” A habitually argumentative part of me wanted to
              protest, but a more useful part could just focus on soothing her through this
              new distress.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              used to defend my views and beliefs with a good deal of passion. Years ago, at
              the beginning of my chaplaincy training, it rankled when colleagues would
              validate me as being an “instrument of God” regardless of my beliefs, my
              professed godlessness. I felt the need to assert myself. With time, I began to
              take clearer stock of my own conditioning and assumptions. I wondered what
              would happen if I set them aside. And I found that when I accompanied people in
              physical, emotional, or spiritual pain, the need to be present and caring
              naturally eclipsed dogma. I began to taste the freedom of empathic presence
              unsullied by belief in a way that reminded me of the freedom of being fully
              present on the cushion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              certain patient and family encounters, though, I would lose my footing. An
              early incident with a dying woman whose daughter had begged me to help her
              mother reconcile herself with Christ unsettled me for months. With my
              encouragement, the mother began praying for the first time in decades, and
              there was such sudden peace in her that it was palpable. During our time together,
              I acted without thinking about what was going on. But after I’d left the room
              and the situation behind, it really shook me—the Buddhist—up. I tried to define
              it, I meditated on it, I wrestled with it, I wrote a poem. It needed time to
              incubate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              fact, meditation experiences would often lead to a similar process: I would
              arise from what I might now call a “state of grace” to instinctively begin
              defining, comparing, adhering, clinging, and sometimes wrestling. I think that
              we can learn to expect and live with that. Once we come back to conventional
              reality, raw experience is always interpreted according to what we think we
              know. Other practitioners may have a similar experience of clarity, bliss, or
              emptiness . . . and call it God, or grace, or communion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I was in retreat in the ’90s, we recited texts in which mu stegs—heretics—were
              to be overcome, albeit compassionately. Heretics had wrong views; we had right
              views. Our beliefs were aligned with the Buddha’s teachings and led to
              enlightenment; theirs were not and led to suffering. Other texts warned us
              against falling into “old school” motivations of individual liberation instead
              of being concerned first and foremost with liberating all sentient beings from
              the ocean of existence and its turbulent waves of birth, aging, sickness, and
              death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              was a given that Madhyamika, the “Middle Way” philosophical school that we
              followed, was the best, because it was best able to guide us to enlightenment.
              Such partisanship is quite present within Buddhism in general. In Tibet, for
              example, monasteries were appropriated, block prints burned, and lineages
              forcibly assimilated in the service of how certain Madhyamika tenets were
              interpreted. How ironic when proponents of the Middle Way go at it—ostensibly
              because of doctrinal disagreements about what, exactly, is meant by emptiness.
              Imagine the monks glowering at each other and quarreling about emptiness like
              we argue politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              mapping out the path to liberation, the Buddha was famously more concerned with
              the mechanics of experience than with defining “reality.” Reality is invariably
              subjective. An expression of this is found in the Buddhist Yogacara—mind-only
              or consciousness only—school of philosophy. In Living Yogacara, Tagawa Shun’ei
              writes:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our
              so-called cognition, or the action of discerning the meaning of things as they
              are perceived by us, is never in any case a perception of the external world
              exactly as it is, but rather a world that can only be apprehended via its
              interface with our present mental state. In other words, it is nothing other
              than our own mind that constructs things and determines their content. This is
              the meaning of “consciousness-only,” or “nothing but the transformations of
              consciousness.” And, if we turn this around, we ourselves are nothing other
              than things that dwell in a world defined by the limits of that which is
              knowable by the functions of our own mind.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">–trans.
              Charles Muller</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              can be liberating to recognize the ubiquity of subjectivity and belief and
              accept the limitations of knowledge. Only when I perceive myself as being a
              “thing that dwells in a world defined by the limits of that which is knowable
              by the functions of my own mind” can I truly delight in the beliefs and faiths
              of others, especially when their faith sustains them and brings them peace.
              Instead of having to define others’ paths, I can walk alongside them on the
              paths they have adopted, pray with them that their wishes come true, and mean
              it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              all believe in something: self, nonself, an omnipotent creator, karma, science,
              reality, emptiness, dragons, elves. . . . When we see that belief gives color
              to every stratum of our experience of reality, we can embrace others as kindred
              believers, regardless of the shades we tend to favor.</span></p>
