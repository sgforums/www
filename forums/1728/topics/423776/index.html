              <p>maybe the spiritual power can do that or use something to cushion the fall, but if it's a fixed karma(ding ye), use the power already also no use, as karma is more powerful than spiritual powers.</p>
              <p>remind me of a story :</p>
              <h4>Mogallana (Also Moggallana, Maha-Maudgalyayana, foremost in possessing supernatural powers)</h4>
              <p>Mogallana followed the Buddha together with Sariputra.  Mogallana gained Enlightenment within 7 days and attained supernatural powers.  Why did Mogallana have such great supernatural powers?  This is because in a previous live, Mogallana gave a treat to a Pacceka Buddha.  The Pika Buddha was not very eloquent in explaining the Dharma through words, hence he illustrated using supernatural powers.  Mogallana was impressed and vowed that he too would achieve in supernatural powers to propagate the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Supernatural powers were quite common among Buddha's disciples.  However the display of it was always discouraged by the Buddha, all except for Mogallana, he was even praised for using supernatural powers in propagating the Dharma.  There were many interesting stories, including one giving rise to the Buddhist festival of Ullambana.  However I shall mention one that is less heard of.</p>
              <p>There was once where Kapilavastu was to be attacked by King Virudhara from the Kingdom of Kosala King.  Buddha tried to prevent the war by sitting at the pathway leading to Kapilavastu on 3 separate occasions.  King Virudhara always retreated whenever he saw Buddha.  However King Virudhara's revenge and hatred could not be subdued.  Buddha knew that there was no way to prevent the Karma further, thus he left them alone.</p>
              <p>Mogallana had been successful in all his supernatural powered deeds.  Hence he thought that more could be done in this case.  Buddha explained to him that this was due to the past bad Karma of the people in Kapilavastu.  The people remained arrogant, non-rependent, deceitful, and did not amend their ways, hence there was no way of substituting the fruits of Karma.  Mogallana was unconvinced.  The army surrounded Kapilavastu such that no one could escape.  Mogallana used his supernatural powers to fly into the city, found 500 great men, transform them into his alms bowl, and flew out of the city to a safe spot. However when he opened the bowl to recover the men, he found a bow of blood water instead!  Mogallana realized that supernatural powers cannot overcome Karma. (For more details, check out <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Courtyard/1652/Massacre.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a> for more details: http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Courtyard/1652/Massacre.html.)</p>
              <p>This was a lesson for Mogallana.  Finally one day Mogallana was ambushed by some Jain followers.  They pushed rocks from a hill onto Mogallana.  Mogallana knew this was his Karma and he did not use supernatural powers to overcome it.  He died under the rocks.  This was before Buddha's final Nirvana.</p>

              <p>exactly what i mean....</p>
              <p>causality is reversed through the effects of enlightenment...because people believe in the remedy, thats why people want to work towards enlightenment to reverse their past negative deeds....</p>

              <p><br>then again, the karma is there is someone trying to kill the person. but sucide is no one trying to kill the person. it's a stupid and ignorance decision. hence i think Buddha or his disciples with power is able to help by cushioning the fall. it's like seeing a person hanging him/herself, any person with a good heart will help cut down the rope asap. after that then try to talk sense to them.</p>

              powers.</p>
              <p>remind me of a story :</p>
              <h4>Mogallana (Also Moggallana, Maha-Maudgalyayana, foremost in
              possessing supernatural powers)</h4>

              <p>there are certainly merits in stopping others from committing sucide. No doubt about that.</p>
              <p>i mean karma in this sense, like if this person was being "possessed"/"disturbed" by a revenging spirit to kill himself ( maybe some one from past life for eg), then the spirit will be angry n may switch attention to you.  (since revenge being stopped). In such an extreme case, a medium and communication line need to be set up to ask what can pacify this revenging spirit.  May be a proper praying event to dedicate to it, or doing charities in its name to help it to be released from the angry ghost realm.</p>

              <p>this also remind me of a touching buddhist story. A good daughter-in-law was looked down by the mother-in-law cos she was from a poor family. The mother-in-law wanted to get in a rich daughter-in-law, so she found all ways and means to ill treat and tortured this poor one.  Finally the good daughter-in-law hanged herself in the wood shed.</p>
              <p>The evil mother-in-law got her wish and brought in the rich daughter-in-law. However she was tortured and ill-treated by this new dil till she could not take it anymore and walked to the wood shed, intending to hang herself. When she opened the door, she saw the poor daughter-in-law showing a terrible hanging state to her, she fainted and dreamt of the poor dil telling her not to commit suicide cos she would have to relive the painful moment over and over again everyday.</p>
              <p>She wanted to warn the mother-in-law not to follow in her footsteps, so she showed the ugliest side of herself hanging from the door.</p>
              <p>When the mother-in-law woke up, she cried in shame and regret. Later she engaged a buddhist monk to help this good dil to be reborn in a good next life.</p>
