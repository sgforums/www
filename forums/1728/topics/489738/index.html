              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span>The Pulse <a href="http://thediplomat.com/authors/vishal-arora/"><span>Vishal
              Arora</span></a><span style="display: none; "> for <span>The
              Diplomat</span></span> August 24, 2015</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>A push to change the draft
              constitution could place religious freedoms under threat.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>A majority of Nepalese supposedly
              want the term “secularism” to be removed from the draft of its new
              constitution, which will soon be put to the vote. Hopes are high among Hindu
              nationalists, who have been demanding that Nepal once again becomes a Hindu
              nation, a status it lost after the fall of the monarchy in 2006.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The Constituent Assembly has
              allegedly <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/secularism-to-go-from-nepal-constitution/article7470390.ece">received</a> millions of suggestions that the word “secularism”
              be dropped from the draft charter.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>This is not surprising, as the
              Nepali word for “secularism,” <em>dharm nirpekshta</em>, carries a negative
              connotation. The term means “indifference” or “opposition” to religion – a
              phrase that could fit the French idea of secularism, calling for a complete
              separation of religion and state. However, the majority of Nepalese are
              religious, at least in their cultural manifestations, and are not keen to
              establish a state that is anti-religion.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Nepal’s four major political
              parties – the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal United
              Marxist-Leninist (UML), the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, and the
              Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum – though left-leaning or Maoists, ascribe a
              different meaning to secularism, one that reflects its practice in neighboring
              India, which too has a Hindu-majority population. The Indian state is
              constitutionally mandated to remain “neutral” to and respectful of the various
              religions its people adhere to, while having no state or official religion.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>It appears that in their numerous
              suggestions, Nepalese people, too, favored a similar state ideology. They urged
              lawmakers to replace the term “secularism” with “Hindu” or “religious freedom.”
              In other words, they are comfortable with describing their country as being
              Hindu or one that provides for religious freedom.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>However, the royalist and Hindu
              nationalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal (RPP-N) is holding rallies and
              protests to pressure the Constituent Assembly to replace the term “secularism”
              with both words: “a Hindu nation with religious freedom.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>To make a case against secularism
              and for a Hindu nation, RPP-N members and supporters are projecting Hinduism to
              be under threat, claiming that missionaries are seeking to convert Hindus to
              Christianity, a “foreign” religion, using “allurement” or “force.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The RPP-N has mere 24 seats in
              the 575-seat Assembly, all of which were allotted to the party under the
              proportional representation system in the 2013 election. It failed to win any
              seat by plurality vote in first-past-the-post single-member constituencies. So
              the minority party is seeking to piggyback on the majority sentiment against
              the use of the word “secularism,” and take it one step further by calling for a
              Hindu nation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>However, there are problems with
              both its claims and demands.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The RPP-N is claiming a crime in
              which the alleged victims are not the complainants. In fact, the converts, if
              any, are not complaining at all. If Hindus are being converted with financial
              benefits or under duress, then where are the “victims”? Blaming conversions on
              missionaries or preachers insults the converts, whose right to freely choose a
              religion of their choice should be respected. It’s as if the converts had no
              role in their own conversions.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Despite the flimsy nature of the
              allegations, the draft constitution already states that no one can “convert
              another person from one religion to another” (Article 31). It doesn’t even
              qualify the verb “convert” by adding the adverbs “by force or allurement,” but
              simply imposes a blanket ban on all activities and expressions that can
              potentially be deemed as attempts to convert. This could effectively outlaw
              preaching of the tenets of a religion to people of other faiths, violating
              religious freedom and freedom of expression.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The demand that Nepal be
              re-declared a Hindu nation is equally problematic.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The RPP-N argues that with more
              than 40 Muslim countries and 70 Christian countries in the world, then Nepal
              certainly has the right to become a Hindu state.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The party’s leaders are confusing
              Muslim- and Christian-majority countries with nations that accord a special
              status to majority religions. There are about 17 countries where one form of
              Christianity enjoys a special status or is the state religion, and around 24
              such Islamic countries.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Besides, it would be a challenge
              to avoid a clash between the constitutional values of special treatment for the
              majority religion and full religious freedom, or to even “protect” the
              religion. This is why few countries that allow a close relationship between
              religion and state are seen as models of religious freedom or communal harmony.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Nepal doesn’t need to look too
              far for bad examples. A look at its own fellow members of the South Asian
              Association for Regional Cooperation could be a good case study.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Would the Nepalese people see
              nations like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives, whose
              constitutions accord a special status to Islam, as their role models? Are these
              nations peaceful? How about “Buddhist” Sri Lanka? Are minorities happy in Sri
              Lanka? Is there peace in that country? Are extremist Buddhist groups protecting
              their religion, or giving it a bad name?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Bhutan is also an officially
              Buddhist nation and yet peaceful, but this tiny nation – because of its
              isolation until recent years – has an entirely different context. Besides, even
              Bhutan doesn’t have a clean image in the area of religious freedom.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>A study of 59 countries,
              published in Southern Economic Journal in 2004, examined the impact of state
              religion and of constitutional protection for religion on the degree of
              religiosity. It <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/24565.pdf">found</a> that the existence of a state religion “reduces”
              attendance in places of worship by 14.6 to 16.7 percent of the total
              population.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The study concluded: “Having an
              established state religion can undo the positive effect of well over a century
              of constitutional protection of religious freedom… If these religious groups
              are successful in obtaining governmental favor for their particular brands of
              religion, they may be inadvertently sowing the seeds of their own destruction.”</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Nepal still has time to heed the
              warning.</span></p>
