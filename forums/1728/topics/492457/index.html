              the role of religion in China from the perspectives of the Chinese government
              and communities of faith?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              official position of the Chinese Communist Party-State on religion is based on
              Marxist-Leninist-Maoist atheism, which believes that religion will die out when
              social conditions develops sufficiently. At the current stage of social
              development, however, religion persists because of social and psychological
              reasons. Since the 1990s, the Communist Party-State has affirmed that religion
              could have both positive and negative social functions. It may contribute to
              society through charity services as well as teachings that provide spiritual
              solace and moral guidance to ordinary people. Nonetheless, religion is the
              opium of the people that may lead people to anti-social beliefs and may be used
              by adversary forces for political causes. The Party-State insists that
              Communist Party members must be atheists, atheist education must be carried out
              through the education system and mass media, and political control over
              religious organizations is necessary to ensure political and social stability.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              perspectives of faith communities on the role of religion are of course
              different from that of the Party-State. Although different religions have
              different perspectives, overall they believe that religious faith is beneficial
              to individual believers and society by providing a moral basis for society and
              moral guidance to individuals.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Which
              religions are most prevalent and what does the growth of religion reveal about
              Chinese society?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The Communist
              Party-State allows five religions to operate legally if they join one of
              the “patriotic” associations: Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Catholicism,
              and Protestant Christianity. There are also faith communities of these five
              religions that operate illegally in the underground (banned by the government)
              or operate in the gray area of legality without joining a “patriotic”
              association (tolerated without official approval). There are also believers and
              practitioners of many other religions. Among the Han majority people, Buddhism
              and Christianity are prevalent. Nearly 20 percent of the adult population
              self-identify with Buddhism, even though very few of them have formally joined
              any Buddhist organization. Christianity has been the fastest growing religion
              in the last three or four decades, with an annual increase of more than 10
              percent. If the Christian growth continues even at a lower rate of 7
              percent per year, China will become the largest Christian country by the year
              2030. Islam in China has become ethnicized so that few Han Chinese convert
              to it, but the 10 ethnic minorities have a significantly large population
              of more than 22 million.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The
              revivals of various religions, especially Christianity, show that the rapid
              social change has both generated the social needs and created the social space
              for religion. As long as social change continues in the current direction, that
              is, increasing urbanization, globalization, and migration, religions will
              continue to grow in the foreseeable future.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>How do
              Chinese nationalism and consumerism affect the practice of religious faith and
              congregation?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Chinese
              nationalism has been on the rise along with China’s economic development and
              growing strengths in world politics. The Communist Party-State has encouraged
              patriotism mixed with nationalism. However, religious communities tend to
              emphasize the universal nature of their faith. In order to boost patriotism and
              nationalism, the Party-State has initiated the policy measures of infusing
              patriotic messages in sermons and raising the Chinese national flag inside
              churches, temples, and mosques. Some Christian churches and Muslim mosques have
              manifested certain levels of resistance against such measures, whereas Daoist
              and Buddhist temples tend to be receptive. Moreover, the Party-State has
              engineered the revival of Confucianism, which is not considered a religion by
              the authorities but nonetheless has a religious dimension. The Chinese
              government has established and funded several hundred Confucius Institutes in
              many countries. Within China, many institutes, associations, and Confucius
              temples have been established. A form of radical or fundamentalist Confucianism
              manifests strong sentiments of anti-Western and anti-modern nationalism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Consumerism
              has become a social and political issue to Buddhism, as many Buddhist temples
              have been tourist sites that try hard to attract tourists and extract money
              from them. While Christian and Buddhist preachers often address consumerism as
              a challenge to individuals, I do not find much of a “prosperity gospel” in
              China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Identify
              three current or emerging salient religious trends in China.</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>First,
              Christianity has been growing fast and begun to show social significance, such
              as the emergence of Christian lawyers courageously fighting for civil and human
              rights. Although Chinese Christians tend to be apolitical, their Christian
              beliefs and congregational life help to value human dignity and exercise
              democratic principles. In the long run, Christian growth in China will be
              beneficial to social and political democracy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Second,
              Tibetan Buddhism is becoming popular among Han Chinese in
              some metropolitan areas, especially among business people and
              professionals. These people tend to be disappointed by the Han Buddhism that is
              perceived to be consumerist and corrupt, whereas Tibetan Buddhism is perceived
              to be pure and more efficacious.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Third, the
              Chinese Communist Party has intensified its fight to cleanse members of
              religious beliefs, practices, and commitment. However, this is bound to fail,
              as the vast majority of Communist Party members hold some supernatural beliefs
              or engage in certain religious or spiritual practices.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>What
              should the next U.S. president understand about religion’s transformative
              effect on China?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 15pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Back in
              the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter made some effective appeal to the then
              Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping about granting religious freedom to
              Chinese people. In order to have economic reforms and opening up to the world,
              the Chinese Communist Party-State at that time adopted some modern norms
              affirmed by the United Nations. The next U.S. president should understand
              that religious freedom is the first freedom among various
              freedoms that would lead to human flourishing. She or he should
              encourage the Chinese authorities to expand religious freedom. In order for
              people to better understand and appreciate religious freedom, the
              president should support American-Chinese dialogues on religious freedom, not
              only by government officials, but also by scholars, religious leaders, and
              college and graduate students.</span></p>
