              <h4>Dharma Talk Presented by Ven. Jinmyo Renge osho</h4>
              <h5>Dainen-ji, June 11, 2011</h5>
              <p>Intimacy is simply being open to the intimacy of experiencing which 
              is already present and always available. This is what Zen practice 
              actually is: opening to this openness, being a bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Intimacy is the recognition that everything within your life is alive
               AS your life. Every moment of experiencing, regardless of how you feel 
              about it, regardless of what you think of it, is this intimacy, and 
              everything you experience points to this intimacy whether you recognize 
              it or not. Zen practice is seeing how we turn away from this intimacy 
              and releasing this contraction.</p>
              <p>On your way into the monastery this morning, you walked through the 
              Sanmon, the Mountain Gate, and up the stone path. On either side of the 
              stones of the path, an array of colours met your eyes as the many 
              different greens of ferns and moss, the small flowering plants and 
              ground cover.  The air in the monastery grounds, cooled by the water in 
              the ponds, is cooler than the air down the street. Did you feel how it 
              was soft on your skin? And as you walked on the path, step after step, 
              you were being observed by countless birds from overhead branches or 
              from inside the thick hedge, calling from all directions. Perhaps you 
              noticed some of these details. Perhaps you were so caught up in just 
              ‘getting into the building on time’ that you missed most of this.Perhaps
               you were even thinking about what you would do after you left or what 
              was happening before you came or even last week or something that has 
              never happened and never will.  In any case, whether you were allowing 
              attention to open to those details or not, there was intimacy with your 
              life. The question is, how intimate were you with your life? How 
              responsive were you? If your attention was folded down into contraction,
               you will have noticed very little about that walk up the pathway. So 
              you see, this intimacy we are speaking of is not something you are ever 
              denied, it is something you can choose to open to.</p>
              <p>You don’t have to wait for experiencing to be arranged in a certain 
              way or for you to be interested in how experiencing is to open to this 
              intimacy. Even when you are not feeling well, when you’re tired or 
              grumpy, you can still be intimate with experiencing. You can have a 
              pounding headache and still open attention to the context in which you 
              and the pounding of your head are taking place because you are aware of 
              the headache. The question is - what is it that is aware? How is it that
               you are aware of anything at all? If you have a headache, trying to 
              manipulate it with your practice isn’t going to cure it. Take an aspirin
               if you want to change it. But while it’s going on, practise with it. 
              Practice isn’t about manipulating experiencing so that you can limit and
               contain it and only experience what you want to experience. You can’t 
              control reality. You can influence it, but if your attention is 
              contracted, you will inevitably influence it in ways that will deepen 
              contraction.</p>
              <p>Wanting to manipulate experience by turning practice into a strategy 
              or a formula is a misunderstanding that beginning students in particular
               fall into. This strategizing comes up while sitting zazen, but also 
              when you’re not sitting. It comes up concerning work issues such as 
              dissatisfaction with a job or a career, or a living situation, but also 
              with more personal issues such as relationships. This is why you spend 
              so much of your sitting time pondering these issues - you think that if 
              you just spend enough time thinking about them, you’ll reach some state 
              of perfect mental clarity and you’ll know exactly what to do; you’ll 
              have the formula for it, the cure. And of course, the fact that all of 
              this is only going on inside your head and reality is not inside your 
              head is something that you will tend to overlook when you’re really 
              caught up in it.</p>
              <p>Because you spend so much time thinking about strategies and 
              designing formulas for yourselves, topics of this sort will also come up
               from time to time in practice interviews and daisan. It’s not that this
               is a problem - far from it, students are welcome to bring up any topic 
              they wish to discuss in interviews and daisan. But I think it’s 
              important to understand how limiting this can be.</p>
              <p>If you ask a practice advisor to tell you how you should respond to 
              your boss or your significant other when they say or do this or that, 
              yes, the practice advisor could probably put together a response that 
              would be very clever. But the problem is that if they were to do that, 
              all they would be giving you is one of many possible solutions to this 
              particular problem and it’s not YOUR solution. You won’t have learned 
              anything from that. Why? Because what you’ve asked for is a formula that
               will only work in a very specific set of conditions. The next time an 
              issue comes up, that formula won’t work because the circumstances will 
              be different. And there’s no guarantee that it will work anyway, because
               the practice advisor or Dharma Teacher is not IN that situation and 
              does not know all of the details of it.</p>
              <p>What we can do, however, is talk about the habitual patterns that 
              people tend to fall into so that they can recognize them and avoid 
              certain pitfalls.</p>
              <p>Everyone wants intimacy but there are many things people call 
              ‘intimacy’ and most are not  intimate at all. Many are what you settle 
              for when you are not really being intimate with your life - the 
              touchy-feelly kind of intimacy people try to share that comes and goes 
              and goes and is gone more often than it is present. There are many 
              patterns people engage in around this, so I will bring up a few of them.</p>
              <p>Relationships aren’t all they’re made out to be. As Anzan roshi has 
              often pointed out, ninety-five percent of the time you’re trying not to 
              get in trouble with the other person. Another five percent can be nice 
              or kind of nice, or just slightly better than not being in trouble. And 
              for the last five percent, which is spread throughout, you’re in 
              trouble. This is not intimacy, it’s the result of following habitual 
              patterns that involve a lot of ‘leaning’.  People who are in intimate 
              relationships do tend to lean on each other a great deal and I don’t 
              mean the kind of leaning one does with an injured hip. No, the other 
              kind of leaning - wanting someone to prop you up, jolly you out of your 
              states or distract you from them. When people are sad or angry or 
              confused, there is the expectation that the other person will be 
              available to hear their stories, sympathize with them and try to make 
              them feel better and this can become more than a full-time job, it can 
              become a life-long job. Even if there is something really serious going 
              on, your first obligation as concerns your states, is to work with them 
              yourself. Looking to another person to do this for you is sheer 
              laziness. When both parties do this to excess, their time together is 
              spent primarily looking at each other, continuously trying to gauge the 
              kind of states that are present, day after day after day.</p>
              <p>If I were to use a metaphor for good and bad relationships, it would 
              be this: There are two people walking down the street together and as 
              they walk, they are looking at the sky, the ground, the trees, the 
              buildings and perhaps commenting on those. Or they might talk to one 
              another about possibilities that may unfold for them or they may just 
              walk together in silence. But they are attentive to the details of the 
              walking, of their surroundings, and that of course includes each other, 
              but without an enormous sense of problem. A bad relationship is like two
               people walking down the street but they are seeing nothing but each 
              other. They watch each other, continually worrying about what the other 
              is thinking, what facial expressions might mean, wondering what is going
               on in the other person’s mind, wondering about their relationship, 
              wondering “do you love me?” which is stifling and claustrophobic.</p>
              <p>Relationships with other people, be it with a significant other or 
              family members or friends, provide us with countless opportunities to 
              notice how the three klesas determine for us the criteria by which 
              someone is worthwhile or not. If your attention is bound up by habitual 
              patterns of contraction, then these will dictate how you view other 
              people. Again, first and foremost, it is your responsibility to work 
              with your own states and habitual patterns. Because these are so 
              habitual and you feel so justified in propagating them, your attention 
              becomes consumed by them and it is very difficult to for you to 
              recognize that they are even present unless you make the effort to open 
              attention. And I mean as much of the time as is possible. Any state you 
              experience has one agenda and that is to continue itself. Practice is 
              about interrupting states. It’s not convenient and it is never habitual.
               It requires an effort to open to reality in the midst of your life. But
               there is time to do this and there is space in your life to practice. 
              If you can find the time to spend as much time as you do lost in 
              habitual thoughts and feelings, you can find the time to practice.</p>
              <p>The intimacy people wish to find in their relationships does not 
              begin as romantic engagement. It doesn’t start with becoming personal 
              with another person. Real intimacy is intimacy with your whole life and 
              it is only to the extent that you can be intimate with your own life 
              that you can be intimate with the life of another. I think this is 
              really quite obvious. If your attention is so folded down that you are 
              spending a good portion of your time lost in storylines and feelingtones
               and strategies, you make yourself unavailable and unresponsive to 
              reality. Other people are not your thoughts and feelings about them.</p>
              <p>If you are in a relationship that was formed on a weak foundation and
               you practice, it may fall apart. And that won’t be because practising 
              will make you cold or indifferent. It will be because you will begin to 
              understand what intimacy really is. If you are in a relationship that 
              was built on a strong foundation and practise it will become even 
              stronger, even more intimate. The reason for this is that intimacy is 
              too intimate to be personal. The intimacy of the bodhisattva, of one who
               is opening to openness is not just intimacy with another person, it is 
              intimacy with the whole of one’s experiencing. It includes other people 
              but is not dependent on other people. And this intimacy is something you
               can practise right now.</p>
              <p>When you are sitting and choose to open past your storylines to feel 
              the actual contact of thumb against thumb, you are practising intimacy. A
               step in kinhin is intimacy with the sensations of the foot, the texture
               of the floor beneath the foot and the coolness of the air that passes 
              beneath the foot as it is lifted to take the next step. And further, 
              opening attention to the whole bodymind, balanced and at ease, intimate 
              with the sensations of the warmth and weight of the hands held in shashu
               resting against the diaphragm, feeling the breath come and go; moving 
              through the space of the room; opening to the seeing as you move through
               the space and the space moves past you and intimate with the space of 
              experiencing in which all of this is occurring, When you pay attention 
              to the sensations of the bodymind, the sounds you are hearing and the 
              colours and forms you are seeing, you are opening past self-absorption -
               this same self-absorption that limits and constricts the relationships 
              you have with other people. This intimate practice of zazen shows you 
              how your attention abstracts and recoils from present experiencing so 
              that you can release contraction and become intimate with the life that 
              lives as all lives, as your life.</p>
              <p>There is much more to look into concerning these topics and we shall continue to do so in the next Dharma Talk.</p>
