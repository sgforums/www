To ensure healthy cultivation in long term, we need to have faith, understanding of dharma, practise and some social factors. It seems to me that many people don't balance up among these few points. Some people only have faith, every week go bugis burn josstick, but their dharma knowledge is empty, when asked about why not join christian, they also don't know how to debut. Social factors also very important, in the past there are many dharma tragedy happened (some monks are forced to go back as layman), just bcoz of the lack of it.
