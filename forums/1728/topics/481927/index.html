              <p>I love the teaching and will like to revise what you had taught… Love the teaching a lot! – <strong>Kelly</strong></p>
              <p>After attending your courses (I have been attending Project Patience 
              too), I do find myself recalling some of the things you said and try to 
              put them into practice, to be more mindful. Thank you very much. – <strong>Joan</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for Project Transformation. It’s really very insightful and inspiring. – <strong>Mingrui</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for the sharing. This course is definitely useful. I enjoyed 
              it and will try to put what I have learnt into practice. My mum enjoyed 
              your classes too… so much so that she has enrolled for both your coming 
              courses. It must be you before she will come for the courses! .. See you
               in the coming courses. And many thanks for giving us the opportunity to
               learn from you. Greatly appreciate it. Cheers, <strong>Violet</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Shi’an! I thoroughly enjoyed both the Project Transformation and 
              Project Patience courses. The 4-session courses were well-planned and I 
              could see the painstaking work behind each slide and set of notes. 
              Really appreciate your mindful work put into these courses. After having
               attended many of your courses since two over years ago, I should be 
              able to comment on the improvements shown with each one I attended. 
              These are the significant ones:</p>
              <p>a) There is summarising not only at the end of each session, but at 
              appropriate intervals – this is excellent as we participants need this 
              positive reinforcement for our learning.</p>
              <p>b) Notes sent to participants promptly. The notes are clear and succinct, and help tremendously for us to revise our learning.</p>
              <p>c) The initiative to print ‘The Eight Verses of Thought 
              Transformation’ is great! We now read these verses after our nightly 
              Nianfo sessions at home and feel that they are indeed useful and helpful
               in our daily lives.</p>
              <p>All in all, it is wonderful to have learnt so much in these 2 latest 
              courses and we will recommend others to attend them as well as all the 
              other courses conducted by Shi’an. We have benefited very much from all 
              the courses conducted by Shi’an (especially in our improved Faith, 
              Aspiration and Practice) and will continue to seek more knowledge and be
               more mindful of Buddha always. Amituofo! <strong>Jac &amp; Kee</strong><strong><br> </strong></p>
