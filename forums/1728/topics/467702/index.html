              <p>I'm not from the Trantric or Tibetean tradition but have always admire the painting on the wall of the Tibetan Gompa and the painting by the thangka painters. You can see so much concentration from these painters when they are painting. I was told that all these painters began their painting by first painting the picture on the Wheel of Life.</p>
              <p>Lately, these picture appears when I was doing my meditation.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Caption : 1st circle  and 2nd circle on the Wheel of Life</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1st circle representing the 3 poisons</strong></span></p>
              <p>The central teaching of Buddhism is the 4 Noble Truth and the Eight Fold Path. Of it the 2nd Noble Truth is "The Cause of Suffering". So what causes the suffering? It's the Greed, Hatred and Delusion that cause us to suffer. Here in the picture, Greed is represented by the rooster, Hatred by the snake and Delusion by the pig. As the picture shows the rooster holding on to the tail of the pig, the pig biting the tail of the snake and the snake holding on to the tail of the rooster. This 3 animal (poisons) represent the cyclic existence of Life.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2nd circle representing karma</strong></span></p>
              <p>The 2nd circle have 2 halves circles of pictures in black and white background. The white shows people moving upward to a higher state of existence and the black shows people moving downward regressing into a lower state of existence. This picture represents karma, the law of cause and effect indicating the results from postive and negative action.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Caption : 3rd circle on the Wheel of Life</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>3rd circle representing the Six Realms of Existence</strong></p>
              <p>This 3 circle is divided into 6 parts, the top 3 representing the higher realms and the bottom 3 representing the lower realms.</p>
              <p><strong>Top most : Deva Realm</strong></p>
              <p>Considered as the highest among the six realms of existence, it is characterized by the attributes of the Buddha. Enlightenment is considered to be easily attained in this realm; and everything sparkles with love and light.</p>
              <p><strong>Top Left : Aysura Realm</strong></p>
              <p>The second highest realm of existence is called the Demi-god realm, or the Jealous God Realm. It is believed to be the realm of Titans, Asuras, and is marked by jealousy and paranoia. Those born into this realm, though blessed with a high birth, are exceedingly jealous of the God realm and of each other. They are believed to spend most of their time fighting among themselves to compete.</p>
              <p><strong>Top Right : Human Realm</strong></p>
              <p>Being born into the human realm is considered to be a very rare occurrence. It is only in the human realm in which liberation from all the six states is possible. The human realm is characterized by doubt and inquisitiveness and the longing for something better.</p>
              <p><strong>Bottom Left : Animal Realm</strong></p>
              <p>The Animal Realm is characterized by ignorance which is equivalent to having a mind similar to that of an animal. The animal realm is nothing but suffering where there is no way in obtaining knowledge and taking steps towards enlightenment.</p>
              <p><strong>Bottom Right : Preta Realm or the Hungry Ghost Realm</strong></p>
              <p>This realm is characterized by craving/desire. It is believed that in the hungry ghost or preta realm, the inhabitants suffer from a greed that can never be satisfied. They have huge stomachs but tiny mouths, food and water is very scarce and when a preta sees food or water they are so delusional that they believe they are seeing blood, bile and other disgusting things of that nature. And even if a preta finds food or water and is able to consume it, it burns their throat and stomach like fire.</p>
              <p><strong>Bottom : Hell Realm</strong></p>
              <p>The lowest among the realms of existence is the hell realm. Buddhists believe that there are about 136 hells which are divided into “hot hells” and “cold hells”. The hell realms are looked upon as journey full of suffering; one born into this realm must not only endure suffering in their respective hell but also pass through each of lesser hells. This journey is supposed to take years to complete. In the course of which, even the Dharma is forgotten and even if it was remembered, the anguish is such that it makes practice impossible. The hell realm is characterized by acute aggression.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My Understanding</strong></span></p>
              <p>Many buddhist believed that each person  will be reborn in accordance to there respective action (Karma) in their previous life. But my understanding is rather than a "physical place", it is the experience of the respective realm in accordance to our action here and now.</p>

The head of yama is adorned with 5 human head symbolising the 5 aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formation &amp; consciousness). The 3rd eye symbolise wisdom, the 4 limbs symbolise birth, old age, sickness &amp; death and the tiger skin between the legs symbolise fearfulness.</p>
