            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">4. Mara always disrupts the cultivator, what should one do?<br><br>Shut the doors of our undesirable habits and self-serving temperament.<br><br>The Mara is a very troublesome thing. It is always destroying that which is good. When a person's career encounters Mara, then he will not be successful. When Mara intrudes into the family, the family breaks up. As a Buddhist, when we encounter Mara, we lose our wisdom-life. Where is the Mara found? It resides in the heavens of desire (devalokas). The king of this heaven is King Mara. Moreover, there are armies of Mara, the children and grandchildren of Mara, female Mara and many others. Nevertheless, regardless of how strong and mighty the Mara is, there is no need to be afraid. Human beings have a weakness - the fear of Mara.<br><br>All Maras intrude through the doors of our undesirable habits and self-serving temperament. Whatever those habits and temperament are, so long as they are not fully eradicated, the Mara will enter from there. For example, the Mara will enter a person through his habit of drinking alcohol. Similarly, it enters a person through his negative habits and temperaments such as sexual misconduct, telling lies, being materialistic, being lazy and refuses to learn or work.<br><br>The best way to counter Mara, is to shut the doors of our undesirable habits and self-serving temperaments. Hence, when we set the objective of learning and practising the Buddha's teachings to eradicate our undesirable habits and self-serving temperament, it is to prevent the Mara from entering us again. Without the troubles caused by Mara, we will succeed in all our endeavours, be they our studies, career or building a blissful family.<br><br>Many people leave the doors open for Mara, and people in the society, by and large, are unaware that they have been invaded by Mara. When Mara takes effect, it can cause people to become bankrupt, families to break up and even the loss of lives. Now, this is the secret - eradicate our undesirable habits and self-serving temperament, thereby shutting the doors through which the Mara enters. In this way, the Mara will not be able to do you any harm.</span><br><br>that also said, mara is zhe2 mo2(torture)...either he torture u or u torture yourself.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

The four are:<br>(1) the Mara of psychophysical existence; (2) the Mara of compulsions; (3) the Mara of death; and (4) the Mara who is born of a god. A fifth kind of Mara is sometimes added, the Mara of conditioning. These classifications helped early Buddhist teachers to disentangle Mara's key features."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Ananda, you should know that, especially in the Dharmaending<br>Age, these ten kinds of demons, the ones that appear in the<br>ten demonic states associated with the thinking skandha, may leave<br>the home-life to cultivate the Way within my Buddhadharma.<br>They may possess other people. The demon kings may possess<br>other people, or they may manifest themselves in various forms.<br>They may display their spiritual powers as demon kings and<br>manifest all kinds of forms. They may appear as Buddhas, Bodhisattvas,<br>Arhats, or gods. Demon kings can manifest in any kind of<br>body. All of them will claim that they have already<br>accomplished Proper and Pervasive Knowledge and<br>Awareness. Â“Proper and Pervasive KnowledgeÂ” refers to the<br>Buddha, who has both proper knowledge and pervasive knowledge.<br>Â“Proper knowledgeÂ” means knowing that Â“the mind produces the<br>myriad dharmas.Â” Â“Pervasive knowledgeÂ” means knowing that Â“the<br>myriad dharmas are the mind itself.Â” When someone has genuine<br>proper and pervasive knowledge and views, he becomes a Buddha,<br>One of Proper and Pervasive Knowledge. However, demons<br>pretend to be Buddhas and claim to have attained proper and<br>pervasive knowledge.<br>When Shakyamuni Buddha was about to enter Nirvana, he<br>summoned the demon king and commanded him, Â“You should<br>abide by the rules. Follow the rules from now on. DonÂ’t violate<br>them.Â” The demon king replied, Â“So you want me to follow your rules?<br>Fine. During the ending age of your Dharma, I will wear your<br>garments, eat your food, and defecate in your alms bowl.Â” His<br>meaning was that he would destroy the Dharma from within.<br>When the Buddha heard that he was worried. He wept and said,<br>Â“ThereÂ’s really nothing I can do about you. Your method is the most<br>poisonous, the most destructive.Â”<br>There is the saying: Â“The parasites on the lionÂ’s body eat the<br>lionÂ’s flesh.Â” This means that in the Dharma-ending Age, the<br>demons are strong and the Dharma is weak. There are a lot of<br>demon kings. Therefore, cultivators must be very careful. What are<br>demon kings like? In general, they are different from ordinary<br>people. They have a demonic energy about them. There is<br>something unusual about them, which reveals that they are demon<br>kings. The Dharma-ending Age is a time when the Dharma is weak<br>and demons are strong. The Song of Enlightenment by Great<br>Master Yongjia says very clearly:<br>Alas! In the evil time of the Dharma-ending Age,<br>Living beings have few blessings;<br>it is difficult to train them. Far indeed from the Sages<br>of the past,<br>their deviant views are deep.<br>Demons are strong, the Dharma is weak;<br>many are the wrongs and injuries.<br>Hearing of the door of the TathagataÂ’s Sudden Teaching,<br>They regret not destroying it as they would smash a tile.<br>Â“AlasÂ” expresses a regretful sighing about the Dharma-ending Age.<br>The evil time means this time is very evil and vile. All the monsters<br>are appearing in the world.</span><br><a href="http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/ps.ss.02.v8.020526.screen.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/ps.ss.02.v8.020526.screen.pdf</a></div>
