              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This mortal existence, like a candle in the wind,<br>If it’s long that’s all right, if it’s short that’s all right.<br>Without intensifying the tight grip of the ego,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These intellectual judgements, like the lure of a mirage,<br>If they’re suitable that’s all right, if they’re not that’s all right.<br>Discarding, like hay, whatever carries the eight worldly concerns,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This entourage, like of flock of birds in a tree,<br>If it’s assembled that’s all right, if it’s scattered that’s all right.<br>Without letting others lead me by the nose,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This illusory body, like a hundred year old house,<br>If it survives that’s all right, if it collapses that’s all right.<br>Without becoming obsessed by food, clothes and medicine,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This religious position, like a child’s game,<br>If it’s kept up that’s all right, if it’s dropped that’s all right.<br>Without deceiving myself with numerous diversions,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These gods and demons, like reflections in a mirror,<br>If they’re helpful that’s all right, if they’re harmful that’s all right.<br>Without perceiving my own hallucinations as enemies,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This delusive talk, like a trackless echo,<br>If it’s pleasing that’s all right, if it’s unpleasant that’s all right.<br>Taking the Three Jewels and my own mind as witness,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">That which is useless at the time of need, like the antlers of a deer,<br>If it’s known that’s all right, if it’s unknown that’s all right.<br>Without simply relying on various sciences,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This material wealth, like what’s found in a dream,<br>If it’s acquired that’s all right, if it’s not that’s all right.<br>Without deceiving others by flattery and assent,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This rank, like a little bird perch on top of a tree,<br>If it’s high that’s all right, if it’s low that’s all right.<br>Without aspiring to that which actually brings sorrow,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This black magic, like a sharpened weapon,<br>If it’s successful that’s all right, if it’s not that’s all right.<br>Without buying the blade that will cut off my life,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These recitations, like parrot’s six syllables,<br>If they’re repeated that’s all right, if they’re not that’s all right.<br>Without counting numbers of the various practices,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Mere religious discourse, like a mountain cascade,<br>If it’s eloquent that’s all right, if it’s not that’s all right.<br>Without thinking of this glibness as Dharma,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The mind quick to judge, like a pig’s snout,<br>If it’s sharp that’s all right, if it’s dull that’s all right.<br>Without uselessly digging up the rubble of anger attachment,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The yogi’s experience, like a stream in summer,<br>If it expands that’s all right, if it recedes that’s all right.<br>Without chasing rainbows like a child,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These pure visions, like rain on a mountain top,<br>If they happen that’s all right, if they don’t that’s all right.<br>Without giving credence to illusory experiences,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The freedoms and endownments, like a wish-fulfilling gem,<br>If I do not obtain them, there is not way to accomplish Dharma.<br>When I have them in hand, without letting them spoil,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This glorious Guru, light on the path of liberation,<br>If I do not meet him, there is no way to realize the true nature.<br>When I know the way to go, without jumping into the precipice,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This immersion in Samsara, like a stone in deep water,<br>If I do not get out of it now, I will not be free of it later.<br>Holding on to the lifeline of the compassionate Three Jewels,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The qualities of liberation, like an island of jewels,<br>If I am unaware of them, there is no way to develop diligence.<br>Seeing the unending benefits to be gained,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These thoughts of mine, like a monkey’s antics,<br>If I do not tame them, there is no way to eliminate my afflictive emotions.<br>Without falling into all kinds of crazy mimicry,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This attachment to ego, like an inherent shadow,<br>If I do not give it up, there is no way to reach a peaceful place.<br>When I recognize the enemy, without befriending it,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The five poisons, like embers glowing in the ash,<br>If I do not extinguish them, I cannot abide in the mind’s self-nature.<br>Without breeding venomous baby snakes in my bed,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This temperament of mine, like the stiff hide of a butter-bag,<br>If I do not soften it, the Dharma and my mind will never blend.<br>Without indulging the child that is born from my self,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">These ingrained bad habits, like the course of a river,<br>If I do not eliminate them, I cannot part from the profane.<br>Without delivering weapons into the hands of the enemy,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">This awareness, like a stainless crystal,<br>If I do not see it, the clinging and effort of meditation cannot dissolve.<br>When I have this inseparable companion, without searching for another,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The natural mind, like an old friend,<br>If I do not recognize it, all my activities will be deluded.<br>Without fumbling around with my eyes closed,<br>May I constantly practice the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In short, if I do not abandon the concerns of this life,<br>There is no way to apply the teachings for the benefit of the next life,<br>Having resolved to be kind to myself,<br>May whatever I do become the Supreme Teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">To doubt the Guru’s instructions that accord with the Dharma,<br>To feel bitterness toward the deity when bad karma emerges,<br>To discontinue the sadhana and so forth when adverse circumstances arise,<br>May such obstacles not occur as accomplishment approaches.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">All this doing has no more meaning than walking around a desert,<br>All these efforts make my character rigid.<br>All this thinking just reinforces my delusions,<br>What worldly beings consider to be Dharma is the cause of binding myself.<br>All this exertion produces no result,<br>All these ideas bring not a single actualization,<br>All the numerous wants will never be fulfilled,<br>Abandoning activities, may I be able to meditate on the oral instructions.<br>If you think you want to do it, take the Victorious One’s words as witness,<br>If you think you can really do it, blend your mind with Dharma,<br>If you think you will practice, follow the example of the past saints.<br>You spoiled ones, is there any other way?<br>Taking a humble position, rich with the treasure of contentment,<br>Free from the binds of eight worldly concerns, firm and strong-hearted in practice,<br>Receiving the Guru’s blessing, realization becomes equal to space.<br>May we inherit the Kingdom of Kuntuzangpo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><em>Thus having united the meaning of the diamond words of the past saints, I have written this as my own prayer.</em></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><strong>Om Svasti!</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Relying upon him, one is completely protected from the many fears of worldly existence.<br>And established on the path of liberation.<br>I pay homage to the most kind Master, the Three Jewels Incarnate.<br>Understanding that he is the essence of my own wakeful awarness.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">It is the responsibility of those who wish to attain liberation to follow the displine<br>Concerning what must be cultivated and what must be abandoned<br>In accordance with the Victorious One’s teachings, commentaries and instructions,<br>Thus, adopting this way of acting is appropriate.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The human body, adorned with freedoms and favorable conditions,<br>Is more extremely difficult to find and is of great importance.<br>At the time you have something like this, if you do not accomplish the ultimate aim<br>Who could be more stupid and deluded than that?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">All composite things are impermanent and are certain to die.<br>The time of death is uncertain and the circumstances of death are limitless.<br>Since at the moment nothing but the sublime teachings will be of benefit,<br>Without procrastinating practice diligently.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The sufferings of the lower realms are unbearable like a pit of fire.<br>Sinking there once, how will you find the opportunity for liberation?<br>Even in the realms of happiness, suffering is actually experienced.<br>Therefore, you must conclusively establish the means of becoming free.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The seeds of constructive and destructive actions unfailingly<br>Ripen into the fruit of happiness and sorrow.<br>As this is the very nature of interdependence, you must rely on attentiveness and mindfulness<br>Concerning the manner of what to engage in and what to avoid.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">From the bottom of your heart, pray to rest your hope permanently<br>In the unfailing protector, your Master, and the Three Jewels.<br>Cultivate the enlightened mind of Bodhicitta by offering your compassionate responsiveness<br>To your fathers and mothers, beings most kind, who are as pervasive as space.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">From beginningless samsara until this moment,<br>Your mind has wandered continuously through ignorance and delusion.<br>From now on, with no attachment to deluded activity,<br>Make effort to realize the undeluded true nature of reality</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Respectfully following a spiritual master who has all the defining characteristics,<br>By ripening your mind stream through receiving the perfectly pure four empowerments<br>Of the great mandala of Vajrayana<br>Establish yourself unmistakenly in profound interdependence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">As spiritual commitments themselves are the only root of accomplishment,<br>Without transgressing the boundary of prescribed precepts,<br>Knowing the restrictions and purposes, practice without confusion<br>The disciplines of adopting and abandoning according to the Three Vehicles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The primordial reality and the nature of all phenomena<br>Is profound, tranquil, unelaborated, luminous and unconditioned.<br>Apply yourself in the methods of realizing exactly as it is<br>This vajra mind, perfected in its ground and unchanging.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The manifold appearances of mind, as many as there are,<br>From their mere appearance, are unreal as magical illusions.<br>Under the power of habitual tendencies towards singular phenomena,<br>The causes and conditions of attachment and hatred are<br>uncertain, and lack single identity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If analyzed and investigated, it cannot be established as anything.<br>Yet everyting arises in the brilliant clear awarenss.<br>As the manifestations of mind are arising unceasingly<br>It is said that the appearances are themselves what is called mind.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The nature of mind is luminous, intangible and inconceivable.<br>Its expanse is free of mental constructs, and falls in no particular direction.<br>Vividly wakeful in the continuity of unconfined self-appearance.<br>Rest in the primordial purity that is changeless and perfect from the ground.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Binding the essential movements of body with the key points,<br>Let the movement of the breath in and out come to its natural state.<br>With no distraction from the focus of meditation on mind itself,<br>Focus the three doors in union on the essential practice.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Without attachment to the apparent yet empty form of the deities, the illusory bodies,<br>Engaging in recitation with indivisible wind and mantra train in the continuity<br>Of mind– luminous, uncompounded great bliss,<br>The path of method that purifies channels, energies and essential drops.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Through the yoga of the indestructible three vajras: body, speech and mind,<br>Cleanse the energy channels, dissolve the energies and thoroughly purify the essential drops.<br>Drawing on the interrelated enhancing pracitces of day and night.<br>You will experience the fruition of the natural state.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Clearly and without grasping, recognize your own nature by yourself<br>By the pair of calm abiding cultivated through resting in awareness<br>And the extraordinary insight of perceiving your nature nakedly.<br>Nurturing this without distraction is the essence of the path.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The view that understands emptiness is the natural state itself.<br>Cultivating undistracted mindfulness is the path of meditation.<br>For the yogi who trains in compassionate expressiveness<br>As diligently as possible, the foundation of liberation will be firmly laid.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Putting enormous effort into the meaningless activities of this life,<br>Many are left with only superficial practice toward the ultimate purpose.<br>Even with the intention to practice the Dharma, those who take it in hand are very rare.<br>Thus in short, concentrate on the holy dharma.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Persevere in the pure vision that knows with certainty the<br>Master to be your own awareness.<br>By arousing unbearable devotion and fierce respect,<br>You will be blessed to realize the self-arising primordial wisdom<br>And effortlessly conviction will develop from deep within.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Whatever unfavorable conditions of illness or malevolent influences may arise,<br>Through never finding their essential nature to be truly established<br>Except as manifestations of deluded ignorance,<br>Train yourself by taking adversities on to the path as the play of illusion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Seek out different spiritual masters upholding their respective Dharma traditions.<br>According to the interests of those to be tamed, each is profound in its own manner.<br>In this way, without accumulating the evils of attachment and anger.<br>Genuinely train in pure vision, non-sectarianism and superior intention.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In a place of solitude, engaging in ordinary food and drink,<br>Being occupied with frivolous entertainment in attending to your retinue of disciples and patrons,<br>Endlessly engaged in deceiving people,<br>Do not be caught in samsara, deceiving yourself through confusion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">By becoming distracted into the many kinds of knowledge that appear to benefit others,<br>Methods of healing and astrological calculations,<br>Coming up with examples, and so on, ordinary thoughts build up, and<br>The images of a great many dharma practitioners are lost.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The natural disposition of the mind is to be self-aware and to rest in its own place;<br>The radiance of the mind is the unceasing arising of all manner of things.<br>Recognizing delusion’s own faults and the non-existence of the basis of delusion,<br>Study, contemplate, and train on the path of indivisibility.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In short, whatever arises, don’t construct thoughts about it;<br>Nurture it without fabrication, naturally, in its own radiance,<br>just as it is.<br>Whatever occurs, be it abiding or moving, do not obstruct or strive.<br>Always sustain the self-nature of your awareness without distraction.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">When gazing directly at your mind,<br>From the instant of emergence, without defining it as ‘it is thus’<br>Strive to maintain with no distraction the original face<br>Of the natural state of your primordially self-liberated awareness.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">You have the power to bear the meaningless hardships of this life<br>Yet for the sake of dharma you don’t give up a single session of sleep.<br>Be unmistaken in your choice of what to adopt and what to abandon;<br>Always strive to achieve the ultimate goal.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><em>So be it. This copy is offered from the admonition of oral advice in the words of the King of Dharma, Orgyen Terdag Lingpa, which is known as the Drops of Nectar.</em></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><strong>Om Svasti Siddham!</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The delightful enlightened form, like a blooming lotus garden,<br>Whom gods and humans honor as the omniscient one,<br>The glorious Samyepa of mountain retreat,<br>Offers some verses to the ears of people with clear minds!<br>Nowadays, some people have been, in a manner of speaking,<br>Claiming I lack knowledge of appropriate manners, wealth and<br>short of an unconfused frame of mind,<br>That I am not firmly established in solitude and am extremely exhausted.<br>To all these, I answer. Listen as I speak!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Although criticized by sublime beings, non-dharmic evil behavior is increasing.<br>Lies, cunning and fraud are the basis of deceiving others,<br>Causing regret at the time of death and falling to lower realms in future lives.<br>Such appropriately worldly manners are better done without!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Sublime beings criticize sensual pleasures as the lasso of samsara.<br>Bringing on quarrels with everyone, it is the basis for many kinds of suffering.<br>Even if you have enough, you’re not satisfied and craving increases.<br>Since it’s the cause for downfalls, it’s fine to be devoid of wealth!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If revulsion towards worldly dharmas does not arise,<br>There will never be liberation from the ocean of existence.<br>Toward impermanent and essence-less phenomena,<br>It’s good to be unattached and better if you are short of worldly plans!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">While staying together as one, attachment and hatred naturally increases.<br>Distractions, diversions and activities become even greater.<br>By binding one to existence, ego clinging is the cause of bondage.<br>In this kind of situation it’s better not to have any certainty!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Even my exhaustion is not without a cause.<br>As I ponder the auspicious throughout the day and night,<br>[I see] the ocean of samsara, with its waves of birth and death.<br>We wander here from the natural illusion of ego clinging.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Having seen the deep ocean of existence that is difficult to cross,<br>I despair and, shedding tears, become exhausted!<br>Please listen to how I am even more wearied by<br>Examining behavior of other people.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Venerable abbots, teachers and lamas, though quite secure,<br>Do not pursue the path of Dharma but chase after sense<br>pleasure and entertainment.<br>Outwardly peaceful, they are extremely arrogant within,<br>Having seen their cunning ways, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Even those endowed with the Dharma pay attention to the wealthy.<br>The straightforward guides as well are more benevolent<br>towards their dissimulating retinues.<br>They pursue the eight worldly concerns, those versed in non-Dharma.<br>Seeing mere reflections of the Gurus, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The slanderous ones who engage in divisiveness know nothing<br>about what is meaningful.<br>The crooked demonic ones who never take a stand but who live by flattery<br>Are not pleased by goodness and separate two who are in harmony.<br>Seeing friends like this, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Unable to bear it themselves, while expecting others to cope with effort;<br>Not helping in times of need, and upholding others’ unworthy positions.<br>Displaying all kinds of moods even for minor things;<br>Seeing friends like this, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If you teach those who have no proper respect, you evoke harsh words.<br>Lacking faith and devotion, rigid as unyeilding wood<br>They run after food and leave behind the activity of exertion.<br>Seeing students like this, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">They praise you to your face, and speak badly behind your back.<br>Not striving on the path of Dharma, but chasing after sense pleasures,<br>As the final return for your nurture they manufacture quarrels.<br>Seeing students like this, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If your food and clothing are inferior, you’re cast down even if<br>you’re learned.<br>With great wealth, even the stupid are venerated<br>And reckoned as talented although their companions are evil and cunning.<br>Seeing this kind of people, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">They look on those who live in an honest way as being completely uncultured.<br>They take those who lack wealth as having merit.<br>They say that those who follow the Dharma have accomplished<br>only worthless methods.<br>Seeing this kind of people, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Those who are expert at fitting into the ordinary are counted<br>excellent scholars.<br>Those who mimic good qualities are said to be wise in Dharma<br>Those who are good at using harsh, stupid and deceitful words<br>are considered quite exemplary.<br>Seeing this kind of people, I become exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">With only verbal generosity, they dedicate as though the merits<br>were complete.<br>Bringing harm, they are proud as though they had created virtue.<br>Engaging in non-Dharma, they clearly believe they have<br>accomplished the journey to the bliss realm.<br>All these perversions make me quite exhausted!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Without Dharma, obtaining mere trifles is counted as happiness.<br>And genuine monks without wealth are scorned by all who see them.<br>When fools are more valued than noble ones,<br>If there is any feeling, exhaustion is appropriate!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">At this time and place, principles are perverted.<br>Being the opposite of one’s mistakes, good qualities are<br>reckoned as erroneous.<br>Just as the beings of Tsuta (a realm where all beings have only one leg) laugh at two-legged humans,<br>Saying one leg is extra,<br>The one called Samyepa who composes, teaches and debates,<br>Now faces insults for acting in accord with the Dharma!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">When I expound this truth, the throng of heedless, ignorant fools,<br>The most stupid who pretend to be studying and contemplating<br>the system of logic,<br>The foolish hypocrites with their imposing air of mastery of the<br>supreme precious three trainings,<br>And those lofty associates who easily befriend them, are most displeased.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">However my body of discipline is superb; the petals of the<br>three trainings are formed and expanded.<br>And the excellent ones who can discern the causes assemble at<br>the fortress of honesty.<br>In order to awaken delight in their minds I arranged this composition.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">All whose minds are clear, please examine whether the<br>meaning is true or false.<br>In this manner the sweet-voiced one of mountain retreat<br>I, Tshultrim Lodro Zangpo composed this.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">By this virtue, may I and all beings,<br>Sit before the great tree of the essence of enlightenment;<br>After defeating the devils of unpleasant speech,<br>May we become Dharma Kings with the spontaneously established three kayas!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><em>With the intention of a perfect exposition, this answer, called “Endowed with Rosary that Completely Subjugates”, was composed by the greatly learned poet, the glorious Samyepa, Tsultrim Lodro. It is here complete.</em></p>

Through the power of my aspirations I could join the supreme lineage of accomplishment; but lacking in diligence, this existence, lived in vain, come now to its twilight. I had intention to do as the Rishis but I am now utterly dejected and I have seen others like me.<br>This is why, to arouse in my mind a clear renunciation I have uttered these thirty pieces of advice from the heart.<br>.<br>First Advice<br>.<br>Alas! Having, through all kinds of skilful means,<br>gathered round oneself a large circle of people, one may hold a flourishing monastic estate. But this is the source of quarrels and causes great attachments for oneself. To remain alone is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Second Advice<br>.<br>At the occasion of village ceremonies intended to discard obstacles and subdue evil spirits, one may display one's qualities in the crowd. But through covetousness for food and riches, it is one's own mind that will be carried away by the demon.<br>To subdue one's own mind is my advice from my heart.<br>.<br>Third Advice<br>.<br>Having collected great contributions from poor people,<br>one may thus erect statues and monuments, distribute plenty of alms and so on.<br>But this is to cause others to accumulate sins on virtuous grounds 1.<br>To make one's own mind virtuous is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Fourth Advice<br>.<br>Desiring one's own greatness, one will expound Dharma to others and<br>through numerous deceitful tricks, one will retain a cycle of important and humble people. But such a mind clinging to gross realities is the cause of pride.<br>To have only short-term plans is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Fifth Advice<br>.<br>Selling, loaning with interest, and all these kinds of deceits;<br>with the wealth amassed in the wrong way one may very well make large offerings, but merits resting upon greed are the source of the eight worldly dharmas2. To meditate upon the rejection of covetousness is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Sixth Advice<br>.<br>Acting as witness, guarantor, and getting involved in law disputes,<br>one may thus settle others' quarrels, thinking this is for the good of all.<br>But to indulge in this will bring up interested aims. To remain without either expectations or apprehensions is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Seventh Advice<br>.<br>Administering provinces, having attendants and material wealth,<br>one's renown may thus spread all over the world.<br>But at the time of death, these things do not have the slightest use.<br>To endeavour in one's practice is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Eighth Advice<br>.<br>Bursars, attendants, those in responsible positions and cooks<br>are the pillars of the monastic community.<br>But a mind interested in these is the cause of worry.<br>To minimize this confusing bustle is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Ninth Advice<br>.<br>Carrying religious objects, offerings, books and cooking paraphernalia,<br>one may go to the mountains solitude with all necessary.<br>But to be well-equipped now is the source of difficulties and quarrels.<br>To have no needs is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Tenth Advice<br>.<br>In these decadent times one may reproach the crude people around one.<br>Although one thinks it will be useful to them,<br>it is just the source of poisonous thoughts.<br>To utter peaceful words is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Eleventh Advice<br>.<br>Without any selfish consideration, one may,<br>with affection, tell people their defects, only thinking of their own good.<br>But although what one says is true this will ulcerate their hearts.<br>To say gentle words is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twelfth Advice<br>.<br>One engages in controversies, defending one's point of view and<br>contradicting the other's thinking thus to preserve the purity of the Teachings.<br>But in such a way one induces impure thoughts.<br>To remain silent is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Thirteenth Advice<br>.<br>Thinking one is rendering service,<br>one support in a partisan way one's Guru's lineage and philosophical views.<br>But to praise oneself and belittle others ripens one's attachments and hatred.<br>To leave these things is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Fourteenth Advice<br>.<br>Having examined thoroughly the Dharma one has heard,<br>one may think that understanding other's errors<br>is proof of having discriminative wisdom.<br>But to think in this way is to cause the accumulation of one's own sins.<br>To view everything as pure is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Fifteenth Advice<br>.<br>Speaking only the language of blank emptiness and disdaining cause and effect,<br>one may think that non-action is the ultimate point of Dharma.<br>But to forsake the two accumulations will wither the prosperity of one's practice.<br>To unite these two is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Sixteenth Advice<br>.<br>Concerning the third initiation, there is the descending of the essence and so on.<br>One may think that the way of the other's body will lead to outstanding progress.<br>But on this path of the impure many great meditators have been ensnared.<br>To rely upon the path of liberation is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Seventeenth Advice<br>.<br>To bestow empowerments upon unqualified people and distribute to crowd<br>sacramental substances is the source of abuse and of spoiling the samaya.<br>To prefer upright behaviour is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Eighteenth Advice<br>.<br>To go naked in public and other eccentricities,<br>one may think is to act as a yogi.<br>But this is how one causes worldly people to lose faith.<br>To be thoughtful in all things is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Nineteenth Advice<br>.<br>Wherever one stays, with the desire to be the greatest<br>one will act in a traditional and clever fashion.<br>But this is the cause of falling from the highest to the lowest.<br>To be neither tense nor relaxed is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twentieth Advice<br>.<br>Whether one dwells in villages, monasteries, or mountains retreats,<br>without searching for intimates one should be friends with all,<br>but with neither intimacy nor animosity.<br>To keep one's independence is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-first Advice<br>.<br>Assuming an artificial countenance one may pay homage<br>in a fine way to the patrons who take care of one's subsistence.<br>But feigning on account of others causes one to entangle oneself.<br>To act with uniform taste is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-second Advice<br>.<br>There are innumerable writings upon divination, astrology, medicine and so on.<br>Although they all deal with the methods based upon<br>the interdependent links, leading to omniscience.<br>To become very fond of these various things will scatter one's contemplation.<br>To minimize the study of these sciences is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-third Advice<br>.<br>At the time one stays inside arranging the interior,<br>one may thus have all comforts in the midst of solitude.<br>But this is how to fritter way one's whole life on trivial details.<br>To put off all these activities is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-fourth Advice<br>.<br>Learned, virtuous and so on, also having some diligence towards accomplishment,<br>thus one's personal qualities may reach their peak.<br>But the clinging associated with this will just entangle oneself.<br>To know how to be free, without egocentricity is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-fifth Advice<br>.<br>To make hail and thunder fall, cast magic spells, while protecting oneself from all these,<br>one may think to subdue what has to be subdued.<br>But by burning another's being one will end up in the lower realms.<br>To remain humble is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-sixth Advice<br>.<br>One might have an abundance of desirable texts, spoken advice, notes and so on.<br>But if one does not put them into practice, at the time of death they will be of no use.<br>To study one's mind is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-seventh Advice<br>.<br>At the time one practices one-pointedly, one may have experiences,<br>discuss them with others, write spiritual verses and sing song of realization.<br>Although such things are natural manifestations of the practice,<br>they will increase wandering thoughts.<br>To keep away from intellectualization is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-eighth Advice<br>.<br>Whatever thoughts arise it is important to stare at them.<br>Thus when one has a clear understanding of the mind<br>it is important to remain with it.<br>Although there is nothing to meditate upon,<br>it is important to remain in such meditation.<br>To be always attentive is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Twenty-nine Advice<br>.<br>In the midst of emptiness, acting according to the Law of cause and effect,<br>having understood non-action keeping the three vows3.<br>with absolute compassion4, may we strive for the benefit of all beings.<br>To unite the two accumulations is my advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Thirtieth Advice<br>.<br>One has followed many wise and accomplished Gurus, received many profound instructions,<br>and looked through a few sutras and tantras, still one does not apply them.<br>Alas! One is just deceiving oneself.<br>.<br>Thus for myself and those alike me I have spoken these thirty pieces of advice from the heart.<br>Whatever little merit may arise from such a spirit of renunciation, may all beings be guided in the<br>wild expanses of existence, and be established in the great bliss. By walking in the footsteps of the<br>Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the three times and of all the great saints, may we become their<br>supreme sons. Thus urged by a little bit of renunciation, Tsultrim Lodro5 conceived these thirty<br>pieces of advice from the heart.<br>.<br>Notes:<br>1. Doing so, instead of accumulating merit, both the lama and the donators accumulate demerit.<br>2. Fame and obscurity; pleasure and pain; gain and loss; praise and blame.<br>3. Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.<br>4. Compassion without representations, non-referential compassion.<br>5. One of Longchenpa's names</span></div>

              </p><p>Advice from Me to Myself</p>
              <p>Patrul Rinpoche</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vajrasattva, sole deity, Master, </p>
              <p>You sit on a full-moon lotus-cushion of  white light</p>
              <p>In the hundred-petalled full bloom of youth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think of me, Vajrasattva,</p>
              <p>You who remain unmoved within the manifest display </p>
              <p>That is Mahamudra, pure bliss-emptiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Listen up, old bad-karma Patrul,</p>
              <p>You dweller-in-distraction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For ages now you've been</p>
              <p>Beguiled, entranced, and fooled by appearances.</p>
              <p>Are you aware of that? Are you? </p>
              <p>Right this very instant, when you're </p>
              <p>Under the spell of mistaken perception</p>
              <p>You've got to watch out.</p>
              <p>Don't let yourself get carried away by this fake </p>
              <p>    and empty life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your mind is spinning around</p>
              <p>About carrying out a lot of useless projects:</p>
              <p>It's a waste! Give it up!</p>
              <p>Thinking about the hundred plans you want to accomplish,</p>
              <p>With never enough time to finish them, </p>
              <p>Just weighs down your mind.</p>
              <p>You're completely distracted</p>
              <p>By all these projects, which never come to an end,</p>
              <p>But keep spreading out more, like ripples in water.</p>
              <p>Don't be a fool: for once, just sit tight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Listening to the teachings — you've already</p>
              <p>    heard hundreds of teachings,</p>
              <p>But when you haven't grasped the meaning of even </p>
              <p>   one teaching,</p>
              <p>What's the point of more listening?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reflecting on the teachings — even though you've listened,</p>
              <p>If the teachings aren't coming to mind when needed,</p>
              <p>What's the point of more reflection? None.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meditating according to the teachings —</p>
              <p>If your meditation practice still isn't curing</p>
              <p>The obscuring states of mind—forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You've added up just how many mantras you've done — </p>
              <p>But you aren't accomplishing the kyerim visualization.</p>
              <p>You may get the forms of deities nice and clear —</p>
              <p>But you're not putting an end to subject and object.</p>
              <p>You may tame what appear to be evil spirits and ghosts,</p>
              <p>But you're not training the stream of your own mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your four fine sessions of sadhana practice,</p>
              <p>So meticulously arranged — </p>
              <p>Forget about them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you're in a good mood,</p>
              <p>Your practice seems to have lots of clarity — </p>
              <p>But you just can't relax into it.</p>
              <p>When you're depressed, </p>
              <p>Your practice is stable enough </p>
              <p>But there's no brilliance to it. </p>
              <p>As for awareness, </p>
              <p>You try to force yourself into a rigpa-like state, </p>
              <p>As if stabbing a stake into a target!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When those yogic positions and gazes keep your mind stable </p>
              <p>Only by keeping mind tethered — </p>
              <p>Forget about them!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giving high-sounding lectures</p>
              <p>Doesn't do your mind-stream any good.</p>
              <p>The path of analytical reasoning is precise and acute — </p>
              <p>But it's just more delusion, good for nothing goat-shit. </p>
              <p>The oral instructions are very profound </p>
              <p>But not if you don't put them into practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reading over and over those dharma texts </p>
              <p>That just occupy your mind and make your eyes sore — </p>
              <p>Forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You beat your little damaru drum — ting, ting — </p>
              <p>And your audience thinks it's charming to hear.</p>
              <p>You're reciting words about offering up your body, </p>
              <p>But you still haven't stopped holding it dear. </p>
              <p>You're making your little cymbals go cling, cling — </p>
              <p>Without keeping the ultimate purpose in mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All this dharma-practice equipment </p>
              <p>That seems so attractive — </p>
              <p>Forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, those students are all studying so very hard,</p>
              <p>But in the end, they can't keep it up.</p>
              <p>Today, they seem to get the idea,</p>
              <p>But later on, there's not a trace left. </p>
              <p>Even if one of them manages to learn a little,</p>
              <p>He rarely applies his "learning" to his own conduct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those elegant dharma disciplines — </p>
              <p>Forget about them!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This year, he really cares about you,</p>
              <p>Next year, it's not like that.</p>
              <p>At first, he seems modest,</p>
              <p>Then he grows exalted and pompous.</p>
              <p>The more you nurture and cherish him,</p>
              <p>The more distant he grows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These dear friends </p>
              <p>Who show such smiling faces to begin with — </p>
              <p>Forget about them!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Her smile seems so full of joy — </p>
              <p>But who knows if that's really the case?</p>
              <p>One time, it's pure pleasure,</p>
              <p>Then it's nine months of mental pain. </p>
              <p>It might be fine for a month, </p>
              <p>But sooner or later, there's trouble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People teasing; your mind embroiled — </p>
              <p>Your lady-friend — </p>
              <p>Forget about her!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These endless rounds of conversation</p>
              <p>Are just attachment and aversion — </p>
              <p>It's just more goat-shit, good for nothing at all.</p>
              <p>At the time it seems marvelously entertaining,</p>
              <p>But really, you're just spreading around stories</p>
              <p>     about other people's mistakes.</p>
              <p>Your audience seems to be listening politely, </p>
              <p>But then they grow embarrassed for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Useless talk that just make you thirsty —</p>
              <p>Forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Giving teachings on meditation texts</p>
              <p>Without yourself having </p>
              <p>Gained actual experience through practice, </p>
              <p>Is like reciting a dance-manual out loud </p>
              <p>And thinking that's the same as actually dancing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People may be listening to you with devotion,</p>
              <p>But it just isn't the real thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sooner or later, when your own actions</p>
              <p>Contradict the teachings, you'll feel ashamed.</p>
              <p>Just mouthing the words,</p>
              <p>Giving dharma explanations that sound so eloquent— </p>
              <p>Forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you don't have a text, you long for it;</p>
              <p>Then when you've finally gotten it, </p>
              <p>you hardly look at it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The number of pages seems few enough,</p>
              <p>But it's a bit hard to find time to copy them all.</p>
              <p>Even if you copied down all the dharma texts on earth, </p>
              <p>You wouldn't be satisfied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Copying down texts is a waste of time</p>
              <p>(Unless you get paid) — </p>
              <p>So forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, they're happy as clams — </p>
              <p>Tomorrow, they're furious. </p>
              <p>With all their black moods and white moods, </p>
              <p>People are never satisfied. </p>
              <p>Or even if they're nice enough, </p>
              <p>They may not come through when you really need them,</p>
              <p>Disappointing you even more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All this politeness, keeping up a </p>
              <p>Courteous demeanor — </p>
              <p>Forget about it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worldly and religious work</p>
              <p>Is the province of gentlemen.</p>
              <p>Patrul, old boy — that's not for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Haven't you noticed what always happens? </p>
              <p>An old bull, once you've gone to the trouble of </p>
              <p>    borrowing him for his services,</p>
              <p>Seems to have absolutely no desire left in him at all— </p>
              <p>(Except to go back to sleep).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be like that — desireless.</p>
              <p>Just sleep, eat, piss, shit. </p>
              <p>There's nothing else in life that has to be done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't get involved with other things:</p>
              <p>They're not the point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keep a low profile, </p>
              <p>Sleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the triple universe</p>
              <p>When you're lower than your company</p>
              <p>You should take the low seat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should you happen to be the superior one,</p>
              <p>Don't get arrogant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's no absolute need to have close friends;</p>
              <p>You're better off just keeping to yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you're without any worldly </p>
              <p>   or religious obligations,</p>
              <p>Don't keep on longing to acquire some!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you let go of everything —</p>
              <p>Everything, everything — </p>
              <p>That's the real point!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This advice was written by the practitioner Trime Lodro </p>
              <p>(Patrul Rinpoche) for his intimate friend Ahu Shri </p>
              <p>(Patrul Rinpoche), in order to give advice that is tailored </p>
              <p>exactly to his capacities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This advice should be put into practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even though you don't know how to practice, just let go of </p>
              <p>everything — that's what I really want to say. Even though </p>
              <p>you aren't able to succeed in your dharma practice, don't </p>
              <p>get angry.</p>

              </p><p>“Buddhahood Without Meditation” by Dudjom Rinpoche:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another occasion, when I encountered Orgyan Tsokyey Dorje–the embodiment of the magical illusion of timeless awareness–he bestowed advice for refining my perception of things so that I could see that they are illusory (gyu-ma). He said, “For me to introduce you directly to the interdependence of causes and conditions coming together, consider this: The cause is the ground of being as basic space (zhi-ying), which is pristinely lucid (dang-sal) and endowed with capacity for anything whatsoever to arise. The condition is a consciousness that conceives of an ‘I.’ From the coming together of these two, all sensory appearances (nang-wa) manifest like illusions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“In this way, the ground of being as basic space, ordinary mind (sem) that arises from the dynamic energy (tzal) of that ground, and the external and internal phenomena that constitute the manifest aspect of that mind are all interlinked (lu-gu-gyud), like the sun and its rays. Thus, we use the expression ‘occurring in interdependent connection.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Here are some metaphors for this process: It is like the appearance of a magical illusion, which depends on the pristine clarity of space as the cause and manifestations through the interdependent connection created by the synchronicity of the conditions–that is, magical substances, mantras, and the mind that creates the illusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All phenomena, which manifest as they do, are ineffable, yet appear due to the influence of conceiving of an ‘I.’ This process is like a mirage appearing from the synchronicity of vividly clear space and the presence of warmth and moisture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All sensory appearances of the waking consciousness, dream states, the bardo, and future lifetimes are apparent yet ineffable. Confusion comes about due to fixation on their seeming truth. This is like a dream that one does not consider false–thinking, ‘This is a dream’–but instead reifies and fixates on as some enduring objective environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Due to the predominant condition of the perception of an inner ‘I,’ the realm of phenomena manifests as something ‘other.’ This is like the appearance of a reflection through the interdependent connection of a face and a mirror coming together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Because one is thoroughly ensnared by concepts of identity (dag-dzin), the realms of the six states manifest one after the other. This is like the cities of gandarvas appearing in one’s environment–for example, one a plain at sunset–as visionary experiences reified by the ordinary mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“While sensory appearances are primordially such that they have never existed, the myriad appearances that are seen, heard, smelled and tasted, or felt are like echoes–subjective appearances manifesting as though they were something else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All sensory appearances are not other than the ground of being, but are of one taste with that ground itself, like the reflections of all the planets and stars in the ocean that are not other than the ocean, but are of one taste with the water itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Due to the concept of an ‘I,’ self and other manifest as though they truly existed within the panoramic sky of the ground of being, expansive basic space. This is analogous to bubbles forming on water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The pristine lucidity of the ground of being as empty basic space is forced into the narrow confines of the subjective perception of consciousness based on conceptual mind (yid-shey). The influence of this entrenched habit causes sensory appearances perceived in confusion to manifest in all their variety. This is like the appearance of a hallucination when pressure is applied to the optic nerve or when one’s nervous system is disturbed by an imbalance of subtle energy (lung).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Sensory appearances manifest from the ground of being in all their variety in view of a consciousness that conceives of an ‘I,’ yet they do not diverge from or occur outside of that ground. This is like the case of an adept who has gained mastery (wang gyur-wa) over states of meditative absorption (ting-nge-dzin) that permit the emanation and control of phantoms. Although a variety of phantoms manifest when such an individual is engaged in this process of emanation and control, in actuality these phantoms are free of any basis and have never existed as real objects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Ah, my incredible little child, meditate progressively in this way and, having realized that all sensory appearances are illusory, you will become a yogin of illusion.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saying this, he vanished.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><em><strong>The Ultimate and Meaningful Instruction: Longchen Rabjam</strong></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Supreme glorious master, all-pervasive lord of the hundred Buddha-families.<br>Who combines into one, the power of compassion and enlightened activity.<br>Of the limitless mandala of the infinite Victorious Ones,<br>I constantly pay homage at your feet.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Ema, fortunate yogins listen to me. We have all now obtained this perfect human body with the freedoms and endowments. We have been introduced to the precious teachings of the higher vehicle. We have the freedom to behave in accordance with the sublime dharma. At this time, we should make sure that our human life does not go to waste and pass without meaning. We must establish our ultimate goal correctly. The categories of teachings are innumerable, the doors to the teachings are countless, and the commentaries to the teachings are vast.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If you cannot practice the essential points of the teachings, then although one knows a hundred thousand volumes of scriptures by heart, certain benefit at the time of death is difficult to achieve. Although you may have acquired boundless qualities of knowledge through study and contemplation, if your mindstream does not accord with genuine dharma you will not be able to tame the enemy of delusions. Moreover, if you don’t commit to an attitude of not needing anything, even with control over the one billion world systems, contentment won’t arise.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Without preparing soon for the uncertain time of death, you will not accomplish the great essential objective when death occurs. If you don’t correct your own mistakes and train in unbiased pure perception, being motivated by attachment and aversion, you won’t fully enter t dharma of the greater vehicle.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Among the six realms of the three worlds, there is not even a single sentient being who has not been your parent. If you do not regularly and continually aspire and pray for their well-being and happiness with the compassionate mind of enlightenment, the treasure of benefiting others will not be revealed. If you do not cultivate the devotion to your root guru that regards him as even more kind than the actual Buddha, the power of blessings will not be great.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">If genuine blessings do not enter into you, the sprout of experience and realization will not emerge. Without realization dawning from within, the fruit of enlightenment will not be obtained through mere intellectual understanding or empty talk. In short, if you do not mingle your mind with dharma, merely appearing like a practitioner will not bring about your purpose. Consider that you do not need more than is merely sufficient to support your life force and vital energy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Pray single-pointedly to your guru and practice Guru Yoga. Whatever virtuous activities you do, always focus on the benefit for sentient beings, your parents. No matter what happiness or sorrow, good or bad might occur, always meditate on the compassion of your guru. Within the expanse of self manifesting non-grasping self-cognizing awareness, abide in non-fabricated and unforced naturalness. Whatever thought arises; know its nature and liberate everything as the play of the true nature of reality.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Without so much as a hair tip of something solid to meditate on, and without falling for even a moment under the power of perpetual ordinary delusion, maintain undistracted mindfulness in all your daily activities. By training in recognizing all sights and sounds — whatever arises of the six consciousnesses — as magical play lacking true existence, you will gain mastery over the experiences of the bardo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In short, at all times and on all occasions ensure that whatever you do accords with the sacred dharma and dedicate all virtue for the attainment of enlightenment. Acting in that way, you will not only fulfill the intentions of your root guru but also be of service to the teachings. You will repay the kindness of your parents and spontaneously accomplish the two benefits, of self and others.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">I request that you retain this in your hearts. Even if you meet me in person, other than these instructions, I have nothing more to say. Therefore, at all times and on all occasions, practice!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-family: tahoma, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The powerful conqueror, the excellent Longchen Rabjam wrote this when he lived on the slope of Gangri Thodkar. May it be virtuous!</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>“Buddhahood Without Meditation” by Dudjom Rinpoche:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another occasion, when I encountered Orgyan Tsokyey Dorje–the
              embodiment of the magical illusion of timeless awareness–he
              bestowed advice for refining my perception of things so that I
              could see that they are illusory (gyu-ma). He said, “For me to
              introduce you directly to the interdependence of causes and
              conditions coming together, consider this: The cause is the ground
              of being as basic space (zhi-ying), which is pristinely lucid
              (dang-sal) and endowed with capacity for anything whatsoever to
              arise. The condition is a consciousness that conceives of an ‘I.’
              From the coming together of these two, all sensory appearances
              (nang-wa) manifest like illusions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“In this way, the ground of being as basic space, ordinary mind
              (sem) that arises from the dynamic energy (tzal) of that ground,
              and the external and internal phenomena that constitute the
              manifest aspect of that mind are all interlinked (lu-gu-gyud), like
              the sun and its rays. Thus, we use the expression ‘occurring in
              interdependent connection.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Here are some metaphors for this process: It is like the
              appearance of a magical illusion, which depends on the pristine
              clarity of space as the cause and manifestations through the
              interdependent connection created by the synchronicity of the
              conditions–that is, magical substances, mantras, and the mind that
              creates the illusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All phenomena, which manifest as they do, are ineffable, yet
              appear due to the influence of conceiving of an ‘I.’ This process
              is like a mirage appearing from the synchronicity of vividly clear
              space and the presence of warmth and moisture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All sensory appearances of the waking consciousness, dream
              states, the bardo, and future lifetimes are apparent yet ineffable.
              Confusion comes about due to fixation on their seeming truth. This
              is like a dream that one does not consider false–thinking, ‘This is
              a dream’–but instead reifies and fixates on as some enduring
              objective environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Due to the predominant condition of the perception of an inner
              ‘I,’ the realm of phenomena manifests as something ‘other.’ This is
              like the appearance of a reflection through the interdependent
              connection of a face and a mirror coming together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Because one is thoroughly ensnared by concepts of identity
              (dag-dzin), the realms of the six states manifest one after the
              other. This is like the cities of gandarvas appearing in one’s
              environment–for example, one a plain at sunset–as visionary
              experiences reified by the ordinary mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“While sensory appearances are primordially such that they have
              never existed, the myriad appearances that are seen, heard, smelled
              and tasted, or felt are like echoes–subjective appearances
              manifesting as though they were something else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“All sensory appearances are not other than the ground of being,
              but are of one taste with that ground itself, like the reflections
              of all the planets and stars in the ocean that are not other than
              the ocean, but are of one taste with the water itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Due to the concept of an ‘I,’ self and other manifest as though
              they truly existed within the panoramic sky of the ground of being,
              expansive basic space. This is analogous to bubbles forming on
              water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The pristine lucidity of the ground of being as empty basic
              space is forced into the narrow confines of the subjective
              perception of consciousness based on conceptual mind (yid-shey).
              The influence of this entrenched habit causes sensory appearances
              perceived in confusion to manifest in all their variety. This is
              like the appearance of a hallucination when pressure is applied to
              the optic nerve or when one’s nervous system is disturbed by an
              imbalance of subtle energy (lung).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Sensory appearances manifest from the ground of being in all
              their variety in view of a consciousness that conceives of an ‘I,’
              yet they do not diverge from or occur outside of that ground. This
              is like the case of an adept who has gained mastery (wang gyur-wa)
              over states of meditative absorption (ting-nge-dzin) that permit
              the emanation and control of phantoms. Although a variety of
              phantoms manifest when such an individual is engaged in this
              process of emanation and control, in actuality these phantoms are
              free of any basis and have never existed as real objects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Ah, my incredible little child, meditate progressively in this
              way and, having realized that all sensory appearances are illusory,
              you will become a yogin of illusion.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saying this, he vanished.</p>

              <p>Maurice O'Connell Walsh sees a possible Shin connection in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.024.wlsh.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Sarakaani Sutta</span></span></a>...see his footnotes.<br><br>I must say that this struck me too, though maybe someone will deem the parallels to be superficial. Shinran believed himself incapable of any religious practice and decided to put his trust in other-power. Likewise, Sarakaaani failed at his practice and took to drink, but his sincere devotion to the Triple Gem kept him out of the states of woe (and even led to stream entry at the moment of death). <br><br>Remarking on practitioners of various capabilities, the Buddha states:<br></p>
              <blockquote class="uncited">
              <div>Take the case of another man. He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release. But he has just these things: the faculty of faith, of energy, of mindfulness, of concentration, of wisdom. Yet if he has <strong>merely faith</strong>, merely affection for the Tathaagata, that man, too, does not go to... states of woe.</div>

              <p>
              </p><p>The famous nineteenth-century dzogchen master Paltrul Rinpoche explained self-liberation concretely and precisely:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The practitioner of self-liberation is like an ordinary person as far as the way in which the thoughts of pleasure and pain, hope and fear, manifest themselves as creative energy. However, the ordinary person, taking these really seriously and judging them as acceptable or rejecting them, continues to get caught up in situations and becomes conditioned by attachment and aversion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Not doing this, a practitioner, when such thoughts arise, experiences freedom: initially, by recognizing the thought for what it is, it is freed just like meeting a previous acquaintance; then it is freed in and of itself, like a snake shedding its skin; and finally, thought is freed in being unable to be of benefit or harm, like a thief entering an empty house."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...Freeing or liberating thought does not mean ignoring, letting go of, being indifferent to, observing, or even not having thoughts. It means being present in hope and fear, pain and pleasure, not as objects before us, but as the radiant clarity of our natural state. Thus anger, for example, when experienced dualistically, is an irritation which we may indulge in or reject, depending on our conditioning. Either way we are caught up in it and act out of it. But when aware of anger as a manifestation of clarity, its energy is a very fresh awareness of the particulars of the situation. However, these particulars are no longer irritating.</p>

              <p>An effortless compassion can arise for all beings</p>
              <p>who have not realized their true nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So limitless is it that if tears could express it,</p>
              <p>you would cry without end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not only compassion, but tremendous skillful means</p>
              <p>can be born when you realize the nature of mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also you are naturally liberated from all suffering and fear,</p>
              <p>such as the fear of birth, death and the intermediate state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then if you were to speak of the joy and bliss that arise</p>
              <p>from this realization, it is said by the buddhas that</p>
              <p>if you were to gather all the glory, enjoyment, pleasure</p>
              <p>and happiness of the world and put it all together,</p>
              <p>it would not approach one tiny fraction of the bliss</p>
              <p>that you experience upon realizing the nature of mind.</p>

Now, this may seem a little unusual for a meditation retreat. He explains, however, that when you go to meditate, you normally take up something to meditate on, some thing. That thing, and therefore that meditation, is necessarily ar</span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">tificial. The practice of Mahamudra is not like that at all. It is not taking up a thing called Mahamudra and meditating on it. Ultimately, Ma-hamudra practice is meditation directly on reality itself.<br><br>Reality itself is not something devised or made up. What you have to do here is accustom yourself to that, practice that. You are not taking up a meditation, but rather are practicing something. Like any activity, when you practice and become accustomed to it, it becomes easier and easier. So, acquaint yourself with this lack of anything whatsoever to be taken up as a discrete object. Focus on reality itself and become accustomed to that. Tilopa's advice, then, is that if you attain something by this Mahamudra practice, then you have not attained Mahamudra. Attaining Mahamudra is attaining non-attainment. If you are not getting anything, then you're getting Mahamudra. If you get some thing, then necessarily it is not Mahamudra.<br><br>What is the meaning of this? If, when we strive for Buddhahood, we think that Buddhahood is something that we are going to get, we will be making a great mistake. We would be like hunters going after an animal. Buddhahood would be reduced to just another worldly activity in which we engage to get some pleasure for ourselves. Mahamudra is not like that, it is not some thing to be obtained. It is attaining the state of non-attainment. Understanding that, we do not focus on obtaining something but on transcending. We have to get beyond that search for something to grasp onto.<br><br>Now the nature of reality is beyond the illusion of the phenomenal world, the world as it appears. What appears is illusory; reality is something else. So, when engaging in this meditation on Mahamudra, one seeks to realize Mahamudra. As long as it is something that is an object of mind, something that is conceived by mind, then is it necessarily something other than Mahamudra. Mahamudra is not a conception, not something which is of the nature of appearances or of the nature of objects of the conventional mind.<br><br>Therefore, whatever we look for, whatever we try to hold on to in terms of objects of mind, is not going to be Mahamudra. It is something other than that. It is not of the nature of the phenomenal world in any sense. As long as we conceive of it as something, we are making a mistake and will not attain the realization of Mahamudra in that way. Tilopa's advice is that if the disciple wishes to see Mahamudra, the disciple must go beyond conventional mind and abandon worldly involvement, because the conventional mind and worldly activities are what obscure the realization of Mahamudra and can never lead to it.<br><br>Excerpted from the book The Practice of Mahamudra - Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche</span></p></div>

Its matured result are the 404 types of disease, headed by heat and cold, phlegm, aches, and swelling.

By resting in that continuouse state, when an experience occurs, it vanishes by itself, and when realization occurs, it dawns as empty cognizance. At least you will not have to suffer with the thought of feeling sick.</div>

Imagine a dark blue HUNG in you heart center, the size of a barley grain. If it is a heat discease, imagine that a white HUNG the size of a barley grain emerges from the HUNG in your heart center and circles throughout the upper part of your torso. It completely draws out all the sickness, just like a magnet collecting needles. Emerging from the top of your head it vanishes into space. Imagining this, draw the winds upward.</div>

Emerging through the lower opening, imagine that it disappears into the center of the earth.</div>

Imagine that it gathers up the sickness and leaves through the boil or out through your fingertips.</div>

It gathers all the sickness throughout your body and vanishes into midair after emerging through whichever nostril the breath moves.</div>

You must cast all concerns far away and be free from doubt and hesitation about what is exorcised or visualized. The visualization and your mind should become unified. It is important to rely and concentrate upon these three points.</div>

When you have frequent experiences, due to the link between the structuring of your channels and the shifting of the thought flow, you will be attacked by the magical displays of s-called demonic forces and feel doubt. When thoughts of fear and dread arise, identify them quickly and bring them onto the path. If you let them run wild or fall under their power, they will become an obstacle for your practice.</div>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);"><br></div>

It is essential to use hindrances as the path. </div>

The experiences of evil forces and magical displays are experienced within your own mistraken mind. There are definitely no ‘gods’ or ‘demonds’ outside of yourself. The very moment you experience evil forces and magical displays, apply the vital point of understanding that they do not possess any true existence as they are devoid of arising, dwelling and ceasing. Whenenver a magical attack occurs, assume your yogi posture, keep the gaze and look into its identity. The thought then dawns as empty cognizance. As soon as your thinking turns into empty cognizance, you possess the confident courage that thoroughly cuts through fear and dead.</div>

Keep the self-assurance of thinking, “I cannot be harmed by obstacles! To faintheartedly think “I wonder if I will meet with some obstacles!” merely creates a welcome for demonds.</div>

They do not possess even an atom of existence outside [your own mind]. Cut the stream of conceptual thinking! Offer your aggregates as a feast.</div>
