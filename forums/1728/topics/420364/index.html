                is Liberation?</span><br> </span></em></p>
              <blockquote><em> The Bardo Thotrol is one of a series of instructions on
              six  types of   liberation: liberation through hearing, liberation through 
               wearing,  liberation   through seeing, liberation through remembering, liberation 
               through  tasting,   and liberation through touching. They were composed by
               Padmasambhava  and   written down by his wife, Yeshe Tsogyal, along with 
              the sadhana of the two   mandalas of forty-two peaceful and fifty-eight wrathful 
               deities. </em>
              <p><em>Padmasambhava buried these texts in the Gampo hills in central 
               Tibet,  where   later the great teacher Gampopa established his monastery. 
               Many other  texts   and sacred objects were buried in this way in different 
               places throughout    Tibet, and are known as terma, 'hidden treasures.' Padmasambhava
               gave the    transmission of power to discover the termas to his twenty-five
               chief   disciples. The Bardo texts were later discovered by Karma-Lingpa,
               who was  an   incarnation of one of these disciples. </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Liberation, in this case, means that whoever
               comes into contact with this   teaching--even in the form of doubt, or with
               an open mind--receives a   sudden glimpse of enlightenment through the power
               of the transmission   contained in these treasures. (p. xi)</strong></span></em></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><br> There is liberation by hearing, seeing, touching etc existing. How this 
              function, to get an idea of it , for this I am sending you something 
              from Khenpho Kathar Rinpoche. He talkes about the mantra KARMAPA CHENNO 
              how it can liberate just by hearing it.<br> Same must be with OM MANI PEME HUNG. I know also about texts which can cause liberation just by wearing it, reading it etc. <br> I think we have to understand this as an gradual process. I could also 
              imagine that to see, hear such things could  as well cause an instant 
              moment of liberations, JUST for persons who already practiced a lot in 
              past lifes.<br><br> Many of us hear Mahamudra teachings 10-30 times, but are still not 
              liberated, and there are people, whom we know from stories who were 
              quite innocent/ ignorant about dharma and just once heared teachings on 
              mahamudra and became enlightened just by hearing the teachings........</em> <em><br><br> I think the reliques of the Buddha and the other masters can have the 
              same effect: getting liberated just by seeing, getting touched by it. 
              And I think the more we believe in this the more we speed up our on 
              progress, the more blessing can enter us.</em> <em><br><br> With all my best wishes</em> <em><br> Csillag<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br> <br> Chenno is actually honorific. „Chen“ is meant as an honorific, and the 
              ending“no“ emphasizes that. It is really an honorific for saying „Listen
               to me.“ It is clear that when we are talking to someone and say „Please
               listen to me,“ we mean for them to listen using the ears.<br> However, we are not particularly saying to the teacher to listen with 
              ears, but rather to listen from the heart or mind to what we are saying.<br> „Please know and understand what I am saying.“ Something like that. In a
               very respectful way,we are saying, „ Listen to me, listen to me.“ We 
              have to know, when we are saying Karmapa Chenno, it does not simply mean
               pay attention.There is also a feeling of a request to grant blessings. 
              So we are requesting him to grant blessings and we are praying to him.<br> <br> When we speak of the ability to libearate through hearing, we have often
               said that an individual like the Karmapa is able to liberate beings 
              through hearing, touching, and then reflecting.<br> If someone has never seen someone like the Karmapa, and if another 
              person with some sense of compassion recites the name „Karmapa“ or 
              „Karmapa Chenno,“ and if the words are heared by that sentient being, a 
              virtuous seed is cultivated in the mind of the hearer.<br> This is because of the compassion and strength or power of someone like the Karmapa.<br> In the end, the person or being who has heard the name of Karmapa or 
              Karmapa Chenno will not have to experience lower births; from then 
              onward, he or she will always develop or cultivate that seed of virtue.<br> <br> That is one example of how someone like the Karmapa can liberate through hearing.<br> Now if we start to recite Karmapa Chenno loudly in the city, people may 
              think we are crazy and the police might come; so do not do this in the 
              city.<br> That is the main reason why we used mountains and ocean; we are free to shout there.<br> By reciting that mantra and animals hearing it, they are helped because 
              they do not need to take rebirth in the lower realms after they die. 
              Therefore, what happens is that these animals and other beings take 
              rebirth in a higher realm such as the human realm; they do not obtain 
              liberation necessarily, but because of the cultivation of that 
              connection, they have the motivation to practice the buddhadharma after 
              that, and by eventually practicing the path of the dharma, they can be 
              liberated in the Western pure land realm of Dewachen.<br> But by the same token, if the sentient beings, the animals, birds or 
              whatever they are, do not have some karma, the mantra alone cannot be 
              beneficial. If that alone were beneficial, Buddha would have had 
              complete power; since Buddha is all-compassionate, he would have done 
              that.<br> All we have to do is just try to recite it and those who have karma will
               be able to benefit from it. We do not know who does or does not have 
              the karma, but they will eventually build the karma to connect to it 
              some day.<br> <br> An individual definitely must have tremendous realization in order for 
              the sound of his or her name to cultivate the seed of virtue in beings.<br> That is why many practitioners who are genuine and compassionate receite
               names such as „Karmapa“ or phrases such as Karmapa Chenno when they are
               in the mountains or near a river, so that even the fish, animals and 
              birds in the forest are able to cultivate such virtuous seeds because of
               having heared the oractitioner`s use of these names and words.<br> This way of benefitting is really beyond our imagination.<br> <br> There is also the possibility of liberation through reflecting or 
              thinking about such beings. Even if we have not met someone like the 
              Karmapa, but we have read his biography, that biography alone can 
              cultivate vitous seeds that will not let us fall into the lower realms 
              even though we may not have met him or her.<br> After learning about this person and being inspired by them, if we 
              simply think about or reflect on them at the moment of death, for 
              example, it is certain that we will be freed from all the suffering and 
              pain of the lower realms even though we have not met them.<br> We will then experience a better birth where all the possibilities of 
              developing our spiritual path are already cultivated within ourselves.<br> This is liberation through simply reflecting.</span></em></p>
