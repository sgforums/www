              <p>This is wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly Singapore is land limited.  Such a profit minded practise will only cause price to go up so high that the dead can't rest in peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taiwan has no land problem and if they want to earn money from dead, stay put in their own country and don't bring it to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The crematurium  in the news is a Taiwanese owned organisation. Taiwanese used the dead to charge high prices for funerals and it is a lucrative business there.  Don't bring it into Singapore and changed it for us.</p>

              <p>This world is going crazy, chasing after dead people's money. Have they ever thought what is the point of having so much money, can't bring with them when they are dead. ç”Ÿä¸�å¸¦æ�¥ï¼Œæ­»ä¸�å¸¦åŽ». Living is already so stressful, these people are making dying equally stressful.</p>
              <p>I think we must learn from Master Shen Yen. If I'm not wrong his ashes was thrown into the sea and he did not even have a grave. This got to show the difference between someone who is enlightened and someone who is not enlightened. ä¼—ç”ŸçœŸå�¯ç¬‘ã€‚</p>
              <p>He wrote the following poem :</p>
              <p>æ— äº‹å¿™ä¸­è€�ï¼Œæ¢¦é‡Œæœ‰è‹¦ç¬‘ï¼Œæœ¬æ�¥æ²¡æœ‰æˆ‘ï¼Œç”Ÿæ­»çš†å�¯æŠ›ã€‚</p>

              </div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some investors have recently turned to a niche form of investment — buying columbarium niches.</p>
              <p>Nirvana Memorial Garden, a columbarium at Old Choa Chu Kang Road, has been in business for two years.</p>
              <p>So far, about 300 of its customers are said to have bought niches for the purpose of investment.</p>
              <p>A
               part—time cleaner, who spent about S$20,000 on four niches, said: "I 
              bought a more expensive one and a normal one. It’s like buying flats and
               condos. My brother told me about people who bought an entire row of 
              niches and managed to sell a few units for quite a lot. Some people 
              really want the units next to their family."</p>
              <p>Currently, a niche can cost between S$2,900 and S$18,000.</p>
              <p>Jessie
               Ong, Nirvana Memorial Garden’s marketing &amp; public relations 
              manager, said there are some tell—tale signs when a customer isn’t 
              buying the niche for his own use.</p>
              <p>"From our conversation with our 
              customers and from the way they fill up the purchase order....they do 
              not indicate the intended user. Actually, the purchaser has the right to
               do the transfer, so we cannot stop them from doing so."</p>
              <p>She added that what the company sells is the right to use the niche.</p>
              <p>However, industry watchers say religious groups and clan associations frown upon this practice.</p>
              <p>William
               Quek from Union Casket said: "They can’t allow this sort of speculation
               to cause confusion or conflict within their organisations."</p>
              <p>Mr 
              Quek added that there are more than 200 churches, temples and clan 
              associations which offer niches at S$1,000 to S$10,000 per unit.</p>

              <p>Taiwan 's niche place now cost over 100k ....funeral can also cost over 100k. Many owed debts because they can't let down their dead family members.</p>

              <p>True Buddist temples like Kong Ming San (Bright Hill Temple) has niche which cost about $500 but you can't choose the location, it goes in sequence. The abbot in this temple Kwang Sheng FaShi is a very compassionate monk, I believe he will help those who approach him and who can't really afford to buy a niche. My neighbour told me Lee Bock Guan at Buddhist Lodge is also very compassionate. He charges very low price for those who approach him for not being able to pay for a place for tablet.<br>He charged my neighbour's relative very low price after knowing the family's plight.</p>

              <p>Most Buddhist Temples will give special low price for extreme cases.  But not for an average household . </p>
              <p>Then what can they do if speculation from Taiwan profit minded organisation influence the niche market and everyone starts to raise the price. Let say from $1000 for a tablet to $10,000 in the future because Nirvana Memorial Crematorium can sell their niche place from this price onwards.  So the rest follows.</p>
              <p>Any way i look at Bright Hill Temple Crematorium and i think the spirit realms must be very crowded.  Sometimes it may not be a bad idea to throw your ashes in the sea.</p>
