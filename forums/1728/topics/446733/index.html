              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-image: initial; margin-bottom: 24px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Now I like to point out, the word suffering again is overused. And it is kind misleading to lot of people. You know when I was teaching about four seals of buddhadharma, that all compounded things are impermanent, by large everybody can accept. Then, and with a good reason, they accept. They are very convinced. ?..? also if I say, when I was talking about all phenomena as emptiness, well, and also nirvana is beyond extreme, those two, they don’t even bother not accepting because most of the time, it is like, it pass this from the top, they don’t want. But you know, I have noticed, the second line, all emotions are suffering, oh my god, everyone, passionately disagrees with me. Passionately. Emotions, all emotions are ?..? And actually many people even try to correct me, maybe Rinpoche, maybe emotion is not the right word. And actually I think to the certain extend they are right. Emotion, ?..?, maybe the Tibetan word ?..? is much bigger than the word emotion. But to up keeping my stubbornness and also actually now deliberately I use the word emotion, deliberately. Emotions are suffering. ?..? Because people think: Oh yah okay negative emotions are properly of course suffering. But how about love? How about devotion? How about inspiration? How about creativity? How about ecstasy, how about all of that. Those are not suffering. This is where I think the definition of the suffering is something that we have to ponder.</p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-image: initial; margin-bottom: 24px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Because the Buddhist definition of the suffering is quite a, ???. One of the biggest element or character that really makes the suffering the suffering is time factor. The fact that it is impermanent. Anything that is impermanent, anything that is put together, they are subject to time. Anything that is subject to the time is basically synonymous to uncertainty. And if it is uncertain, does that recall something. Pain. Uncertainty is the biggest pain.</p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-image: initial; margin-bottom: 24px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Because of uncertainty, things like insurance company works. It is the uncertainty that is really, the economy is working because of the uncertainty. You can sell things that might come, might not come. For the sake of protecting yourself and stuff like that. Uncertainty is a very very big problem. And if you look at emotions, love, compassion, even the religious, even the dharma, related to dharma love, things that we try to meditate upon, love, compassion, suffering. Of course the sticky love, of course it is a suffering. Of course. No need to mention that one. You all know that. But even the love and compassion that we are try to cultivate, yes it is suffering. If it is shocking you, it is nothing. In fact when we talk about ?..?, the third suffering, the third type of suffering, in the mahayana sutras and shastras, it is clearly stated that even the tenth bhumi bodhisattvas meditative state is also a suffering. So of course, emotions are suffering.</p>

              Everything is impermanent... What is impermanent is suffering... What is suffering and impermanent cannot be taken as I or mine.
              
              Clearly seeing so, dispassion arises with regards to all feelings, sensations, thoughts and emotions. Dispassion arising, there is no delight or clinging in them. As a result, there is relinquishment and cessation.
              
              As my master ven shen kai used to say, the ultimate method (and purpose) of buddhism is to let go. He said, "A student once asked me about the ultimate method of cultivation in Buddhism. The answer is the method of letting go. Not only do we need to practise letting go now, the present, but also the past and future. We have to let go of all the distresses in our mind. Moreover, we have to let go of all notions of possession or attachments that we have. Even when we become Bodhisattvas or attain Buddhahood, the Buddha must be given up too. This is the only way of the true Buddha-Dharma."
              
              There is a quote from garab dorje, and i am reciting it from memory so it might not be accurate by the word, but it goes like this: "even the buddha, vested with the five wisdoms, is unable to find happiness in samsara."

              <p>Hi Dharmadhatu and AEN,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the very nice sharings :)</p>
              <p>I think this thread tie in quite nicely with this previous thread:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/443447">Mind's content and emotion</a></p>
              <p>I will like to share that not being attach also pertains to not being attached to whatever that arise as thoughts/ideas/thinking. In another word, it is also about not being attached to one's experiences as if it belongs to me/mine.</p>
              <p>In my experience, if this un-attachment to experiences is allowed, there will come a time when the thoughts also ceases (temporarily)... what is left is the awareness of the breathe only.</p>
              <p>However, during those time, i have also noticed (in my case) that there appears to be a subtle attachment too... this time it is to the experience of luminosity. The only thing that is 'informing' is that of prior experience of unattachment to luminosity. The experience of attachment to luminosity is as if being absorbed by it. If awake, eyes will open big and wide as if to mirror/match the luminosity.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing. Nothing definitive.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">my past experience has been that of too much effort and trying to much to recapture experience or luminosity.  I notice that this is a attachment and egoic pattern.  What AEN said is right, the final point is to let go. However, to let go paradoxically means to be right there with whatever arises without pushing it away or correcting it... to the extent of not even trying to be right there... this path of direct experience is so profound.</div>

              <p>that say letting go is one thing, while picking back up is yet another thing. just like they say letting go/forgetting is easier than the process of moving on.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">when a person ask Monk Bu Dai (representing Maitreya Bodhisattva) what Buddhadharma is all about, He put down his Cloth Sack representing to let go. The guy then ask what next after letting go. Monk Bu Dai pick up the sack again and walk off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">---</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">There is a parable about a Zen master who was approached by a pupil. The pupil asked, "I have nothing in my mind now; what shall I do next?" "Pick it up," replied the master. This is an excellent example of the negation that comes with proper understanding, as opposed to pure nihilism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">If we are bound to the concept of letting go, then we are not free. When we are not free, understanding - pañña - does not arise. But if we truly see the clinging to desire and let go of it, our act becomes a pure act, without any attendant tensions or frustrations. When the act is pure and simple, we can accomplish more with less stress. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At that point, you are "picking up" just as you are "letting go."</span></span></p>

              Muse over this
              Most question, certainly they do, but the tendency is to look for answers and ( n most likely to reaffirm what has been told to them, answers derived from someone or a book or â€¦.) They do not question beleifs, traditions, so on so forth and why? There is another type that questions, â€“ they question and NOT look for answers but re-evaluate, examine and the understandding of what is misleading or erroneous simply drops away. The third type â€“ simply being aware of â€¦. , cos the latter is a synthesis of inner and outer. one can be religious and gravitate towards being spiritual. Religion, most are merely pointers to being spiritual. Religion (all) is learning and of course, for the seeker the possibility of it as being a device to being spiritual is there. For the follower, if one is sleepwalking â€“ it is nothing but rituals after rituals. Spirituality is unlearning, not collecting, it is unlearning, a process where one unloads all the â€™â€™rubbishâ€™â€™. True or false all depends on where one is on the spectrum of learning/unleraning/relgion/spirituality
               It is only when one is being self-honest does it have meaning or will it make sense!
              
              Ps - Emotions are merely guests, they will come and go and they stay cos the master/the host has given them permanent residency. catc the drift?

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">If we are bound to the concept of letting go, then we are not free. When we are not free, understanding - pañña - does not arise. But if we truly see the clinging to desire and let go of it, our act becomes a pure act, without any attendant tensions or frustrations. When the act is pure and simple, we can accomplish more with less stress. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At that point, you are "picking up" just as you are "letting go."</span></span></p>

              <p>We have to put in efforts to cultivate the mind (labelled as attachment). And yet we have to learn how to let go (labelled as non-attachment).</p>
              <p>If we practice non-attachment, then how can we cultivate the mind?, since we are not attach to its attainment. This question was posed to us many years ago.</p>
              <p>We argued, deliberated and discuss. And came up with this answer</p>
              <p>1.  No choice, we need to have some form of attachment, "to want to cultivate the mind"</p>
              <p>2.  Once we have a strong foundation, we need to start to let go.</p>
              <p>3.  After letting go, there is bliss and non-attachment.</p>
              <p>It is like a tree with a branch overhanging a small creek. We jump up to grab the branch firmly (refer to [1] &amp; [2] above) then we swing and let go off the branch ([2] &amp; [3]) at the right moment, and land over to the other side of the creek. That's how we go to the "opposite shore".</p>

              <p>Regarding whether emotions are sufferings.</p>
              <p>Are ALL emotions sufferings? The answer is NO.</p>
              <p>Can ALL emotions be classified under Dukha? The answer is YES.</p>

              <p>“It is impossible for sublime sensations not to arise once
                                      realization has dawned clearly. Realization consists of perceiving
                                      the intrinsic awareness, which the guru signals at the initiatory
                                      ritual by exclaiming, “This is it!” so that the initiate gets the
                                      sense of identity as if he knew it himself from the beginning. As
                                      for the “sublime sensations of bliss,” it is an elevated state of
                                      great bliss, transcending the outflowing senses. “Clarity” refers
                                      to a clear awareness, which might seem like a clear light
                                      permeating the body, or like a spontaneous transformation of what
                                      hitherto has been a concept or a tinted clarity into a natural one.
                                      “Non-discrimination” refers to such a [clear and blissful] state
                                      that remains unclouded by even the slightest thought, and this
                                      state emerges without the duality of sublime sensation and mental
                                      experience.</p>
              <p>2. How the aberrations turn into deviations</p>
              <p>When a meditator seeks to revive the inner sensations of bliss,
                                      clarity, and nondiscrimination – either collectively or separately
                                      – owing to his craving for them and his dismay at their absence,
                                      this is committing a deviation from the intrinsic nature of things.
                                      The reason why these sensations often become obstacles to true
                                      realization is that generally any directed mental focus becomes an
                                      impediment to liberation. particularly the clinging to sensations
                                      of bliss, clarity, and nondiscrimination as superior levels will
                                      cause one to be reborn in a higher realm, [which is still samsara,]
                                      whereas discriminating against negative mental states as inferior
                                      will cause one to reborn in a lower realm. In short, all cravings,
                                      attachments, and directed mental focus are considered to be
                                      deviations from the noble path.</p>

              <p>"In some of his songs Milarepa says that bliss, clarity, and nonthought are like the dregs of the view and should be thrown away.  In other songs, he says that bliss, clarity, and nonthought are like the summit of the view. How are these seemingly contradictory statements reconciled?  In the first case, bliss, clarity and nonthought are like the cozy mood or atmosphere of shamatha and so nothing more than a product of grasping mind.  So of course such a state should be dispensed with and not clung to.  However, the natural state, the essence itself is also blissful, clear and free of thought, yet these qualities cannot be dispensed with because they are intrinsic to the natural state.  The difference is that at the stage One-pointedness, one still clings to these temporary experiences; whereas in the next stage of Simplicity, they are recognised to be characteristics of the natural state which is not only blissful, clear and free of thought, but also free of all clinging and grasping."</p>
