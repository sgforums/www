Otherwise 'white lies' may just be an excuse and you will still end up having bad karma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thus i heard a simile, there was this hunter who was chasing this deer. the deer ran passed a monk/master and went toward the <span style="font-style: italic;">west</span>. the hunter later come to ask the master regarding where the deer had gone. the master told the hunter that it had went toward the <strong>east</strong>. of such case, the master though commit false speech karma, but the karma weight of saving Both the deer from dying and saving the hunter from commiting killing had overide his false speech karma.<br><br>another story: Mencius was told to keep an honorable secret of a particular country's plan to attack Wei country. However, Mencius went to inform the Wei country, thinking that He rather be dishonored than cause a war to break between 2 countries and suffering of many.<br><br>so wisdom is still very important.<br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">here's Master Jing Jie's excellent explaination on the Vinaya:<br><br>how can the body of precept be destroy?<br>it's when one commit the 4 evil deeds - kill, steal, sexual misconduct and lying. and/or, one no longer wish to attain the unsurpassed bodhi, and live a un-righteous livelihood.<br><br>even if you break the percepts, we can only say you have a little mistakes. A inperfect/flawed bodhisattva. There's room for improvement. The body of precept/aspiration is not broken.<br><br>don't be afriad that after you take the precepts that you will break the precepts. Past masters would prefer one to uphold percept even if you break it and enter evil realms than one who don't uphold precepts and attain heavenly rebirth. Why? because even the former enter the evil realms, with the strength of the precepts, one can spring out easily, compare to the latter who do not. Chances for the latter to commit evil is inevitable.<br><br>Buddha not afraid you have affliction or you commit evil. Buddha most afraid you don't plant good seeds. As light can destroy darkness. Why is there no darkness, as there's light. Or to turn around is the safe shore. Buddha only afraid you don't turn around. As long as you can turn over a new leaf, there's always hope. Why do people have afflictions, because their good merits are not enough. </span><br><br>ps: if you study precept/lui/Vinaya carefully, it actually got 4 factors (which i need to check what are they call), but of which there's one which state that if it's a <strong>suitable time</strong> to break the precept and you do not break it, you are truly breaking the precept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 years ago's archive:<br>i watched <span style="font-style: italic;">a korean movie called "Little Monk". The little monk have been living in the monastery from very young, and the Abbot have to enforce the 5 precepts on the little monk. Little monk recite the sutras everyday. And since he still do not understand what's the use of keeping precepts and do not know the real meaning (ie unenlighten yet)... few occasions, the little monk broke the precepts such as hunting rabbits and lying to the Abbot. The Abbot keep scoding and even punish the little monk, but he still don't get it. Until the end of the story (bad ending), the little monk cannot tolerate the attitude of the Abbot and left the monastrey to seek for his mother, which he long for, when seeing other kids have a mother.<br><br>Now, it's the little monk wrong, due to his ignorance/unenlightened?<br><br>we even as adults praxis are like the little monk, even though we recite /study the sutras and all, yet sometimes we still commit wrong, ...why? because we still are not enlightened. If we are enlightened, we would not be doing it.<br><br>In other word , are an unenlightened wrong, because they are unenlighten? Sadly, no.<br>From this i no longer see that there's wrong in others even if they commit wrong, as they are not enlighten as yet, just like the little monk in the story.<br><br>Was touch by this realisation.</span><br><br>ps: now that's newer realisation regarding "If we are enlightened, we would not be doing it." AS...<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">If one's enlightened, even doing wrong is doing right.</span> "<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">..but have to be careful when saying to unenlightened ppl though.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>sinweiy,<br>Your statement sounds hypocritical to me. Mistakes committed by others can be wrong while mistakes committed by you can be right.</blockquote>I don't think he mean this. Perhaps what he meant was that with a good intention, there can be no such thing as a 'bad action'. But on the other hand, with a bad intention (selfish or greedy intention), even saving the lives of a million lives would lead you nowhere ultimately.<br><br>But then, we do not have enough wisdom or capacity (as of now) to truely know if our intention is good or bad. Even though in such cases, I will still prefer to break a precept or commit a 'wrong action' for a greater good, we can never really know if we're acting under delusion.</div>
