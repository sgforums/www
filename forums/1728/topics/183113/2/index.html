              <h2>Lecture No. 1 (September 23, 1951)</h2>
              <p>I consider it a great privilege to be in your midst today and to have this 
                  opportunity of addressing you on the subject of <em>What Buddhism Is</em>. At 
                  the outset, I must be very frank with you. I have not been to a university 
                  and I have no knowledge of science except as a man in the street. Nor am I 
                  a scholar in the theory of Buddhism with any knowledge of Pali, the language 
                  in which the Tipitakas (literally, the "Three Baskets" of Buddha-Dhamma) 
                  are maintained. I may say, however, that I have read in Burmese to some extent 
                  the treatises on Buddhism by well-known and learned Buddhist monks. As my 
                  approach to Buddhism is more by practical than by theoretical means, I hope 
                  to be able to give you something of Buddhism which is not easily available 
                  elsewhere. I must admit, however, that for the time being I am just a student 
                  of practical Buddhism, an experimentalist trying to learn through Buddhism 
                  the truth of the nature of forces. As this has to be done as a householder 
                  and within a limited time available in between the multifarious duties of 
                  a responsible officer of Government, the progress is rather slow and I do 
                  not claim for a moment that what I am going to say is absolutely correct. 
                  I may be right or wrong. But when I say a thing, I assure you that it is with 
                  a sincerity of purpose, with the best of intentions and with conviction.</p>
              <p><br> The Lord Buddha said in the <em>Kalama Sutta:</em> [1]</p>
              <dl>
              <p>"Do not believe in what you have heard; do not believe in tradi tions 
                    because they have been handed down for many generations; do not believe 
                    in anything because it is rumoured and spoken by many; do not believe merely 
                    because a written statement of some old sage is produced; do not believe 
                    in conjectures; do not be lieve in that as truth to which you have become 
                    attached from habit; do not believe merely the authority of your teachers 
                    and elders. After observation and analysis, when it agrees with reason and 
                    is conducive to the good and gain of one and all, then accept it and live 
                    up to it."</p>
              </dl>
              <p>Pray do not, therefore, believe me when I come to the philosophical issues 
                  until and unless you are convinced of what I say, either as a sequel to proper 
                  reasoning or by means of a practical approach.</p>
              <dl>
              <ul>
              <li>To abstain from evil, </li>
              <li> To do good, </li>
              <li> To purify the mind, </li>
              <li> These are the teachings of all the Buddhas. </li>
              </ul>
              </dl>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Dhammapada, verse 14</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>This extract taken from the<em> Dhammapada</em> gives in brief the essence 
                  of Buddhism. It sounds simple, but is so difficult to practise. One cannot 
                  be a true Buddhist unless one puts the doctrine of the Buddha into practice. 
                  The Buddha said: [2]</p>
              <dl>
              <p>"You, to whom the truths I have perceived have been made known by 
                    me, make them truly your own, practise them, meditate upon them, spread 
                    them abroad: in order that the pure religion may last long and be perpetuated 
                    for the good and the gain and the well-being of gods and men."</p>
              </dl>
              <p>Before I take up the teachings of the Buddha, which form the basic foundation 
                  of Buddhism, I propose to acquaint you, first of all, with the life story 
                  of Gotama Buddha. For this purpose, I feel it is my duty to give you a background 
                  of certain Buddhist concepts which may be foreign to most of you. I propose, 
                  therefore, to give you a short descriptive explanation of such concepts in 
                  Buddhism as the Universe, the World-system, the planes of existence, etc. 
                  These will, no doubt, give you some food for thought. I would, however, appeal 
                  to you to give a patient hearing and to pass over these matters for the time 
                  being, i.e., until we come to the question time for discussion.</p>
              <h3>The Universe</h3>
              <p>The Buddhist concept of the Universe may be summed up as follows: There is 
                  the<em> Okasa Loka</em> (the Universe of Space) which accommodates<em> Nama</em> and <em>Rupa </em> (Mind and Matter). In this mundane world, it is<em> Nama</em> and <em>Rupa </em>(Mind and Matter) which predominate under the influence of 
                  the law of Cause and Effect. Next is the <em>Sankhara Loka</em> (the Universe 
                  of Mental Forces), creative or created. This is a mental plane arising out 
                  of the creative energies of Mind through the medium of bodily actions, words 
                  and thoughts. The third and last is the <em>Satta Loka</em> (the Universe of 
                  Sentient Beings) visible or invisible, beings that are the products of these 
                  mental forces; we may rather call these three the "Three-in-One" 
                  universe, because each is inseparable from the others. They are, so to speak, 
                  interwoven and interpenetrating.</p>
              <p>What will interest you most are the <em>Cakkavalas </em>or World-systems, 
                  each with its thirty-one planes of existence. Each World-system corresponds 
                  to the Human World with its solar system and other planes of existence. There 
                  are millions and millions of such World-systems; they are simply innumerable. 
                  The ten thousand World-systems closest to us are within the <em>Jati-khetta</em> (or the Field of Origin) of a Buddha. In fact, when the renowned Sutta (or 
                  discourse), the <em>Maha-Samaya</em> (meaning the "Great Occasion") 
                  was preached by the Buddha in the <em>Mahavana </em>(forest) near the town of 
                  <em>Kapilavatthu, </em>not only the <em>Brahmas </em>and <em>Devas </em>of our World-system 
                  but of all the ten thousand World-systems were present to listen to the teachings 
                  of the Buddha.[3]</p>
              <p>The Lord Buddha can also send his thought-waves charged with boundless love 
                  and compassion to the sentient beings of a billion such World-systems within 
                  the <em>Ana-khetta</em> (the Field of Influence). The remainder of the World- 
                  systems are in the <em>Visaya-khetta</em> (infinite space), beyond the reach 
                  of the Buddha's effective thought waves. You can very well imagine from these 
                  concepts of Buddhism the size of the Universe as a whole. The material insignificance 
                  of our World in the <em>Okasa </em>Loka (the Universe of Space) is simply terrifying. 
                  The Human World, as a whole, must be just a speck in space.</p>
              <p>Now I will give you an idea of the thirty-one planes of existence in our 
                  World-system, which, of course, is the same as in any of the other World-systems. 
                  Broadly speaking, they are:</p>

              <p>These planes of existence are pure or impure, cool or hot, luminous or dark, 
                  light or heavy, pleasant or wretched -- according to the character of the 
                  mental forces generated by the Mind through the volition <em>(Cetana) </em> associated with a series of actions, words and thoughts. For example, take 
                  the case of a religious man who suffuses the whole universe of beings with 
                  boundless love and compassion. He must be generating such mental forces as 
                  are pure, cooling, luminous, light and pleasant, forces which normally settle 
                  down in the <em>Brahma </em>Worlds. Let us now take the reverse case of a man 
                  who is dissatisfied or angry. As the saying goes, "The face reflects 
                  the mind." The impurity, heat, darkness, heaviness and wretchedness of 
                  his mind are immediately reflected in the person -- visible even to the naked 
                  eye. This is due, I may say, to the generation of the evil mental forces of 
                  <em>Dosa </em> (anger) which go down to the lower worlds of existence. This 
                  is also the case for the mental forces arising out of <em>Lobha </em>(greed) 
                  or <em>Moha </em>(delusion). In the case of meritorious deeds such as devotion, 
                  morality and charity, which have at their base attachment to future well-being, 
                  the mental forces generated are such as will normally be located in the sensuous 
                  planes of <em>Devas </em>(celestial beings) and of Mankind. These, ladies and 
                  gentlemen, are some of the concepts in Buddhism relevant to the life story 
                  of Gotama Buddha.</p>
              <h3>The Preparation to Become a Buddha [4]</h3>
              <p>Gotama Buddha is the fourth of the five Buddhas to rise in the World- cycle 
                  which is known as a <em>Bhadda Kappa </em>(an auspicious world-cycle). His predecessors 
                  were the Buddhas <em>Kakusanda, Konagamana</em> and <em>Kassapa. </em>There were 
                  also innumerable Buddhas who arose in earlier world-cycles and who preached 
                  the very same <em>Dhamma </em>that gives deliverance from suffering and death 
                  to all matured beings. Buddhas are all compassionate, glorious and enlightened. 
                  A hermit by the name of <em>Sumedha </em>was inspired by Buddha <em>Dipankara </em>-- so much so, that he took the vow to make all the necessary preparations 
                  to become a Buddha in the course of time. Buddha <em>Dipankara </em>gave him 
                  his blessings and prophesied that he would become a Buddha by the name of 
                  <em>Gotama </em> after a lapse of four incalculable periods [5] of world-cycles 
                  plus one hundred thousand world-cycles <em>(Kappas). </em>From then onwards, 
                  existence after existence, the <em>Bodhisatta </em>(future Buddha) conserved 
                  mental energies of the highest order through the practice of the ten <em>Paramitas </em> (or <em>Paramis, </em>Virtues leading toward Perfection):</p>
              <dl><ol type="i">
              <li> <em> - Dana Parami </em> - Virtue in Alms-giving (or generosity) </li>
              <li> <em> - Sila Parami </em> - Morality </li>
              <li> <em> - Nekkhamma Parami </em> - Renunciation </li>
              <li> <em> - Panna Parami </em> - Wisdom </li>
              <li> <em> - Viriya Parami</em> - Great effort (or perseverance) </li>
              <li> <em> - Khanti Parami</em> - Forbearance (or patience) </li>
              <li> <em> - Sacca Parami </em> - Truthfulness </li>
              <li> <em> - Aditthana Parami</em> - Determination </li>
              <li> <em> - Metta Parami </em> - All-embracing Love </li>
              <li> <em> - Upekkha Parami</em> - Equanimity</li>
              </ol></dl>
              <p>It is, therefore, a most arduous task to become a Buddha. Utmost strength 
                  of will-power is necessary even to think of it. The <em>Bodhisatta's </em> preparatory 
                  period came to an end with the life of King <em>Vessantara </em>[6] who excelled 
                  any living being in Alms-giving. He gave away his kingdom, his wife and his 
                  children and all his worldly possessions, for the consummation of his solemn 
                  vow taken before the Buddha <em>Dipankara. </em>The next existence was in the 
                  <em>Tusita </em>(celestial plane) as the glorious<em> Deva Setaketu</em>, until 
                  he got his release from that plane of existence and took conception in the 
                  womb of <em>Maya Devi</em>, the queen of King <em>Suddhodana </em>of <em>Kapilavatthu, </em>a place near modern Nepal. When time was drawing near for her confinement, 
                  the queen expressed her desire to go to the place of her own parents for the 
                  event. King <em>Suddhodana </em>accordingly sent her there with a befitting 
                  retinue and guards. On the way, a halt was made at the <em>Lumbini </em>Grove. 
                  She descended from her palanquin and enjoyed the cool breeze and fragrance 
                  of Sal flowers. While holding out her right hand to a branch of a nearby Sal 
                  tree for a flower, all of a sudden and unexpectedly, she gave birth to a son 
                  who was to become the All-Enlightened Buddha. Simultaneously, the natural 
                  order of things in the cosmos was revolutionized in many respects and thirty-two 
                  wonderful phenomena were vivified. All material worlds were shaken from their 
                  foundation up. There were unusual illuminations in the solar system. All the 
                  beings of the material planes could see each other. The deaf and dumb were 
                  cured. Celestial music was heard everywhere, and so on.</p>
              <p>At that moment, <em>Kaladevala, </em>the hermit teacher of King <em>Suddhodana, </em>was discoursing with the celestial beings of the <em>Tavatimsa Deva</em> world. He was a hermit of fame who had mastered the eight attainments <em>(Samapattis) </em>which gave him super-normal powers. Learning of the birth of a son to 
                  the king in the midst of the rejoicing in all the <em>Rupa </em>and <em>Kama </em>worlds, he hurried back to the palace and desired the baby to be brought 
                  before him for his blessings. As the king was about to place the baby before 
                  his teacher for the occasion, a marvel took place. The baby rose into the 
                  air and rested his tiny feet on the head of <em>Kaladevala </em>who at once 
                  understood that the baby was no other than the Embryonic Buddha. He smiled 
                  at this knowledge, but cried almost immediately thereafter, because he foresaw 
                  that he would not live to hear his teachings, and that after his death, he 
                  would be in the<em> Arupa Brahma Loka</em> (the Immaterial Planes of the <em>Brahmas) </em>whence he would have no relationship with any of the material planes. 
                  He regretted bitterly that he would miss the Buddha and his teachings.</p>
              <p>On the fifth day, the child was named <em>Siddhattha </em>in the presence 
                  of renowned astrologer-palmists who agreed that the child had all the characteristics 
                  of a Buddha-to-be. His mother, the queen, however, died a week after her confinement, 
                  and the child was taken care of by his maternal aunt, <em>Pajapati-Gotami.</em> <em>Siddhattha </em>spent his early years in ease, luxury and culture. He was 
                  acclaimed to be a prodigy in both intellect and strength. The king spared 
                  no pains to make the course of his life smooth. Three separate palaces were 
                  built to suit the three seasons (hot, cold, and rainy) with all the necessities 
                  that would make the prince sink in sensuality. That was because the king, 
                  out of paternal affection, desired his son to remain in worldly life as a 
                  king rather than become an Enlightened Buddha. King <em>Suddhodana </em>was 
                  ever watchful that his son should be in an environment that would give him 
                  no chance for higher philosophical ideas. In order to make sure that the thoughts 
                  of the prince would never turn in this direction, he ordered that nobody serving 
                  him or in his association was ever to speak a single word about such things 
                  as old age, sickness or death. They were to act as if there were no unpleasant 
                  things in this world. Servants and attendants who showed the least sign of 
                  growing old, weak or sickly were replaced. On the other hand, there was dancing, 
                  music and enjoyable parties right through, to keep him under a complete shade 
                  of sensuality.</p>
              <h3>The Great Renunciation</h3>
              <p>As days, months and years passed, however, the monotony of the sensual surroundings 
                  gradually lost their hold over the mind of Prince <em>Siddhatta. </em> The mental 
                  energies of virtue conserved in all his earlier innumerable lives for the 
                  great goal of Buddhahood were automatically aroused. At times, when the world 
                  of sensuality lost control over his mind, his inner self worked its way up 
                  and raised his mind to a state of purity and tranquillity with the strength 
                  of <em>Samadhi </em>(concentration) such as had raised his baby form into space 
                  and onto the head of <em>Kaladevala. </em>The war of nerves began. An escape 
                  from sensuality and passion was his first consideration. He wanted to know 
                  what existed outside the walls of the palace, for he had not gone out even 
                  once. He wished to see Nature as it is and not as man has made it. Accordingly, 
                  he decided to see the Royal Park, outside the palace walls. On the way to 
                  the park, in spite of the precautions taken by the king to get the roads clear 
                  of unpleasant sights, he saw an old man bent with age on the very first visit. 
                  Next he saw a sick person in the agony of a fatal malady. Thereafter he met 
                  with a human corpse. On the last trip he came across a monk. All these predisposed 
                  his mind to serious thinking. His mental attitude was changed. His mind became 
                  clear of impurities and tuned up with the forces of his own virtues conserved 
                  in the <em>Sankhara Loka</em> (the plane of mental forces). By then his mind 
                  had become freed from hindrances, was tranquil, pure and strong. It all happened 
                  on the night when a son was born to his wife, a new fetter to bind him down. 
                  He was, however, immune to anything which would tend to upset the equilibrium 
                  of his mind. The virtues of determination worked their way for a strong resolve 
                  and he made up his mind to seek the way of escape from birth, old age, suffering 
                  and death. It was midnight when the solemn determination was made. He asked 
                  his attendant <em>Channa </em>to keep his stallion <em>Khanthaka </em>ready. After 
                  a parting look at his wife and the newly born babe, Prince <em>Siddhattha </em>broke 
                  away from all the ties of family and of the world and made the Great Renunciation. 
                  He rode across the town to the river Anoma, which he crossed, never to return 
                  until his mission had been achieved.</p>
              <h3>The Search for Truth</h3>
              <p>After this Great Renunciation, Prince <em>Siddhattha </em>went around in search 
                  of possible teachers in the garb of a wandering ascetic with a begging bowl 
                  in his hand. He placed himself under the spiritual guidance of two renowned 
                  <em>Brahman </em>teachers, <em>Alara </em>and <em>Uddaka. Alara </em>laid stress 
                  on the belief in the <em>atman </em>(soul) and taught that the soul attained 
                  perfect release when freed from material limitations. This did not satisfy 
                  the prince. He next went to <em>Uddaka </em>who emphasized too much the effect 
                  of <em>Kamma </em>(volitional actions) and the transmigration of the soul. Both 
                  could not get out of the conception of "soul" and the prince ascetic 
                  felt that there was something else to learn. He, therefore, left both of them 
                  to work out the way to emancipation on his own. By that time, of course, he 
                  had learned the eight attainments <em>(Samapattis) </em>and had become an adept 
                  in the exercise of all the supernormal powers including the ability to read 
                  events of many world- cycles to come and a similar period of the past. These 
                  were all in the mundane field and they did not much concern the prince ascetic, 
                  whose ambition had been an escape from this mundane field of birth, suffering 
                  and death.</p>
              <p>He was joined later by five ascetics, one of whom, <em>Kondanna </em>by name, 
                  was the astrologer-palmist who definitely foretold on the fifth day after 
                  his birth that he would surely become a Buddha. These ascetics served him 
                  well throughout the six years during which he was engaged in fastings and 
                  meditation, subjecting himself to various forms of rigorous austerities and 
                  discipline till he was reduced to almost a skeleton. In fact, one day, he 
                  fell down in a swoon through exhaustion. When he survived this condition, 
                  he changed his method, followed a middle course and found the way to his Enlightenment 
                  was clearer.</p>
              <h3>The Attainment of Buddhahood</h3>
              <p>It was on the eve of the full-moon day of <em>Vesakha[7] </em>just 2540 years 
                  ago [i.e., from 1951] that Prince <em>Siddhattha, </em>a wandering ascetic, 
                  sat cross- legged beneath a Bodhi tree on the bank of the river <em>Neranjara </em>in the Forest of <em>Uruvela </em>(near present day Buddhagaya) -- with 
                  the strongest of determinations -- not to rise from that posture on any account 
                  until he gained the Truth and Enlightenment, Buddhahood -- even if the attempt 
                  might mean the loss of his very life.</p>
              <p>The great event was approaching. The prince ascetic mustered up all his 
                  strength of mind to secure that one-pointedness of mind which is so essential 
                  for the discovery of Truth. The balancing of the mind, the prince found on 
                  this occasion, was not so easy as hitherto. There was not only the combination 
                  of the mental forces of the Lower Planes with those of the Higher Planes all 
                  around him, but also interferences strong enough to upset, off and on, the 
                  equilibrium of his mind. The resistance of the impenetrable masses of forces 
                  against the radiation of the light normally secured by him was unusual, perhaps 
                  because it was a final bid for Buddhahood, and <em>Mara, </em> the supreme controller 
                  of evil forces, was behind the scenes. The prince, however, worked his way 
                  through slowly but surely, backed up by the mental forces of virtues which 
                  must inevitably come back to him at the right moment. He made a vow and called 
                  upon all the <em>Brahmas </em>and <em>Devas </em>who had witnessed the fulfilment 
                  of his ten great Perfections to join hands with him in the struggle for supremacy. 
                  This done, the association with the transcendingly pure mental forces of the 
                  <em>Brahmas </em>and <em>Devas </em>had salutary effect. The thick masses of forces, 
                  which seemed impenetrable for a time, broke away and with steady improvement 
                  in the control over the mind, they were wiped out once and for all. All the 
                  hindrances having been overcome, the prince was able to raise his power of 
                  concentration and put the mind to a state of complete purity, tranquillity 
                  and equanimity. Gradually, the consciousness of true insight possessed him. 
                  The solution to the vital problems which confronted him made its appearance 
                  in his consciousness as an inspiration. By introspective meditation on the 
                  realities of nature in his own self, it came vividly to him that there is 
                  no substantiality, as there seems to be, in the human body and that it is 
                  nothing but the sum total of innumerable millions of <em>Kalapas, </em>each 
                  about the size of 1/46,656th part of a particle of dust raised by the wheel 
                  of a chariot in summer. On further investigation, he realized that this <em>Kalapa </em>also is matter in constant change or flux. So also with the mind, which 
                  is a representation of the mental forces (creative) going out and the mental 
                  forces (created) coming into the system of an individual continually and throughout 
                  eternity.</p>
              <p>The Buddha then proclaimed that the Eye of Wisdom <em>(Panna-cakkhu)</em> arose when he overcame all false perception of substantiality within his own 
                  self. He saw by means of the lens of <em>Samadhi </em>(concentration) the <em>Kalapas </em>on which he next applied the law of <em>Anicca </em>(impermanence) and reduced 
                  them to nonentity or behaviour, doing away with what we, in Buddhism, call 
                  <em>Pannatti </em> (concept) and coming to a state of <em>Paramattha, </em>understanding 
                  the nature of forces or, in other words,<strong> Ultimate reality.</strong></p>
              <p>Accordingly, he came to a realization of the perpetual change of mind and 
                  matter in himself <em>(Anicca) </em>and as a sequel thereto the Truth of Suffering 
                  <em>(Dukkha). </em>It was then that the ego-centralism in him broke down into 
                  the void and he got over to a stage beyond Suffering <em>(Dukkha Nirodha)</em> with no more traces of <em>Atta, </em>or attachment to self, left behind. Mind-and- 
                  matter were to him but empty phenomena which roll on forever, within the range 
                  of the Law of Cause and Effect and the Law of Dependent Origination. The Truth 
                  was realized. The inherent qualities of an Embryonic Buddha then developed 
                  and complete Enlightenment came to him by the dawn of <em>Vesakha. </em> Verily, 
                  Prince <em>Siddhattha </em>attained <em>Samma-Sambodhi</em> (Supreme Enlightenment) 
                  and became the Buddha, the Awakened One, the Enlightened One -- the All- Knowing 
                  One. He was awake in a way compared with which all others were asleep and 
                  dreaming. He was enlightened in a way compared with which all other men were 
                  stumbling and groping in the dark. He knew with a knowledge compared with 
                  which all that other men knew was but a kind of ignorance.</p>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have taken so much of your time today. I thank you 
                  all for your patient listening. I must also thank the clergy of the church 
                  for their kind permission given to me for this address.</p>

              <h2>Lecture No. 2 (September 30, 1951)</h2>
              <p>Last Sunday I gave you a brief outline -- a very brief one too -- of the life of our
              Lord Buddha, up to the moment of his attainment of Buddhahood. I am going to tell you
              today what his teachings are. Buddhist teachings are preserved in what we call the <em>Tipitakas, </em>consisting of the <em>Suttas </em>(Discourses), the <em>Vinaya </em>(the rules of
              discipline for <em>Sanghas, </em>or monks and nuns) and the <em>Abhidhamma </em>(the
              philosophical Teachings). We have the <em>Tipitakas </em>in <em>Pali </em>in several volumes
              which will require an intelligent Pali scholar some months just to read through. I
              propose, therefore, to confine myself today only to essentials, that is to say, the
              fundamental Truths of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Before Lord Buddha took upon himself the task of spreading his <em>Dhamma </em>(Teachings),
              he remained in silent meditation for a continuous period of 49 days, that is, seven days
              under the Bodhi tree and seven days each in six other spots nearby, enjoying at times the
              peace of Supreme <em>Nibbana </em>and at others going deeper in investigation into the most
              delicate problems of <em>Paramattha-Dhamma</em> (Ultimate Realities). On his complete
              mastery of the law of <em>Patthana </em>(the Law of Relations), in which the infinite modes
              of relations between thought moments are also dealt with, there emerged from his body
              brilliant rays of six colours, which eventually settled down as a halo of six-coloured
              rays around his head. He passed through this seven-times-seven- days' meditation without
              food. It is beyond us all to be without food for 49 days. The fact remains that he was
              throughout the period on a mental plane as distinct from a physical plane, in which
              mankind normally is. It is not material food that maintains the fine-material existence
              and life-continuum of beings in the Fine-material Worlds of the Brahmas, but the <em>Jhanic
              Piti</em>, which in itself is a nutriment. So also was the case with the Buddha, whose
              existence during this long period was on a mental rather than physical plane. Our
              experiments in this line of research have firmly convinced us that for a man of such high
              intellectual and mental development as the Buddha, this is a possibility.</p>
              <p>It was the dawn of the 50th day of his Buddhahood when he arose from this long spell
              of meditation. Not that he was tired or exhausted, but, as he was no longer in the mental
              plane, he felt a longing for food. At that time, two traders of a foreign land were
              travelling in several carts loaded with merchandise through the Uruvela forest. A <em>Deva </em>of
              the forest who had been their relative in one of their previous existences advised them to
              take the opportunity of paying homage to the All-Enlightened Buddha who had just arisen
              from his meditation. They accordingly went to the place where the Buddha was seated,
              illumined by the halo of six-coloured rays. They could not resist their feelings. They lay
              prostrate in worship and adoration before the Buddha and later offered preserved rice
              cakes with honey for the first meal of the Buddha. They were accepted as his lay
              disciples. On their request that they might be given some tokens for their worship, the
              Buddha presented them with eight strands of hair from his head. You will be surprised to
              know that these two traders were <em>Tapassu </em>and <em>Bhallika </em>from<em> Ukkala</em>[8],
              which today is known as Rangoon, where you are at this moment. And the renowned Shwedagon,
              which you all probably have visited, is the Pagoda in which were enshrined all the eight
              hair-relics of the Buddha under the personal direction of the then ruler of <em>Ukkala, </em>2540
              years ago. It has been preserved and renovated till now by successive Buddhist kings and
              devout laymen. Unfortunately, however, these two traders of <em>Ukkala, </em>who had the
              privilege of becoming the first lay disciples of the Buddha, were disciples only by faith,
              without a taste of the <em>Buddha-Dhamma </em>in actual practice, which alone would give
              them deliverance from suffering and death. Faith is, no doubt, a preliminary requisite,
              but it is the practice of the Teachings which really counts. The Buddha therefore said,
              "The Path must be trod by each individual; Buddhas do but point the Way." [9]</p>
              <h3>The Teachings of the Buddha</h3>
              <p>Buddhism is not a religion according to the dictionary meaning[10] of the word
              religion because it has no centre in god, as is the case in all other religions. Strictly
              speaking, Buddhism is a system of philosophy co- ordinated with a code of morality,
              physical and mental. The goal in view is the extinction of suffering and death.</p>
              <p>The Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha in his first sermon, known as the <em>Dhamma-cakka-pavattana
              Sutta</em> (the Discourse to set in motion the Wheel of <em>Dhamma) </em>form the basis on
              which is founded this system of philosophy. In fact, the first three of the Four Noble
              Truths expound the philosophy of the Buddha, while the fourth (the Eightfold Noble Path
              which is a code of morality-cum-philosophy) serves as a means to the end. This first
              sermon was given to the five ascetics led by <em>Kondanna, </em>who were his early
              companions in search of the Truth. <em>Kondanna </em>was the first disciple of the Buddha in
              practice to become an <em>Arahat </em>(a Noble One who has gone beyond the limitations of
              all fetters).</p>
              <p>Now we come to the Four Noble Truths. They are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> <em>- Dukkha Sacca </em>- The Truth of Suffering </li>
              <li> <em>- Samudaya Sacca</em> - The Truth of the Origin of Suffering </li>
              <li> <em>- Nirodha Sacca</em> - The Truth of the Extinction of Suffering </li>
              <li> <em>- Magga Sacca </em>- The Truth of the Path leading to the Extinction of
                    Suffering</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To come to a complete understanding of the fundamental concepts in the philosophy of
              the Buddha, emphasis is laid on the need for the realisation of the Truth of Suffering. To
              bring home this point, Lord Buddha tackled the problem from two different angles.</p>
              <p><strong>Firstly, </strong>by a process of reasoning. He made his disciples feel that life is a
              struggle, life is suffering; birth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is
              suffering; death is suffering. The influence of sensuality is, however, so strong in
              mankind that people are normally apt to forget this themselves, to forget the price they
              have to pay. Just think for a moment how life exists in the pre-natal period; how from the
              moment of birth the child has to struggle for existence; what preparations he has to make
              to face life; how, as a man, he has to struggle till he breathes his last. You can very
              well imagine what life is. Life is indeed suffering. The more one is attached to self, the
              greater is the suffering. In fact, the pains and sufferings a man has to undergo are
              suppressed in favour of momentary sensual pleasures which are but occasional spotlights in
              the darkness. Were it not for the <em>Moha </em>(delusion) which keeps him away from the
              Truth, he would surely have worked out his way to emancipation from the rounds of life,
              suffering and death.</p>
              <p><strong>Secondly, </strong>the Buddha made it known to his disciples that the human body is
              composed of <em>Kalapas </em>(subatomic units), each dying out simultaneously as it comes
              into being. Each <em>Kalapa </em>is a mass formed of the following nature elements:</p>
              <ol type="i">
              <li> <em>- Pathavi </em>- Extension (literally, earth) </li>
              <li> <em>- Apo </em>- Cohesion (lit., water) </li>
              <li> <em>- Tejo </em>- Radiation (lit., heat and cold) </li>
              <li> <em>- Vayo </em>- Motion (lit., air) </li>
              <li> <em>- Vanna </em>- Colour </li>
              <li> <em>- Gandha </em>- Smell </li>
              <li> <em>- Rasa </em>- Taste </li>
              <li> <em>- Oja </em>- Nutritive essence</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The first four are called <em>Maha-Bhutas</em>, i.e., essential material qualities which
              are predominant in a <em>Kalapa. </em>The other four are merely subsidiaries which are
              dependent upon and born out of the former. A <em>Kalapa </em> is the minutest particle
              noticeable in the physical plane. It is only when the eight nature elements (which have
              merely the characteristic of behaviour) are together that the entity of a <em>Kalapa </em>is
              formed. In other words, the coexistence of these eight nature elements of behaviour makes
              a mass which, in Buddhism, is known as a <em>Kalapa. </em>These <em>Kalapas, </em>according to
              the Buddha, are in a state of perpetual change or flux. They are nothing but a stream of
              energies, just like the light of a candle or an electric bulb. The body, as we call it, is
              not an entity as it seems to be, but a continuum of matter with the coexisting life-force.</p>
              <p>To a casual observer, a piece of iron is motionless. The scientist knows that it is
              composed of electrons, etc., all in a state of perpetual change or flux. If it is so with
              a piece of iron, what will be the case for a living organism, say a human being? The
              changes that are taking place inside the human body must be more violent. Does man feel
              the rocking vibrations within himself? Does the scientist who knows that all is in a state
              of change or flux ever feel that his own body is but energy and vibration? What will be
              the repercussion on the mental attitude of the man who introspectively sees that his own
              body is mere energy and vibration? To quench thirst one may just easily drink a glass of
              water from a village well. Supposing his eyes are as powerful as microscopes, he would
              surely hesitate to drink the very same water in which he must see the magnified microbes.
              So also, when one comes to a realization of the perpetual change within oneself (i.e., <em>Anicca </em>or Impermanence), one must necessarily come to the understanding as a sequel thereto
              of the Truth of Suffering as the consequence of the sharp sense of feeling of the
              radiation, vibration and friction of the subatomic units within. Indeed, life is
              suffering, both within and without, to all appearances and in ultimate reality.</p>
              <p>When I say, Life is suffering, as the Buddha taught, please be so good as not to run
              away with the idea that, if that is so, life is miserable, life is not worth living, and
              that the Buddhist concept of suffering is a terrible concept which will give you no chance
              of a reasonably happy life. What is happiness? For all that science has achieved in the
              field of materialism, are the peoples of the world happy? They may find sensual pleasure
              off and on, but in their heart of hearts they are not happy concerning what has happened,
              what is happening and what may happen next. Why? This is because, while man has mastery
              over matter, he is still lacking in mastery over his mind.</p>
              <p>Pleasure born of sensuality is nothing compared with the <em>Piti </em>(or rapture) born
              of the inner peace of mind which can be secured through a process of Buddhist meditation.
              Sense pleasures are preceded and followed by troubles and pains, as in the case of a
              rustic who finds pleasure in cautiously scratching the itches over his body, whereas <em>Piti </em>is free from such troubles and pains either before or after. It will be difficult for
              you, looking from a sensuous field, to appreciate what that <em>Piti </em>is like. But I
              know you can enjoy it and have a taste of it for comparative evaluation. There is
              therefore nothing to the supposition that Buddhism teaches something that will make you
              feel miserable with the nightmare of suffering. But please take it from me that it will
              give you an escape from the normal conditions of life, a lotus as it were in a pond of
              crystal water immune from its fiery surroundings. It will give you that Peace Within which
              will satisfy you that you are getting not only beyond the day-to-day troubles of life, but
              slowly and surely beyond the limitation of life, suffering and death.</p>
              <p>What then is the Origin of Suffering? The origin of it, the Buddha said, is Tanha or
              Craving. Once the seed of desire is sown, it grows into greed and multiplies into craving
              or lust, either for power or for material gains. The man in whom this seed is sown becomes
              a slave to these cravings and he is automatically driven to strenuous labours of mind and
              body to keep pace with them till the end comes. The final result must surely be the
              accumulation of the evil mental forces generated by his own actions, words and thoughts
              which are motivated by <em>Lobha </em>(desire) and <em>Dosa </em>(anger) inherent in him.
              Philosophically again, it is the mental forces of actions <em>(Sankhara) </em> which react
              in the course of time on the person originating them, and which are responsible for this
              stream of mind and matter, the origin of suffering within.</p>
              <h3>The Path Leading to the Extinction of Suffering</h3>
              <p>What then is the Path leading to the Extinction of Suffering? The Path is none other
              than the Noble Eightfold Path taught by the Buddha in his first sermon. This Eightfold
              Path is divided into three main stages, namely, <em>Sila, Samadhi</em> and <em>Panna.</em></p>
              <h4>Sila (The Precepts)</h4>
              <ol>

              <ol type="A">
              <li><strong>Sila. </strong>The three characteristic aspects of <em>Sila </em>are:<ol>
              <li><em>- Samma-vaca:</em> - Right Speech </li>
              <li><em>- Samma-kammanta</em>: - Right Action </li>
              <li><em>- Samma-ajiva:</em> - Right Livelihood </li>
              </ol><ol>
              <li><strong> - Panatipata:</strong> Abstaining from killing any sentient being. (Life is the most
                precious thing for all beings and in prescribing this precept the Buddha's compassion
                extends to all beings.) </li>
              <li><strong> - Adinn'adana:</strong> Abstaining from taking what is not given. (This serves as a
                check against improper desires for possessions.) </li>
              <li> <strong>- Kamesu-miccha-cara:</strong> Abstaining from sexual misconduct. (Sexual desire is
                latent in man. This is irresistible to almost all. Unlawful sexual indulgence is therefore
                something which the Buddha prohibited.) </li>
              <li><strong> - Musavada:</strong> Abstaining from telling lies. (This precept is included to
                fulfil by way of speech the essence of Truth.) </li>
              <li><strong>- Sura-meraya: </strong> Abstaining from intoxication. (Intoxication causes a man to
                lose his steadfastness of mind and the reasoning power so essential for the realization of
                Truth.) </li>
              </ol></li>
              <p>By Right Speech is meant: Speech which must be true, beneficial and neither foul nor
              malicious.<br> By Right Action is meant: The fundamentals of morality, which are opposed to killing,
              stealing, sexual misconduct and drunkenness.<br> By Right Livelihood is meant: A way of living by trades other than those which increase
              the suffering of all beings -- such as slave trading, the manufacture of weapons and
              traffic in intoxicating drugs.</p>
              <p>These represent generally the Code of Morality as initially pronounced by the Buddha
              in his very first sermon. Later, however, he amplified it and introduced separate codes
              for the monks and lay disciples.</p>
              <p>I need not worry you with what has been prescribed for monks. I will just let you know
              what the code of morality, or the precepts, for a Buddhist lay disciple is. This is called
              <em>Panca Sila</em>, or the Five Precepts, which are:</p>
              <p>The <em>Panca Sila</em> therefore is intended to control actions and words and to serve
              as a foundation for <em>Samadhi </em>(equanimity of mind).</p>
              <li><strong>Samadhi. </strong>Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the mental aspect of Buddhism,
                  which I am sure will greatly interest you. In the second stage of the Eightfold Noble Path
                  <em>(Samadhi) </em>are included:<ol>
              <li> <em>- Samma-vayama:</em> - Right Exertion </li>
              <li> <em>- Samma-sati:</em> - Right Attentiveness </li>
              <li> <em>- Samma-samadhi:</em> - Right Concentration </li>
              </ol></li>
              <p>Right Exertion is, of course, a prerequisite for Right Attentiveness. Unless one makes
              a determined effort to narrow down the range of thoughts of one's wavering and unsteady
              mind, one cannot expect to secure that attentiveness of mind which in turn helps one to
              bring the mind by Right Concentration to a state of One-pointedness and Tranquillity (or <em>Samadhi). </em> It is here that the mind becomes freed from hindrances -- pure and tranquil,
              illumined within and without. The mind in such a state becomes powerful and bright.
              Outside, it is represented by light which is just a mental reflex, with the light varying
              in degrees from that of a star to that of the sun. To be plain, this light which is
              reflected before the mind's eye in complete darkness is a manifestation of the purity,
              tranquillity and serenity of the mind.</p>
              <p>The Hindus work for it. To go from light into the void and to come back to light is
              truly <em>Brahmanic. </em>The New Testament, in Matthew, speaks of "a body full of
              light." We hear also of Roman Catholic priests meditating regularly for this very
              miraculous light. The Koran, too, gives prominence to the "Manifestation of Divine
              Light."</p>
              <p>This mental reflex of light denotes the purity of mind within, and the purity of mind
              forms the essence of a religious life, whether one be Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or
              Muslim. Indeed, Purity of Mind is the greatest common denominator of all religions. Love,
              which alone is a means for the unity of mankind, must be supreme, and it cannot be so
              unless the mind is transcendentally pure. A balanced mind is necessary to balance the
              unbalanced minds of others. "As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes
              straight his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard, difficult to
              hold back."[11]</p>
              <p>So said the Buddha. Exercise of the mind is just as necessary as exercise of the
              physical body. Why not, then, give exercise to the mind and make it pure and strong so
              that you may enjoy the <em>Jhanic </em>Peace Within?</p>
              <p>When Inner Peace begins to permeate the mind, you will surely progress in the
              knowledge of Truth.</p>
              <p>Believe it or not, it is our experience that under a proper guide, this Inner Peace
              and Purity of Mind with light can be secured by <em>one and all</em> irrespective of their
              religion or creed, provided they have sincerity of purpose and are prepared to submit to
              the guide for the period of trial.</p>
              <p>When by continued practice one has complete mastery over one's mind, one can enter
              into <em>Jhanic </em>states (absorption states) and gradually develop oneself to acquire the
              attainments <em>(Samapattis) </em>which will give one supernormal powers like those
              exercised by <em>Kaladevala, </em>the hermit teacher of King <em>Suddhodana. </em>This, of
              course, must be tried with very strict morality and away from human habitations, but it is
              rather dangerous for those who still have traces of passion in them. Anyway, such a
              practice, which gives supernormal powers in this mundane field, was not encouraged by the
              Buddha, whose sole object of developing <em>Samadhi </em>was to have the purity and strength
              of mind essential for the realization of Truth.</p>
              <p>We have in Buddhism forty methods of concentration, of which the most outstanding is <em>Anapana, </em>that is, concentration on the incoming and outgoing breath, the method followed by all
              the Buddhas.</p>
              <li> <strong>Panna. </strong>Ladies and gentlemen, I will now take up the philosophical aspect of
                  Buddhism in the third stage of the Noble Eightfold Path, <em>Panna </em>or Insight. The two
                  characteristic aspects of <em>Panna </em>are: 
                    <ol>
              <li> <em>- Samma-sankappa:</em> - Right Aspiration (or Right Thought) </li>
              <li> <em>- Samma-ditthi:</em> - Right Understanding </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Right Understanding of the Truth is the aim and object of Buddhism, and Right
                  Aspiration (or Right Thought) is the analytical study of mind and matter, both within and
                  without, in order to come to a realization of Truth.</p>
              <p>You have heard of <em>Nama </em>and <em>Rupa </em>(mind and matter) so many times. I owe
                  you a further explanation.</p>
              <p><em>Nama </em>is so called because of its tendency to incline towards an object of
                  sense. <em>Rupa </em>is so called because of its impermanence due to perpetual change. The
                  nearest terms in English to <em>Nama </em>and <em>Rupa </em>therefore are mind and matter. I
                  say "nearest" because the meaning is not exact.</p>
              <p><em>Nama, </em>strictly speaking, is the term applied to the following:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> - Consciousness <em>- (Vinnana)</em> </li>
              <li> - Feeling <em>- (Vedana)</em> </li>
              <li> - Perception <em>- (Sanna)</em> </li>
              <li> - Volitional Energies (or Mental Forces) <em> - (Sankhara).</em> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>These, together with <em>Rupa </em>in the material state, make what we call the <em>Panca-kkhanda</em> or Five Aggregates. It is in these five aggregates that the Buddha has summed up all the
                  mental and physical phenomena of existence, which in reality is a continuum of mind and
                  matter coexisting, but which to a layman is his personality or ego.</p>
              <p>In<em> Samma-sankappa</em> (Right Aspiration), the disciple, who by then has developed
                  the powerful lens of <em>Samadhi, </em>focuses his attention into his own self and by
                  introspective meditation makes an analytical study of the nature, first of <em>Rupa </em>(Matter)
                  and then of <em>Nama </em>(mind and the mental properties). He feels -- and at times he also
                  sees -- the <em>Kalapas </em>in their true state. He begins to realize that both <em>Rupa </em>and
                  <em>Nama </em>are in constant change -- impermanent and fleeting. As his power of
                  concentration increases, the nature of the forces in him becomes more and more vivid. He
                  can no longer get out of the impression that the <em>Panca-kkhandha</em>, or Five
                  Aggregates, are suffering, within the law of Cause and Effect. He is now convinced that,
                  in reality, all is suffering within and without and there is no such thing as an ego. He
                  longs for a state beyond suffering. So eventually going beyond the bounds of suffering, he
                  moves from the mundane to the supramundane state and enters the stream of <em>Sotapanna, </em>the
                  first of the four stages of the <em>Ariyas </em>(Noble Ones). Then he becomes free from (i)
                  ego, (ii) doubts and (iii) attachment to rules and rituals. The second stage is <em>Sakadagami </em>(Once-Returner), on coming to which sensuous craving and ill- will become attenuated.
                  He ceases to have any passion or anger when he attains the third stage of <em>Anagami </em>(Non-Returner).
                  <em>Arahatship </em>is the final goal. Each of the <em>Ariyas </em>can feel what <em>Nibbana </em>is
                  like, even as a man, as often as he may choose by going into the fruition stage of <em>Sotapanna, </em>etc., which gives him the <em>Nibbanic </em>Peace Within.</p>
              <p>This Peace Within, which is identified with <em>Nibbana, </em>has no parallel because it
                  is supramundane. Compared to this, the <em>JhanicPeace Within </em>, which I mentioned
                  earlier in dealing with <em>Samadhi, </em>is negligible because while the <em>Nibbanic Peace
                  Within </em> takes one beyond the limits of the thirty-one planes of existence, the <em>Jhanic
                  Peace Within</em> will still keep one within these planes -- that is to say, in the
                  fine-material world of the <em>Brahmas.</em></p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, just a word more. What I have said includes only some of the
                  fundamental aspects of Buddhism. With the time at my disposal, I hope I have given you my
                  best:</p>
              <p>To come to a state of Purity of Mind with a light before you;</p>
              <dl><dd> To go into a Jhanic state at will; </dd><dd> To experience for yourselves Nibbanic Peace Within. </dd><dd>These are all within your reach.</dd></dl>
              <p>Why not, then, try for the first two at least, which are within the confines of your
                  own religion? I am prepared to give you any help that you may require.</p>
              <p>May I again express my gratitude to you all for your patient listening. My thanks are
                  also due to the clergy of the church for their kind permission.</p>

                       religion: "Action or conduct indicating a belief in, reverence 
                       for, and desire to please, a divine ruling power; the exercise or 
                       practice of rites or observances implying this. ... Recognition on 
                       the part of man of some higher unseen power as having control of his
                       destiny, and as being entitled to obedience, reverence, and worship
                       ..." The transferred usage given is closer to the way the word may 
                       be correctly applied to Buddhism: "Devotion to some principle ..." 
                       But even so, it is important to exclude  any idea of a creative and

                       Buddhism only recognizes that the functioning of mind and matter can

                       Dhamma in its highest sense is this Truth, which is rediscovered by

              <h2>Lecture No. 3 (14th October 1951)</h2>
              <p>My talks on "What Buddhism Is" will not be complete without a reference,
              though in brief, to the Law of <em>Paticca-samuppada</em> (the Law of Dependent Origination)
              and the Law of <em>Patthana </em>(the Law of Relations, or Cause and Effect).</p>
              <h3>The Law of Dependent Origination</h3>
              <p>It will be recalled that in summing up my first lecture, I mentioned how Prince
              Siddhattha, the wandering ascetic, realised the truth and became a Buddha. Lest you
              forget, I will repeat that portion again.</p>
              <dl>
              <p>Verily, Prince Siddhattha attained <em>Samma-sambhodhi</em> and became the Buddha, the
                Awakened One, the Enlightened One, the All-knowing One. He was awake in a way compared
                with which all others were asleep and dreaming. He was enlightened in a way compared with
                which all other men were stumbling and groping in the dark. He knew with a knowledge
                compared with which all that other men knew was but a kind of ignorance.</p>
              </dl>
              <p>All religions, no doubt, claim to show the way to Truth. In Buddhism, for so long as
              one has not realized the truth (i.e., the Four Noble Truths), one is in ignorance. It is
              this ignorance <em>(Avijja) </em>that is responsible for the generation of mental forces <em>(Sankhara) </em>which regulate the life continuum (or consciousness) <em>(Vinnana) </em>in all sentient
              beings. Just as the life continuum is established in a new existence, mind and matter (<em>Nama</em> and <em>Rupa) </em> appear automatically and correlatively. These, in turn, are developed
              into a vehicle or body with sense centres <em>(Salayatana). </em>These sense centres give
              rise to contact <em>(Phassa) </em>and contact of these sense centres with sense objects
              gives rise to sense impressions <em>(Vedana) </em>which have the effect of arousing desire <em>(Tanha) </em>followed closely by attachment or clinging to desire <em>(Upadana). </em>It is this
              attachment, or clinging to desire, which is the cause of becoming (Bhava) or of existence
              with the attendant birth (Jati), old age, illness, death, anxiety, agony, pains, etc. <em>(Jara-marana</em>,
              etc.), all of which denote suffering. In this way the Buddha traced the origin of
              suffering to ignorance.</p>
              <dl><dt> So the Buddha said: [12] </dt><dd> Ignorance is the origin of mental forces; Mental forces, the origin of the life
                  continuum; The life continuum, the origin of mind and matter; Mind and matter, the origin
                  of the sense centres; The sense centres, the origin of contact; Contact, the origin of
                  impression; Impression, the origin of desire; Desire, the origin of attachment;
                  Attachment, the origin of becoming (existence); Becoming (existence), the origin of birth;
                  Birth, the origin of old age, illness, death, anxiety, agony, pains, etc. (which are all
                  suffering).</dd></dl>
              <p>This chain of origination is called the Law of Dependent Origination and the root
              cause of all these is therefore <em>Avijja, </em>ignorance -- that is, ignorance of the
              Truth. It is true that superficially desire is the origin of suffering. This is so simple.
              When you want a thing, desire is aroused. You have to work for it or you suffer for it.
              But this is not enough. The Buddha said, "The five aggregates, which are nothing but
              mind and matter, also are suffering." The Truth of suffering in Buddhism is complete
              only when one realizes by seeing mind and matter as they really are (both within and
              without) and not as they seem to be.</p>
              <p>The Truth of Suffering is therefore something which must be experienced before it can
              be understood. For example, we all know from science that everything that exists is
              nothing but vibration caused by the whirling movement of infinite numbers of sub-atomic
              particles, but how many of us can persuade ourselves to believe that our own bodies are
              subject to the same Law? Why not then try to feel things as they really are in so far as
              they relate to yourself? One must be above physical conditions for this purpose. One must
              develop mental energy powerful enough to see things in their true state. With developed
              mental power, one can see through and through; one can see more than what one can see with
              the help of the latest scientific instruments. If that be so, why should one not see what
              exactly is happening in one's own self -- the atoms, the electrons and what not, all
              changing fast and yet never ending. It is, of course, by no means easy.</p>
              <p>Here is an extract from a diary of one of my disciples which will give you an idea of
              what Suffering Within is:</p>
              <dl>
              <p>21/8/51. As soon as I began to meditate I felt as if someone were boring a hole through
                my head and I felt the sensation of crawling ants all over my head. I wanted to scratch,
                but my Guru forbade me from doing it. Within an hour I saw the sparkling ra dium of blue
                light tinged with violet colour entering inside my body gradually. When I lay in my room
                continuously for three hours I became almost senseless and I felt a terrible shock in my
                body. I was about to be frightened but my Guru encouraged me to proceed on. I felt my
                whole body heated up and I also felt the induction of the electronic needle at every part
                of my body.</p>
              <p>22/8/51. Today also I lay down meditating for nearly three hours. I had the sensation
                that my whole body was in flames and I also saw sparkles of blue and violet rays of light
                moving from top to bottom aimlessly. Then my Guru told me that the changing in the body is
                <em>Anicca </em>(impermanence) and the pain and suffer ing following it is Dukkha and that
                one must get to a state beyond <em>Dukkha </em>or Suffering.</p>
              <p>23/8/51. My Guru asked me to concentrate on my breast without the radiation of light
                and added that we are reaching the stage of philosophy of our body. I did accordingly and
                came to the conclusion that our body is full of Sufferings.</p>
              </dl>
              <p>In reality, this Suffering Within is a sequel to the keen sense of feeling of the
              vibration, radiation and friction of the atomic units experienced through a process of
              introspective meditation called <em>Vipassana </em> with the aid of the powerful lens of <em>Samadhi. </em>Not knowing this Truth is indeed ignorance. Knowing this Truth in its Ultimate Reality
              means destruction of the root cause of suffering, that is, ignorance with all the links in
              the chain of causation ending with what we call "life" with its characteristics
              of old age, illness, anxiety, agony, pains, etc.</p>
              <p>So much for the Law of Dependent Origination and the root cause of suffering.</p>
              <h3>The Law of Cause and Effect</h3>
              <p>Let us now turn our attention to the Causal Law of Relations as expounded by the
              Buddha in the Law of <em>Patthana </em>in the <em>Abhidhamma Pitaka</em>. This is the Law in
              the course of the analytical study of which six coloured rays emerged from the person of
              the Buddha during his non-stop meditation for 49 days soon after the attainment of
              Buddhahood. We have five volumes of about 500 pages each of <em>Pali </em>text on this very
              delicate subject. I will just give here only an idea of the Law. There are 24 types of
              Relations on which the fundamental principles of Cause and Effect in Buddhism are based.
              They are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> Condition - <em>Hetu</em> </li>
              <li> Object - <em>Arammana</em> </li>
              <li> Dominance - <em>Adhipati</em> </li>
              <li> Contiguity - <em>Anantara</em> </li>
              <li> Immediate Contiguity - <em>Samanantara</em> </li>
              <li> Coexistence - <em>Sahajata</em> </li>
              <li> Reciprocity - <em>Annamanna</em> </li>
              <li> Dependence - <em>Nissaya</em> </li>
              <li> Sufficing Condition - <em>Upanissaya</em> </li>
              <li> Antecedence - <em>Purejata</em> </li>
              <li> Consequence - <em>Pacchajata</em> </li>
              <li> Succession - <em>Asevana</em> </li>
              <li> Action - <em>Kamma</em> </li>
              <li> Effect - <em>Vipaka</em> </li>
              <li> Support - <em>Ahara</em> </li>
              <li> Control - <em>Indriya</em> </li>
              <li> Ecstasy - <em>Jhana</em> </li>
              <li> Means - <em>Magga</em> </li>
              <li> Association - <em>Sampayutta</em> </li>
              <li> Dissociation - <em>Vippayutta</em> </li>
              <li> Presence - <em>Atthi</em> </li>
              <li> Absence - <em>Natthi</em> </li>
              <li> Abeyance - <em>Vigata</em> </li>
              <li> Continuance - <em>Avigata</em> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>I will explain to you now about the co-relation of <em>Hetu </em>(condition) and <em>Kamma </em>(action) and the effect produced by their causes, as I understand them.</p>
              <p><em>Hetu </em>is the condition of the mind at one conscious moment of each <em>Kamma </em>(action)
              whether physical, vocal or mental. Each <em>Kamma </em>therefore produces a condition of
              mind which is either moral, immoral or neutral. This is what in Buddhism we call <em>Kusala
              Dhamma</em>, <em>Akusala Dhamma</em> and <em>Abyakata Dhamma</em>. These <em>Dhammas </em>are
              mere forces -- i.e., mental forces -- which collectively create the Universe of Mental
              Forces as explained in my first lecture.</p>
              <p>Moral <em>(Kusala) </em>Forces are positive forces generated from <em>Kammas </em> (actions, words and thoughts) motivated by such good deeds as alms-giving, welfare work,
              devotion, purification of mind, etc.</p>
              <p>Immoral <em>(Akusala) </em>Forces are negative forces generated from <em>Kammas </em> (actions, words, and thoughts) motivated by desire, greed, lust, anger, hatred,
              dissatisfaction, delusion, etc.</p>
              <p>Neutral <em>(Abyakata) </em>Forces are neither moral nor immoral. This is the case, for
              example, of an <em>Arahat </em>who has got rid of all traces of ignorance <em>(Avijja). </em>In
              the case of an <em>Arahat, </em>contact <em>(Phassa) </em>of sense objects with the sense
              centres produces no reaction to sense impressions <em>(Vedana) </em> whatsoever, just as no
              impression is possible on flowing water which is ever changing. To him, the whole
              framework of the body is but an ever-changing mass and any impression thereon
              automatically breaks away with the mass.</p>
              <p>Let us now adjust the moral and immoral forces generated by conditioned actions with
              the planes of existence. For this purpose, I will classify the planes of existence roughly
              as follows:</p>
              <dl><dt>(1) <em>Arupa- </em>and <em>Rupa-Brahma </em>Planes.</dt><dd> These are beyond the range of sensuality. Supreme Love, Supreme Compassion, Supreme Joy
                  at others' success or greatness and Supreme Equanimity of Mind are the four qualities of
                  mind which generate transcendentally pure, brilliant and extremely pleasing, cool, and
                  light mental forces which find their location in the highest of the planes of existence.
                  This is the reason that in these planes matter is superfine and there is nothing but
                  radiance, and the vehicles or bodies of the Brahmas cannot be identified with matter but
                  with radiation or light.</dd></dl><dl><dt> (2) The Sensuous Planes which are composed of: </dt><dd> (i) - the Planes of Celestial Beings </dd><dd> (ii) - the Human World </dd><dd> (iii) - the Planes of the Lower Forms of Existence</dd></dl>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Planes of Celestial Beings.</span> All good or meritorious deeds, words or
              thoughts which have a taint of desire for future well-being create moral mental forces
              which are very pure, luminous, pleasant and light. These find their location in the higher
              planes of celestial beings where matter is fine, luminous, pleasant and light. These
              celestial beings therefore have astral bodies varying in fineness, luminosity and colour
              according to the planes to which they belong. Ordinarily they live in heavenly bliss till
              their own moral mental forces are consumed, when they revert to the lower planes of
              existence.</p>
              <p>I will now pass on to (iii) the Planes of the Lower Forms of Existence. I will come to
              our Human World last.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Planes of the Lower Forms of Existence. </span>All malicious, evil, demeritorious
              actions, words and thoughts create mental forces which by nature are impure, dark, fiery,
              heavy and hard. The most impure, dark, fiery, heavy and hard mental forces should
              therefore find their place in Hell, the lowest of the four planes of existence. The matter
              in all these planes must, therefore, be hard, crude, unpleasant and hot. The human world
              is just above the concentration of these forces, which are meant for consumption by those
              beings destined for these lower forms of existence. These beings, with the exception of
              those in the animal world, are invisible to the ordinary human eye but visible to those
              only who have developed the higher powers of Samadhi and secured the Divine Eye. Here,
              suffering, both physical and mental, predominates. This is just the reverse of what
              happens in the planes of celestial beings.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Human World.</span> Now I come to the human world. This is a half-way house
              between heaven and hell. We experience pleasure and pain mixed together, in degrees as
              determined by our own past Kamma. From here, we can, by developing our mental attitude,
              draw in our own mental forces that are in the higher planes. It is also from here that we
              can go down to the depths of depravity and tune up with the forces of the Lower Order.
              There is no such constancy as in other planes of existence. One may be a saint today but
              one can be a rogue thereafter. One may be rich today but one may soon become poor. The
              vicissitudes of life here are very conspicuous. There is no man who is stable, no family
              which is stable, no community which is stable, no nation which is stable. All are subject
              to the Law of <em>Kamma.</em></p>
              <p>As this <em>Kamma </em>comes out of Mind, which is ever-changing, the effects of Kamma
              must necessarily also be changing.</p>
              <p>It is the condition of the evil mental forces submerged in the Earth just under our
              feet which gives rise to the Law of Gravitation. For as long as man has inherent
              impurities in him which, prima facie, exist, he is subject to this gravitational pull and
              if he dies with the mental attitude tuned up with mental forces of a plane of lower
              existence at the last moment of his life, at the moment of death, the next existence is
              automatically in that plane, in order to clear, in a manner of speaking, his debit account
              of mental forces there. On the other hand, if at the moment of death his mental attitude
              is associated with forces in the human world, the next existence can be in the human world
              again. If, however, his mental attitude at the last moment of death is associated with the
              reminiscence of his good deeds, etc., the next existence will normally be in the celestial
              world, in order to enjoy the credit balance of his own mental forces there. One goes to
              the <em>Brahma </em>world if, at the moment of death, one's mind is not sensual, but is pure
              and tranquil. This is how <em>Kamma </em>plays its role in Buddhism, with mathematical
              precision.</p>
              <p>These, ladies and gentlemen, are the essential teachings of the Buddha. The way in
              which these teachings will affect the individual depends on how one takes it. The same
              applies to the family, the community or people in general. We have Buddhists in Faith and
              Buddhists in Practice. Yet there is another class of Buddhists who are just labelled
              Buddhists by Birth. Only Buddhists in actual practice can secure the change in mental
              attitude and outlook. Let them only observe the five precepts. They are the followers of
              the teachings of the Buddha. If this were followed by all the Buddhists in Burma, there
              would be no internecine strife such as we have here in Burma. But there is another
              disturbing factor: bodily requirements. One must have the bare necessities of life. Life
              is more precious to a person than anything else. The tendency, therefore, is for one to
              break laws of discipline, whether religious or governmental, for his self-preservation and
              for others depending on him.</p>
              <p>What is most essential is the generation of pure and good mental forces to combat the
              evil mental forces which dominate mankind. This is by no means easy. One cannot rise to a
              level of pure mental attitude without the help of a Teacher. If we want effective power to
              combat these forces, we must work for it Dhammically, i.e., according to the <em>Dhamma. </em>Modern
              science has given us for what it is worth the atomic bomb, the most wonderful and at the
              same time the most dreadful product of man's intelligence. Is man using his intelligence
              in the right way? Is he creating good or bad mental forces, according to the spirit of
              Buddhism? It is our will that decides how and upon what subject we shall use intelligence.
              Instead of using intelligence only for the conquest of atomic energy in matter without,
              why not use it also for the conquest of atomic energy within. This will give us the Peace
              Within and will enable us to share it with all others. We will then radiate such powerful
              and purified mental forces as will successfully counteract the evil forces which are all
              around us. Just as the light of a single candle has the power to dispel darkness in a
              room, so also the light developed in one man can help dispel darkness in several others.</p>
              <p>To imagine that "good" can be done by means of an "evil" is an
              illusion, a nightmare. The case in point is that of Korea. For all the loss of lives on
              both sides, now over a million, are we nearer to or further away from Peace? These are the
              lessons which we have learnt. A change of the mental attitude of mankind through religion
              alone is the solution. What is necessary at the moment is mastery over mind and not only
              mastery over matter.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism we differentiate <em>Loka Dhatu</em> from <em>Dhamma Dhatu</em>. By <em>Dhatu </em>is
              meant the nature elements or forces. <em>Loka Dhatu</em> is therefore matter (with its
              nature elements) within the range of the physical plane. <em>Dhamma Dhatu,</em> however,
              comprises mind, mental properties and some aspects of the nature elements which are not in
              the physical but in the mental plane. Modern science deals with what we call Loka Dhatu.
              It is just a base for <em>Dhamma </em> <em>Dhatu </em>in the mental plane. A step further and
              we come to the mental plane; not with the knowledge of modern science but with the
              knowledge of <em>Buddha- Dhamma </em>in practice.</p>
              <p>At least Mr H.A. Overstreet, author of <em>The Mature Mind</em> (New York: W.W. Norton)
              is optimistic about what is in store for mature minds. He said:</p>
              <dl>
              <p>The characteristic knowledge of our century is psychological. Even the most dramatic
                advances in physics and chemistry are chiefly the application of known methods of
                research. But the attitude toward human nature and human experience that has come in our
                time is new. This attitude could not have come earlier. Before it came, there had to be
                long preparation. Physiology had to be a developed science; for the psychological person
                is also physiological. His mind, among other things, is a matter of brain tissue, of
                nerves, of glands, or organs of touch, smell and sight. It was not until about seventy
                years ago that physiology was sufficiently developed to make psycho-physical research
                possible, as in the laboratories of the distinguished German psychologist, William Wundt.
                But before physiology there had to be a developed science of biology. Since brain, nerves,
                glands and the rest all depend upon processes, the science of the living cell had to have
                its maturing before a competent physiology could emerge. But before biology there had to
                be chemistry; and before chemistry, physics; and before physics, mathematics. So the long
                preparation goes back into the centuries. There is, in short, a time clock of science.
                Each science has to wait until its hour strikes. Today, at least, the time clock of
                science strikes the hour of psychology, and a new enlightenment begins. To be sure, the
                interests explored by this latest of the sciences are themselves old; but the accuracy of
                research is new. There is, in brief, a kind of iron logic that is in control. Each science
                has to wait for its peculiar accuracy until its predecessor has supplied the data and
                tools out of which its accuracy can be made. The time clock of science has struck a new
                hour: a new insight begins to be at our service.</p>
              </dl>
              <p>May I say that it is the <em>Buddha-Dhamma</em> which should be studied by one and all
              for a new insight into the realities of human nature. In Buddhism we have the cure for all
              the mental ills that affect mankind. It is the evil forces of the mind (past and present)
              that are responsible for the present state of affairs all over the world. By inspiring a
              strong sense of Buddhism in the minds of the people during the most critical days of Burma
              some two years ago, we have been able to get over the crisis.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, there is dissatisfaction almost everywhere. Dissatisfaction creates
              ill-feeling. Ill-feeling creates hatred. Hatred creates enmity. Enmity creates war. War
              creates enemies. Enemies create war. War creates enemies and so on. It is now becoming a
              vicious circle. Why? Certainly because there is lack of proper control over the mind.</p>
              <p>What is man? Man is after all mental forces personified. What is matter? Matter is
              nothing but mental forces materialized, a result of the reaction of moral (positive) and
              immoral (negative) forces. The Buddha said, "<em>Cittena niyyati loko</em>,"
              "The World is mind-made."[13]</p>
              <p>Mind, therefore, predominates over everything. Let us then study the mind and its
              peculiar characteristics and solve the problem that is now facing the world.</p>
              <p>There is a great field for practical research in Buddhism. Buddhists in Burma will
              always welcome whoever is anxious to have the benefit of their experience.</p>
              <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have made an attempt to give you the best of what I know about
              Buddhism. I shall be glad to give any interested person such further explanation on any
              point that he may wish to discuss. I am grateful to you for your kind attendance and the
              interest taken in my lectures. May I again thank the clergy of the church for the
              permission so kindly given for this series of lectures on their premises.</p>
              <dl>

              a 14-year old girl who died while sitting in meditation. The girl
              practises in the Mogok tradition in Burma.<br><br>Her body remained
              soft and flexible (as seen in the video) for the next three days with
              no smell. They later proceeded to cremate her.<br><br><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1104216929553846431">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1104216929553846431</a><br><br>There are also other videos showing Mogok Sayadaw's funeral and relics. </div>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; "><strong style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">International Religious Freedom Report 2007</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman; ">
              </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; "><strong>Section II. Status of Religious Freedom</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">Legal/Policy Framework</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted this right in some circumstances. The Constitution provides that every citizen or person in the country has a constitutional right to profess, practice, or propagate his or her religious belief so long as such activities do not breach any other laws relating to public order, public health, or morality. There is no state religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">All religious groups are subject to government scrutiny and must be registered legally under the Societies Act. The Government deregistered the country's congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1972 and the Unification Church in 1982, making them unlawful societies. Such a designation makes it impossible to maintain a legal identity as a religious group, with consequences relating to owning property, conducting financial transactions, or holding public meetings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The Government plays an active but limited role in religious affairs. For example, the Government seeks to ensure that citizens, most of whom live in government-built housing, have ready access to religious organizations traditionally associated with their ethnic groups by helping such institutions find space in these housing complexes. The Government maintains a semiofficial relationship with the Muslim community through the Islamic Religious Council (MUIS). The MUIS advises the Government on concerns of the Muslim community, drafts the approved weekly sermon, regulates some Muslim religious matters, and oversees a mosque-building fund financed by voluntary payroll deductions. The Constitution acknowledges Malay/Muslims to be "the indigenous people of Singapore" and charges the Government specifically to promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social, cultural, and language interests.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The 1961 Women's Charter gives women, among other rights, the right to own property, conduct trade, and receive divorce settlements. Muslim women enjoy most of the rights and protections of the Women's Charter; however, for the most part, Muslim marriage law falls under the administration of the Muslim Law Act, which empowers the Shari'a court to oversee such matters. The act also allows Muslim men to practice polygamy. Requests to take additional wives may be refused by the Registry of Muslim Marriages, which solicits the views of existing wives and reviews the financial capability of the husband. In the period covered by this report, there were 44 applications for polygamous marriage and 13 applications were approved. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The Presidential Council on Minority Rights examines all pending bills to ensure that they do not disadvantage a particular group. It also reports to the Government on matters affecting any racial or religious community and investigates complaints. There were no complaints or reports to the Presidential Council on Minority Rights from fiscal year 2005/2006. Fiscal year 2006/2007 data was not available by the end of the reporting period.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The Government does not permit religious instruction in public schools.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">There are official holy days for each major religion in the country: Hari Raya Haji and Hari Raya Puasa for Muslims, Christmas and Good Friday for Christians, Deepavali for Hindus, and Vesak Day for Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
              <span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; ">The Government promotes interfaith understanding indirectly by sponsoring activities to promote interethnic harmony. Because the primary ethnic minorities are predominantly of one faith each, government programs to promote ethnic harmony have implications for interfaith relations. In February 2006, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled the Community Engagement Program (CEP). The goal of the CEP is to promote multiracial and interreligious harmony, in part so that a strong foundation would be in place should an incident that could provoke ethnic/religious discord, such as a religiously related terrorist attack, occur in the country. During the period covered by this report, the CEP has held numerous community-based seminars, worked with trade unions to form cluster working groups on religious and community harmony, and launched a new website as a platform for communication and dialogue.</span><p></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The Profundity of the Vinaya<br>How deep and subtle the Vinaya is can be understood from the following<br>examples. <strong>A lay person, even after eradicating all mental defilements and<br>becoming an Arahant, has to pay respect to and worship an ordinary monk<br>who still has all the mental defilements. </strong>This is because a monk enjoys that<br>status by having followed the Vinaya procedure. An ordinary monk must not<br>bow to an Arahant lay person as his own status is higher. The Arahant is still a<br>lay person, while the other is a monk. If the two are compared on the basis of<br>mental purity, this injunction seems unreasonable.<br>There is a vast difference between a lay Arahant and an ordinary monk.<br>The former has personally achieved nibbÃï¿½na so his heart is always pure, while<br>the latterâs heart contains many defilements, so he is not free from the<br>suffering of the lower realms. Yet a lay Arahant has to pay respect to a monk<br>who is just an ordinary person. In the matter of status in the Buddhaâs<br>dispensation, an ordinary monk, being a member of the SaÃ¡Â¹â¦gha, is nobler than<br>an Arahant who is just a lay person. <strong>Why does a lay Arahant have to worship an ordinary monk? It is due to the Vinaya proclaimed with the supreme<br>authority of the Omniscient Buddha.</strong> One can therefore realise that the power<br>of Vinaya is imponderable and boundless in scope and extent. The Buddhaâs<br>supreme power, immeasurable wholesome kamma, and omniscience manifest<br>themselves in laying down these unique Vinaya rules. They have effects for<br>every monk in the Buddhaâs dispensation.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>âÃâ¬nanda, after I pass away the Dhamma and Vinaya I have proclaimed<br>and prescribed will be your teachers.â<br>These prophetic words of the Buddha are profound, and their scope is<br>boundless. So each of the millions of precepts undertaken by a monk during<br>his ordination represents the Buddha himself. The prophetic words of the<br>Buddha dwell in an ordained monk, whoever he may be.<br>A bhikkhu in this dispensation means a fully ordained monk who has<br>fulfilled five factors: purity of the ordination procedure, purity of the group of<br>monks, purity of the four formal recitations of kammavÃï¿½cÃï¿½, purity of robes and<br>bowl, and being a qualified candidate for full ordination. Once the ceremonies<br>of taking the three refuges and formal recitations have been done, he instantly<br>receives and undertakes the precepts. So we can say that nine billion Buddhas<br>dwell in his person by the power of the Buddha and efficacy of the Vinaya. He<br>is like a pagoda where the Buddhaâs relics are enshrined.<br>Everyone should know that a pagoda, even if it is made of mud or sand, is<br>a sacred object of worship because the Buddhaâs relics are enshrined there.</p>
              <p><strong>Due respect must be paid to the relics enshrined therein, which represent the<br>Buddha, even if the pagoda is made of unworthy materials. If disrespect is<br>shown even to this type of pagoda, one accumulates unwholesome kamma.</strong><br>Even if the precincts of a pagoda are littered with dust, garbage,<br>excrement, etc., the pagoda itself remains worthy of deep respect. So everyone<br>should bow their heads in showing due respect to the relics, which are<br>certainly worthy of honour. If one shows disrespect on seeing a pagoda with all<br>sorts of rubbish nearby, one accumulates unwholesome kamma.<br>Similarly, an ordinary monk possesses millions of Buddhas in his person,<br>though his mind is littered with thousands of mental defilements, like garbage<br>near a pagoda. As long as a single Vinaya precept still exists in his person, he is<br>entitled to be worshipped by a lay Arahant. The innumerable Vinaya precepts<br>that exist in his person represent countless Buddhas. Though he is not free<br>from Vinaya faults, he is like a pagoda. So a lay Arahant must revere him for<br>this reason.<br>If devotees consider this matter carefully, they will realise the countless<br>Vinaya rules observed by an ordinary monk. Moreover, they will appreciate<br>and revere the power of the Buddha, who is fully entitled to proclaim Vinaya<br>rules and regulations, and appropriate procedures for their purification. The<br>commanding power of the Omniscient Buddha shows its greatest effects in the<br>SaÃ¡Â¹â¦gha established by him. The power of the Vinaya is very profound, and is<br>hard to understand by an ordinary devotee or uneducated layman. No one can<br>fully fathom the significance of the Vinayaâs power.</p>
