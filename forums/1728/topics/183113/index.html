Thubten Chodron, on the Malaysian leg of her Asian tour, talks about an age old problem faced by practitioners: How does one find a teacher that is "suitable"? What does being suitable mean? And suitable for who? Lim Kooi Fong finds out in his hour long interview with the learned Venerable.<br><br>Petaling Jaya, Malaysia -- Funny how enlightened moments announce their arrival. A sprinkling of morning dew hanging at the edge of a fresh, young sapling. A ray of gold bursting forth from behind grey weather. And a little kitten snuggling in the comfort of her mother's embrace.<br><br>Voices of enlightened masters teaches us that such moments arrive because our minds were ready to receive them. Images such as the above come and go day by day. And yet, many of us don't even pay an ounce of attention to them. But when the mind is ready, and the situation is there, the condition is then said to have arrived for a ripening of insight, or "spiritual uplift". But how and when do we know that we are ready? Who can we rely on to tell us so?<br><br>"Reliance on a teacher," says Ven. Thubten Chodron, "can be a kind of paradox."<br><br>"While a teacher's responsibility is to teach, more important as well is their responsibility to help students respond to them," she advises. "A student's obligation is to think about what has been taught, to assess and to analyze the worthiness of the teachings. They also need to show a genuine interest in the Dharma, and to be open minded, that is, not to hold onto preconceived ideas and concepts that impedes spiritual enquiry."<br><br>But how do we know if a teacher has actually "realized" the spiritual insight he or she claims to have?<br><br>To this, the venerable explains, "Some teachers may be able to dispense with deep teachings. We need not however, be overly concerned with whether the person has realized the teachings he or she is giving or not. If the explanation of the teachings is unsatisfactory, we need not expose the deficiency of the teacher because of the possibility of a misinterpretation. As long as the teachings does not contradict ethics, we should continue to have faith in his or her spiritual ability."<br><br>Ven. Chodron cautions however, that it is not right for students to speculate on the attainment of their teachers. "It's a like a cook, you know. A good cook would never say that he or she is a good cook. The judgment sits on the onus of those who eats the food." She further elaborated the metaphor by emphasizing that "in Tibetan Buddhism, it is forbidden to talk about one's attainment."<br><br>"However," the venerable continues, "if what the teacher says clearly cannot match the deed with words, then we have to be cautious. For instance, if a teachers talks about compassion, but gets angry ever so often, then we have to be aware of the manner which is contrary to the teaching."<br><br>"The spiritually health of a teacher-student's relationship is only useful when the mutual dependence of one another succeeds in positive mental engagement. What this means is that when students sincerely listens to the teachings and puts them into practice, some will find their life become more meaningful. As a result, their respect for the teacher increases," she explains.<br><br>Does that give rise to a possibility of the student being attached to the teacher, I enquired. And what if the teacher possesses charismatic tendencies? Won't that too affects the ability of the student to establish spiritually healthy and useful relationships with their mentors?<br><br>Ven. Chodron uses the term "idolatry attachment" to describe the danger when students get too close to their teacher. "The ability of a skilled spiritual master to unlock the "bodhicitta" in their students is no doubt something that is truly treasured," she emphasized. "You can say that most people expects this to be the end result of a master-apprentice affiliation. But this can only happen if the students can relate to the teachings in an uplifting way."<br><br>"The danger is," she warns, "when the students becomes so much attached to the teacher that instead of fermenting spiritual ties, the relationship degenerates into jealousy, with each student studiously looking out at who is getting more attention from the teacher."<br><br>"I spoke earlier of the need for students to have the ability to assess and to analyze situations," she reminded me. "Teachers too need such qualities to avoid falling into the charismatic trap. Newcomers to Buddhism, especially in the west, are often people who needs emotional support more than spiritual guidance. Some hope to fill this void by trying to look deeply within themselves, depending on someone to help them along the way. Others however, tries to fulfill their 'spiritual emptiness' by looking for someone or something to worship. They carry their idolatry tendencies, that is worshipping movie stars, politicians and sports celebrity into the religious realms," the venerable laments.<br><br>"By all means, students must remember that all the training they receive only has one ultimate aim, and that is to become an evolved individual which has the ability to help sentient beings. If their end goal is to be dedicated only to the teacher, and only to caring and helping the teacher, they inevitably fall into the 'guru devotion' dilemma. This is by all account," she warns, "a spiritual misnomer because the final destiny of a teacher-student relationship is the mutual spiritual enrichment of both parties."<br><br>Simply put, "both become better people."<br><br>The conversation thus far have put paid to the idea that all it needs to be enlightened is to have the "right touch" from a "right guru". To have expected half as much of such romanticized idea from this respected venerable would be like looking out for a flight of fancy. The bottom line remains that a useful, healthy, teacher-student relationship is very much a symbiosis. A skilful teacher is a learner most of the time, and a teacher only some of the time.<br><br>The pull and push factors in the emotional rollercoaster that plague most teacher-student relationship is only a phase where both side try to discover one another. During such a social and spiritual ride, the interesting thing they learn is, - ultimately, all that they discover are their true selves.<br><br>And while the morning dew drops need a sapling to cling on, and the ray of sunlight needs a pall of grey clouds to breakthrough,  the magic is established only when the elements starts to leave one another. The enlightening glory arrives when the dew actually drops, and the ray of gold leaving behind the clouds and turns to basking the landscape with its light, awakening all its glorious colors.<br><br>As Ven. Thubten Chodron deftly describes it, "When a teacher reprimands a student, and the student returns with a serene look, you know that the spiritual bond is strong, and the practice is firm. The ego does not run away. But when the two do part, the world is better for it because now, there is one more to save sentient beings."<br><br>The dew has dropped, the sun is shining, and the student is transformed to be a teacher. And the enlightening cycle of life rolls on. BNN</span><br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>http://americanbuddhist.net/node/4660<br><br>Thu, 2007-02-22 11:17 Â— ABN<br>Poor headline and slightly strange telling of the story, but this information is quite interesting. "Incorruptible bodies" are part of most religious traditions.<br>The Buryats are a Mongolian people numbering approximately 252,000 whose lands are located north of the Russian-Mongolian border near Lake Baikal. ABN<br>_________________<br><br>22/02/2007<br><br><strong>Dead Buddhist Monk Is Alive</strong><br><br>Exhumation of the body of Hambo Lama Itigelov took place September 10 th, 2002 on the territory of cemetery near the city of Ulan Ude (Russian Federation). He died and was buried in 1927 and the exhumation was performed in presence of relatives, officials, and specialistsÃ¢Â€Â�.<br><br>This was the information that appeared in Russian mass media regarding Buryat Lama who was exhumed from the grave in the beginning of the 21 st century. The grave contained a wooden box and there was a sitting Buddhist lama in Ã¢ "lotus"  pose. His body was preserved as if it was mummified, however it was not. Soft muscles and skin, folding joints. The body was covered with silk clothes and fabric.<br><br>Hambo Lama Itigelov is a real person quite well known in Russian history. He stidied in Anninsky Datsan (Buddhist university in Buryatia, nowadays there are ruins only) and got degrees in medicine and philosophy (nature of emptiness), he created encyclopedia of pharmacology. In 1911 Itigelov became a Hambo Lama (the head of Buddhist church in Russia). During the period from 1913 till 1917 he participated in social actions of the Tsar, being invited to 300-year anniversary of RomanovÃ¢Â€Â™s house, opened the first Buddhist temple in St. Petersburg, and Nikolai II gave him St. Stanislav award on 19 th of March, 1917.<br><br><strong>LINK TO ORIGINAL</strong><br><br>http://www.bumbinorn.ru/2007/02/22/hambo_lama_48654.html<br><br>During the First World War Itigelov created and inspired the organization called Ã¢Â€ÂœBuryat brothersÃ¢Â€Â�. He was helping the army with money, meals, clothes, medicaments, he also built a set of hospitals with lama doctors helping wounded soldiers. For that he got St. Anna award and others.<br><br>In 1926 Itigelov advised the Buddhist monks to leave Russia, since Ã¢Â€Â˜the red teaching was comingÃ¢Â€Â™ (Itigelov himself never left Russia). In 1927, being 75, he told lamas to begin meditation, since he said he was preparing to die. Lamas did not want to perform this meditation because Itigelov was still alive. Thus, Itigelov began to meditate by himself, lamas joined him and soon he died.<br><br>Ititgelov left a testament where he asked to bury him as he was, sitting in lotus pose in the cedar box on traditional cemetery. It was done. There was also a statement, where he asked other monks to exhume him after several years. (This is the exciting point Ã¢Â€Â“ this means he knew that his body would be preserved). This was done in 1955 and in 1973 by Buddhist monks but they were scared to tell everybody about this, since communist regime did not leave any space for religion in society. Only in 2002 the body was finally exhumed and transferred to Ivolginsky Datsan (a residence of todayÃ¢Â€Â™s Hambo Lama) where it was closely examined by monks and, which is now more important, by scientists and pathologists. The official statement was issued about the body Ã¢Â€Â“ very well preserved, without any signs of decay, whole muscles and inner tissue, soft joints and skin. The interesting thing is that the body was never embalmed or mummified.<br><br>Two years passed. ItigelovÃ¢Â€Â™s body is now kept open air, in contact with other people, without any temperature or humidity regimes. How Itigelov keeps this condition, nobody knows.<br><br>This is the ONLY KNOWN AND CONFIRMED CASE OF IMPERISHABLE BODY throughout the whole world. Embalming and mummifying is well known among different nations and peoples Ã¢Â€Â“ Chili (Chinchora), Egypt mummies, Christian Saints, communist leaders and others. Some bodies were found in permafrost, however when they contacted with oxygen atmosphere they perished within several hours.<br><br><strong>However, there are descriptions of such things in Buddhist texts, but there are no confirmed examples. Well, now there is.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Seems like the writer is not aware of other Holy Beings who have also achieved a high level of practice resulting in their bodies not decaying e.g. in Thailand etc.</span></strong><br><br>For two years after the exhumation of ItigilovÃ¢Â€Â™s body it does not perish nor decay, no fungus, no negative things happen to it. Itigelov said before he died that he left a message to all peoples on Earth. This message contains no words. Now it is our turn to understand it.<br><br></div>
