              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i m not sure if other members have ask the similar question as what i am asking now.</p>
              <p>i start chanting 2 years ago (at that time was not really active) and when i was having pregnancy complication, then i started to chant Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa wholeheartedly.</p>
              <p>Also i know is good for 'chao du'.</p>
              <p>recently i meet a sifu. He warned me not to turn on buddha chanting evening time. Reason being, will invite unwanted things inside my house.</p>
              <p>i m not sure if the sifu say correctly or not. As far as i know, Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa chanting meant for chao du as well.</p>
              <p>Am i doing wrong and invite those spirits inside my house till cause fire?</p>
              <p>I am not sure, but no matter how many times i do the chanting, still the spirit inside my house refuse to go!</p>
              <p>hopefully someone can enlighthen me this issue.</p>

              <p>Spirits are everywhere. Even if you don't chant, spirits will enter your house if your house has no dharma protectors or images of Buddha or Bodhisattva. I did ask the shifu this question. Shifu gave me a very good answer.</p>
              <p>He said those spirits who were willing to listen to you chanting were all good spirits. They were better than humans who didn't want to listen to the sutra. These good spirits would bless you and be grateful to you as you had helped them. They would listen and go off without disturbing the peace of your house.</p>
              <p>However, please do not chant æ–½é£Ÿmantra as this will invite good and bad spirits because they are all hungry for food. If there's no food, the bad spirits will disturb you.</p>

              <p><br>There was one Incredible tale episode, this young lady showed her face on screen. She had 3rd eye, she saw ghost in church when she was young. Ghosts are everywhere. Those ghosts who enter temple must get the permission from the dharma protectors, that's my understanding from shifu. They are good spirits who want to learn dharma.</p>

              <p>Even so... we had an old family friend who had the third eye and he said that sometimes he would observe some mischievous ghosts trip people to make them fall; for no other reason other than to cause mischief.  Sometimes, when he knew their intention, he would shout at them to warn them not to be naughty, and those ghosts would leave.  But he says that for the most part, he would leave them alone and they left him alone too.</p>

              Why were you chanting DizangWang Pusa, since you know it is for "chao du"?
              
              Dizangwang Pusa and it's associated mantra are for the DEAD, of course you are inviting the ghosts into your house lah......

              <p>Go to the source that can help you remove the ghosts.    Buddhism does not provide such help except for asking you to do chanting which you already did and does not solve your problem.</p>
              <p>It is dangerous to chant without knowing the true meaning of the sutra and mantra.   </p>

              <p>Why were you chanting DizangWang Pusa, since you know it is for "chao du"? Dizangwang Pusa and it's associated mantra are for the DEAD, of course you are inviting the ghosts into your house lah...... You are like asking why you are being "hum dump" when you yell f#%K you at a person... Hahahahahahahhah ...... Hehehhehehehehe</p>

              <p>No, Dizang Wang Pusa is not just for the dead. He benefits both the dead and the living (é˜´é˜³ä¸¤åˆ©). I chanted DiZang Jing almost everyday last year and my family members recovered from sickness due to karmic. As Dizang sutra is very long, I recite Dizang Pusa's name every now and then after their recovery.</p>

              <p>Hi Sabrina</p>
              <p>I m not sure, the "sifu" which you are referring. Are they Buddhist temple monk and nun or fortune teller or fengshui master. As this term has been used loosely in the circle.</p>
              <p>However, it is true in a certain sense, normally it is not adviseable to play Buddhist chant at night. One need to be selective with it as sometime spirit will be attracted to it especially like Compassionate Mantra.</p>
              <p>Secondly, do not be fearful of the spirit, the correct buddhist perspective is to show compassion to them. They are in the worst state of existence in comparison to us. In fact, as human we have better merits than them especially you can chant Namo Di Zang Wang Pusa. However, you need to take this a step further, you need to have compassion like Di Zang Wang Pu Sa.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say this, everyday you are calling on your teacher, Di Zang  Wang bodhisattva yet not practising the way of Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Some pointer to consider:</p>
              <p>1) Will Di Zang Wang chase the pitiful sentient being out of hell?</p>
              <p>2) Where can they go?</p>
              <p>The fact, he choose to stay in the hell realms to teach the sentient being so that they can create good cause for a better rebirth. That's act make him into a Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>In the same manner, you claim that there is spirit in your house, one need to coexist with them in a harmonious way. Otherwise, you will be laughing stock in the spirit eyes. However, you can tell the spirit not to disturb you and your family since you know of their existence.</p>
              <p>The lest you can do is always dedicate the merits of your chanting, giving and etc to them which all Buddhist do.</p>
              <p>May the merits accumulated through the chanting be shared with all sentient beings near and far. May all be well and happy. May all be free from the endless cycle of suffering.</p>
              <p>In times to come, they will become your protectors then your freeloaders. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> see Dr Tan webfor further reading: <a href="http://www.kktanhp.com/Spirits,Ghosts.htm">http://www.kktanhp.com/Spirits,Ghosts.htm</a></p>

              <p>Spirits are everywhere. Even if you don't chant, spirits will enter your house if your house has no dharma protectors or images of Buddha or Bodhisattva. I did ask the shifu this question. Shifu gave me a very good answer.</p>
              <p>He said those spirits who were willing to listen to you chanting were all good spirits. They were better than humans who didn't want to listen to the sutra. These good spirits would bless you and be grateful to you as you had helped them. They would listen and go off without disturbing the peace of your house.</p>
              <p>However, please do not chant æ–½é£Ÿmantra as this will invite good and bad spirits because they are all hungry for food. If there's no food, the bad spirits will disturb you.</p>

              <p>Can I play in the evening too? Or late late at night?</p>
              <p>I wont mind so long you cannot see them and they are good, I mean even will bless you too.</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i m not sure if other members have ask the similar question as
              what i am asking now.</p>
              <p>i start chanting 2 years ago (at that time was not really
              active) and when i was having pregnancy complication, then i
              started to chant Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa wholeheartedly.</p>
              <p>Also i know is good for 'chao du'.</p>
              <p>recently i meet a sifu. He warned me not to turn on buddha
              chanting evening time. Reason being, will invite unwanted things
              inside my house.</p>
              <p>i m not sure if the sifu say correctly or not. As far as i know,
              Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa chanting meant for chao du as well.</p>
              <p>Am i doing wrong and invite those spirits inside my house till
              cause fire?</p>
              <p>I am not sure, but no matter how many times i do the chanting,
              still the spirit inside my house refuse to go!</p>
              <p>hopefully someone can enlighthen me this issue.</p>

              <p>Not sure which "Sifu" tells you that. Seems to be mixed with some Taoist beliefs.</p>
              <p>Ghost are everywhere. They can enter your house even if you don't do any chanting. The good thing is that if ghosts listen to Sutra chanting, most of them will "like" it. It can even subdue and change their mind to kindness. They will even protect you and bless you. Yes. chanting might attract ghosts to come and listen to it. But you should bear in mind that sutra are dharma for the good of ghosts. Ghosts will not harm you, but will even be glad to listen to dharma. They might even thank you.</p>
              <p>Those ghosts that will not come (upon hearing the chants) are the "evil" one, as they fear the power of Buddha and Bohisattva.</p>
              <p>As a general guide, if you're pregnant, you might want to chant è§‚ä¸–éŸ³è�©è�¨æ™®é—¨å“�  (Guanyin Sutra), which is highly recommended.</p>
