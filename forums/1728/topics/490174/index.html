Some self-proclaimed Buddhist
              protection organisations are complaining loudly about a movie which tells a
              story about wayward monks. They believe those involved in this movie, which is
              titled Abat which means monastic misconduct, have an ulterior motive against
              the country's main religion.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The protesters were spurred on by
              a monk at Wat Benchamabopit who has criticised <span class="italic">Abat</span>,
              a work by Kanitta Kwanyoo, on his Facebook page. On his page he said he noticed
              the movie industry often tends to release films with a negative image of monks
              at times when we are about to celebrate religious "big days",
              although he was not specific in this case.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The monk also listed other films
              including <span class="italic">Nark Prok</span> and <span class="italic">Ong
              Kulimara</span> to prove his conspiracy theory. He seems to forget that <span class="italic">Ong Kulimara</span> is an adaptation of Jataka tales that date
              back more than 2,500 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Those agencies, Buddhist
              followers or this particular monk's followers, were to lodge a complaint with
              the Culture Ministry yesterday. Their demand is that the ministry uses its
              power to force the filmmaker to revise the film content.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Their main argument: Such a movie
              may destroy people's faith in Buddhism. Another point that makes these people
              believe there is a conspiracy is the main character who plays a novice is not a
              Buddhist. It's fortunate that they stop short of saying that the director is a
              woman.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>We have seen this outrage before.
              Remember that famous, thought-provoking painting by Anupong Chantorn which
              boldly criticised monks who engage in misconduct. The 2007 work triggered
              protests among these same groups. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>It astounds me how some people,
              in fact quite a lot, lack the ability to separate fictitious content in films
              and the real world.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Believing that only movies with
              positive content about Buddhism are good for our religion shows how they, at
              best, take things only at face value.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>What astounds me even more is to
              think how these people become indifferent when monks -- real, not fictitious
              figures -- engage in misconduct.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>When pointing to misconduct by
              monks, examples simply abound. Just read the newspapers: There are reports of
              drunken monks (believe me, these people would complain if a film featured a
              monk gulping down booze. At best, they would demand the scene be cut). There
              are monks in sexual relationships; monks who accumulate vast wealth... the list
              goes on and on.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Some misconduct is so serious
              that it could erode Buddhists' faith. Yet, these people -- including fellow men
              in saffron robes -- still act as if nothing has happened.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>A major irony is the case of Wat
              Kalayanamit which has been locked in legal warfare with the Fine Arts
              Department and its local community.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The temple made headlines in past
              years when the abbot ordered the demolition of some heritage buildings in the
              temple compound, to pave the way for modern structures, and forced the eviction
              of surrounding community members, nearly 60 households, from the temple land.
              It's the community's heritage.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Eventually, the legal case with
              the Fine Arts Department was wrapped up with the temple and the abbot being
              charged for violating the heritage conservation act; while the department
              bulldozed two new buildings that were constructed on the abbot's orders.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Apart from the loss of the
              heritage buildings, my concern was about how the temple abbot treated the
              community. As the legal wrangle went on, the temple's ties with the
              community turned sour. Community members no longer make merit at the monastery.
              It's sad to see how a temple can be so hostile to the people, while the Lord
              Buddha teaches otherwise.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The latest development is that
              the temple has started bulldozing houses, starting with the home of the
              community leader who led the conservation campaign. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>All this has happened without
              those Buddhist protectors questioning such a hostile act by the men in saffron
              robes. The Sangha Council has watched this saga -- and done nothing. Like the
              Buddhism protectors, the council is just indifferent.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>To me, such indifference is even
              more dangerous than the <span class="italic">Abat</span> film or any other movie,
              book or work of art.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The Lord Buddha teaches us about
              the law of impermanence and, of course, that law also applies to
              Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Our religion can only be
              destroyed when we Buddhists lose our faith. </span></p>

              <p>It is precisely that lots of people lack the ability to separate fictitious content in films and the real world, that such movies that portray the negative image of monks should be banned or censored. Allowing such movies to be screened will do nothing but put the whole religion in a very bad light.  I do believe ulterior motive against the religion is at play here. Remember, the Sangha community is one of the three pillars of the religion. No right-minded Buddhist will produce a film that will bring down one of these pillars that can cause the total collapse of the religion. </p>
              <p>But it does not mean that such wayward monks should allow free rein to do as they wish and eventually destroy the followers’ faith in the religion. They should be brought to task and dealt with firmly by the secular laws in place or the Sangha council.</p>
              <p>One starts to wonder as well, what are the members of the Sangha council thinking?</p>
              <p>Edmund Burke said, “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.” With all due respect, are these members of the Sangha council an ignorant lot? Ignorant of what is going on in the secular world and the bad hats under their charge? Or have they misinterpreted the Buddha’s teaching of equanimity for indifference?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Apathy and indifference is more dangerous than hatred. Hatred requires effort. An apathetic person will not exert any effort to make a difference in either direction.  He sits back and watches events unfold before his very eyes completely indifferent to the world around him. It is such inaction that is allowing these wayward monks from getting away with all their wrongdoings. If the whole religion has being undermined by these wayward monks, it also makes the members of the Sangha council just as responsible for their inaction.</span></p>

              <p>I don't know what is in faith. </p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is ignorance. </p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because of conditioning, conditions.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is sense base and sense media.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is contact.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is feeling.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is grasping, perhaps aversion.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is becoming.</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is birth [sic: and our fertility rates are very low, which is a good thing for buddhists]</p>
              <p>Faith can only arise because there is what lies beyond birth, including aging and sickness, although there ought to be death.</p>
