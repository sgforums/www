              <p>That's right. Yi Kuan Dao only teaches people to do good. It does not lead people to liberation. Therefore it is not Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it mislead people into thinking that what it teaches is the same as Buddhism, and has cult-like behaviors (like secret initiation and swearing to get lightning strike etc). This is why Yi Kuan Dao is listed in this forum as a cult and not some other non-Buddhist religions and teachings.</p>

              <p><br>last time there was a famous esangha forum, very international Buddhists forum. They have different sect in different partitions. as one of the pureland moderator there myself, i talked to a lot of well known well cultivated monks/buddhists there. but it was closed down due to a japan sect monk cum lawyer went to sue the forum owner for rejecting his wrong view. the owner never do anything, as it was most of the mods that rejected his view.  since that forum is well establish and some old timers know their Buddhism stuff. so some of the rules are taken from there, when i discussed with AEN.</p>

              <p>Yi Kwan Tao only on entry levels, it's practices are more taoist practices of immortality, the chinese believe in Tien, or Heavens or  Shang Di, Tai Shang Lao Jun is a taoist immortal. </p>
              <p>Tsk, tsk you should know better, is Buddha a God, or Brahma like?</p>
              <p>But opportunities arising, I will like someone to gently induct these people to Buddhism. </p>
