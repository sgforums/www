              <p>Like I said, there are lots of elementary Buddhism textbooks out there. Why cant they serve as entry and foundation to Buddhism instead?</p>
              <p>He advocate only to people that have respect in a teacher? Not true. His DVD, he cant see who's the audience at the other end. When he record his so call 'learning process', his dharma talk, he should know that it will be spread out, propagate thru DVD distribution and Internet. So, this skillful mean defense dun apply here.</p>

              <p>and like i said, they CAN, if they have TIME to read and study, and that there are too MANY.</p>
              <p>yea, u have this point that he cannot see. though many of us here seeing them can understand and interprete it correctly. so u have to decern and pick for yourselve.  not asking u to follow all that u cannot understand. those who can decern well out of respect for any teacher, get the real message. the real message is the matter at hand. he pointing the moon with the finger, but some people keep clinging on the finger and don't see the moon.</p>
              <p>some of the message are ch'an messages. if one have some ch'an knowledge, one'll understand. as we know ch'an message are non-sensical. they said "if you meet Buddha in the road, kill him." ....then u really kill a buddha? not true what.</p>
              <p>or the ch'an story of burning the Buddha statue for heat and honouring firewood as Buddha. so it's in the heart/mind that count, not the label.</p>

              <p>There are many Buddhist temples conducting Di Zi Gui lessons for young children. So, who says it cannot be an entry point to Buddhism. Don't you think Di Zi Gui is easier for the children than äº”ä¹˜å…±æ³• ,  ä¸‰ä¹˜å…±æ³• , å¤§ä¹˜ä¸�å…±æ³•.</p>

              <p><strong>Dawnligth you said:</strong> I have no comments if Yi Kwan Dao stands on its own and did not claim their link to Buddhism, but that is not the case. They went round telling people that Amitabha's era is over, now it is another era which is what they are promoting. This is not true, there are many Buddhists who experienced the existence of Amitabha. Spreading the false dharma is a serious matter as it will æ–­ä¼—ç”Ÿçš„æ³•èº«æ…§å‘½ã€‚</p>
              <p>I have no comments for other religion which threaten their followers as long as they don't claim their linkage to Buddhism. That is why I choose Buddhism which does not threaten its followers. What is there to threaten if the religion is the truth. So, to me Buddhism is the truth.</p>
              <p>I have listened to MJK's talk but I did not hear what you mentioned that he said God has many faces. But anyway, he did say the only way to Pureland is to recite Amitabha's name which he is promoting unless you tell me MJK advise people to recite Tai Shan Lao Jun's name to go Pureland. If he did, I will agree that it is not right.<br><br><strong>Dawnlight,</strong> Yi kwan Tao claims <strong>Sakyamuni Buddha's</strong> era is over not amitabha buddha's era. Simialrly, Ven CK says now Buddhism is no longer enough to save and uplift the moral standards of Human and he further says in this era, only Taoism and Confucianism can uplift human standards now. issn't such a proclaimation æ–­ä¼—ç”Ÿçš„æ³•èº«æ…§å‘½? <br><br>Since you have no comments on other religons who threatens their followers why did you object to Yi Kwan Tao so fervently? <br><br>I will source for all these of Ven CKs teachings out for you to research and please don't say I æ–­ç« å�–ä¹‰, you should read it and verify for yourself. <br><br>Ven Ck says He can recite on the bible and quran to go pureland. Yeah, he did say this explicitly. (Hold! people will start to argue, must understand the meaning not the word he say) sorry to say, the word was already wrong from the beginning to potray the correct meaning behind it.<br></p>

              <p>re-post:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">base on experience on Hua Yen Sutra/Buddha vehicle(Yi chan fa), and seeing people's reactions, i had notice the difference between [I]hinayana and mahayana [/I]not base on the apparent or what people had wrote or journalized, that said Theravada is Theravada/Arahathood and Mahayana is Mahayana/Bodhisattvahood. or Theravada is hinayana.<br><strong>actually. i think within Theravada, there's mahayana And hinayana. And within Mahayana, there's hinayana and mahayana.</strong> All in one, one in All. note i use cap for the 'm' and 'M'.<br>So what's the differences? i think....<br>hinayana cultivator - emphasis on the apparent meaning of what Buddha said; emphasis on sunyata of self; clear distinction between Buddhism from worldly dharma; prefer to meditate base on stillness of body; avoid polutions best as possible.<br>mahayana cultivator - emphasis more on the significant than apparent; emphasis on sunyata of self And Dharma itself; able to blend/use worldly dharma to convert into Buddhadharma; "tong zhong xiu" able meditate amidst daily activities. ie they after cultivated bodily stillness in the mountain, they re-enter 'polutions' of urban area to enhance their meditative stillness. such standard of stillness of the mind powerful.<br><br>so sometime i fall into the hinayana category and sometimes in mahayana category. but look forward to practice like mahayana standard, while hinayana is my foundation. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></span><br><br>ps: why i rather use the word 'hinayana' is because so that we can differ within Mahayana. so it's not directly refering to Theravada.<br></p>

So you want to tell me i am attached to Dharma now? <br><br>If you cannot discuss healthiy and I will start using your zen koan way to rely you and in the end it leads to no where<br><br><br>to beginn with: I spank you 3000 times and ask you to eat dog shit. Dogs have Buddha nature but sinweiy u have no buddha nature.  ZEN KOAN way of answering copying you. <br><br>See where this kind of discussions leads to, it leads to nowhere? You say somewhere I hit you 300 times you say nowhere I hit you 3000 times, you say only don;t know mind, i also hit you 30000 times, you keep silent I hit you 300000 times, you give a smile i ask you to bang the wall, you dont bang the wall, I say you got no buddha nature and you bang the wall i say u got no buddha nature. <br><br><br><br>Sinweiy, advise for you. don't use zen koasn for discussions, its more meant for realizations, esp for purelander buddhists, we should hold dearly to the name and vow power of amitabha Buddha alone.</p></div>

              <p>There are many Buddhist temples conducting Di Zi Gui lessons for
              young children. So, who says it cannot be an entry point to
              Buddhism. Don't you think Di Zi Gui is easier for the children than
              äº”ä¹˜å…±æ³• ,  ä¸‰ä¹˜å…±æ³• , å¤§ä¹˜ä¸�å…±æ³•.</p>
              <p>Be honest with yourself, can you practise according
              to Di Zi Gui. Let me be honest with you, I can't. MCK is only
              saying as a stepping stone. What is wrong with that ?</p>

              <p>Basic elementary Buddhist textbooks are easier than Di Zi Gui.</p>
              <p>Its a wrong stepping stone. Buddhism has got elementary reading material, much simpler than Di Zi Gui. Start from there then. Why he advocate Di Zi Gui instead? Isn't it clear he is bias against Buddhism cant do the job of covering the entry and foundation of Buddhism?</p>
