              <p>Here's my reply over there, to the thread starter:</p>
              <p>"BuddhaDharma is all complete he said. But he put it as university 
                      level. Confucianism as primary school level, Daoism secondary school 
                      level.</p>
              <p>Is BuddhaDharma that difficult to grasp? If it is so difficult to
                       grasp, what are those elementary Buddhist textbook for? For who? There 
                      are elementary buddhist text books for children, intermediate buddhist 
                      textbooks for young adult and so forth. Accoring to Ven Hsuan Hua logic,
                       all the buddhist textbooks are for advance level. For the adults."</p>
              <p>"One question pops into my mind. Did he practice what he preaches
                                          here in this dharma talk? His zendo é�“åœº, did he ask his disciples to
                                          go study Confucianism first, and then Daoism second, then Buddhism?
                                          I dun think so. Correct me if I am wrong, the City of Ten Thousand
                                          Buddha, their study program for their young monks, did it start from
                                          Confucianism?"</p>

              <h1>The Quest</h1>
              <p>The quest for enlightenment is the quest for truth or reality. It’s not a quest for ideas about truth—that’s philosophy. And it’s not a quest to realize your fantasies about truth—that’s fundamentalized religion. It’s a quest for truth on truth’s terms. It’s a quest for the underlying principle of life, the unifying element of existence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your quiet moments of honesty, you know that you are not who you present yourself as, or who you pretend to be. Although you have changed identities many times, and changed them even in the course of a single day, none of them fit for long. They are all in a process of constant decay. One moment you’re a loving person, the next an angry one. One day you’re an indulgent, worldly person; the next a pure, spiritual lover of God. One moment you love your image of yourself, and the next you loathe it. On it goes, identified with one self-image after another, each as separate and false as the last.</p>

              <p><strong>wiser said:</strong> hahahah...weeshun you are truly what Buddha describe about.  Ignorant .  You are ignorant about other faith's wisdom.  Is Buddha born in the same country and same era with Laozi, Jesus, Confucius ? So how you expect Buddha to mention their names? Are you using your brain to think correctly?</p>
              <p>Please stop quoting Buddha's words to attack others. You do not understand the true wisdom of Buddha.</p>
              <p>And one of the Holy dharma of Buddha is chakra and kundalini .  You didn't realise it. So you are as ignorant as the others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>wiser: </strong>The Buddha was borned in India, no qualms about that right ? Different era from Laozi, Confucious and Jesus.  Since the Buddha has never taught about them, Who are we to add them on to Buddhism? Based on what?<br><br>Also I am sad to tell you again that I have never attempted to degrade Taoism or another other religion, as a Buddhist, we do not see the need to bash another religion for the propagation of Buddhism. I repeat again, as a Buddhist we should wholey rely on the Buddha's teachings alone as our basic foundational entry all the way to final liberation. Just like myself a purelander as well as what master CK said, NAMO AMIUTUOFO alone and not recite mixing names of other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in, just wholeheartly recite Namo Amituofo is suffice. <br><br>Similarly, Buddhism alone is enough for Buddhists becos the Buddha's teachings encompass all. UNLESS you want to pass me a message is that the wisdom of Taoism, Confucianism, islam and Christianity are absent and cannot be found in Buddhism as that we Buddhist have to resort to using their texts to preach as foundation entry to our Buddhists. <br><br>Ignorant or not is not a matter of your judgement, its a process from darkness to brightness wisdom. <br><br>Namo Amituofo</p>

I questioned you many times, does the Buddha has no teachings regarding the foundtional entry to Buddhism as that we have to resort to using non buddhist texts to be built as a Buddhist entry? This is why i quoted you the Wu Cheng Gong Fa, this is the MOST foundational entry to Buddhism and to further, the standard of Karma and reward system as recorded in Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian is not in accord with the Buddha's teaching, the Buddha had already taught the Dharma and paved the way for us, all we need to do is to honestly and sincerely follow the Buddha's path and not try to seek more paths outside Buddhism. <br><br>We do not need to go back to India, all we need to do is to follow what the Buddha has left for us not what Laozi, Confucious, Jesus or Mohd has left. Just as I quoted you "He who sees the dharma sees me and he who sees me sees the dharma" Thus said 3.91, Buddhism is nothing "cheem" all you need to do now is just clearly follow the teachings the Buddha had left for us and we will be able to see him just as we see ourseleves when we practise his teachings. <br><br>Namo Amituofo</p>

              <p> <br><strong>Wiser:</strong> Yes, according to the Pureland Sutras and the Vow that Amitabha Buddha made, soley calling and meditation upon the name of <strong>Namo Amituofo</strong> is enough to be reborned in Pureland.  This is not my personal opinon, it is taught in the Pureland Sutras as well as all Pureland Masters. <br><br>I have to also agree that there are many Buddhists who might have more karmic affinity with other Buddhas and Bodhisatvas thus reciting and meditating upon their names, its perfectly fine and healthy to do that, Nothing wrong at all. If they have a special karmic affinity with so and so Buddha and Bodhisattva, by all means recite their names and practise their Dharma door, this is still under the umbrella shield of the Buddha's teachings. I respect other dharma methods which the Buddha taught even when I find Pureland Buddhism the most suitable for me. This is also the reason why as I Pureland Buddhist, I print not only Pureland Sutras for free distribution, I print Hua Yen Sutras, Suragama Sutras, Prajna Sutras etc as well. As long they are teachings of our Buddha Sakyamuni, we should all accept and propagate it and not teachings not taught by the Buddha.<br><br><br><strong>p/s:</strong> Guan Yin Pusa or Avalokitesvra Bodhisattva should not be called a Goddess, incase readers gets confused.</p>
