              <p>weychin, Waterloo Guan Yin Temple has never considered itself
                      Buddhism, it has always declared itself to be under the Xian Tian
                      Dao lineage and Xian Tian Dao has a history of embracing all three
                      religions as the core of their religions. They have another sister
                      temple at Joo Jiat.<br> <br> But when Buddhist temple starts teaching and distributing and even
                      preaching non buddhist teachings to Buddhists, problems arises. The
                      Buddhist temple is responsible for propagating the teachings of the
                      Buddha and not taoism, as Buddhists we build our foundation and
                      grow on the path the Buddha had lead and taught to us not Laozi or
                      Jesus path.</p>

              <p>Exactly, but when preaching to who are generally go to temples to "pai pai" or eat vegetarian food during 1st and 15th of the lunar month, these people are "wai tao", these are just preliminary introduction to Buddhism relative to contemporary faith.</p>
              <p>Before becoming a Buddhist, everybody not born in a Buddhist world, Buddhist continent, Buddhist country, Buddhist community, Buddhist family and Buddhist practices, everybody is practically "wai dao', why? Because, only then can a Buddhist can truly be Buddhist.</p>
              <p>As you practise bit by bit, day by day, etc., you become a little less ignorant.  If people are wai dao to begin, should engage them in a way that they can relate. You see people be enlighten in this life, you do not see the accumulated efforts of previous life time.

For instance, up to the time when I escaped from mainland China in the1940s, itinerant Buddhist monks could seek lodging in Taoist temples, and itinerant Taoist clerics could pass the night in Buddhist monasteries -they respected one another's faith and method of spiritual practice. Chinese maintain that "all paths lead to the same destination." So any religious practitioner who does not go against the basic moral principles of love, peace, and the pursuit of true happiness is worthy of approval regardless of his method of practice. Hence the Chinese saying that "Buddhist monks and Taoist clerics all belong to the same family." <br>China has a plurality of ethnic groups and a great diversity of religions.

They have manifested themselves in these various personas only to adapt to different cultures and living environments, so that they may use the most appropriate means to deliver sentient beings. Hence in the 12th century, the Confucian scholar Lu Jiuyuan (1139-1193), influenced by Buddhism, said that "When a sage appears in the East, he has the same mind and realizes the same principle; when a sage appears in the West, he has the same mind and realizes the same principle." This means that all prophets, from whatever geographical area and of whatever religion, have more or less the same love and realize roughly the same truth. </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Book Antiqua'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Buddhism has been in China now for 2,000 years. When it was first introduced to China, it tried to adapt to indigenous Chinese culture as much as possible, even using Taoist and Confucian terminology and concepts to explain parts of its doctrines. This then contributed to the arising of Buddhist schools with distinctly Chinese characteristics such as the Tiantai, Huayan, Pure Land, and Chan schools. In other words, Buddhism in China first learned and absorbed elements from traditional Chinese culture, then evolved into new schools distinct from Indian Buddhist schools. Even traditional Chinese Confucians learned and incorporated Buddhist thought, which resulted in the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties. Chinese Taoists, in a similar manner, transformed and incorporated many Buddhist scriptures into the Taoist Canon, thereby enriching Taoist culture. In China, Buddhist monks from the generation before mine were required to be well versed in not only the Buddhist Canon, but also Confucian and Taoist thought; otherwise, it would have been difficult for them to propagate Buddhist teachings. In our age, we should open our minds even more, and learn about the various world religions, so as not to find ourselves in self-imposed isolation with narrow horizons, like a frog gazing up at the sky from the bottom of a well. <br>If we turn back to discuss Indian religions, we can see that they, too, have contributed to one another's growth through mutual influence and stimulation. In fact, much of the content of Buddhism was incorporated from ancient Indian religions. In the Buddha's time, different religious sects and schools filled India, some ancient, and some newly-established. Siddhartha Gautama himself humbly learned from many teachers of various spiritual schools. After becoming a Buddha, though he developed distinctly Buddhist views, and discarded many religious views and beliefs not in conformity with Buddhism, Buddhism is still a product of Indian religious culture. Hence, in turn, in the 8th century the great Hindu philosopher Shankara (700-750) consulted Buddhist Madhyamika philosophy and thereby created Vedantic philosophy. <br></strong></span></p>

When it was first introduced to China, it tried to adapt to indigenous Chinese culture as much as possible, even using Taoist and Confucian terminology and concepts to explain parts of its doctrines. This then contributed to the arising of Buddhist schools with distinctly Chinese characteristics such as the Tiantai, Huayan, Pure Land, and Chan schools. In other words, Buddhism in China first learned and absorbed elements from traditional Chinese culture, then evolved into new schools distinct from Indian Buddhist schools. Even traditional Chinese Confucians learned and incorporated Buddhist thought, which resulted in the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties. Chinese Taoists, in a similar manner, transformed and incorporated many Buddhist scriptures into the Taoist Canon, thereby enriching Taoist culture. In China, Buddhist monks from the generation before mine were required to be well versed in not only the Buddhist Canon, but also Confucian and Taoist thought; otherwise, it would have been difficult for them to propagate Buddhist teachings.  </strong></span></p>

              <p><br>as mentioned, the simple reason, is because many household buddhists nowaday  (like me) do not have much time to read the vast hinayana (foundation) sutras, due to working and all. Confucianism and Daoism helped by consolidated it to something more summarised and most of all, more effective.</p>
              <p>He advocate it to all people that have respect in a teacher. if not, if he see u no respect, he won't say.</p>
              <p>and also he's sharing and recording his learning process. the people listen can pick which ever useful to their daily life. to me, i also don't follow all everything. as some are talking to christian, or Confucianism and Daoism, telling them to learn their own teachings well and be a good person. Same like Dalai Lama is doing now. He's not converting people.  </p>

                      been in China now for 2,000 years. When it was first introduced to
                      China, it tried to adapt to indigenous Chinese culture as much as
                      possible, even using Taoist and Confucian terminology and concepts
                      to explain parts of its doctrines. This then contributed to the
                      arising of Buddhist schools with distinctly Chinese characteristics
                      such as the Tiantai, Huayan, Pure Land, and Chan schools. In other
                      words, Buddhism in China first learned and absorbed elements from
                      traditional Chinese culture, then evolved into new schools distinct
                      from Indian Buddhist schools. Even traditional Chinese Confucians
                      learned and incorporated Buddhist thought, which resulted in the
                      rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties. Chinese
                      Taoists, in a similar manner, transformed and incorporated many
                      Buddhist scriptures into the Taoist Canon, thereby enriching Taoist
                      culture. In China, Buddhist monks from the generation before mine
                      were required to be well versed in not only the Buddhist Canon, but
                      also Confucian and Taoist thought; otherwise, it would have been
                      difficult for them to propagate Buddhist teachings.

              <p>Firstly, Ven Shen Yan, he was referring to the Chinese Buddhist monks, generation before him.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the statement u shown, it doesn't support Ven JK teachings. Why? There's a difference for senior monks, who have good grasp on Buddhism, go read on Confucianism and Daoism in order to reach out to more people, and Ven JK advocacy of Confucianism and Daoism as entry and foundation to Buddhism.There's a great difference. Think about it.</p>

              <p>I have no comments if Yi Kwan Dao stands on its own and did not claim their link to Buddhism, but that is not the case. They went round telling people that Amitabha's era is over, now it is another era which is what they are promoting. This is not true, there are many Buddhists who experienced the existence of Amitabha. Spreading the false dharma is a serious matter as it will æ–­ä¼—ç”Ÿçš„æ³•èº«æ…§å‘½ã€‚</p>
              <p>I have no comments for other religion which threaten their followers as long as they don't claim their linkage to Buddhism. That is why I choose Buddhism which does not threaten its followers. What is there to threaten if the religion is the truth. So, to me Buddhism is the truth.</p>
              <p>I have listened to MJK's talk but I did not hear what you mentioned that he said God has many faces. But anyway, he did say the only way to Pureland is to recite Amitabha's name which he is promoting unless you tell me MJK advise people to recite Tai Shan Lao Jun's name to go Pureland. If he did, I will agree that it is not right.</p>
