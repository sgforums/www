            <div class='col-md body'>Unfulfilled things are never ending in life... I also have thoughts of wishing to 'clear off stuff' but would quickly remind myself that we should never expect that we can finally 'clear off' stuff for practicing -- of course we can make retirement plans, but life is impermanent, what if we pass away before that?<br><br>What is important is we grasp the opportunity NOW... like my dharma teacher say, convert vow/resolution into strength, and start practicing it now... Bodhisattva practitioner cultivates in the midst of activities, in fact, the Bodhisattva cannot find Enlightenment apart from realizing it within activities.. as my teacher said, no Enlightenment apart from activities. And she always stress that we Act FOR cultivation, the purpose of acting, serving, doing, is to Cultivate. This is how important it is.</div>

Click play to listen.<br><br><a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/astin6" rel="nofollow">http://cdbaby.com/cd/astin6</a><br><br>A note from the artist:<br><br><strong>Â“Already ShiningÂ” points the listener back to the simple light of awareness that is taking in this moment right now. This is a light like no other, a light that is self-luminous, self-sustaining, and effortlessly present. It is the light of knowing that makes everything visible and yet itself can never be seen. There is no practice we can engage in that will keep the lamp of awareness lit, no technique we can employ to keep this light from going out, for there is no existence, no mind, or self apart from it. The self and awarenessÂ—they are one and the same thing. There is nothing that needs to be done to make awareness shine. It is already shining. This is your nature. It is what you have always beenÂ…</strong><br><br>-------------<br><br>His signature song (my favourite), 'Love, Serve &amp; Remember': <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/astin1" rel="nofollow">http://cdbaby.com/cd/astin1</a><br><br>When Ram Dass asked his teacher Maharaji how he'd be able to carry on in his spiritual work once he'd returned to the U.S. and was no longer in his physical company, Maharaji said, "It is very simple. Just love everyone, serve everyone, and remember God." Love, serve, and remember...the simplicity and profound message contained in these three words served as the inspiration behind the song of the same name that appears on this recording "Remembrance." May this song and the other titles on this album inspire you to remember the truth of who you are and to love and serve this world from that place of remembrance.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>His albums:<br><br>Remembrance<br>Reflections<br>Voice of the Mystics<br>Clear Blue Mind<br>Now is the Time<br>Already Shining</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I quoted this somewhere in this forum before:<br><br>What appears is at the same time disappearing, the arising and the passing away, a single movement, without beginning or end. This is the preciousness of life, this amazing constellation of feelings, thoughts, sensations, and the mystery of wakefulness that illuminates them all, here and then gone in a flash.<br><br>And the extraordinary paradox is that this which is ever changing is, at the same time, changeless. A bird, a tear, a star- all the movement of a single life, one ocean dancing as a thousand different waves and yet always remaining itself.<br><br>~ John Astin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wonderful poetry on Non-Duality by John Astin: <a href="http://www.integrativearts.com/writings.html#" rel="nofollow">http://www.integrativearts.com/writings.html#</a><br><br><strong>Pathless Path</strong><br><br>The path to God, the path to ultimate reality is as Krishnamurti said, a "pathless path." In the end, there is no path to the ultimate because there is only the ultimate. Everything is made of That, the source and suchness of all things - every tree, every person, every flower, every atom, every star - all of them made of the same ineffable mystery, the wetness in every wave...<br><br>We may imagine that we are on a journey back to God, but how can there be a journey to something that is everywhere and everything? We walk to our temples and mosques, our churches and synagogues, our yoga centers and meditation cushions, to find God, to find Truth, but what is sought is already present, present before the first step is ever taken, and present as that very step. What is sought is here before the first thought ever arises to seek It, and It is here as that very thought. Truth is present, before the mind ever imagines it has been lost. But Truth is also the imagining, God seeking God...<br><br>We seek God but there is no escaping God for there is only God, only Spirit dancing as everything that is seen, everything that is touched, everything that is felt. We search for something else that will make us happy, some other experience or moment, but the happiness and freedom we seek is already here as this - this experience, this state of mind, this moment. Every breath, every sensation, the clarity, the confusion, the seeking, and the end of seeking, all of them God, all of them the Truth, all of them, enough.<br><br>Â©2007 John Astin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gateless Gate</strong><br><br>Because of the tendency to be identified with the content of consciousness, it can be very liberating to realize that consciousness is and always has been free from (not identified with) that which appears within it. But in actuality, there really isn't awareness with objects appearing in it. There is only awareness, only Life appearing as everything. And as this understanding deepens, it is seen that no experience is the truth and every experience is the Truth, for there is only Truth. So, no experience need be resisted.<br><br>After all, what need could there be to become free from appearances when the appearances themselves are freedom? When what appears is simply met - not by the "me" but by the awake space in which everything arises - whatever appears is realized to be just another movement of awakeness, another expression of Life. Then, every experience becomes a doorway, even though there really is no doorway, for we are always and already beyond the gateless gate.<br><br>Â©2006 John Astin</div>
