              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>One of the major religions in Japan is Buddhism, a religion that differs
              quite a bit from what most of us in the Western World believe. While they don’t
              exactly worship a god, there is one figure who Buddhists look up to for
              “enlightenment”, and that is Gautama Buddha. Gautama Buddha, who is most
              frequently referred to as just simply “Buddha”, has a presence in most Buddhist
              temples in the form of a statue. Most of these statues, however, are extremely
              old and valuable, and as with anything of value, theft tends to occur. In fact,
              between 2007 and 2009 there had been 105 reported thefts of statues in Japan,
              most of these occurring in sparsely populated, low population areas of the
              country. This has led various groups around Japan to begin using 3D printing
              technology in order to create replicas of their Buddhist statues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>One example was a group of students from the Prefectural Wakayama
              Technical High School, who used 3D scanners to create a virtual copy an Aizen
              Myoo statue which measured 51cm in height. It took 6 months for them to
              complete the model, before they set out to make a 3D printed replica of it.
              This has allowed the original to be moved into a secure location while the
              copy, which is made of plastic, has replaced the original in the temple. This
              removes the fears of theft, as the original is now in a very safe place. At the
              same time, the museum also has a 3D printed copy on display so that the
              visually impaired can touch and feel the statue. Previously this was not
              possible, as the original had been enshrined in glass, meaning no one was able
              to lay their hands on it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>The students at the Wakayama Technical High School have been encouraging
              other temples around Japan to do the same as they did, and virtually create
              “backups” of their valuable Buddhist statues. Many temples have begun taking
              this advice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>In Jiangjin City, which is located in Shimane, Japan, a large 90cm tall
              statue of Amitabha Tathagata has stood for years. The statue is sculpted in
              accordance with the Kamakura period. The abbot of the temple was concerned
              about possible theft, so he took the valuable statue to a nearby museum, and
              after learning about 3D printing technology, he elected to also have a copy
              made of the original.</span></p>

              (Buddha),” said the temple’s abbot. “With this 3D printed replica, as long as
              it is enshrined in the temple, people can feel at ease.”</span></em></p>

              without the worry that someone will end up stealing something extremely
              valuable to their temple and their religion in general.<em></em></span></p>

              around the world begin following this model put forth by these students and
              this abbot in Japan. What do you think? Is this the solution to protecting
              cultural and religious heritage?</span></p>
