              <p>Its not being mean or cruel, its good for the person so that
                  won't create more bad karma for themself. No point keep criticising
                  clone when they don't seem to want to change, after being given
                  many chances, and always saying sorry in the end but still do it

              <p>The only way to help this person might be just to permanently

              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Legend says that the name of Mencius' mother was Chang-shih and that she changed her residence three times on account of her concern for Mencius. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The traditional Chinese four-character idiom (å­Ÿæ¯�ä¸‰è¿�) refers to the legend that Mencius' mother moved their house three times - from beside a cemetery to beside a marketplace (other versions of the story said the move was to a house beside an abattoir), to finally beside a school - before finding a location that she felt was suitable for his upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of a proper environment for the proper upbringing of children.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">At first they lived near a cemetery, and the young Mencius amused himself with acting the various scenes which he witnessed at the tombs. "This", said his mother, " is no place for my son;"—and she moved to a house in the market-place. But the change was no improvement. The boy took to playing the part of a salesman, boasting about his wares, and exchanging light chaff and banter with customers. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">His mother sought a new house, and found one at last close by a public school. There her child's attention was caught by the various exercises in correct manners by which the scholars were taught, and he endeavored to imitate them. The mother was satisfied. "This," she said, "is the proper place for my son." </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Another story of this period tells of a pig-butcher's shop near their house. One day Mencius asked his mother what they were killing the pigs for, and was told that it was to feed him. Her conscience immediately reproved her for the answer for she had not been able to afford pork. She said to herself, "While I was carrying this boy in my womb, I would not sit down if the mat was not placed square, and I ate no meat which was not cut properly—thus I taught him before he was born. And now when his intelligence is opening, I am deceiving him: this is to teach him untruthfulness!" With this she went and bought a piece of pork in order to validate her words. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">When Mencius returned home one day from school, his mother looked up from the web which she was weaving, and asked him how had got on. He answered her idly that he was doing well enough.  On this, she took a knife and cut through the thread of her shuttle. The idler was alarmed, and asked what she meant. She gave him a long lecture, showing that she had done what he was doing—that her cutting through her thread was like his neglecting his learning. The admonition, it is said, had its proper effect; the lecture did not need to be repeated. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">There are two other narratives concerning Chang-shih later in Mencius's life. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">His wife was squatting down one day in her own room, when Mencius went in. He was so much offended at finding her in that position, that he told his mother, and expressed his intention to put her away, because of "her want of propriety." </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"It is you who have no propriety," said his mother, "and not your wife. Do not The Rules of Propriety say, "When you are about to ascend a hall, raise your voice; when you enter a door, keep your eyes low?" The reason for the rules is that people may not be taken unprepared. But you entered the door of your private apartment without raising your voice, and so caused your wife to be caught squatting on the ground. The impropriety is with you and not with her." On this Mencius rebuked himself, and did not put away his wife. </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">One day, when he was living with his mother in Ch'i, she was struck with the sorrowfulness of his aspect as he stood leaning against a pillar, and asked him the cause of it. He replied, "I have heard that the superior man occupies the place for which he is adapted, accepting no reward to which he does not feel entitled, and not covetous of honor and emolument. Now my doctrines are not practiced in Ch'i—I wish to leave it, but I think of your old age, and am anxious."</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">His mother said, "It does not belong to a woman to determine anything of herself, but she is subject to the rule of the three obediences. When young, she has to obey her parents; when married, she has to obey her husband; when a widow, she has to obey her son. You are a man in your full maturity, and I am old. Act as your understanding of righteousness tells you, and I will act according to the rule that applies to me. Why should you be anxious about me?"     </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Legge concludes "Such are the accounts which I have found of the mother of Mencius. Possibly some of them are inventions, but they are devoutly believed by the people of China—and it must be to their profit. We may well believe that she was a woman of very superior character, and that her son's subsequent distinction was in a great decree owing to her influence and training".  </p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0.5em; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>

              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">Legend says that the name of Mencius' mother was Chang-shih and that she changed her residence three times on account of her concern for Mencius. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">The traditional Chinese four-character idiom (å­Ÿæ¯�ä¸‰è¿�) refers to the legend that Mencius' mother moved their house three times - from beside a cemetery to beside a marketplace (other versions of the story said the move was to a house beside an abattoir), to finally beside a school - before finding a location that she felt was suitable for his upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of a proper environment for the proper upbringing of children.</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">At first they lived near a cemetery, and the young Mencius amused himself with acting the various scenes which he witnessed at the tombs. "This", said his mother, " is no place for my son;"—and she moved to a house in the market-place. But the change was no improvement. The boy took to playing the part of a salesman, boasting about his wares, and exchanging light chaff and banter with customers. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">His mother sought a new house, and found one at last close by a public school. There her child's attention was caught by the various exercises in correct manners by which the scholars were taught, and he endeavored to imitate them. The mother was satisfied. "This," she said, "is the proper place for my son." </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">Another story of this period tells of a pig-butcher's shop near their house. One day Mencius asked his mother what they were killing the pigs for, and was told that it was to feed him. Her conscience immediately reproved her for the answer for she had not been able to afford pork. She said to herself, "While I was carrying this boy in my womb, I would not sit down if the mat was not placed square, and I ate no meat which was not cut properly—thus I taught him before he was born. And now when his intelligence is opening, I am deceiving him: this is to teach him untruthfulness!" With this she went and bought a piece of pork in order to validate her words. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">When Mencius returned home one day from school, his mother looked up from the web which she was weaving, and asked him how had got on. He answered her idly that he was doing well enough.  On this, she took a knife and cut through the thread of her shuttle. The idler was alarmed, and asked what she meant. She gave him a long lecture, showing that she had done what he was doing—that her cutting through her thread was like his neglecting his learning. The admonition, it is said, had its proper effect; the lecture did not need to be repeated. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">There are two other narratives concerning Chang-shih later in Mencius's life. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">His wife was squatting down one day in her own room, when Mencius went in. He was so much offended at finding her in that position, that he told his mother, and expressed his intention to put her away, because of "her want of propriety." </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">"It is you who have no propriety," said his mother, "and not your wife. Do not The Rules of Propriety say, "When you are about to ascend a hall, raise your voice; when you enter a door, keep your eyes low?" The reason for the rules is that people may not be taken unprepared. But you entered the door of your private apartment without raising your voice, and so caused your wife to be caught squatting on the ground. The impropriety is with you and not with her." On this Mencius rebuked himself, and did not put away his wife. </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">One day, when he was living with his mother in Ch'i, she was struck with the sorrowfulness of his aspect as he stood leaning against a pillar, and asked him the cause of it. He replied, "I have heard that the superior man occupies the place for which he is adapted, accepting no reward to which he does not feel entitled, and not covetous of honor and emolument. Now my doctrines are not practiced in Ch'i—I wish to leave it, but I think of your old age, and am anxious."</p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">His mother said, "It does not belong to a woman to determine anything of herself, but she is subject to the rule of the three obediences. When young, she has to obey her parents; when married, she has to obey her husband; when a widow, she has to obey her son. You are a man in your full maturity, and I am old. Act as your understanding of righteousness tells you, and I will act according to the rule that applies to me. Why should you be anxious about me?"     </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;">Legge concludes "Such are the accounts which I have found of the mother of Mencius. Possibly some of them are inventions, but they are devoutly believed by the people of China—and it must be to their profit. We may well believe that she was a woman of very superior character, and that her son's subsequent distinction was in a great decree owing to her influence and training". </p>

              <p>Hi Dawn</p>
              <p>I am afraid this picture is really a urban legend due to the obvious stroke of artiste work. It does not in anyway prove the existence of dragon but more of a beautiful work of an artiste.</p>
              <p>I think the Buddhist scripture always mentioned of dragon presence whenever Buddha is conducting a preaching. In fact, dragon is consider to consider as a minor deity which is capable of producing rain and guardian of Buddhism when they embrace Buddha teaching. Otherwise, just like human they can be good or bad.</p>
              <p>In fact, there are account of accomplished Thai forest monks encountering their presence in the caves of Thailand. They can even take the form of human.</p>
              <p>According to some record, a dragon taking a form of beautiful lady used to attend Nichiren lotus sutra lectures. One day, when Nichiren approached her to enquire about her family whereabout since she always came alone. She replied that she was a ‘hiten’ {or ten-nyo}, a kind of celestial nymph, and that she dwelt in a pond at Mount Shichimen. She explained that it was her wish to repent her sins and take faith in the Dharma Flower Sutra; so that she might overcome all manner of sorrow and suffering.<br>However, Nichiren suspected that she was really a being he had met before. So he surreptitiously held up a shiny vase, to serve as a mirror. Her reflection on the surface revealed that she was actually a shichimen, a red dragon with seven {7} heads. Nichiren then asked her to return to her pond and serve as the Daimyojin, or guardian deity of Kuonji. Having been exposed and shamed, she humbly complied with the Shonin’s request.</p>
              <p>Hence, it seem like all over asia people have encounter with the naga who come in different form. Though we can see them, but we just need to respect them.</p>
