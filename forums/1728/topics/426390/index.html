              <p>Dragons in Thai art and literature are the most common mythical 
              creatures. Thailand Dragons mythology has a huge influence of Indian, 
              Chinese  and Japanese legends. 
                <br> Buddhism is a dominated religion in Thailand - over 94% of Thais are
               Buddhists. Theravada school of Buddhism determined concepts and legends
               reflected in Thai Dragons. 
              At the same time Thailand shares cultural and historical heritage 
              with Laos and Cambodia, that makes Thailand Dragons quite unique.</p>

              <p>The "dragons" are real, not just an imaginary creature. I want to 
              be clear about this.</p>
              <p>The name "dragon" is a translation of Draco. I prefer to call them Draco, but for this topic, I will just call them dragons.</p>
              <p>The dragons are very intelligent beings who came from Alpha Draconis star system to Earth<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> millions of years ago
               and they are still on Earth now</span>. Althought their numbers on Earth are less 
              than 3000, their "impact" to Earth and its population has been very 
              "problematic".</p>
              <p>Their appearance in their native form are serpent-like, smiliar to these pictures-&gt; <a href="http://www.draconian.com/dragons/chinese-dragon.php">http://www.draconian.com/dragons/chinese-dragon.php</a></p>
              <p>In their lizard-like humaniods form, they are known as the 
              Reptilians... If you want to know how Reptilians look like, just do a 
              search in youtube.</p>
              <p>I am not sure why Buddhists still worship/pray to dragons/nagas... perhaps someone in this forum can tell me.</p>
              <p>My advice is to 
              stay well away from them (dragons/nagas). And if you somehow, did manage to meet one of 
              them, do your best not to fear them...</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say this, some of these dragons do not have our(human) 
              interest at heart. If you know exactly what the dragons have been doing
               on Earth, you may be totally shocked.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>is it written by you or you copy from other source? nicely written but I think you have miss the most important point- <strong>Respect</strong></p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><em>I am sorry to say this, some of these dragons do not have our(human) interest at heart. If you know exactly what the dragons have been doing on Earth, you may be totally shocked.</em></p>
              <p><em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em></p>
              <p>Reading from this statement, I think that it is rather religio-centric to say that. Some hidden christian meanings to me. Don't look at things from your perspective. Look at the bigger picture.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you say dragons don't exist, what can they do to us...?</p>
              <p>Allow me to drag abit...</p>
              <p>I have been to Hindu temple more than once. I even eat the food there. Unlike the stereotype that indian food are spicy, it taste sweet in fact. I was admiring the arts and cultures. If I were to tell my indian friend that:" <em>Hey! Your god does not lead you out of samsara. Come join me and learn buddhism."</em></p>
              <p>I tell you, things become <em>dai ji tua tiao. </em>I don't think I can survive out of the Hindu temple... Basic respect gone instead of appreciating the difference of cultures</p>
              <p>Last week, I went sao mu (cleaning graves-Qing Ming) with my relatives. As my late grandma's tomb has a Earth Deity (tu di gong) beside, we must first offer our respect to this deva first before respecting my late grandma. As I am a buddhist, I still offered my joss sticks. Because of respect. Respect for him of taking care of my grandma. And does not expects returns. You can choose not to believe these unseen heavenly beings. But respect is most important. If I only stubbornly only want to pray to Di Zang Bodhisattva instead of Earth Deity, what will happened...? Conflicts with my relatives!</p>
              <p>It's silly don't you think...? It starts to èµ·çƒ¦æ�¼. Creating unwanted troubles.</p>
              <p>I regret to write the thread of Guanyin Bodhisattva. I just wanted the thread to serve as a reminder to people to have a day of vegetarian meals or maybe buy flowers to offer to Guanyin Bodhisattva... that's all... end up the thread is attracting unwanted attention. I really regret it.</p>

              <p><br>Christians are brainwashed to accept that all other religions are false only worshipping and accepting their god is true and the only true one.     Other than God every other things are worldly and satanic.    They are taught that they are in the world but not of the world.  That is why we encounter some head swelling christians.    Ironically, God also teaches humility .</p>

              <p>The "dragons" are real, not just an imaginary creature. I want to be clear about this.</p>
              <p>The name "dragon" is a translation of Draco. I prefer to call them Draco, but for this topic, I will just call them dragons.</p>
              <p>The dragons are very intelligent beings who came from Alpha Draconis star system to Earth <span style="text-decoration: underline;">millions of years ago and they are still on Earth now</span>. Althought their numbers on Earth are less than 3000, their "impact" to Earth and its population has been very "problematic".</p>
              <p>Their appearance in their native form are serpent-like, smiliar to these pictures-&gt; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.draconian.com/dragons/chinese-dragon.php">http://www.draconian.com/dragons/chinese-dragon.php</a></p>
              <p>In their lizard-like humaniods form, they are known as the Reptilians... If you want to know how Reptilians look like, just do a search in youtube.</p>
              <p>I am not sure why Buddhists still worship/pray to dragons/nagas... perhaps someone in this forum can tell me.</p>
              <p>My advice is to stay well away from them (dragons/nagas). And if you somehow, did manage to meet one of them, do your best not to fear them...</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say this, some of these dragons do not have our(human) interest at heart. If you know exactly what the dragons have been doing on Earth, you may be totally shocked.</p>

              <p>Reading from this statement, I think that it is rather religio-centric to say that. Some hidden christian meanings to me. Don't look at things from your perspective. Look at the bigger picture.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you say dragons don't exist, what can they do to us...?</p>
              <p>Allow me to drag abit...</p>
              <p>I have been to Hindu temple more than once. I even eat the food there. Unlike the stereotype that indian food are spicy, it taste sweet in fact. I was admiring the arts and cultures. If I were to tell my indian friend that:" <em>Hey! Your god does not lead you out of samsara. Come join me and learn buddhism."</em></p>
              <p>I tell you, things become <em>dai ji tua tiao.</em> I don't think I can survive out of the Hindu temple... Basic respect gone instead of appreciating the difference of cultures</p>
              <p>Last week, I went sao mu (cleaning graves-Qing Ming) with my relatives. As my late grandma's tomb has a Earth Deity (tu di gong) beside, we must first offer our respect to this deva first before respecting my late grandma. As I am a buddhist, I still offered my joss sticks. Because of respect. Respect for him of taking care of my grandma. And does not expects returns. You can choose not to believe these unseen heavenly beings. But respect is most important. If I only stubbornly only want to pray to Di Zang Bodhisattva instead of Earth Deity, what will happened...? Conflicts with my relatives!</p>
              <p>It's silly don't you think...? It starts to èµ·çƒ¦æ�¼. Creating unwanted troubles.</p>
              <p>I regret to write the thread of Guanyin Bodhisattva. I just wanted the thread to serve as a reminder to people to have a day of vegetarian meals or maybe buy flowers to offer to Guanyin Bodhisattva... that's all... end up the thread is attracting unwanted attention. I really regret it.</p>

              <p>Ha ha... I think I'm the one who started all this because I put up my favourite Guan Yin Pusa picture. May be I should explain a bit about this picture. This was told by my neighbour who is an old auntie, she saw this picture when she came to my place.</p>
              <p>This picture was taken when someone on board a plane saw a big dark cloud. She found it strange and took a picture of it. After developing it, the picture showed Guan Yin Pusa. That is how the picture comes about. She said it could be the dragon  was trying to stir up a storm and Guan Yin Pusa was trying to tame it by stepping on it. I don't know the last sentence was added by her or it is true. She said the storm would have caused trouble to the plane if it was not stopped. However, the dragon in the picture do not look "bad" to me, it looked like a "good dragon".</p>

              <p>I do not like <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></strong> chinese religious beliefs.</p>
              <p>You see my neighbour praying to Tian Gong.</p>
              <p>I see also find It humorous.</p>
              <p>Christianity is not a religion for whites.</p>
              <p>God died for the sins of all mankind,not only for whites.</p>
              <p>Christianity is logical.</p>
              <p>We do sin everyday. This proves we have a sinful nature.</p>
              <p>That's why I do not believe in buddha nature.</p>
