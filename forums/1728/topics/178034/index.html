            <div class='col-md body'>i think it all starts from letting go. if theres no hatred, anger, fear, revenge, one will naturally won't want to fight back retaliate. if given a choice one has to go to war to fight under external circumstances(outside of yr inside) then protecting others putting others' lives above yours is already an act of letting go and showing unconditional compassion love not only to yr own family but also to other ppl.<br><br>if one who has no hatred, anger, revenge, fear, then why would one even wish or think of joining a force. there are many ways to contemplate this so nothing is a fixed answerscos when things happen naturally one will do/respond naturally and good karma or bad karma will also naturally be developed based on the actions done that time. if you think what u decide to do benefit yourself and others also then do it but killing is surely away from the buddhist practice. even a person wants to take yr life, that could be yr karma energy brought from previous life or time and let him take yr life cos u want to stop this cycle of revenge. but if yr family depends on you to support them and u can't die, thats also a karma that u have to face cos perhaps last time u might also have done this to someone before. so we have to act right here right now to practice the good wholesome deeds.<br><br>evrything comes unexpected, when face them u'll naturally know how to deal with them.</div>

Of course, with war ethics. We cannot be the aggressors. No where did Buddha disallowed it (with exception of monastic monks and nuns, of course) for defence... ask your NUS friend where he heard it from. Buddha taught that having a strong army is an an essential quality of a good ruler.<br><br>Pls read: <a href="http://www.beyondthenet.net/thedway/soldier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondthenet.net/thedway/soldier.htm</a><br><br>As to whether there will be karma involved in the killing? Yes. But we will have to do our duties to defend the nation, so we just maintain our Awareness and not harbour any resentment against the enemies. Like this we will have less karma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>killing is always never the solution. even sun-zi bing fa uses the wisdom of non-killing as 1 of the strategies as the ultimate victory so did buddha who just used his words to bring peace and stopped a warring situations. it all aint easy to said than done also. its important to learn the moral of the teachings and put suitably in our daily encounters and experiences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Killing is bad, hence wars brings a lot of destruction to land, properties, lives and the eco-system and even when the war is over, it will bring ill-will to those conquered or vanquished. look at the animosity of china or s korea over japan.<br><br>The ruler of the kingdom or head of state will bear the responsibility of starting  the war, they will have accumulated untold bad kamma as a result like after they die, they will go to avici hell for untold eons or kalpas.<br><br>Personally I feel that head of state shoud do their best to avoid wars, cos war bring untold sufferings to its people and the economy. But if another country is to wage war, no choice but to defend, but remember to treat POW's with humane treatment, not like torturing them for information or retribution , adhering to the Geneva conventions on war.<br><br>Buddha once stopped a war between the warring states, think was the shakyans over water on a river.  The Buddha stood at the scene of the battleground and as a result, the warring states gave respect to the Buddha by not going to war. The Buddha asked the respective sides, what was the value of water, they replied value of water is little. The Buddha then asked, what's the value of blood, they replied it was invaluable. Such was the wisdom of the Buddha, that he helped averted a war.<br><br>Hope the current and future leaders or head of state will adopt a commen sense approach and not go to war for oil, minerals, money or whatever you can think of.<br><br></div>

They retreated because nobody is willing to listen to dharma and practise virtues anymore. After the chaos is over, they return to society to teach people to become wholesome... and from there, lifespan increase until 84000 again.<br><br>Anyway my shi fu recommends people to be Bodhisattvas/practise as a bodhisattva in this world. Of course... to be noted: his teachings does differ somewhat from mainstream Pure Land. His teachings are 'neither zen nor pure land, both zen and pure land, practise both esoteric [doesnt mean tantric but the 'unspeakable'] and exoteric, cultivation and understanding corresponds.'<br><br>It is very good to aspire to be born in Amitabha PL, but he also says don't forget to return to Saha world as Bodhisattvas. Samsara is full of sufferings, we should have the compassion to help them. But if even now we can become Bodhisattvas, then all pure lands are within our reach. We can go to the infinite buddha lands ourselves.<br><br>But as for the Pure Land to be established during the time of Maitreya, it is not simply a matter of waiting for Maitreya Buddha to come to this world. He is teaching in Tushita Heaven right now because the devas have greater blessings than us. In the future, his celestial disciples will be reborn in this Earth and become his disciples. But there is also a need to purify the minds of this world now. We must do it now and create the 'yuan' for Maitreya Buddha to come. The sutra states that those who received Maitreya's teachings were those who have learnt and practised in Shakyamuni's era.<br><br><blockquote>The Sutra of Maitreya's Attaining Buddhahood<br><br>...Then, Maitreya Buddha praised Shakyamuni Buddha by saying, "Excellent! Excellent! He was able to teach billions of evil sentient beings how to cultivate the roots of meritorious Karma, so that sentient beings are able to be born in My Pure Land." Maitreya Buddha then expresses respect for Shakyamuni Buddha by chanting his name three times, and by praising him: "The great spiritual teacher Shakyamuni Buddha! He was burdened heavily by enduring insults. He was brave and taught sentient beings mindfully and diligently. He was able to teach, and help to make more mature the undeveloped, evil sentient beings in the evil world of the five impurities and constant suffering, so they might cultivate good deeds and diminish their evil deeds through many Kalpas times. Because of this, those beings are able to see Maitreya today. Burdened with the responsibility of teaching sentient beings, Shakyamuni BUddha suffered enormously. He enabled sentient beings to enter the temple of the unconditioned, permanent bliss of no-egotism. From his teaching, your disciples can be born in My Pure Land. Today, I have already expounded on the Four Noble Truths and the thirty-seven conditions by which to beautify and purify the city of Nirvana. I have also expounded on the Twelve Causes and Conditions. All sentient beeings can now perceive the unconditioned Dharma and enter into the profound truth of emptiness."... (many more paragraphs praising Shakyamuni Buddha)</blockquote>If we all practise the dharma right now, we may become of Maitreya's enlightened disciples in the future. We may even be one of his Great Disciples.<br><br>If we can purify our mind, one day pure land will be right before our eyes. Because "when mind is pure, land is pure".</div>

Those who lives by the sword, dies by the sword. You will not achieve liberation or salvation by killing another being cos your mind will be disturbed and you will not get peace of mind as killing is a bad deed. Ask yourself how many times did you feel guilty conscience by doing a bad deed?<br><br>It is said that when you die, all the events in your life will be bring before you, the good and the bad deeds that you have done.<br><br>You can use self defence to protect yourself and your family from another human, but you can do that by not killing him, merely dislodge his weapon like knife and subdue him.<br><br>if you happen to kill someone with no intention, there is no kamma as the intention is not there. For instance, if you reverses your car and did not realise a person was there and you kill that person, the kamma you get is maybe disqualify from driving through negligance and maybe a fine, but you did not purposely set out to kill the person, you killed him cos you did not realise he was there. If you saw him and still reverses your car, that is a different story.<br><br></div>
