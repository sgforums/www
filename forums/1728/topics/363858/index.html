              <p id="paragrah">Skeptic that I am, upon hearing there was an historical 
              exhibition on the lives and art of Japan's Buddhist nuns, I assumed that this 
              would be a drab show of temple artifacts and feminine articles veneered in the 
              dust of incense smoke. As the show is largely curated by Western female 
              academics, I also assumed the whole thing might be wrapped around a feminist 
              agenda designed to overcompensate for centuries of male domination by 
              exaggerating any female achievement, no matter how slight.</p>

              <p>Although a skeptic, I'm eager to experience exhibitions that I 
              may be wary of, and in the process, occasionally discover unexpected gems.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><img src="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/images/photos2009/fa20090605a1b.jpg" alt="News photo"></p>
              <p>This was the case with "Amamonzeki — A Hidden Heritage: Treasures 
              of the Japanese Imperial Convents" at Tokyo's University Art Museum, one of the 
              most aesthetically pleasing of all the exhibitions this year, and certainly the 
              best researched.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Thanks to the participation of non-Japanese academics, such as 
              Patricia Fister of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, who 
              kindly showed me around, the catalog is fully bilingual, casting an 
              international light on an area little known in Japan, never mind the rest of the 
              world.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The great surprise of this show is its sheer beauty, both in the 
              items selected and the design of the displays, which include reconstructions of 
              rooms and altars. The objects, such as scroll and screen paintings, calligraphy, 
              miniature Buddhist statues, dolls, games and other knick-knacks, have been 
              gathered from the 13 surviving Imperial convents — <em>amamonzeki</em> — 
              exclusively female Buddhist establishments that have long-standing ties with 
              Japan's royal family.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While each of the 13 convents is well represented, the curators, 
              who include experts from the Tokyo University of the Arts, have managed to 
              minimize any sense of repetition in the displays, giving the show a wonderfully 
              varied feel, evoking but not exhausting aspects of the convents as they now are 
              and once were.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The elegance and charm of many of the pieces is unexpected 
              because, as a belief system, Buddhism is not supposed to be concerned with the 
              attractions of this world. As the Buddhist scholar Hajime Nakamura pointed out 
              in "The Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples" (1960), though, Japanese Buddhism 
              has always been a lot less otherworldly than its Indian and Chinese antecedents.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Another important factor was that the Imperial convents were 
              repositories of daughters of the good and the great, including among their 
              inmates the surplus ladies of the Imperial family. This meant that they tended 
              to echo the living standards and high cultural tastes of the court.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">In addition to the gorgeous fabrics and furnishings on display, 
              some of the other items — elaborately made dolls with their own furniture, 
              incense-sniffing games and a shell-matching game with scenes from the "Tale of 
              Genji" — suggest that there was a certain amount of frivolity and hedonism among 
              the cloistered inmates, indicative perhaps of a degree of immaturity only to be 
              expected among young women deprived of the callings of motherhood and marriage. 
              But much here shows that many of the nuns found a higher sense of fulfillment 
              through religiously directed art and ascetic exercises.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">One of the most astounding items is a small wooden plaque in a 
              gilded case, on which the names of Buddhist deities have been skillfully and 
              beautifully formed using fingernail parings. This was made in 1686 by the Zen 
              Abbess Daitsu Bunchi, daughter of the Emperor Gomizuno-o, who used the 
              fingernails of her dead father to commemorate him in such a remarkable way.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><img src="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/images/photos2009/fa20090605a1c.jpg" alt="News photo"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 10px; "><strong>Portrait of Abbess Daitsu Bunchi by Prince-Abbot Shinkei </strong>TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS</span></p>
              <p>Depicted in a large scroll painted one year after her death in 
              1697, the Abbess is one of several impressive characters to emerge from the 
              exhibition. A keen ascetic who reportedly cleared away thorn bushes by hand to 
              found the convent of Ensho-ji, near Nara, the portrait presents a credible 
              picture of a tough, uncompromising spiritual matriarch. Like any Zen master, in 
              her hands she holds the <em>hossu,</em> the ceremonial fly whisk, a symbol of 
              ridding oneself of the illusions of the material world.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The extreme spiritual asceticism of Abbess Bunchi, which included 
              cutting off pieces of her own skin to write sutras on, is rare. Instead, the 
              true glory of the Imperial convents is that they were able to unite spiritual 
              and material beauty with that same unique Japanese sensibility that conceives 
              the material universe to be populated by 8 million gods.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">A key figure in this sense was the Abbess Tokugon Riho, a 
              daughter of the Emperor Gosai and a niece of Abbess Bunchi. Entered into 
              Hokyo-ji Convent in Kyoto at the age of 12, she later received artistic training 
              from a professional artist, Kano Chikanobu of the renowned artistic dynasty.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While her large-scale calligraphy shows a surprisingly masculine 
              energy, her paintings combine delicate artistic technique with a sense of serene 
              devotion. Her "Death of the Buddha" (18th century), shows the expiring deity 
              surrounded by dozens of disciples and animals. The attention to worldly detail 
              suffused with spiritual love in the picture strongly reminds us that the 
              spiritual and material don't necessarily have to occupy different planes of 
              reality.</p>
