              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong> </strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">San Francisco, CA (USA)</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> -- A book titled “<em>Biocentrism: How Life and
              Consciousness Are the Keys to Understanding the Nature of the Universe</em>“,
              published in the USA, has stirred up the Internet because of the notion that
              life does not end when the body dies and can last forever. The author of this
              publication, scientist Robert Lanza, has no doubts that this may be possible.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Beyond time and space</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Lanza is an expert in regenerative medicine and
              scientific director at Advanced Cell Technology Company. While he is known for
              his extensive research on stem cells, he was also famous for several successful
              experiments on cloning endangered animal species. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But not so long ago, the scientist turned his
              attention to physics, quantum mechanics and astrophysics. This explosive
              mixture has given birth to the new theory of biocentrism, which the professor
              has been preaching ever since. The theory implies that death simply does not
              exist. It is an illusion which arises in the minds of people. It exists because
              people identify themselves with their body. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They believe that the body is going to perish, sooner
              or later, thinking that their consciousness will disappear too. In fact,
              consciousness exists outside of constraints of time and space. It is able to be
              anywhere: in the human body and outside of it. That fits well with the basic
              postulates of quantum mechanics, according to which a certain particle can be
              present anywhere and an event can happen in several, sometimes countless, ways.
              Lanza believes that multiple universes can exist simultaneously. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>These
              universes contain multiple ways for possible scenarios to occur. In one
              universe, the body can be dead. And in another it continues to exist, absorbing
              consciousness which migrated to this universe. This means that a dead person,
              while traveling through the ‘tunnel’, ends up in a similar world he or she once
              inhabited, but this time alive. And so on, infinitely. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Multiple worlds</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This hope-instilling but extremely controversial
              theory by Lanza has many unwitting supporters – not just ‘mere mortals’ who
              want to live forever, but also some well-known scientists. These are physicists
              and astrophysicists who tend to agree with the existence of parallel worlds and
              who suggest the possibility of multiple universes, known as the Multiverse
              theory. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Science fiction writer H.G. Wells was the first to
              come up with this concept, which was proposed in his story “The Door in the
              Wall” in 1895. 62 years after it was published, the idea was developed by Hugh
              Everett in his graduate thesis at the Princeton University. It basically states
              that at any given moment the universe divides into countless similar instances.
              And the next moment, these “newborn” universes split in a similar way. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You may be present in some of these worlds – you may
              be reading this article in one universe or watching TV in another. The
              triggering factor for these multiplying worlds is our actions, explained
              Everett. When we make certain choices, one universe instantly splits into two
              different versions of outcomes. In the 1980s, Andrei Linde, scientist from the
              Lebedev Physical Institute in Russia developed the theory of multiple
              universes. He is now a professor at Stanford University. Linde explained:
              “Space consists of many inflating spheres, which give rise to similar spheres,
              and those, in turn, produce spheres in even greater numbers, and so on to
              infinity. In the universe, they are spaced apart. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They are not aware of each other’s existence. But they
              represent parts of the same physical universe.” The fact that our universe is
              not alone is supported by data received from the Planck space telescope. Using
              the data, scientists created the most accurate map of the microwave background,
              the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation, which has remained since
              the inception of our universe. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They also found that the universe has a lot of
              anomalies represented by black holes and extensive gaps. Theoretical physicist
              Laura Mersini-Houghton from the North Carolina University argues that the
              anomalies of the microwave background exist due to the fact that our universe
              is influenced by other universes existing nearby. And holes and gaps are a
              direct result of attacks from neighboring universes. Soul quanta So, there is
              abundance of places or other universes where our soul could migrate after
              death, according to the theory of neo-biocentrism. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But does the soul exist? consciousness parallel
              universeProfessor Stuart Hameroff from the University of Arizona has no doubts
              about the existence of eternal soul. Last year, he announced that he has found
              evidence that consciousness does not perish after death. According to Hameroff,
              the human brain is the perfect quantum computer, and the soul, or consciousness,
              is simply information stored at the quantum level. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It can be transferred, following the death of the
              body; quantum information carried by consciousness merges with our universe and
              exists infinitely. In his turn, Lanza proves that the soul migrates to another
              universe. That is the main difference his theory has from the similar ones. Sir
              Roger Penrose, a well-known British physicist and expert in mathematics from
              Oxford, supports this theory and claims to have found traces of contact with
              other universes. Together, the scientists are developing a quantum theory to
              explain the phenomenon of consciousness. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They believe that they have found carriers of
              consciousness, the elements that accumulate information during life and “drain”
              consciousness somewhere else after death. These elements are located inside
              protein-based microtubules (neuronal microtubules), which previously have been
              attributed a simple role of reinforcement and transport channeling inside a
              living cell. Based on their structure, microtubules are best suited to function
              as carriers of quantum properties inside the brain. That is mainly because they
              are able to retain quantum states for a long time, meaning they can function as
              elements of a quantum computer.</span></p>
