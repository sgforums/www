              <p>Some things for your consideration. I found the clarifications by Loppon Namdrol (a very knowledgeable and experienced scholar/yogi/teacher who I and Thusness considers to be highly enlightened) to be enlightening.</p>

              <div class="quotetop"><br></div>
              <p>This has been bothering me lately so I figured i'd post a topic about it.<br><br>Many people say that the historical Shakyamuni buddha did not teach mahayana sutras or vajrayana tantras.</p>
              <p><strong>Jigme Phuntsok:</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, there are no record of any Mahayana sutras until much later,
                      but this is because the Mahayana sutras were passed on strictly orally
                      at first and not written down until later.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>That's a nice fantasy, but that is all it is.</p>
              <p><strong>Jigme Phuntsok:</strong><br><br>Then how do you account for the presence of Mahayana-like
                      doctrines in the Mahasangikas who were present in large numbers at the
                      time of the early councils?</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>Which Mahayana like doctrines did you have in mind? Bodhicitta,
                      great compassion, ten bodhisattva stages, three kayas, emptiness of
                      persons and things and so on?</p>
              <p><strong>Jigme Phuntsok:</strong></p>
              <p>It is my understanding that the Mahasangikas taught a nascent form
                      of the Buddha-nature doctrine which included teachings on the
                      permanence of the Buddha, the primordial presence of countless
                      qualities within the Buddha-nature; as well as the emptiness of all
                      dharmas.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong><br><br>Did you have a sutra in mind that they taught these things in? Or is this a speculation?</p>
              <p><strong>xabir2005 (me):</strong></p>
              <p>Just to clarify: in your understanding, all Mahayana and Vajrayana sutras/tantras come from realized masters other than Buddha?</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p>N</p>
              <p><strong>Londro:</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Namdrol,<br><br>Did you not once threaten to ban a person on
                      this forum for asserting that the Mahayana Sutras and the Pali Canon
                      were not the actual words of the Buddha?<br><br>Lodro</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>Nope. Incidentally, a realized master is a Buddha. So they can represent the Buddha. <br><br>N</p>
              <p><strong>Paljor:</strong></p>
              <p>As far as I know, only a fully enlighten Buddha (samyaksambuddha)
                      endowed with the ten power, can turn the wheel of dharma. Enlighten
                      masters like Nagarjuna, Tilopa, Naropa, Milarepa, Asanga... can
                      elaborate and comment on the Buddha's words, their spoken words are in
                      accord with the dharma yet not having the same status as "Sutra", which
                      only reserved for the Buddha. Buddha Vajradhara, Vairochana,
                      Samantabadhra are different manifestations of Sakyamuni Buddha in pure
                      realm.<br><br>P.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong><br><br>By come from, Paljor, we mean in pure visions, etc. But we do not need to confuse pure visions with empirical history. <br><br>N</p>
              <p><strong>Paljor:</strong></p>
              <p>The Buddha may not be around in nirmanakaya for us but he's
                      always available to bodhisattvas (enlighten masters) in Sambogakaya
                      (pure realm). <br><br>P.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, that is correct, that is why we do not need to indulge in
                      historical literalism to account for the origin of Mahayana and
                      Vajrayana teachings. <br><br>N</p>
              <p><strong>Paljor:</strong></p>
              <p>The nirmanakaya Buddha (historical Buddha) is as important as
                      Sambogakaya Buddha, just as conventional reality is as important as
                      ultimate reallity as declared by Nagarjuna.<br><br>I know that Sakyapas
                      tent to emphasize the important of Sambogakaya but there's no need to
                      ignore the important of nirmanakaya Buddha, they are the same: for the
                      benefit oa all sentient beings. <br><br>P.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>Actually, this is not so. According to
                      Gorampa for example, the Sambhogakaya and the Nirmanakaya have the same
                      relationship as an illusionist and his illusion. <br><br>But that is
                      really not so germane here. What is germane when considering history is
                      the empirical record. And the empirical record simply does not support
                      the notion that Mahayana was taught while Gotama Buddha walked this
                      earth. This does not mean that Mahayana does not have a valid origin --
                      it does, as I have explained. It is in the pure visions of later
                      masters who came after the Buddha and who wrote down their visions of
                      Buddha teaching various teachings in various places. <br><br>Now I
                      don't know about what you think, but I am pretty sure that the number
                      of monks who were said to be present on the summit of Vulture peak when
                      the Buddha was teaching the Lotus Sutra, for example, cannot actually
                      fit there. It is not a large place. <br><br><img src="http://www.vimutti.org.nz/zenphoto/cache/India%20Pilgrimage/IMG_3828.jpg_w540.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><br>N</p>
              <p><strong>Paljor:</strong></p>
              <p>If the house of Vimalakirti was big enough for 32 hundred thousands thrones, and these thrones each measured 42 hundred thousands league in height, and his house didn't increase in size, nor get crowded, then I think the vulture peak can be as vast as space to accomodate the number of monks, humans, non-humans, etc... Now why people who have "pure vision" should create something so "untrue" and "illogical", shouldn't that go against the dharma? Or is there something that is beyond intellectual elaboration? </p>
              <p>P.</p>
              <p><strong>Namdrol:</strong></p>
              <p>It does not go against the Dharma, it means that the author of
                      the sutra who was describing the setting was making a didactic point. <br><br>N</p>

              <p>Old posts by Namdrol:</p>
                  <p>"The Mahayana sutras are recorded words of Buddha, the words of
                                          Buddha recorded from the visions of Indian masters from 100 BCE
                                          onwards, just as the Pali suttas are the words of Indian masters
                                          recorded when they saw the Buddha between roughly 460 BCE-400
                                          BCE."</p>
                  <p>.</p>
                  <p>.</p>
                  <p>Now with regards to Tantras (of Vajrayana):</p>
                  <p>"Tantras in general have always had a revealed source, and for
                                          the most part have never sought authorship by the historical Buddha
                                          as a criteria for their validity-- the tantras come from Oddiyana,
                                          where they are kept by Dakini guardians. Indian Mahasiddhas would
                                          visit there, and recover texts to bring back to India, for example,
                                          Virupa recovered the Raktayamari cycle from there.<br> <br> Certainly some major tantras (Kalachakra, Guhyasamaja, Hevajra,
                                          lower tantra in general) have been thought to have been taught by
                                          the historical Buddha by some Tibetan exegetes, but there are whole
                                          classes of tantras considered to have never been taught by
                                          Shakyamuni Buddha, but rather by Samhogakaya manifestations. For
                                          this reason, tantras continue to be produced (albeit they are
                                          completely unoriginal in content) and sutras have not continued to
                                          be reproduced."</p>

                  <p>More quotations from "Loppon Namdrol":</p>
                  <p>"I take the position that tantric texts were gradually written
                                          down beginning in the sixth to seventh century based on the
                                          experiences of Buddhist masters. I don't see much difference
                                          between "created" and "revealed".<br> <br> One day these texts did not exist, the next day they did--
                                          <span>authorship</span> is not an issue for me, that is
                                          whether they are the produce of a Buddha or a master putting words
                                          in a Buddha's mouth does not matter-- I think the system is highly
                                          effective whatever its origin. "</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The phrase 'all form is non-form' is from the Diamond SÅ«tra. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  said, "SubhÅ«ti, what do you think? Can we use our ordinary flesh-eyes
                  to see the TathÄ�gata’s physical form and thus believe we are seeing the
                  true TathÄ�gata ?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">SubhÅ«ti
                  replied, "No, World-honoured One. We cannot look upon the unreal form
                  of the TathÄ�gata’s manifestation and think we have perceived the
                  non-arising and non-ceasing true body of the TathÄ�gata."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">How
                  is that? The 16-foot physique of the TathÄ�gata is a bodily form
                  produced by an aggregation of causes and conditions. When life ends,
                  that body decays and eventually vanishes. It is not the truly pure
                  Dharma-kÄ�ya of the TathÄ�gata because the Dharma-kÄ�ya has no form to be
                  seen; it is empty and tranquil. How could flesh-eyes of sentient beings
                  see the true form of the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  told SubhÅ«ti, "Not only is the TathÄ�gata’s bodily form a false form
                  produced by the aggregation of causes and conditions, which does not
                  have real substance, so is any kind of thing in the universe, in this
                  world as well as beyond this world. All living and non-living things,
                  shapes and colours are merely formed by aggregations of causes and
                  conditions. They are impermanent and will change as causes and
                  conditions disperse. They are as illusory as the flower in the mirror
                  or the moon in the water!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"If
                  looking at appearances of objects, sentient beings are able to lucidly
                  awaken to its aggregation of causes and conditions, and understand
                  impermanence, their arising and ceasing; and if at that very instant,
                  distinguishing does not arise, then without discrimination, they can
                  enter into deep stillness. In stillness, pure wisdom reveals itself.
                  With supreme wisdom, they realise that all worldly form is created by
                  causes and conditions. Its nature is empty; it is not reality. In this
                  way, they will directly perceive the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya."</span></p>

                  was the Arahat who best understood emptiness. Thus, with regards to
                  emptiness, he had profound realisation. We see this in a story:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Once,
                  Buddha went to the heavenly palace of TrayastrimÅ›Ä�s to preach Dharma to
                  his mother. He only returned to earth after having been gone for a few
                  months. All of his disciples missed him. When he returned, they rushed
                  to welcome him, each hoping to be the first to pay their respects to
                  him. Being the most advanced in supernatural ability amongst the
                  Buddha's female disciples, BhiksunÄ« Lián-huÄ�-sè (è“®èŠ±è‰²) used her
                  supernatural powers and transformed herself into the image of
                  Saint-king CakravartÄ«. Then, with great poise, she went to stand right
                  up in front. She very happily paid her respects toBuddha and said,
                  "Disciple Lián-huÄ�-sè is the first to pay respects to Buddha today. Oh,
                  I’m overjoyed!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha replied with a smile, "Lián-huÄ�-sè, the first to see the TathÄ�gata wasn’t you. It was SubhÅ«ti!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">BhiksunÄ«
                  Lián-huÄ�-sè was astonished! SubhÅ«ti had not joined in the queue to
                  welcome the Buddha. How could he have been the first to meet the Buddha?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  then said, "The bodily form of the TathÄ�gata is not seen by our
                  perceptions. He who sees the Dharma, sees the TathÄ�gata." </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">As
                  it turned out, when Buddha returned to earth, SubhÅ«ti had been in the
                  meditation hall sitting in stillness, deeply observing the emptiness of
                  all things and phenomena, clearly understanding the reality of inherent
                  emptiness, and thus realising the formless Dharma-kÄ�ya of TathÄ�gata.
                  Even though he had not been there in the queue, he had in fact truly
                  seen the TathÄ�gata.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  has three bodies (TrikÄ�ya). One is 'NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya'(åŒ–èº«), or the
                  'Emanation Body'. According to the sentient beings' capacity for
                  understanding, Buddha manifests the illusory forms of physical bodies
                  in numerous worlds. Because of their heavy karmic hindrances, some
                  disciples were only able to see the 16-foot golden body of the Buddha,
                  but were unable to see the 32 physical characteristics and 80
                  accompanying physical features of a great person (i.e.
                  DvÄ�trimÅ›advara-laksana and Anuvyañjana).</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another
                  body of Buddha is 'Sambhoga-kÄ�ya' (æŠ¥èº«), or the 'benefiting body', of
                  which are two kinds: one is the 'body which benefits oneself', and the
                  other is the 'body which benefits others'. The former is the Buddha's
                  own attainment and awakening to his meritorious intrinsic pure
                  Buddha-nature, in the state of Dharma joy. The latter is the appearance
                  of enlightened, liberated Bodhisattvas to guide beginner-Bodhisattvas
                  (i.e. sentient beings who emulate Bodhisattvas and practise the
                  Bodhisattva Way) according to prevailing causalities, enabling these
                  beginner-Bodhisattvas to benefit from the teachings of Greater Vehicle
                  (MahÄ�yÄ�na) with Dharma joy. Both NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya and Sambhoga-kÄ�ya are
                  physical forms which are visible. However, the perfect Sambhoga-kÄ�ya of
                  Great Bodhisattvas is a form that is infinite and of awesome majesty.
                  It is not something that ordinary sentient beings like us can see. What
                  ordinary people see is the NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya form.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
                  third body of Buddha, named 'Dharma-kÄ�ya'(æ³•èº«), is the Truth Body of the
                  TathÄ�gata, and also the reality of all phenomena. It permeates all of
                  space and is omnipresent. An ancient sage said, "Green bamboos are
                  entirely Dharma-kÄ�ya, luxuriant chrysanthemums are all PrajñÄ�; each
                  grass, each tree, all in the ocean of Buddha-nature. Green bamboos are
                  used for expressing the state of Dharma-kÄ�ya, but bamboos are by no
                  means Dharma-kÄ�ya. Luxuriant chrysanthemums are used for displaying the
                  function of PrajñÄ�, but chrysanthemums are by no means PrajñÄ�."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
                  myriad of things and phenomena in this world are formed by aggregations
                  of numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements and five
                  skandhas , arising by causality and ceasing by causality; their nature
                  is inherently empty. And everything in the world is as such. They do
                  not exist as individual entities. Hence, the nature of all things and
                  phenomena is empty, tranquil and all pervasive. However, people are
                  unaware of this and are grasping on to their belief that the numerous
                  forms in the universe truly exist. But if you can truly comprehend this
                  and awaken to the realisation that the nature of all forms is
                  emptiness, then instantaneously you perceive the pure Dharma-kÄ�ya of
                  TathÄ�gata.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>A nice summary on the development of teachings by Ven. Hui-Feng:</p>
              <p><br><br>Before explaining how the sukha-tathagatagarbhikas ( <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/style_emoticons/Default2/tongue.gif" border="0" alt="tongue.gif"> ) explain the "apparent conflict", and Chan too, let's take a few steps back.  <br><br>Even
              in the early sutras, there is the idea of certain teachings as being
              "fully drawn out" (nitartha), and others as "yet to be drawn out"
              (neyartha). We could say, "explicit" and "implicit". However, at first,
              which were which was not stated. <br><br>So, there were some "apparent
              conflicts" quite early on. The biggest by far was that of the
              "pudgala", which was kind of a synonym for "atman". In some sutras the
              Buddha says things like "the pudgala does this and that", "the pudgala
              is reborn in some place", and so forth; and in other sutras, the Buddha
              states that "there is no atman, no pudgala, no sattva..." and so forth.
              <br><br>Now, one school, the Pudgalavadins, tried to come up with a
              theory that kept all teachings on a similar "truth" level. They ended
              up with an "expressible pudgala", which was rather dubious. Still, they
              tended to fall towards the extreme of eternalism, rather than
              annihilism. So, although neither are correct, the former is better than
              the latter (see my signature). <br><br>The other schools, notably the
              Abhidharma groups, came up with the "dharma theory", which broke
              everything down into irreducible parts, each of which was impermanent,
              dissatisfactory and not self (and empty too). Now, based on a group of
              these irreducible dharmas, one could have a designation, but these
              desigations / names, etc. were not real per se. Classic example: The
              five aggregates are real, the "person" is a designation based on the
              aggregates. <br><br>They then used this theory to explain the apparent
              contradiction, ie. that teachings that spoke of a "pudgala", "atman",
              etc. were actually just "conventional designations" and thus "implicit"
              and "to be fully drawn out", whereas thos that taught in terms of
              "dharmas", were "ultimate teachings" and "already fully drawn out".
              (I've an essay in my Blog, see signature, on this one if you want more
              details.) <br><br>To seal this, the Abhidharma literature which is
              slightly later than the sutras almost always tries to use the "dharma"
              / "ultimate" terminology. Therefore, a bunch of later explanatory
              literature wins the day. <br><br>But, there were still some problems
              with this Abhidharma dharma-theory. In particular, the tendency towards
              explaining these irreducible dharmas as somehow substantial. In fact,
              even up to the point of the Sarvastivada considering dharmas as
              themselves little atman, etc. (Remember, the Sarvastivada is from a
              school closely related to the Pudgalavadins.) Again, a slight leaning
              towards eternalism. <br><br>Now, another body of literature starts to
              appear, ie. the Mahayana sutras. Once again, they have the advantage of
              being the latest texts, so they can make arguments against all the
              earlier material, and consolidate a complete systematic view. The
              emphasis is on the fact that even these so-called Dharmas are empty
              too, not just empty of an atman / pudgala, but empty of any sort of
              substantiality, eternality, and so forth. <br><br>But, again, this has
              the tendency towards nihilism in the eyes of some. So, yet another body
              of literature starts to appear. Well, two, actually. These are the
              Yogacara literature, stemming from the Sarvastivadins. And, the
              Tathagatagarbha literature. <br><br>Because they are now the newest
              stuff, they can explicity within the text themselves say things like
              "Oh, the XXX sutra is just a provisional teaching, this sutra that you
              are reading now is the real, true and ultimate teaching!!" And, of
              course, the XXX sutra doesn't say anything to the contrary - because
              this new Tathagatagarbha sutra didn't even exist at the time to be
              refuted!! <br><br>Every new batch of literature that came out stated
              that it (and usually, only it), was the "explicit" and ultimate
              teaching, etc. etc. and that everything that had come before was merely
              provisional. <br><br>In India, this was nitartha versus neyartha. But
              in China, slightly different. The Chinese for a start received a lot of
              their Buddhism "all at once", or, at least in a quite different order
              at first to the Indians. ie. they got Abhidharma stuff first, then some
              Mahayana stuff, and then the Agama sutras, and then mostly Mahayana
              stuff with some later commentaries of Abhidharma and Mahayana. <br><br>So,
              mainly starting from Tiantai Zhiyi, they started to make
              "doxographies", and try to put the various sutras in order - of time,
              and importance. Of course, they considered (almost) every text that had
              "Thus have I heard..." to be all taught during the Buddha's time.
              However, because the later texts claimed to be more ultimate, etc. they
              ended up being put later in the Buddha's career. <br><br>eg. whereas
              modern scholars would say that the range of sutras, early and Mahayana,
              took place over about 8 centuries, Zhiyi crammed them all within the
              life time of Sakyamuni. First, the Avatamsaka, then the Agamas, then
              the Prajnaparamita, then the Vaipulyas (other Mahayana sutras), then
              the Lotus Sutra and finally the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra. <br><br>Actually,
              the Mahayana Parinirvana Sutra (not to be confused with the early
              Parinirvana Sutra) was a genius idea! If they set the sutra at the
              parinirvana of the Buddha, then obviously it would have to be the
              Buddhas last (and thus ultimate) teaching! And yes, this was a
              Tathagatagarbha text. <br><br>All these were already translated, and
              the Tiantai doxography already in place, by the time that Chan came on
              the scene. So, the Mahayana sutras, especially the Tathagatagarbha
              sutras, were supreme. For Chan at first, the Lankavatara Sutra was
              extremely important, but also the Parinirvana, etc. Lotus, etc. <br><br>During
              the first few generations of Chan, they mainly used these Mahayana
              sutras as the basis of their practice. Bodhidharma cites them, so do
              Daoxin, Hongren and Huineng. It's called "based on the scripture,
              realize the mind / truth". This later came to be called "Ruali Chan",
              "rulai" being the translation of "tathagata", referring to the
              Tathagatagarbha sutras. <br><br>Later, in the late Tang and Song, etc.
              there was a move towards "patriarch Chan". Though the Sutra content was
              there, it was less obvious, and there was usage of techniques like
              "silent illlumination", "word/thought watching", etc. Still, most of
              these were based around later Mahayana thought, especially
              Tathagatagarbha. There were some exceptions, but they were minor. <br><br>It
              was in this later period that Chan goes to Japan and we have Zen. Also,
              a lot of Zen in Japan is Tendai influenced, so the notion of the
              importance of the Lotus Sutra and Parinirvana Sutra is perhaps even
              stronger than in China. <br><br>These Chan and Zen boys and girls were
              largely not scholars by this stage. Thus, where the Indian pandits were
              quickly putting Tathagatagarbha at the bottom end of their doctrinal
              scale of "which teaching is ultimate", subsuming it under a Madhyamaka
              (and Yogacara) over-system, the Chinese (and Japanese) did not. Nobody
              was really going around noting that "Hey, these buddhists are talking
              like the Vedantins or Brahmins!?", because there weren't (m)any
              Brahmins in China! Everything Indian got subsumed into the Buddhist
              fold. <br><br>Also, around the late Tang, the routes to India were not
              as open, and so the latest Indian explanations did not make it to
              China. Unlike in Tibet, which is the time when Buddhism started there.
              Their Tathagatagarbha and Yogacara was already largely the later,
              pre-packaged in Madhyamaka outfit version, and so it stayed. <br><br><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/style_emoticons/Default2/rantoff.gif" border="0" alt="rantoff.gif"> <br><br>(If only I could usually write a 1000 word essay so quickly!  hahahahaha!)  <br><br>Huifeng  <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/style_emoticons/Default2/namaste.gif" border="0" alt="namaste.gif"></p>

              <p>Theravada also use chanting as a form of meditation, a way to gain samadhi. They also have parittas and sutta chantings, all taught by Buddha in the pali canon, supposed to provide protection, and so on.</p>
              <p>What the Buddha was against probably was the use of mantras and spells for selfish, greedy, evil purposes, that only serves to increase one's three poisons. There were mantras used for killing, seducing, harming others, etc. Those are certainly unacceptable.</p>

                  people, which are considered as  more 
                  powerful than all kind of mantras. Because these verses have power of Buddha, Dhamma &amp; Sangha.
                  <strong>Parittas</strong> have truth actions which means from truth of virtue powers of Buddha, Dhamma &amp;
                 Sangha, wishing actions to be occurred such as blessings or removing life problems. 
                  <strong>Gathas</strong> are poems which have noble worshiping verses &amp; characteristics of 
                  tipple gems. Some gathas or parittas were teaching of Lord Buddha so called

                 pains from chanting such kind of gathas in our home, under the Bodhi tree and some
                 Devalas. You can offer flowers, oil lamps &amp; odors to Buddha in such place
                 then concentrate your mind to virtue powers of Buddha some time such as 15
                 minutes, then you can chant some gathas. Also you can chant Karaniya Metta, Maha

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>There is a big difference between mantras and parittas. Paritta chanting is also typically called protective chanting. The efficacy of the Paritta chanting of the Theravada tradition comes from the meaning of the truths held in the paritta passages. In the Buddha's teaching, it is always said that truth holds power. And that the truth will protect you. When you chant these parittas, you are supposed to reflect on the qualities or teachings in the paritta. Reflecting on these qualities, the practitioner generates good thoughts which protects him. As the saying goes, the 'Dhamma protects those who practice the Dhamma' (<em>Dhammo have</em> rakkhati <em>dhamma cari). </em></p>
              <p>That is the root of the power that the parittas hold. This is different from mantras.</p>
              <p>As I was taught, the power of mantras comes from the sounds. These are sacred sounds transmitted to us by the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The power of the mantra first comes from the correct recitation of the mantra as it was taught to you by your teacher, the transmission lineage, the right visualisation and the altruistic mind of the practitioner when reciting the mantra.</p>

              <p>Ah I see... thanks for clarifying! What you said made sense.</p>
              <p>As for mantras, from what I've learnt, you don't have to pronounce it exactly to get its positive effects. It is actually the practitioner's sincerity and one pointedness that makes it powerful... there is a story of how an old lady chanted 'om mani peh meh niu' because she mis-read the last character of the mantra, but nevertheless there is auspicious clouds and signs surrounding her house.</p>
