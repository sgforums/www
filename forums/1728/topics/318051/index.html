              <p>Can anyone help?   My mum left for more than 49 days already and on the 1st and 15th days of the lunar month she comes back.   I was told initially when they pass on they will come back because they have not gone to the deeper level of hell so easy for them to return.   She visited me often during the 49 days.   In the dream, she even told me she will bless me.</p>
              <p>The dead loved ones return after the 49 days period:</p>
              <p>1)   is it true as in what others say that they can't let go of their living loved ones?</p>
              <p>2)   by coming back, visiting the living loved ones mean will  affect them for rebirth?</p>
              <p>3)   they come back because rebirth does not take place so soon?</p>

              <p>u are thinking in the sense of æŠ•èƒŽ as in the ghost movies? actually in Buddhism, there are six different realms.</p>

              <p>if they are reborn in hell or animal or human or asura realms, don't think they can "come back" and intervene our dreams.</p>
              <p>however if one is reborn in ghost realm then it could be the reason that she choose the 1st and the 15th... as a month in the ghost realm is about 1 day in human realm. and yes ghost can sometimes intervene with our dreams especially with the love ones.</p>
              <p>as for heavenly realm. they also can intervene with our dreams, but rare. moreover, 49 days is just too soon. as 500 year in human realms would be abt 1 day in the first level of heaven, at least. </p>
              <p>clinging to loved ones is one of the main cause of reborning in the the ghost realm. so if she's really in the ghost realm, it would be safe to say that she wouldn't go deeper or re-reborn into hell realm. "normally" i read for those very bad ones, then they will undergo retribution in hell realm first then after their karma is exhasuted, they are reborn in animal realm then ghost realms then human realm etc.  as to leave the ghost realm and enter human realm again, they properly have to let go or exhaust their clinging for their loved ones first.</p>
              <p>the "7*7=49 days" saying is got to do with the "bardo" (in-between) period, whereby a dead person has not been lead by their karma to the next realm. during this bardo period, the activities is also pretty similar to the ghost/spiritual realm.</p>

              <p>1. Most people cannot bear to leave behind their loved ones, even after they die.  This is in fact, one of the reasons why they cannot leave this cycle of birth and death.</p>
              <p>2. The state of mind before a person's death is very important.  By not letting go, and by having a lot of fear, this will affect where they will be reborn.  Of course, karmic actions play an important role too.  When a person has a horrified death (eg murdered) he may be born into the realm of the ghost.</p>
              <p>3.  There're many different theories as to the period to a person's rebirth.  Some (esp. the Tibetans) believe it's 49 days but other traditions may say that it's instant.</p>
              <p>If you feel that your mother is visiting you, pls say it out loud to her to let go.  Assure her that you can take care of yourself so that she can finally put down this burden and be reborn into a desirable realm.</p>
              <p>For you, it is also time to let go.  We have to understand that nobody can escape birth and death, and it is just the natural order for a person to die.  When the conditions for existence are no longer there, we just die.  We have to accept that our births and deaths have actually occurred countless times, and every time we suffer in it.  That is why we practise the Dharma, so that we can be eventually free from samsara.</p>
              <p>It is very very rare to be born as a human, and also to encounter the Dharma, so pls make the best out of your current life.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if I have let go, really.   All I know now is I want my mum to be happy in the other world and hope she will not go for rebirth as animals or insect.</p>
              <p>Different times, do they choose what they want to be to come back to visit us?  For eg, moth, butterful or others.</p>

              <p>Hi qiqq9, I'm really very sorry.  I can fully understand your anguish and your desire to have your mother happy. </p>
              <p>But you know, it is very difficult for ordinary beings like us to know if your mother has come back as moths or reborn as human/ghost/insect.  Many people can speculate on this, but they will not be able to give you a sure answer.</p>
              <p>If you believe that your mother is reborn in the lower realms, then dedicating your good deeds to her will help.  You can also read 'The original vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva' sutra.  Inside will give details on how to relieve her suffering.  You can get this book for free in many temples, or you can read from the internet.  Trust the words of Buddha, rather than people like us who are not yet enlightened, although we can point the way :)</p>
              <p>Also, pls do not be fixated on the '49 day period'.  You must remember that nobody has ever said that it is 49 'human' days.  Pls also use this experience to remind yourself that the saha world is suffering, and do not abandon the Dharma when you're in happier times in the future.</p>

              <p>i'm not sure if there's such a thing as ghost/heavenly beings transfering/manifesting their consciousness/"soul" into the body of a moth, as a form of visiting their loved ones. it could properly be a scientific explaination where moth are just attracted to some smell of incense or candle light or something. i'll have my reserve for this.</p>

              <p><br>I believe every child's wish is the best for their parents, hence I can understand your sense of loss at this point of time.  As some of the dharma brothers have correctly pointed out, 49 days after passing on is an important period for the deceased in Vajrayana, as they will be experiences various phenomenon within their conscious, which will pretty determind where they seek rebirth in.  Of course, this will also depend very much on their karma and merits they have accumulated during their lifetime, this and previous.  This stage is indeed called the Bardo stage.  During this time, the family members, as yourself, are encouraged to chant sutras and do good/go vege and dedicate the merits to their love ones, so that with this merits, it'll help the remaining conscious to take the right path towards liberation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many a times, the chanting Shifu do combine Buddhist scripture/mantras with Taoist mantra when they performed the right, cos they feel that it will help the dead to seek rebirth in a higher realm, such as the Heavenly realm.  Though their interpretation may not be right, their intention and motivation is afterall, for the better of the dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Buddhism context, the chanting of sutras during these 49 days is a way we communicate to the dead to remind them of Buddha's teaching and the importance of letting go of attachment, so that they could be free from samsara eventually and move on to one of the paradise land of the buddhas or bodhisattvas.  Of course, the teachings is for the living as well, to understand impermanence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said, that doesn't mean that the family members' job are done after 49 days.  In fact, constant doing good and dedicate merits will still help the dead in terms of accumulation of merits, so that even though they remained within samsara, they will eventually enjoy the benefits of the merits and remained on the path towards liberation.</p>
              <p>Your mother is definitely very fortunate to have a child like you, and there is still alot ways you can do to help your mother.  Understand the buddha's teaching and practise dilligently is the best thing you could do to help your mother, as well as all other sentient beings.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ffcc00;">however if one is reborn in ghost
              realm then it could be the reason that she choose the 1st and the
              15th... as a month in the ghost realm is about 1 day in human
              realm. and yes ghost can sometimes intervene with our dreams
              especially with the love ones.</span></p>
              <p>other than the 1st and 15th days of the month, that day 2 days
              before 15th a moth was flying and rested on my hand for a
              second.   ON the 1st of the month saw this same size of
              moth in the bathroom of my cousin's house where I was staying for a
              while.</p>
              <p>How to find out if she has gone for rebirth?   I don't
              want her to become animals and so on.  Actually, I have many
              times told her that I can take care of myself and asked her not to
              worry but to go to the place she can find happiness and told her
              that the goddess of mercy will take care of her.   When
              my mum comes back, she was with a white flash of light.  
              I spoke to a shifu about this, shifu said white light is good and
              blue light is no good.</p>

              <p>As Sinweiy suggested, if your mom keeps appearing to you.... it could be that she is attached and stuck to the ghost realm. The window of opportunity for rebirth is within 49 days, after which if he had not been reborn elsewhere will become ghost.</p>
              <p>What you can do is to go Buddhist monasteries during the 7th Month, attend the Fa Hui, donate to the sangha (community of monks and nuns), etc... and dedicate the merits to your mother. Regardless whether she is in ghost realm or even higher realm, she can benefit from it. If she is in ghost realm she can be reborn in human realm faster.</p>

                          day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the 
                          realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. 
                          Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was 
                          impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. 
                          Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme 
                          state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and 
                          with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, 
                          she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal 
                          before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what 
                          was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered 
                          his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. 
                          He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into 
                          pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, 
                          your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of 
                          cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha 
                          and insulted the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Sangha [1]</span>, had no respect 
                          for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled 
                          with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed 
                          many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she 
                          is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and 
                          your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save 
                          a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, 
                          Maudgalyayana wept in pain. </strong></span></p>

                          The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day 
                          of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". 
                          This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the 
                          purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, 
                          many attain the <span style="color: #cc0000;">Bodhi [2]</span>. The merits that 
                          they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most 
                          delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you 
                          can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of 
                          the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through

                          to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering

                          give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. 
                          After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very 
                          grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. 
                          He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th 
                          of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude 
                          and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage 
                          of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much 
                          so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. 
                          Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter 
                          of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act 
                          of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and 
                          making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite 
                          the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the 
                          compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had 
                          advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">When 
                          we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate 
                          the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other 
                          living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit 
                          from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their 
                          action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms 
                          of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of 
                          offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, 
                          the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with 
                          vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able 
                          to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite 
                          them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In 
                          this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000a0; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000a0; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</span></strong></p>

              <p><br>I believe every child's wish is the best for their parents, hence I can understand your sense of loss at this point of time.  As some of the dharma brothers have correctly pointed out, 49 days after passing on is an important period for the deceased in Vajrayana, as they will be experiences various phenomenon within their conscious, which will pretty determind where they seek rebirth in.  Of course, this will also depend very much on their karma and merits they have accumulated during their lifetime, this and previous.  This stage is indeed called the Bardo stage.  During this time, the family members, as yourself, are encouraged to chant sutras and do good/go vege and dedicate the merits to their love ones, so that with this merits, it'll help the remaining conscious to take the right path towards liberation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many a times, the chanting Shifu do combine Buddhist scripture/mantras with Taoist mantra when they performed the right, cos they feel that it will help the dead to seek rebirth in a higher realm, such as the Heavenly realm.  Though their interpretation may not be right, their intention and motivation is afterall, for the better of the dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Buddhism context, the chanting of sutras during these 49 days is a way we communicate to the dead to remind them of Buddha's teaching and the importance of letting go of attachment, so that they could be free from samsara eventually and move on to one of the paradise land of the buddhas or bodhisattvas.  Of course, the teachings is for the living as well, to understand impermanence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said, that doesn't mean that the family members' job are done after 49 days.  In fact, constant doing good and dedicate merits will still help the dead in terms of accumulation of merits, so that even though they remained within samsara, they will eventually enjoy the benefits of the merits and remained on the path towards liberation.</p>
              <p>Your mother is definitely very fortunate to have a child like you, and there is still alot ways you can do to help your mother.  Understand the buddha's teaching and practise dilligently is the best thing you could do to help your mother, as well as all other sentient beings.</p>

              <p>Well said, coolbluewater.  The best things that can be done for the dead are by chanting and dedicating merits.  Take heart, qiqq9, whether your mother is in the ghost realm or not , in the long run, does not become very important, because ultimately it's going to be temporary.  We have probably gone into the six realms many times before coming into our current form.  When all karmic effects are expiated, everything will start anew.</p>
              <p>qiqq9, you said you're not into religion?  Then do you believe in Buddhism?  If you don't believe, then whatever we have said here about karma and dedicating good merits don't count anymore, and there's no use going to any fa hui.  If you believe, then you also have to believe that all things are illusory and so dedicate yourself to practising the Dharma, not just for your mother but also for yourself and all sentient beings.  We should not be looking into religion when you have a problem and abandon it after the problem is solved.  I have a feeling that you're going to Taoism, Buddhism or what have you, as long as they can solve your problem.  This is very dangerous because there are evil supernatural beings out there who can help you for a while but lead you astray in the end.  I sincerely hope you will delve into the Dharma in the coming future.</p>

              <p>Your mother has planted Bodhi seeds in you and in return has gotten a filial son/daughter, who now seeks the Buddhist way to relieve her suffering.  Isn't this a wonderful example of (good) karma, and give us more reason to believe in it?</p>
              <p>According to Master Chin Kung, we are still at the nursery stage in Buddhism so we're in no position to enlighten anyone.  But we can definitely share in whatever we know and to try our best to spread the Dharma.  Amituofuo. </p>
