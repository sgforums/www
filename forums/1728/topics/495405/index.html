              Display of Sacred Hair Relic of the Buddha</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor Global | 2018-04-16 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Conservationists in Myanmar have expressed concern that a
              public procession and display scheduled this month of an ancient Buddhist
              relic, believed to be a hair from the historical Buddha, risks damaging the
              object of reverence. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The relic, believed to have come from the head of Shakyamuni
              Buddha more than 2,500 years ago is usually enshrined within Botataung Pagoda
              in downtown Yangon. However, due to planned renovation work at the ancient
              monument, the Buddha’s hair relic has been moved to a nearby prayer hall where
              it has been placed on public display. The relic is scheduled to be carried by
              procession and placed in the Chanthagyi Prayer Hall of the city’s iconic
              Shwedagon Pagoda for five days, along with a number of other sacred items from
              Botataung Pagoda, on the morning of 19 April. On 24 April, the hair relic and
              other revered objects are to be conveyed back to Botataung Pagoda.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The interior of the chamber needs renovation,” said U Sein
              Maw, director of Yangon Region’s Ministry of Religious Affairs. “Water leaks
              from its ceiling,” he added, explaining that the removal of the relic was
              necessary before the repairs could be carried out. (The Irrawaddy)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha’s hair relic will be carried around Yangon in a
              procession for people to venerate, said Dr. Badana Eidi Bala, chair Sayadaw of
              the Yangon Region Sangha Nayaka was cited as saying by the Myanmar Times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“We carried out a consecration ceremony at Shwedagon Pagoda
              with 18,000 sangha [members], and now we will schedule a meeting with every
              sangha [member] . . .<span>  </span>in Yangon Region,”
              said Dr. Badana. “This ceremony for the relic is led by the regional Sangha
              Nayaka and the regional government, so I urge believers to follow.” (Myanmar
              Times)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Critics of the decision, who include conservationists as well
              as members of State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, a government-appointed body of
              high-ranking Buddhist monks that oversees the country’s monastic sangha, have
              expressed concern for the safety of the relic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Should a piece of national heritage like the sacred hair
              relic be out for a long time due to its fragility?” said Daw Moe Moe Lwin,
              director of the Yangon Heritage Trust. “What if it is accidentally damaged
              during the display and procession? I wonder if precautions have been taken.”
              (The Irrawaddy)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She drew a comparison with Sri Lanka’s most sacred Buddhist
              relic, a tooth of the historical Buddha, which is enshrined in a heavily
              guarded room in the Temple of the Sacred Tooth in the city of Kandy. “Even when
              you are in the room, you don’t actually see the tooth. It’s kept in a gold
              casket which contains a series of six caskets of diminishing size,” she
              observed. (The Irrawaddy)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to accounts of its history, Botataung Pagoda was
              first built by the region’s Mon civilization some 2,500 years ago. The pagoda
              was destroyed by British aircraft during the Second World War, although the
              relic casket<span>  </span>was found undamaged in the
              rubble. The pagoda was rebuilt in 1948 after the country regained independence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">U Sein Maw offered assurances that a plan had been put in
              place to ensure the relic is properly protected during thr renovation period.
              “We have been discussing the best way to carefully put the relic casket in the
              car and transport it from Botataung to Shwedagon Pagoda,” he said, noting that
              repairs and renovations for the relic chamber were part of a larger plan to
              restore the entire pagoda, including replacing all the gold on the structure.
              An estimated 50–60 kilograms of gold would be needed to complete the project,
              he added.<span>  </span>(The Irrawaddy)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Myanmar is a predominantly Theravada Buddhist country, with
              80.1 per cent of the population of almost 48 million people identifying as
              Buddhists, according to 2010 data from the Washington, DC-based Pew Research
              Center. Christians, folk religions, and Muslims account for the bulk of the
              remainder. Buddhist monks, venerated throughout Burmese society, are believed
              to number around 500,000, with an estimated 75,000 nuns in the Southeast Asian
              country.</span></p>
