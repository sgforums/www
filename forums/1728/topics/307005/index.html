              <p>Beginners to Buddhism have a hard time; at least for some or most of them.</p>
              <p>There are many metaphors, similes, figuratives and analogies in the Buddhist teachings, namely sutras for example; so many that not all can tell exactly which are real statistics and which are just figurative figures and fictional analogies to illustrate a certain point.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>The most commonly known quote for all or most Buddhists is</p>
              <p>"I shall not attain Buddhahood until all beings are liberated from hell" (it refers broadly to all that are suffering in the 3 evil realms or those who are not yet free from countless cycles of birth and death).</p>
              <p>Now, can hell really be literally empty? I don't know..</p>
              <p>Cos no being with consciousness can escape from being attached to the notion of 'self'. As a result, all sentient beings, think, feel and act in accordance to that self-projected ego, to seek ways to satisfy 'it' and hence have to go through samsaric life and death for all their good and bad deeds.</p>
              <p>At a certain point in time, some may gain enough spiritual wisdom to be free totally after a few rebirths or during their present lifetime. But how is this compared to other countless beings in 3 evil realms or the entire samasaric cycles experienced by all sentient beings in the ten directions?</p>
              <p>Even if at a certain point in time all beings in a certain hell (say Avici hell) is delivered totally by any Bodhisattva or Buddha, many countless 'new' ones will continue be born there to so-called fill in the places that very instant. This is due to karmic forces that no one can prevent or stop.</p>
              <p>So is Kstigarbha Bodhisattva's vow a mere metaphor or a figurative to encourage or comfort all of us?</p>
              <p>If it is just a metaphor or figurative to encourage, comfort or to warn, then what hope can I have?</p>
              <p>It's just like saying 'son, I will not rest till I can see that you know how to really take good care of yourself and at the same time love and care for others like I do for you.'</p>
              <p>But your parents are not immortals, they will die, or they will grow sick and not being able to communicate to you, sometimes totally. What if they die or become totally uncommunicative due to sickness before you really become what they have always hope for you to become?</p>
              <p>So are your parents making empty promises? Was it just a lecture, a warning, a form of encouragement or reassurance?</p>
              <p>The teaching is there, waiting for you to practise. But yet, you are now alone in facing all sorts of temptations and adversity. If you are strong and steadfast in following the teaching, you will survive and grow up to be a useful person. If not, too bad...God (or Buddha) knows what will happen to you...</p>
              <p>Are the vows of Bodhisattvas or Buddhas like a rope, a boat or a ray of light for those who can swim or climb? To me, those who are not as strong in mind and heart are like those with no legs, but hands or vice versa. I don't think anyone can climb a mountain or swim with just two legs or two hands.</p>
              <p>Many times, I feel very confused and helpless about the whole thing as I try to understand it using the 'non-attachment' concept taught in the Diamond sutra: There is no sentient being to save, there is no Bodhisattva to save them. Something like that.</p>
              <p>So during those days I would choose to view the Bodhisattva's vows in a literal way: that one day, all sentient beings in any form of suffering will be helped by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and they shall never have to suffer again. That helps me to feel at peace, that helps me to feel loved and cared for. Cos before anyone really succeeds in attaining non-attachment or anatta, they still are attached to the need for love and concern from others, though in different degrees, in different aspects in life.</p>
              <p>Try it, dear friends who are still struggling in the cultivation of non-attachment and anatta as taught in the Diamond sutra. Believe in the compassionate vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Amitabha Buddha or any Bodhisattva LITERALLY.</p>
              <p>Believe that they are always with you, even if you have not attained non-attachment. And even if at present or throughout your whole life, you still find yourself caring more about yourself than others. As long as you still believe in, somewhere deep inside you, that ultimately, the Law of Cause and Effect spoken by all Buddhas is true, without any deliberate embellishment or distortion, you will one day see the Truth for yourself in time to come.</p>
              <p>Don't hurry, don't panic. But neither should you be lazy. If you are lazy, you will still see the Truth one day, only much, much longer than those who work hard at it, in following Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p>I feel and share your pain, those who are lazy. I feel and share your pain, those who think they are slow. I feel and share your pain, those who still can't achieve non-attachment on their last breaths.</p>
              <p>Your life will never have been lived in vain, if you have heard of the name of any Bodhisattva or Buddha, or simply just Namo Buddhaya. (å�—æ‘©ä½›ï¼‰ Heard, as in just hearing with your ear, no belief at all.</p>
              <p>We will meet some day, cos I have vowed to a Bodhisattva disciple of all Buddhas, be it past, present, about to come, or yet to come.</p>
              <p>Till then, I wholeheartedly wish you all the best in your cultivation. May you succeed in freeing yourself from the bondages of greed, anger/hatred and unwholesome views. May you succeed in becoming a fully-enlightened Buddha.</p>
              <p>Amituofo! :)</p>

              <p>This are so call,Fang Pien fa meng.Buddhism is more than 2500 years old.There are many mixture of culture in it.Very confusing!Many doubt also!</p>
              <p>Truth can doubt and question at! No Budha or Bodhisattva is going to punish you for doubting or questioning.Real gold is not afraid of fire.</p>
              <p>But,my personal opinion is,it is better to learn the very basic of Buddhism,because Dharma can be experience right here and now,not wait after death.For example,the three Dharma seal is Suffering,permanence and non-self.The 4 noble truth and 8 fold path.This kind of Dharma will not give you doubt.Believe or not it is happening in you right now.It is the truth of all beings.It is founded by the Lord Buddha not create by somebody.Truth is discovered not created.</p>
              <p>If you kill the,I, or ego.Then there will be no heaven and hell.No Buddha,no Bodhisattva.</p>

                                            there are also 20 small kalpas. During the 19th small kalpa, sentient 
                                            beings in every world, including the earth world, of the Three Thousand

                                            aeons of kalpas, as a result of the efforts of many Buddhas and 
                                            Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions in the Three Periods (past, present 
                                            and future) to enlighten sentient beings, all sentient beings learn 
                                            to change their wicked ways and lead virtuous lives instead. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When 
                                            many sentient beings transmigrate from the six realms of existence 
                                            into the human realm and successfully received the guidance, and 
                                            when hell has emptied so that there isn't a single sentient being 
                                            left there, then the 20th small kalpa of the Destruction Kalpa starts. 
                                            Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva (<img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/dicangpusa.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="59" height="14">) 
                                            vowed: "As long as hell is not empty, I shall not become Buddha.

              <p>Yah, but if you have read the sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows, you will know that there are many Avici and Abyss hells in different worlds. Our svaha world has its own Avici and Abyss hell and it's the same for other worlds.</p>
              <p>Those who slander the Bodhisattva in thoughts or actions will suffer for so long in 3 evil realms that even after 1000 Buddhas have come and finally gone into Parinibbana, these beings are still suffering very severely for their karma.</p>
              <p>The sutra goes on to say that, even after the Avici and Abyss hells they are in has been disintegrated due to exhaustion of karmic force or Destruction/Void kalpa, they will be reborn in the hells of other worlds.</p>
              <p>Such pain, such suffering...I feel so much for them and for myself, for I have sinned... and am continuing to sin...</p>

                              in all the worlds from the 1st Jhana down to the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, 
                              will transmigrate, each according to his own good karmic seeds of the 
                              past. Some will transmigrate above the 2nd Jhana; some will surpass Three 
                              Fields of Existence (World of Desires, World of Forms, and World of Formless); 
                              and others will arrive at Pure Lands of Buddhas elsewhere. At this time, 
                              the world of sentient beings will be totally ruined. Only then, at the 
                              end of the final phase of the last small kalpa, will the "Three Great 
                              Calamities" occur, destroying all the material worlds. These three calamities 
                              of fire, water and wind will not occur simultaneously, but each will take 
                              its turn. At that time, balance in space will be lost, planets of all 
                              the worlds will leave their orbits, and looking from the earth, one will 
                              see seven suns appear in the sky at the same time. The suns' fiery heat 
                              will burn up all the worlds. The destruction will reach the farthest depths 
                              of the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, including all the worlds of the Three 
                              Thousand Great Chilocosm World of Desires, and even the 1st Jhana of the 
                              World of Forms.</span></p>

                              of the "Great Fire Calamity" comes the "Great Water Calamity". The worlds 
                              from the 2nd Jhana Plane in the World of Form down through the Hell of 
                              Ceaseless Suffering will be engulfed by floodwaters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Next, the Great Wind 
                              Calamity follows. All the worlds below the 3rd Jhana down to the Hell 
                              of Ceaseless Suffering will be blown away like dust. All the materials 
                              will be dispersed into oblivion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">When the above-described 
                              Three Great Calamities destroy the world, each calamity will not be over 
                              in the passing of a single event. Each event will recur one after another. 
                              First, there will be seven Great Fire Calamities followed by one Great 
                              Water Calamity. This sequence of seven Fire and one Water Calamities will 
                              recur seven times, after which the Great Wind Calamity will finally occur. 
                              So altogether, there will be 56 Great Fire Calamities, seven Great Water 
                              Calamities, and one Great Wind Calamity, making a total of 64 calamities. 
                              When all the worlds go through the course of these Great Calamities and 
                              enter the Void Kalpa, then it is truly "End of the World". </span></p>

              <p>Seriously, I doubt If the time period between the 19th small kalpa and the 20th one is sufficient enough for all beings to be guided by bodhisattvas and Buddhas of all ten directions.</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">1) SW: the key word is Before instead of between. "<span style="FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-FAMILY: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: x-small"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Before</span> the 19th small kalpa...."</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>Furthermore, if we are indeed in the 9th small kalpa of the Existence era, we have wait for a very unimaginably long time before the Destruction era comes and for it to end.</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">2) SW: what u mean?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">so "9th small kalpa of the Existence era" is like our "world" is 29 years old out of 80 years lifespan. 20 years for formation/birth; 20 for existence/old age; 20 for destruction/sickness; 20 for ending/death. so 41 years old is starting of destruction/sickness.  at such an age onward, our 3 posions normally are more unbothered or çœ‹å¾—å¼€ already, hence the metaphor in another perspective.</span></p>
              <p>And even when some of us manage to be reborn as humans after the Destruction era, I wonder how many will hear of the Dharmma and be able to benefit directly to gain liberation from samsaric existence in that one lifetime.</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">3) SW: after? what after? no more after already mah. <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">BEFORE</span> destruction era, all go to 2nd Jhana heaven already. like 40 plus person, got some "stillness" in them per se.</span></p>
              <p>Some of them may have heavy karmic burdens and so even they may hear of the Dharmma, they cannot understand or believe. Then isn't it  useless or futile in a way?</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff">4) SW: no more "them" liao mah.</span> <span style="COLOR: #0000ff">unless, those transfered to other threefold world. yes, "heavy karmic burdens" still remain. you have to see the point from Our saha world(ourself) and the point from Other threefold world(others). there's a metaphoric understanding.</span></p>

              <p>It depends on which tradition of buddhism. In the mahayana and vajrayana buddhism, buddha nature is said to exist in ALL sentient beings in samsara. Therefore one will be able to become buddha no matter what someday in future. However buddha nature is not emphasized/not taught in theravada buddhism(correct me if im wrong). One needs cultivation and practice in order to gain Arhatship, therefore saying that buddha nature is not within us but we must find it through cultivation.</p>
              <p><br>I sort of agree with theravada point of view, because i dont think human has done evil just as simply as hatred,greed and ignorance. The reason why we are in samsara is because we do not have a pure nature. If we have buddha nature, wouldnt we all become buddhas now since we have Sakyamuni buddha to enlighten us? People might argue what 'buddha nature' meant was that we all have the potential to become buddha someday, but then i feel that they key to buddha nature is still cultivation and to put buddha's word into practice.</p>
              <p>The world is full of negative energies. Even if we have buddha nature, it is very unlikely we will find buddha nature by chance. Therefore the simplest thing we can do is cultivate compassion, wisdom, try to cease desire and help others base on our capabilities. If we can do that, that is the key.</p>

              <p>The Buddha nature concept, seriously is a mystery to me. But deeply I still believe in it. Why? To put it very shortly, why do some people continue to do evil despite all efforts by people to help me and why do some people continue to do good despite all efforts by people to humiliate and/or torture him?</p>
              <p>The only reason I think of is some people's Buddha nature are less tainted by delusions compared to others hence the observed difference.</p>
              <p>And why some people less tainted by delusions? I don't know. But I will continue to find out more about it.</p>

              <p>It depends on which tradition of buddhism. In the mahayana and
                                                      vajrayana buddhism, buddha nature is said to exist in ALL sentient
                                                      beings in samsara. Therefore one will be able to become buddha no
                                                      matter what someday in future. However buddha nature is not
                                                      emphasized/not taught in theravada buddhism(correct me if im
                                                      wrong). One needs cultivation and practice in order to gain
                                                      Arhatship, therefore saying that buddha nature is not within us but
                                                      we must find it through cultivation.</p>
              <p><br> I sort of agree with theravada point of view, because i dont think
                                                      human has done evil just as simply as hatred,greed and ignorance.
                                                      The reason why we are in samsara is because we do not have a pure
                                                      nature. If we have buddha nature, wouldnt we all become buddhas now
                                                      since we have Sakyamuni buddha to enlighten us? People might argue
                                                      what 'buddha nature' meant was that we all have the potential to
                                                      become buddha someday, but then i feel that they key to buddha
                                                      nature is still cultivation and to put buddha's word into
                                                      practice.</p>
              <p>The world is full of negative energies. Even if we have buddha
                                                      nature, it is very unlikely we will find buddha nature by chance.
                                                      Therefore the simplest thing we can do is cultivate compassion,
                                                      wisdom, try to cease desire and help others base on our
                                                      capabilities. If we can do that, that is the key.</p>

              <p>Buddha Nature is not just a term pointing out to the potential in all of us to attain Buddhahood, even though this potential is implied and intrinsically linked to it (our originally radiant citta).</p>
              <p>Buddha Nature is talking about our True Nature, the ultimate reality. Which is luminous and empty.</p>
              <p>In this sense Theravada definitely talks about Buddha Nature too, even though they do not use the same name. They call it the Shining Mind. Our Buddha Mind is already shining, but obscured due to our defilements. That is why we are still in samsara.</p>

The Vibhajyavaadins, who were close to or identical with the Theravaadins, held that the fundamental or root-nature (<em>Muula-bhaava</em>) of <em>citta</em> was brightly shining (Skt. Prabhaasvara; Bareau, 1955: 175), while the Mahaasaa.nghikas said the same of the ‘own-nature’ (<em>svabhaava</em>) of citta (Bareau, 1955: 67-8), and the Dharmaguptakas said this of the ‘nature’ (<em>bhaava</em>)
                                                      of the citta (Bareau, 1955: 194). The Sarvaastivaadin Vaibhaas.sikas,
                                                      however, disagreed (Bareau, 1955: 147). In the Mahaayaana, the concept
                                                      became one of great importance. The <em>A.s.tasaahasrikaa</em> Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, a text from around the first centuries BC
                                                      or AD, identifies it with the compassion-based ‘thought of awakening’ (<em>bodhi-citta</em>), the aspiration to attain Buddhahood, for the sake of liberating all beings.  Of this it says, ‘that <em>citta</em> is no <em>citta</em>, since it is by nature brightly shining (<em>taccittam-acittam: prak.rtiscittasya prabhaasvaara</em>)’
                                                      (Vaidya, 1960: 3, cf. Conze, 1973: 84). Here, the link with compassion
                                                      tallies with the ‘early Sutta’ linking of the lovingkindness to the
                                                      radiant <em>citta</em> (Para.10.22).  The unusual nature of this <em>citta</em> is here signalled by it being termed a non-<em>citta citta</em>.  The connection to <em>bodhi</em>,
                                                      awakening or enlightenment, is also found in the ‘early Suttas’, if not
                                                      quite in the same way. Arahatship is, of course, a kind of <em>bodhi</em>, and the seven ‘factors of <em>bodhi</em>’, which conduce to liberation, are developed by a <em>citta</em> which is without defilements (S. V. 93), I.e. with its radiance uncovered.</p>
              <p><br>(10.34)   The uncovered brightly shining <em>citta </em>is
                                                      thus the ideal springboard from which to attain awakening, such that it
                                                      can be seen as a kind of enlightenment-potential. Appropriately, one
                                                      strand of Mahaayaana thought identifies the brightly shining <em>citta</em> with the <em>Tathaagata-garbha</em>: the Buddha-embryo, or Buddha-potential which is the Buddha-nature (<em>Buddha-dhaatu</em>) present in all beings.  Indeed, it is awareness of this which prompts the arising of the ‘thought of awakening’.  The <em>La.nkaavataara Suutra </em>(p.77) says of the <em>Tathaagata-garbha</em> that it is ‘by nature brightly shining  and pure (<em>prak.rti-prabhaasvara-visuddy</em>-), originally pure (-<em>adi-visuddha</em>)’.  It is ‘naturally pure (<em>prak.rti-parisuddho</em>)
                                                      but it appears impure as it is defiled by stains which arrive’ and is
                                                      ’enveloped in the garments of personality-factors, (sensory) elements
                                                      and sense-spheres, and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred,
                                                      delusion and imagining (-<em>parikalpa</em>)’ [20].  As discernment is a personality-factor, and is generally equivalent to <em>citta</em>, this implies that the <em>Tathaagata-garbha</em> Is not a normal kind of ‘<em>citta</em>’, just as the <em>bodhi-citta</em> is not.</p>
              <p><br>(10.35)   The <em>Sriimaala-devii Simhanaada Suutra </em>sees the Buddha-potential as that which aspires for <em>nirvaa.na</em> (Paul, 1980: ch.13), while the <em>Ratnagotra-vibhaaga</em> sees it as replete with the qualities of Buddha hood (vv.51, 84). It is
                                                      both ‘since beginningless time naturally present’ and ‘perfected
                                                      through proper cultivation’ (v.149). It is already present, ‘the
                                                      immaculate true nature to which nothing need be added and from which
                                                      nothing need be taken’ (v. 113). Yet it has to be separated from
                                                      accompanying impurities, just as gold-ore has to be refined so as to
                                                      bring out and manifest the intrinsic purity of gold (v.47). Its
                                                      relation to the defilements is much as in Theravaada thought. The <em>Ratnagotra-vibhaaga</em> says that karma and the defilements are based on unmethodical
                                                      attention, that this is based on ‘the mind’s purity’, yet it also says
                                                      that this ‘true nature of mind’ is itself without further basis (vv.
                                                      56-7): a step beyond the Theravaada view. In fact, in Tathaagata-garbha
                                                      thought, the Buddha-potential becomes the basis of all existence. The <em>La.nkaavaatara Suutra</em> says that it ‘holds within it the cause for both good and evil, and by
                                                      it all forms of existence are produced. Like an actor it takes on a
                                                      variety of forms …’ (p.220). The <em>Ratnagotra-vibhaaga</em> equates it with the subject of the following verse: <br><br>The Realm (<em>dhaatu</em>) is without beginning in time,<br>It is the common basis (<em>aasraya</em>) of all states.<br>Because it exists, there also exist<br>All places of rebirth and full attainment of <em>nirvaa.na</em>.<br>(Holmes &amp; Holmes, 1985: 72-3).<br><br>In the <em>La.nkaavataara Suutra</em>, the Buddha-potential is actually seen as eternal and permanent but, while it may seem like a metaphysical Self (<em>aatman</em>), or eternal creator, it is not so, for it is the same as emptiness (p.778), i.e. lack of inherent Self-nature.  The <em>La.nkaavataara Suutra</em> (p.221) also equates it with the <em>aalaya-vijn~naana</em> or ‘home-discernment’ of Yogaacaarin thought.  This is a similar concept to that of the Theravaadin <em>bhava.nga citta</em>, being part of a system which also includes conception (<em>manas</em>)
                                                      and the six forms of sense-discernments (See Harvey, 1990: 107-09). As
                                                      in Theravaada thought, it is conception which is the agent of
                                                      generating defilements. Unlike <em>bhava.nga</em>, though, the <em>alaaya</em> is seen as projecting out of itself the apparently external objects
                                                      which are taken by the sense-discernments. The Theravaada view, here,
                                                      is simply that past karma affects which objects are <em>noticed</em>, and conception and cognition then interpret and misinterpret these objects.</p>
              <p><br>(10.36)
                                                      It can thus be seen that the Buddha-potential, a key concept of the
                                                      Mahaayaana, which became particularly central in Zen Buddhism, has
                                                      links to both the ‘early Suttas’ and to the later Theravaada. While the
                                                      Mahaayaana makes more explicit use of this type of concept, analogues
                                                      to it are found in the early texts and the scholastic Theravaada
                                                      tradition. The radiant <em>citta</em> as an enlightenment potential is also a part of the living Theravaada meditation tradition.<br><em>(<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 100%;">e&amp;oe</span>)</em></p>
