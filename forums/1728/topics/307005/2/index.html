              <p><br>Because it is similar, therefore why the great praise heaped on Earth-Store Bodhisattva? Seriously even when reading the Universal Dharma Door highlighting the vows and skilful means of Avalokitesvaraya (Guan Yin) Bodhisattva, I have not yet come across praises as great as that for Earth-Store Bodhisattva from the Buddha.</p>
              <p>All Bodhisattvas practise fillial piety, compassion and wisdom, so why did the Buddha promote and praise Earth-Store Bodhisattva to the saha world and even entrust the deliverance of all beings in the saha world to him?</p>
              <p>If you say it's that Earth-Store Bodhisattva has great affinity with us, isn't it the same for Guan Yin? And maybe all Bodhisattvas from all directions?</p>
              <p>I do not understand. See, when you are praticising the Bodhisattva way, it is imperative that you jie yuan or establish good karmic ties with every sentient being, so how is that it appears as if only certain Bodhisattvas can have greater affinities with the saha world?</p>
              <p>All Bodhisattvas go by the Four Unlimited Vows to save all sentient beings, so that includes every world that has sentient beings in any direction. To do that, you definitely have to jie yuan with all, so that all will listen to you at a suitable time when you preach the Dharma to them</p>
              <p>So it's quite hard to understand when I hear from Venerables telling us that certain Buddha or Bodhisattva has no 'yuan' with us, therefore they cannot help us.</p>

              <p>1) I'm not sure if you have compared what is recorded in sutra of Earth-Store Bodhisattva Original Vows with that in Universal Dharma Door. Cos if you had, you would understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
              <p>2) That is the explanation that I have heard from Master Chin Kung, but I still have my doubts when I wish to understand further.</p>
              <p>3 &amp; 4) This is indeed a funny thing: In the human world, I can understand the need for specialisation, but for Bodhisattvas as well? I have mentioned that all Bodhisattvas' virtue of fillial piety are equal in levels of practice or else they would not have been respected as Bodhisattvas. To teach others you must be better than others a whole lot more. So we know heavenly beings are also filial people when they were alive as humans, but why are they not Bodhisattvas? The reason is their filial piety is not up to standard when compared with Bodhisattvas and not all choose to cultivate bodhicitta.</p>
              <p>5) I think you missed out something: I mentioned all listened to the Bodhisattva at a suitable time, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> all listen <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at one time. </span></strong>That is a huge difference in my opinion.</p>
              <p>I also agree that the 4 Universal vows ultimately point to awakening and liberating our own mind.</p>
              <p>However, when explaining to secular people or beginner Buddhists, we have to be careful and detailed in explaining how this is connected with saving or guiding real people in our lives. If not, they will probably spend too much time meditating and questioning themselves as they think this is all about 'me'.</p>
              <p>For example, <span style="color: #0000ff;">ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰è‡ªå·±å¿ƒé‡Œå¤´çš„ä¼—ç”Ÿæ— è¾¹è¦�å�‘æ„¿åº¦ </span><span style="color: #000000;">: What does it mean? Save your own thoughts? How is this different with </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰è‡ªå¿ƒçƒ¦æ�¼æ— é‡�è¦�å�‘æ„¿æ–­. </span><span style="color: #000000;">As for vow 3 and 4, it's even more profound...</span></p>
              <p>6) Seriously I don't know who I have yuan with. Which Bodhisattva should I follow?</p>
              <p>Let's assume I come from a clean slate whereby I have heard of the names of many great Bodhisattvas and their sutras, and noticed they all talk about the same thing. So should I anyhow tikam and follow one based on instinct? Is it really ok to adopt a tikam attitude when choosing which to follow?</p>
              <p>If you say fillial piety is important, then all should be following Earth-Store and not others. If you say compassion is important, then all should be following Guan Yin. If you say wisdom is important, than all should be following Manjusri Bodhisattva. But yet everyone chooses differently based on their own 'feel'. This shows that some choose based on logic and reasoning, and some chooses based on 'feel'.</p>
              <p>And furthermore, filial piety involves compassion too and compassion involves being filial to your parents too. Finally, wisdom encompasses both filial piety and compassion. So it's the same thing, why is it made to sound like they are three different things?</p>
              <p>Anyway some can also choose Maitreya Bodhisattva as he too can be regarded a representation of the filial piety virtue. Remember he's gonna become a Buddha soon. So logically speaking, his filial piety virtue is complete as this filial piety nature has been perfected to the acme, his Buddha nature has already fully awakened, therefore he could attain Buddhahood. So if you tell me that Earth Store Bodhisattva alone should represent filial piety, then how about the rest? Don't all Bodhisattvas represent filial piety in their own right, ways and from their past vows?</p>
              <p>As a result of the above brainstorming with myself, I told myself that I  choose again, after finding out more about the various Bodhisattvas and their core teachings. I don't want to just really choose based on logic or 'feel' alone. In the past I had followed my mother when I was in primary and secondary school days as she has always believed in Guan Yin Bodhisattva and chants the name devoutly. But later she came to know a relative from her maternal family who is a devout practitioner of Amitabha Buddha's Pureland Dharma Door and from there I was introduced to Amitabha Buddha.</p>
              <p>For beginners, it is not easy to choose. Especially when they hear about Master Chin Kung's explanation that they should follow Earth Store Bodhisattva as he 'specialises' in filial piety. Then later they should follow Guan Yin for compassion and so on...It confuses and frightens me to learn from so many...</p>
              <p>Actually I personally feel that Sakayamuni Buddha specialises in filial piety as well, and so does all past, present and future Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. So I don't understand how the term 'specialisation' or 'representation' is really applied or interpreted in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>So I decided to finally choose Amitabha Buddha for 'simplicity', one represent everything, all in one. Amitabha Buddha has perfected in his learning and practice of every human virtue to its greatest height of achievement; all these virtues has achieved full awakening.</p>
              <p>Let me summarise: so your yuan with a particular Bodhisattva is not entirely a personal issue. Why? Cos you directly or indirectly influence others with your choice.</p>
              <p>Remember how all sentient beings are essentially 'of one body and mind'? So for those who have heard of so many Bodhisattvas' names but are hard put to choose which one? What kind of advice should be given to them?</p>

              <p>3 &amp; 4) This is indeed a funny thing: In the human world, I can understand the need for specialisation, but for Bodhisattvas as well? I have mentioned that all Bodhisattvas' virtue of fillial piety are equal in levels of practice or else they would not have been respected as Bodhisattvas. To teach others you must be better than others a whole lot more. So we know heavenly beings are also filial people when they were alive as humans, but why are they not Bodhisattvas? The reason is their filial piety is not up to standard when compared with Bodhisattvas and not all choose to cultivate bodhicitta.</p>
              <p>5) I think you missed out something: I mentioned all listened to the Bodhisattva at a suitable time, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> all listen <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at one time.</span></strong> That is a huge difference in my opinion.</p>
              <p>I also agree that the 4 Universal vows ultimately point to awakening and liberating our own mind.</p>
              <p>However, when explaining to secular people or beginner Buddhists, we have to be careful and detailed in explaining how this is connected with saving or guiding real people in our lives. If not, they will probably spend too much time meditating and questioning themselves as they think this is all about 'me'.</p>
              <p>For example, <span style="color: #0000ff;">ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰è‡ªå·±å¿ƒé‡Œå¤´çš„ä¼—ç”Ÿæ— è¾¹è¦�å�‘æ„¿åº¦</span> <span style="color: #000000;">: What does it mean? Save your own thoughts? How is this different with</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰è‡ªå¿ƒçƒ¦æ�¼æ— é‡�è¦�å�‘æ„¿æ–­.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">As for vow 3 and 4, it's even more profound...</span></p>
              <p>6) Seriously I don't know who I have yuan with. Which Bodhisattva should I follow?</p>
              <p>Let's assume I come from a clean slate whereby I have heard of the names of many great Bodhisattvas and their sutras, and noticed they all talk about the same thing. So should I anyhow tikam and follow one based on instinct? Is it really ok to adopt a tikam attitude when choosing which to follow?</p>
              <p>If you say fillial piety is important, then all should be following Earth-Store and not others. If you say compassion is important, then all should be following Guan Yin. If you say wisdom is important, than all should be following Manjusri Bodhisattva. But yet everyone chooses differently based on their own 'feel'. This shows that some choose based on logic and reasoning, and some chooses based on 'feel'.</p>
              <p>And furthermore, filial piety involves compassion too and compassion involves being filial to your parents too. Finally, wisdom encompasses both filial piety and compassion. So it's the same thing, why is it made to sound like they are three different things?</p>

              <p>well, the word "specialize/representaion" is just spoken for the sake of saying to different sentient being who still have discrimination. if beings have no discrimination, we can just say if one specialize in filial piety all the way, they are no different from practicing compassion or wisdom All the way. Core realisation is the same.</p>
              <p>u know if Buddhas don't use one bodhisattva name like "Earth Store" to represent filial piety/ultimate respect, then Buddha don't have any name to represent already. without a name, how are beings going to understand? like in school u use "maths" to reprepresent the subject of maths. we don't use maths to represent science. so it's just a name.</p>
              <p>then if i use Guan Yin to represent filial piety, then you will ask why not use Manjusri to represent. wah like than i never ending. then if u say, why not use all names. but like that, it can be more confusing with all the names, no? like maths to mean literature + maths + science etcs, also cannot right?</p>
              <p>simply put - <em>yuan</em> is in the sense, you feel more close or you feel more comfortable with. no additional meaning.</p>
              <p>yes, in deed focusing on Amitabha Buddha is good. Amita simply mean Infinity or All Buddhas. It's using One Buddha to represent all buddhas. good huh.</p>
              <p>ps: though using this kind of replying, i may miss out replying all the paragraphs, as u wrote quite a lot...hehe.</p>

              <p>Hmm..I can understand your logic there. However, for human virtues, it cannot be compared directly to the 'maths is not represented as science' analogy.</p>
              <p>Human virtues and flaws are far more complicated and profound than any known or unknown secular topic of knowledge, that is why Bodhisattvas take so long to perfect them.</p>
              <p>Actually I feel close to most Bodhisattvas and Buddhas' names, but I would generally find it easier to relate on both a rational and emotional level, names like ä¸€åˆ‡ä¼—ç”Ÿå–œè§�ä½› than say åœ°è—� or è§‚éŸ³.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking I still don't feel close to Amitabha Buddha at all, even till now when I'm still practising it, but I feel close to Earth-Store Bodhisattva because of his great compassion to delay Buddhahood and to continously make new and great vows to help all suffering beings with inexplicably messy and negative karmic entanglements.</p>
              <p>But because I want to believe in the words of Sakayamuni Buddha and at the same time understand that Zen, Tien Tai or Hua Yen's way of awakening the Buddha nature is way too deep for me, I chose this Amitabha Buddha Pureland dharma door rather quickly.</p>
              <p>The yuan that you or most Buddhists speak of sounds as if it is based on feeling alone. But I wish to speak of and understand 'yuan' (affinity) in a way whereby one learns as much as possible about the choices before them and then makes an informed decision. Unless there was no choice at all to begin with. I do know that this may be unique to me, but I also wish to help others who may be choosing, like me too. :)</p>

              <p>yes, of course it's not exactly the same, hence it's an analogy, it's to give a rough idea, it's not that picky. moreover, i'm also refering to the <strong>purpose of "naming".</strong> as normally, when people mention the name Guan yin, they normally, reminds them of compassion, as of Manjushri to wisdom for example.</p>
              <p>i can even use apple as analogy. when people say apple, it normally, have this first impression of a red round fruit etc. but on a further investigation there can also have green colored apple per se.</p>
              <p>so different people have different taste. so we have maths refering to number operation, as to Guan yin to compassion. while we have Subjects refering to an overall naming, as to Bodhisattva to Guan yin, Manjushri, Earth Store etcs and Buddha to Amitabha, Shakyamuni etc. like in school we learn about different subjects, but somebody may prefer or is better in literature as they have this emotional connection, while others prefer or is better in maths as they have this rational connection. all this are a form of yuan in itself.</p>
              <p>all and all, different people have different mind set. it's difficult to one size fit all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultimately</span>, it's just an empty name, that need to be transcended. it's the meaning that need to be addressed. we have to get pass the thinking that Earth store is "someone" out there.</p>
              <p>if one can think in this way while not rejecting the need for the different kind of bodhisattvas for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conventional</span> usage, you'll have realise the idea of<strong> non-duality</strong>.  </p>

              <p>I understand your point but it sounds like Buddhism is too chin chai as in anything goes. Like this also can, like that also can. Sometimes this cannot, that cannot. I blur liao...</p>
              <p>I'm asking not just for myself, but also for those who have asked me about why Buddhists pray to so many Gods or Bodhisattvas. Even after giving them the explanation that it is a personal choice as to which Bodhisattva they wish to emulate as long as the individual is comfortable with his/her own choices, they gave me the look as if Buddhists are cult members or look very doubtful or puzzled.</p>
              <p>One point about the school analogy, we cannot choose to study only one subject loh. I personally am weak in maths, if possible, I hope to study everything but maths. But yet no choice, I have to study maths.</p>
              <p>To me, even Confucius is too high a role model for me to follow liao, much less talk about Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>And to clarify, I'm not trying to say that one size fits all works. I'm trying to say that sometimes too many choices creates confusion. Cos at least a very large proportion of Buddhists, beginners or otherwise, cannot really attain true non-duality in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>Their practice of 'non-duality' is at most about keeping quiet when they are asked for their views on differences between this and that Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>So members of the public or beginner Buddhists wouldn't know if they are keeping quiet due to ignorance about what they are practising or have really achieved non-duality.</p>

              <p>Isn't it good to have more bodhisatvas and enlightened being around.<br>If you have no ç¼˜ with this bodhisatva, other bodhisatva still can help you. When you are practicing the bodhisatva teaching or dharma door, you are benefiting from the bodhisatva already.<br>All bodhisatva are compassion towards sentient beings like mother care about the children. They will try their very best to help us, manifest in many forms for example deity, dragon, humans that suit people of different conditions. When we pray to let's say amitabha buddha, by just a chant of the name will create a link or a yuan for amitabha buddha to help you.<br><br>If this is your friends' definition of cult, then I really wonder what their "<em>religion</em>" teach about.</p>

              <p>Isn't it good to have more bodhisatvas and enlightened being around.<br>If you have no ç¼˜ with this bodhisatva, other bodhisatva still can help you. When one is chanting a bodhisatva's name or mantra, practice his dharma door, you are benefiting from the bodhisatva already.<br>All bodhisatva are compassion towards sentient beings like mother care about the children. They will try their very best to help us, manifest in many forms for example deity, dragon, humans that suit people of different conditions. When we pray to let's say amitabha buddha, by just a chant of the name will create a link or a yuan for amitabha buddha to help you.<br><br>If this is your friends' definition of cult, then I really wonder what their "<em>religion</em>" teach about.</p>

              <p>But for mainstream Buddhism, most Buddhists in their lifetimes would be most familiar with the names of Guan Yin, Earth-Store, Manjusri, Sakayamuni Buddha and Amitabha Buddha.</p>
              <p>Just these 5 already hard to explain to beginners who ask for advice on who to choose loh. Not forgetting the fact I'm a beginner as well.</p>
              <p>If you ask a person who believes in Guan Yin, he/she would advise you to try to chant Guan Yin's name or Guan Yin's sutra. If you ask a person who believes in Manjusri, you would have to practise anatta or emptiness. So on and so forth.</p>
              <p>Like that, the beginner blur like siao liao.  Let's hope I am the only beginner who thinks and feels like that. That would be good. If not, I hope to help those who are like me, standing at the crossroads leading to the Five Great Names.</p>
              <p>Some say learn from Earth-Store cos he specialise in or represent filial piety and filial piety is much needed for people of our times, cos it is observed that people do not know how or don't want to care for their parents. But then Guan Yin don't practise filial piety or is in no capacity to represent filial piety meh, some would ask.</p>
              <p>I don't want to always give generic or enigmatic answers to beginners. I wish deeply to think in the shoes of these group of beginners.</p>
              <p>I wish to be able to share with them personal experiences when one happens to be a situation of selecting who to learn from.</p>
              <p>Only after sharing my personal process of choosing who to follow, then the rest is indeed up to them to decide.</p>
              <p>My emphasis is on informed choice. Striking a balance between rationale and emotional appeal.</p>

              <p>I'm asking not just for myself, but also for those who have asked me about why Buddhists pray to so many Gods or Bodhisattvas. Even after giving them the explanation that it is a personal choice as to which Bodhisattva they wish to emulate as long as the individual is comfortable with his/her own choices, they gave me the look as if Buddhists are cult members or look very doubtful or puzzled.</p>

              <p>like that cannot chin chai already. praying-type teaching are more suitable for Ah Gong, Ah Ma type.</p>
              <p>i presume these are some what educated people? to such "educated" people, proper best to use basic buddhism teaching (refer link). it's normally found in distributions.i learn this in the beginning. it's not so superstition.</p>

              <p>but as they investigate, superstition or not would be something else. :)<a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/be_a_lamp_upon_yourself.htm"></a></p>
              <p>moreover, the "subject" analogy (which was from old Master Chin Kung actually), would be more rational to them, i think. it's about not seeing the different bodhisattvas as someone or entity that need to be worshipped, but it's about a practice of something wholesome. and that if they practice boundless compassion like Guan Yin, they are also Guan Yin in a way. Any people who practice boundless compassion is Guan Yin.</p>
              <p>thus learn that if of any of the ten prefections, one can concentrate on practicing one of them all the way. ie boundless loving kindness, if practice all the way to it's <strong>core essence</strong>, then it's also the prefection, yes perfection of All the ten perfections altogether, includng transcendent wisdom, giving, endurance, energy, persistent, morality, renunciation,  equanimity etc. <a href="http://www.simhas.org/basics15.html">http://www.simhas.org/basics15.html</a></p>
              <p>meaning, one who reached the core, will automatically realised or conduct the rest. they are inseperatable from the Buddhanature.   </p>
              <p>so non-duality is equanimity. filial piety is under morality. filial piety can be ultimatly refering to respecting All sentient beings as ur parent.</p>
              <p>i choose wisdom to go all the way. my sister in law, wish to choose endurance. some may choose giving/renouciation. i say go all the way. eventually, u will reach realisation.</p>
              <p>since study too many subject is confusing, might as well pick one and go all the way. this way of concentrating actually helps calm/clear the mind to finally absorble the rest.</p>

              <p>As I said, human nature is simply a set of psychological, biological conditioning and behaviors. Buddha nature is unconditioned and ever present, and is the 'original face before you were born'. Without Buddha Nature there is no consciousness to begin with. The basic sentience and consciousness depends on Buddha nature.</p>
