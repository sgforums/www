              <p><strong>Arctic Ice Melt has Reversed</strong></p>
              <p>One of the most dramatic results of the record cold over much of the planet is the reversal of the much-reported melt of the icebergs in the Arctic Ocean. Last autumn the world was alarmed to hear from certain climatologists that the ice in the Arctic had melted to its "lowest levels on record.” What was carefully omitted from those scare stories was the fact that those records only date back as far as 1972, and that there is anthropological and geological evidence of much greater melts in the past.</p>
              <p>Now, as a result of the recent record cold weather, the ice is back. According to Gilles Langis, a senior forecaster with the Canadian Ice Service in Ottawa, the Arctic winter has been so severe the ice has not only recovered, it is actually 10 to 20 cm thicker in many places than at this time last year.</p>
              <p>What few people know and what the Global Warming lobby seems at pains to keep known is the fact that there is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the ocean is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean. The thickness is not one of the universal constants, never was.</p>

              <p>This year began with a severe spell of winter weather in <a title="China" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/themes/?Theme=China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">China</span></span></a>. Observers characterized it as the largest natural disaster to hit China in decades. By the end of January, blizzards and cold temperatures had killed 60 people and caused millions to lose electric service. Nearly a million buildings were damaged and airports had to close. Hong Kong had the second-longest cold spell since 1885. A temperature of 33.6 degrees Fahrenheit was barely higher than the record low of 32 degrees F set in 1893.</p>
              <p>Other countries in Asia also experienced record cold. In February, cold in the northern half of Vietnam wiped out 40 percent of the rice crop and killed 33,000 head of livestock. In <a title="India" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/themes/?Theme=India"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">India</span></span></a>, the city of Mumbai recorded the lowest temperatures of the last 40 years. Across India, there was more frost damage to crops than at any other time in the last 30 years.</p>

              <p>as for case 2, i just heard a news on nokia company and i felt pity for the employers, who may be on trouble of being lay off due to poor business. but then again, they were once very hot. so fortune really are not forever. it's <strong>impermance</strong>. and so will the business of iphone in one day.  </p>

              <p>Yep.. but we must be aware of the ill effects of gambling, its so easy to get addicted. Just 1 try of gambling can make a person addicted for life.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, its difficult for someone who never gamble before to understand.</p>
              <p>Some ppl think just gamble one or two times with friend who ask them to go is alright. Actually it could be otherwise. What could make matters worse is if someone wins money on his/her first few tries</p>

In the form and formless worlds the relationship of the delusions to the Truths follows the same order with the exception of hatred in relation to all four Truths, since hatred must be eliminated before one can enter .
