            <div class='col-md body'><p>During the retreat at Jangchubling Monastery in India in March 2000,<br>Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche solely received the Chod tantra empowerment as<br>well as the dharma instrument from His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon<br>Chetsang Rinpoche in His Holiness’s retreat room. It was too pitch<br>dark to see anything when the lama led Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche the way<br>from Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche’s retreat room to that of His Holiness<br>Chetsang Rinpoche. At the time of the perfect completion of the<br>empowerment and transmission of teaching upon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche<br>from His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche in His Holiness’s retreat room,<br>thunder growled in the sky above the retreat room and His Holiness<br>immediately foretold that Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche’s dharma activities<br>would flourish and come to perfection in the future, thus benefiting<br>more sentient beings. Later on when Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche was on way<br>back to the retreat room after receiving the empowerment and<br>transmission of teaching from His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche, the dark<br>clouds disappeared and the sky became so clear that the moon and stars<br>were particularly brilliant, which is a very auspicious sign. Human<br>bones that are made for the dharma instruments represent impermanence<br>to remind people that there is nothing but only bones left after they<br>die, and therefore there is nothing worth being attached to! The<br>dharma instrument (made of the tibia bone of a young woman who had<br>died from an accident), which Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche uses during<br>conduction of the Chod rituals was the one that His Holiness, Rinchen<br>Dorjee Rinpoche’s root Guru, he used for performing Chod (photos 1, 8,<br>13). In 2006, His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche bestowed<br>upon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche this Dharma instrument, symbolizing that<br>Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche has directly received the Chod of Drikung<br>Kagyu tradition. Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche ever enlightened that there<br>will be more and more people attending the Chod puja if the conduction<br>of Chod ritual could be completed perfectly to transfer the<br>consciousness of the deceased.<br><br>For the years, Most Venerable Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche conducts Chod<br>puja regularly in Taiwan. At present, Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche conducts<br>Chod pujas once per month in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is always<br>attended by more than 1000 people, including those unable to speak,<br>and those unable to move and suffering from serious ill or cancer Some<br>followers even take flights from distant places such as United States,<br>Japan, India, and Holland etc to attend the pujas. Many cancer<br>patients, and those with other serious medical disorders or chronic<br>diseases, have had their conditions improved or even cured by<br>attending Chod pujas.<br><br>http://www.gloje.org/en/event_calendar<br><br>The Most Venerable Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche, the Vajra Master of the<br>Glorious Jewel Buddhist Center, is the root disciple of His Holiness<br>The 37th Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche (7th reincarnation).<br>Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche has performed several retreats at<br>Jangchubling, India, under His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche’s personal<br>supervision and received from him the heart of Mahamudra and other<br>Drikung empowerments. In April 1999, His Holiness held a grand<br>enthronement ceremony for Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche and bestowed a<br>ceremonial hat and garment upon him. In the face of all the Rinpoches<br>and lamas at the monastery, Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche was officially<br>ordained as a Drikung Guru and the only ngakpa guru of han ancestry in<br>the history of Drikung Kagyu Order of Tibetan Buddhism. Both Most<br>Venerable Tenzin Nyima Rinpoche and Most Venerable Yunga Rinpoche of<br>the Drikung Kagyu Lineage are also the root gurus of Rinchen Dorjee<br>Rinpoche. Even though these two great Rinpoches are in long-term<br>retreats and usually do not meet with visitors, they still personally<br>transmitted empowerments and terma teachings to Rinchen Dorjee<br>Rinpoche. Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche is the only lay disciple of Most<br>Venerable Tenzin Nyima Rinpoche. Furthermore, in 2005, Most Venerable<br>Yunga Rinpoche confirmed and recognized Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche to<br>have attained the siddhi of the Spranbrala Yoga in Mahamudra practice.<br><br>Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche established “The Glorious Jewel Buddhist<br>Center” in 1997 to propogate Buddhism in Taiwan. “Glorious Jewel”<br>(Ratna Shri) was the ordain name of the founder of the Drikung Kagyu<br>Lineage, Lord Jigten Sumgon. His Holiness Drikung Kagyu Chetsang took<br>this ordain name and bestowed it upon the center. Additionally, His<br>Holiness personally wrote the authorization for “The Glorious Jewel<br>Buddhist Center” to disseminate the Drikung doctrine of orthodox<br>Buddhism on behalf of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage. Taking up nearly 1000<br>square meters in Taipei city and with almost one thousand disciples,<br>it has now become the biggest Drikung Kagyu center in both size and<br>scope. His Holiness came to Taiwan in 2004 to preside over the<br>center’s inauguration ceremony and personally wrote a Long Life Prayer<br>for Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche at the request of the disciples. In 2006,<br>His Holiness explicitly pronounced: “Yen (Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche’s<br>family name) Rinpoche is the best disciple I’ve ever had. His<br>achievement in practice comes in a natural way. He has been learning<br>and practicing outstandingly.” During the great pujas held in recent<br>years, Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche was allowed to sit and walk beside<br>Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang. This clearly indicates the siddhi attained<br>by Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche. On the official website of the Drikung<br>Kagyu Order, the siddhi of Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche has also been<br>clearly recognized!”<br><br>Glorious Jewel Buddhist Center of Drikung Kagyu Lineage<br>Address: 17F, 136, MinQuan West Road, Taipei 103, Taiwan<br>TELï¼š+886-2-87809794~5 FAXï¼š+886-2-87809793<br><br>http://www.gloje.org/en/rare-difficult-to-obtained-chod</p></div>
