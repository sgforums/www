Just to clarify your questioning mind. Monks who don't drink doesn't mean they cant be curious to find out more.<br><br>Furthermore, there is a percentage of Thai monks who still smoke. Although the numbers have dropped by very large amount in the past decades.</div>

In fact, it is very easy. First of all, we must know how to eradicate our self serving and evil habits. We can naturally do that when we understand how important it is to our life to eradicate such habits. If we do not understand this, then no matter how learned in Buddhism we are, it does not serve any real purpose. Take for example the question of consuming alcoholic drinks. You could take a fruit juice or tea in its place. It is not necessary that you must take alcohol. If persuaded by your friends, you could say : "I am very sorry, I have been advised by the doctor to lay off alcohol for a year. I will be in trouble should my wife finds out that I have been drinking." Your good friends will understand and therefore let you off. Handling questions like this is a matter of having wisdom.<br><br>The most difficult thing for anybody to do, is to eradicate oneÂ’s self serving and evil habits. This is because habits are carried into the present life from the aeons of previous lives. They are deeply rooted and therefore are difficult to eradicate. Once these have been eradicated, then the Mara-hindrances are eliminated. The inability to eradicate them results in one spending his entire lifetime with the Mara without ever knowing it.<br><br>Let me tell you a story. There was a very promising lay-Buddhist who came to take refuge in the Three Treasures and before leaving asked, "Master, is there anything about me that I need to correct?" I replied, "Very well, there is nothing you need to correct other than to eradicate your self serving and evil habits." He was puzzled. He wondered if it was because he had evil habits that were deeply rooted. He began to examine himself, "I am a moderate person. My bosses and my colleagues treat me well. What self serving and evil habits does Master want me to eradicate?"<br><br>While on his way home, he continued to think over this as he smoked. Four cigarettes later, he was still pondering. Then, as he was lighting his fifth, it suddenly occurred to him, "Oh! I smoke. This is the self serving and evil habit that Master wants me to eradicate!" At this moment he spontaneously extinguished the cigarette and quit the habit.<br><br>Thus, when learning Buddhism one should not just talk about the theories. One must really put the teachings into practice. One should not commit even the smallest bad deed, neither should one neglect even the smallest virtuous deed. Only then is one a Buddhist.</div>
