              <p>ä»€éº¼æ˜¯æµ·å�°ä¸‰æ˜§ï¼Ÿ<br>What is the Sea-Imprint Samadhi?<br>ä¸Šå®£ä¸‹åŒ–è€�å’Œå°šæ–¼è�¯åš´ç¶“æ·ºé‡‹ä¸­ä¹‹é–‹ç¤º<br>excerpted from the Venerable master hua’s explanation of the flower adornment sutra<br>å­”æžœæ†² è‹±è­¯ english translated by theresa kung</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the Buddha spoke the Flower Adornment Sutra, he entered the<br>Sea-Imprint Concentration. He spoke through the Sea Imprint Samadhi,<br>which emits light.<br>The “sea” refers to all the seas of perfumed water. “Imprint” refers<br>to the imprint made by a seal. The sea’s ability to reflect all the mountains,<br>rivers and the great earth is referred to as “sea imprint.” Surrounding<br>Mount Sumeru are the seas of perfumed water, within which all the images<br>of this world are imprinted.<br>An instance of this is the planet Earth. As the Earth rotates, the<br>images of the moon and stars appear. These are functions of the “lightemitting<br>sea-imprint.” Buddhas have this kind of samadhi which is called<br>“sea-imprint samadhi.”<br>What is the “sea-imprint samadhi”? The seas of perfumed water<br>are limpid and waveless—without a single ripple. However, the physical<br>bodies of all living beings in the worlds of the ten directions appear<br>within the seas of perfumed water in just the same way as a seal makes<br>an imprint on a material. Sea-imprint refers to the seas of perfumed<br>water manifesting all the phenomena of the world within them, hence<br>the “imprint.”<br>All living beings in the worlds of the ten directions—their forms<br>and characteristics—are reflected in the seas of perfumed water, much<br>like as an imprint is made by pressing a seal on a piece of paper. Each<br>of all the living beings of the ten directions has an imprint appearing in<br>the seas of perfumed water, thus the term “sea-imprint.” The Buddha<br>entered this kind of samadhi and spoke Dharma using the “sea-imprint<br>samadhi.”<br>He spoke the Dharma in samadhi, and within samadhi, all living beings<br>clearly appear. Why do all beings appear in the Tathagata’s treasury<br>of light? Why does the Tathagata’s light makes an imprint in the minds<br>of all beings? All these are the functions of the magical powers of the<br>sea-imprint.<br>Why are living beings and Buddhas not different? Because they are<br>the same. The Buddha has returned to the source and regained the nature<br>of the Tathagata’s treasury. Living beings have not lost the potential nature of the Tathagata’s treasury.<br>For example, winds stir up waves in the sea, but waves and the seawater<br>are both characterized by wetness. This nature of wetness is an analogy for<br>the nature of Tathagata’s treasury. There may be waves, but the waves are in<br>the water and have not lost their nature of wetness.<br>Therefore, living beings’ nature of Tathagata’s treasury is the same as the<br>Buddha’s nature of Tathagata’s treasury. Since we do not understand and fail<br>to return to the source, even we are replete with the nature of Tathagata’s<br>treasurey, we remain unaware of it.<br>As we now listen to [the lectures of] the Flower Adornment Sutra<br>and have come to learn that every one of us is replete with the nature of<br>Tathagata’s treasury, we need to uncover our nature of the Tathagata’s treasury.<br>How are we going to do that? By cultivating, by making efforts. If you<br>apply efforts, cultivate and become enlightened, you will attain the nature of<br>Tathagata’s treasure and understand your inherent Buddha nature.<br>It is said,<br>The Buddha speaks the Dharma with a single sound;<br>Each being understands it according to its kind.<br>Celestial beings hear it as the language of celestial beings. Bodhisattvas hear<br>it as the language of Bodhisattvas. Arhats hear it as the language of Arhats.<br>Humans hear it as the language of humans. Animals hear it as the language<br>of animals. Hungry ghosts hear it as the language of hungry ghosts. Hell<br>beings hear it as the language of hell beings. Thus, the Buddha employs<br>one kind of sound to speak the Dharma, and all living beings of whatever<br>category, upon hearing it, instantly understand, as if the Dharma had come<br>right into their minds, as if it had fallen right into their hearts. It is said of<br>each category of living beings,<br>Each has their own attainment;<br>Each has their own understanding.<br>As their understandings differ, accordingly the states they attain are also different.<br>The Dharma Realm is very big, so big that nothing is beyond it. The<br>Dharma Realm is at the same time very small, so small that nothing is within<br>it. All of the Dharma Realm is just all beings; all beings are just all of the<br>Dharma Realm. The minds of every category of beings are illuminated by<br>the Buddha’s light, causing beings to understand all of the various dharmas<br>so they can cultivate accordingly. By cultivating according to the Dharma,<br>they will reach the other shore.<br>That is why in each of the Buddhalands, there invariably appear the<br>seven places and nine assemblies [where the Flower Adornment Sutra was<br>expounded]. That is, in those other worlds, there also appears the state of<br>seven places and nine assemblies—the inconceivable state that expounds<br>the great Dharmas of Flower Adornment, simultaneously proclaiming the<br>principles of the Sutra.</p>
