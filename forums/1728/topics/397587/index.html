              <p>King Pasenadi Kosala and General Vidudabha are so funny!!</p>
              <p>But I'm always amazed by Buddha's (as well as Ananda's) wisdom and ability to answer their questions so well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Venerable Thanissaro:</p>
              <p><em>Even King Pasenadi of Kosala, the king most closely associated with 
                          the Buddha, comes across as well-meaning but somewhat dense. An entire 
                          discourse, <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.090.than.html">MN 90</a>,
                           is a satire of how his royal position has thwarted his ability to learn
                           the Dhamma. He can't phrase his questions properly, has trouble 
                          following a discussion for more than a few sentences, and is unable to 
                          come to any certain conclusions about the truth. Still, in other 
                          discourses he has his occasional moments of spiritual clarity, and the 
                          Buddha uses those moments as opportunities to teach the Dhamma. The 
                          Buddha's approach here is twofold: to try to expand the king's 
                          perspective on life at times when the king is willing to be frank; and 
                          to encourage the king when the latter gains insights on his own.</em></p>

              <div id="H_content">
              <div class="chapter">
              <p>At <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. Then <a id="pasenadi" name="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a> approached the 
              Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down,
               sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him: 
              "Well now, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the 
              day?"</p>
              <p>"Just now, lord, I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical 
              of head-anointed noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication 
              of sovereignty, obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have 
              attained stable control in their country, and who rule having conquered a
               great sphere of territory on earth."</p>
              <p>"What do you think, great king? Suppose a man, trustworthy and 
              reliable, were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say: 
              'If it please your majesty, you should know that I come from the east. 
              There I saw a great mountain, as high as the clouds, coming this way, 
              crushing all living beings [in its path]. Do whatever you think should 
              be done.' Then a second man were to come to you from the west... Then a 
              third man were to come to you from the north... Then a fourth man were 
              to come to you from the south and on arrival would say: 'If it please 
              your majesty, you should know that I come from the south. There I saw a 
              great mountain, as high as the clouds, coming this way, crushing all 
              living beings. Do whatever you think should be done.' If, great king, 
              such a great peril should arise, such a terrible destruction of human 
              life — the human state being so hard to obtain — what should be done?"</p>
              <p>"If, lord, such a great peril should arise, such a terrible 
              destruction of human life — the human state being so hard to obtain — 
              what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful 
              deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>
              <p>"I inform you, great king, I announce to you, great king: aging and 
              death are rolling in on you. When aging and death are rolling in on you,
               great king, what should be done?"</p>
              <p>"As aging and death are rolling in on me, lord, what else should be 
              done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious 
              deeds?</p>
              <p>"There are, lord, elephant battles [fought by] head-anointed 
              noble-warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty, 
              obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures, who have attained stable 
              control in their country, and who rule having conquered a great sphere 
              of territory on earth; but there is no use for those elephant battles, 
              no scope for them, when aging and death are rolling in. There are 
              cavalry battles... chariot battles... infantry battles... but there is 
              no use for those infantry battles, no scope for them, when aging and 
              death are rolling in. In this royal court there are counselors who, when
               the enemies arrive, are capable of dividing them by their wits; but 
              there is no use for those battles of wits, no scope for them, when aging
               and death are rolling in. In this royal court there is abundant bullion
               and gold stored in vaults and depositories, and with such wealth we are
               capable of buying off enemies when they come; but there is no use for 
              those battles of wealth, no scope for them, when aging and death are 
              rolling in. As aging and death are rolling in on me, lord, what else 
              should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right conduct, skillful deeds, 
              meritorious deeds?"</p>
              <p>"So it is, great king! So it is, great king! As aging and death are 
              rolling in on you, what else should be done but Dhamma-conduct, right 
              conduct, skillful deeds, meritorious deeds?"</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One 
              Well-Gone, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
              <div class="freeverse"><a id="mountains" name="mountains">Like massive</a> boulders,
              mountains pressing against the sky,
              moving in from all sides,
              crushing the four directions,
              	so aging and death
              come rolling over living beings:
              noble warriors, priests, merchants,
              workers, outcastes, &amp; scavengers.
              They spare nothing.
              They trample everything.
              Here elephant troops can hold no ground,
              nor can chariots or infantry,
              nor can a battle of wits
              or wealth win out.
              So a wise person,
              seeing his own good,
              steadfast, secures confidence
              in the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha.
              One who practices the Dhamma
              in thought, word, &amp; deed,
              receives praise here on earth
              and after death rejoices in heaven.</div>

              <p>It means all the wealth you accumulated in the end will be left behind.</p>
              <p>Only by practicing skillful conduct can you be assured a higher rebirth (birth in human or heaven realm) in the next life, so cultivating the dharma is of true value since it is not only limited to this life.</p>
              <p>Of course, even a higher rebirth is not the ultimate goal of Buddhism, but rather freedom from all sufferings and afflictions and uncontrolled rebirths through enlightenment, but a king will probably not have liberation as his goal.</p>
