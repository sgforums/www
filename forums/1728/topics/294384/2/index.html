It is no good to create such affinity to the spirit realm.<br><br>If one is genuinely compassionate and intends to help the spirits be reborn in higher realms, what we can do is to dedicate our merits through offerings to sangha and pujas, etc, to the liberation of the spirits in their name.</div>

It will be good for both you and the kmt that you seek a well-learned venerables to advise you in releasing them and pray for their deliverance.<br><br>To my understanding, even in Thailand, there seems to be a few methods in making a KMT into a bucha. However what methods are not that important. The essence is that these spirits are sort of magically bounded to the statue to do the owners' biddnig.<br><br>Of course you may not be asking them to do bad things or what now.

The idea is similar, where the name of DZW itself suggesting the tolerance and fairness to everyone like mother earth, XKZ's idea is that you able to tolerate entire existence. However XKZ has little affinity with the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism as XKZ is not that well known and popular. Apparently XKZ is more popular and known in Japanese Buddhism. In Chinese Buddhism where Manjusri represents Wisdom, it is so in Japanese Buddhism that XKZ stands for Wisdom.</div>
