              <p>i think in Mahayana, it is more into refine subtleness of karma as in the above sutra. taking about ignorance karma.  ( like as long, one is not totally Fully Enlightened Buddha, there's still some bit of karma left. Like Avalokitesvara also have last bit of ç”Ÿç›¸æ— æ˜Ž haven't sever yet. )</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The perspective of Avalokitesvara not severing the last bit of ç”Ÿç›¸æ— æ˜Ž is based on the unsurpassed vow of liberating sentient beings / equal enlightenment beings, essentially <span style="font-family: SimSun; font-size: 10pt;">å�—é˜Žæµ®æ��ä¼—ç”Ÿ who met with danger etc and desiring for help.</span> Avalokitesvara has long attained Buddhaship according to sutra.  Avalokitesvara would to enter fully enlightenment realm only when there is no more affinity needed to support his vow. This refine subtleness of karma is negligible if ignorance has been transformed into bodhi. Nevertheless, if practitioners have yet to realize Bodhi mind, relax, be compassionate and benevolence along with meditation practice will develop bodhi mind speedily.</p>

His mother told him that he could never become king until Nagarjuna died, since Nagarjuna and the King have the same lifespan. His mother said to ask Nagarjuna for his head and since Nagarjuna was so compassionate, he would undoubtedly agree to give it to him. Nagarjuna did in fact agree, but Kumara could not cut his head off with a sword. Nagarjuna said in a previous life, he had killed an ant while cutting grass. As a karmic result, his head could only be cut off with a blade of kusha grass. Kumara did this and Nagarjuna died. </span></p>

              <p>In the last webcast,i remember Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche also mentioning about Digpa and Dribpa.  Digpa is negativities outright with the intention and so forth. Dribpa is obstacles -- less serious like accidentally committing a negative deed.  Accumulation of many Dribpas can equate to the seriousness of Digpa.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in Tibetan Buddhism, this has always been the understanding. And it is reflected in stories and teachings.</p>
              <p>For instance, if you have received offerings in faith to do prayers for the dead but forgot to do the appropriate deeds, it could be said to be a lack of intention to do so, but due to this, it could create a very heavy obscuration and impede you.  In one of his life, a rinpoche (i think Dzogchen Rinpoche) experienced this obstacle after he died.</p>
              <p>Intention is a very impt factor in the determination of karma but there are many other factors. the Berzin archive link i posted earlier is a very good resource to study.</p>
              <p>Many mantras from the sutras and tantras are also for specially purifying the unintentional karmas/obscurations eg. mantra to bless the feet in case of walking on insects, mantra to purify if walking across the shadow of a holy objects eg stups or dharma books, mantra to purify for consuming offerings to the Triple Gems etc etc.  So i guess indirectly, it could be said that this is the teaching of Buddha.</p>

              <p><br>hence why, so is the effect unintentionally commited by "others" toward you.  i tot it's quite logical, or where the karmic effect is based on natural law or sort(Niyama Dhammas?), rather than individuality.</p>
              <p>karma mean an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">act</span> of body, speech and mind.  you think it's "unintentional" but it can be some action created out of folly/ignorance, not knowing or unmindfulness. so it's not that neutral anymore. neutral is really neutral.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, karma is very complicated.</p>

              <p>ok, don't say about killing, say about speech. like sometime "you" think it's an unintented speech, but it might insult another person thinking you intented to insult them. we don't live by ourselves only. we are interconnected.</p>

              <p>ok, don't say about killing, say about speech. like sometime "you" think it's an unintented speech, but it might insult another person thinking you intented to insult them. we don't live by ourselves only. we are interconnected.</p>

              <p>This is very complex,  put it based on my shallow understanding is that be good like courtesy, grateful, bliss, joys together is good kamma.<br>Although good but devoiding of attachment because it is a nature of all that it supposedly to be in this way of life <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/dude_hug.png" alt="dude_hug.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/girl_hug.png" alt="girl_hug.png">.</p>
              <p>So, question might asked, if there is no one around for you to showcase your good kamma on courtesy, grateful, how then, for god sake please showcase to the table, chair, foods, dusts among others.

              <p>when a karma effect occur, we can also say like the other thread of yours, a combined result of the past and present actions:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;">In this way, the Buddha points to one of the most distinctive features of his own teaching on kamma: that the present experience of pleasure and pain is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">combined</span> result of both past and present actions. This seemingly small addition to the notion of kamma plays an enormous role in allowing for the exercise of free will and the possibility of putting an end to suffering before the effects of all past actions have ripened. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 12pt;">ps: Mahayana also like to talk about collective karma. </span></span></p>

              <p>non-dual is like.... not in any of the position e.g.</p>
              <p>good - evil</p>
              <p>nirvana - samsara</p>
              <p>virtue - vices</p>
              <p>etc etc</p>
              <p>but for me now i need to stick to duality... i need a "guide" first.. Can't maintain in the position of non-duality. I try to understand non-duality... maybe such as not looking at the goodness or the bad side of a person... to be as non-biased as possible.</p>
              <p>When i read from Mahayana perspective of non-duality, it's quite profound.. i give a short example, like Nirvana is Samsara... there is no difference... because to realize Nirvana is to go through suffering in Samsara... compared to a lotus growing out of the muddled pond.</p>
              <p>Thervada perspective doesn't seem to have non-duality. It precisely works on duality to realize Nibbana... hmmm for example, Samsara is suffering, therefore to let go of cravings and practise according to the right path</p>
              <p>there's one article which i have read. You can read to find out more.</p>

              <p>There is non-duality - the non-duality of subject and object, and the non-duality of existence and non-existence in Theravada Buddhism. But it wasn't expressed in that article.</p>
              <p>Anyway on another note - <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm</a></p>
              <p>David Loy:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">That saá¹�sÄ�ra is nirvÄ�á¹‡a is a major tenet 
                of MahÄ�yÄ�na philosophy. "Nothing of saá¹�sÄ�ra is different from nirvÄ�á¹‡a, 
                nothing of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is different from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the limit of 
                nirvÄ�á¹‡a is also the limit of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference 
                between the two." <a name="%5B1%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#1">[1]</a> And yet there must be some difference between them, 
                for otherwise no distinction would have been made and there would be no need 
                for two words to describe the same state. So NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes 
                them: "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being 
                born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared 
                to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a." <a name="%5B2%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#2">[2]</a> There is only one reality -- this world, right here 
                -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is
               the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically
               
                perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in 
                space and time. NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic 
              in that 
                it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika
               insists, 
                cannot be characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is that 
              which 
                is absolved of all thought-construction"), but which YogÄ�cÄ�ra 
              nevertheless 
                sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so forth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">But if, as Buddhism claims, there never was an "I, " how can "I" experience dualistically? The answer, 
                of course, is that "I" do not experience dualistically; the sense 
                of duality is only an illusion, since all experience is and always was nondual. 
                However, this only raises the question in a different form: if not how does 
                the delusion of duality originate (since Buddhism "turns aside" all 
                such questions about first causes), then how is this delusion of duality perpetuated? 
                Since we are told it is possible to overcome the sense of duality and attain 
                -- or, more precisely, realize -- nirvÄ�á¹‡a, what obstructs the experience of 
                nonduality?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The purpose of this paper is to outline
               an answer 
                to that question. It seems to me that there are three main factors 
              which constitute "the process of being born and passing on," two of 
              which -- craving 
                and conceptualizing -- are well-known. What is not so well understood 
              is the 
                relation between them and their relation with a third factor which 
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna 
                identifies-causality. The interaction of these three factors works to 
              sustain 
                the sense of duality. AvidyÄ�, ignorance, is not a separate factor but a
               generic 
                term for their interaction.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Craving, taá¹‡hÄ�, is the most obvious factor, since 
                the Buddha's Second Truth identifies it as the cause of our dukkha (dissatisfaction). 
                Fundamentally, the problem of craving is not sensual desire but attachment in 
                general, whether to sense-experience or to "mental events." How does 
                such attachment generate the sense of duality? Does not the concept of attachment 
                presuppose duality -- an "I" which is necessary in order to cling 
                to something? The YogÄ�cÄ�ra answer is that the tendency of nondual Mind to "freeze" 
                or "fix itself" gives rise to the distinction between subject and 
                object: "that-which-is-grasped" becomes reified into an objective "thing" and "that-which-grasps" becomes the "self." 
                Here the mutual interdependence of subject and object is obvious: there can 
                be no "that-which-grasps" without "that-which-is-grasped." 
                But it is claimed that this dualism is delusory, for there is no real distinction 
                between the content of consciousness and consciousness itself. "When cognition 
                no longer apprehends an object, then it stands fully in [nondual] consciousness-only, 
                because where there is nothing to grasp there is no more grasping... The absence 
                of an object results in the absence also of a subject, and not merely in that 
                grasping." <a name="%5B3%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#3">[3]</a> NirvÄ�á¹‡a, of course, is "the end of craving" and 
                therefore the end of such grasping. "The tendencies to treat object and 
                subject as distinct and real entities are forsaken, and consciousness is established 
                in just the true nature of one's own [nondual] consciousness." <a name="%5B4%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#4">[4]</a></span></p>

              <p>David Loy:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">That saá¹�sÄ�ra is
                  nirvÄ�á¹‡a is a major tenet of MahÄ�yÄ�na philosophy. "Nothing of
                  saá¹�sÄ�ra is different from nirvÄ�á¹‡a, nothing of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is different
                  from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the limit of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is also the limit
                  of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference between the two."
                  <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B1%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#1">[1]</a> And yet there must be some difference
                  between them, for otherwise no distinction would have been made and
                  there would be no need for two words to describe the same state. So
                  NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes them: "That which, taken as causal or
                  dependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken
                  noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a."
                  <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B2%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#2">[2]</a> There is only one reality -- this
                  world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two
                  different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the "relative" world as usually
                  experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a
                  collection of objects which interact causally in space and time.
                  NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it
                  incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika
                  insists, cannot be characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality
                  is that which is absolved of all thought-construction"), but which
                  YogÄ�cÄ�ra nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and
                  so forth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">But if, as Buddhism
                  claims, there never was an "I, " how can "I" experience
                  dualistically? The answer, of course, is that "I" do not experience
                  dualistically; the sense of duality is only an illusion, since all
                  experience is and always was nondual. However, this only raises the
                  question in a different form: if not how does the delusion of
                  duality originate (since Buddhism "turns aside" all such questions
                  about first causes), then how is this delusion of duality
                  perpetuated? Since we are told it is possible to overcome the sense
                  of duality and attain -- or, more precisely, realize -- nirvÄ�á¹‡a,
                  what obstructs the experience of nonduality?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The purpose of this
                  paper is to outline an answer to that question. It seems to me that
                  there are three main factors which constitute "the process of being
                  born and passing on," two of which -- craving and conceptualizing
                  -- are well-known. What is not so well understood is the relation
                  between them and their relation with a third factor which NÄ�gÄ�rjuna
                  identifies-causality. The interaction of these three factors works
                  to sustain the sense of duality. AvidyÄ�, ignorance, is not a
                  separate factor but a generic term for their
                  interaction.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Craving, taá¹‡hÄ�, is
                  the most obvious factor, since the Buddha's Second Truth identifies
                  it as the cause of our dukkha (dissatisfaction). Fundamentally, the
                  problem of craving is not sensual desire but attachment in general,
                  whether to sense-experience or to "mental events." How does such
                  attachment generate the sense of duality? Does not the concept of
                  attachment presuppose duality -- an "I" which is necessary in order
                  to cling to something? The YogÄ�cÄ�ra answer is that the tendency of
