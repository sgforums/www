            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Isis,<br><br><blockquote>From my understanding, when the mind understands the true nature of existence, the mind will auto release the need of knowing. The need of knowing is a form of craving. Correct me if im wrong.</blockquote>What I have experienced is that the mind becomes aware of the poverty of it's own conceptualizations and then is quite prepared to remain silent.<br><br><blockquote>i do know that "self " is an illusion. So how do i experience the true nature of existence? At this moment, am i trying to conceptualise this " true nature of existence and related it to a "how do i" ? </blockquote>The very fact that you are trying to do something should suggest to you that this is efforting by the ego/mind.<br><br>The fact is you already are fully what you are.<br><br>You are perfection right now.<br><br>You are the present moment.<br><br>You are God.<br><br>There's nothing you need to do to achieve this.<br><br>Just be!<br><br><blockquote>so just simply be and surrending the self in the process? mmmmm..<br><br>No thought and desire arising when you experience 'true nature of existence' ??? </blockquote>This does not happen like this.<br><br>It requires insight into your true nature.<br><br><blockquote>or am i asking too many questions and not looking hard enough  </blockquote>There will continue to be the appearance of a "someone" asking questions and looking hard until you fully realize that there is no one and nothing to do.<br><br>Perfection is here right now.<br><br>And within this perfection is a dream of imperfection.<br><br>Until you wake up.<br><br>As Ramana Maharshi would say, you have to do whatever you can to get rid of the idea that you are not realized.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In other words, know that everything is fine and nothing matters ultimately no matter what is done? Just like how christians know that God will take care of all things, just rest and glorify God, and dont bother finding out what God is because he is unknowable because he is God? (I'm not being angry at this)<br><br>Now that I know this, I want some supernatural powers to play with.</div>

You will recognise it when you have reached it. Those that have gone before can only guide you as you make the journey.<br><br><strong>It is your own journey. It is your own effort. </strong>Nobody can take credit when you have reached the destination.<br><br>If it were possible for an external source to bring you into the epic center, many more would be there. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the perspective of whether you are looking from the outside or you are looking in, the journey is your own.<br><br>The good thing about this then is that, unlike dogmatic religions, you can actually reach the destination through guidance from an internet forum. You see, it is your own effort and not somebody's teaching. (There is a duality here. It is 100% effort and 0% effort. That is not important. <strong>For now you have to take it as 100% effort.)</strong><br><br>Since it is your own effort, what would be the problem if you received "bad" guidance? Whatever "guidance" you received has to pass through you. It is your effort, it is your journey. You have to work it out for yourself what is "good" and what is "bad" anyway.<br><br><strong>You have to test it. You have to taste it. </strong>The "bad" teaching can open your eyes to what is bad and that is as important as knowing what good is; if you are to reach the epic center.<br><br>It then follows that there is no "fake" Buddhism at all. That which is fake will teach you what "fake is" and that which is "true" <strong>you cannot accept anyway unless you yourself know it to be true after you have tested it and tasted it.</strong></div>
