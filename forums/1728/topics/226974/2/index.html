            <div class='col-md body'>Hi JonLS,<br><br>Of all ways, the direct way is toughest.  Sound simplest but is the most difficult path to walk as it is pathless.  When one not only 'sees' the non-duality aspect of awareness but also the 'momentum' aspect, the workings of consciousness will become clearer.  Skillful means are devised to suit ppl with differing conditions and all skillful means is to generate enough conditions to lead one to the ultimate understanding of our pristine nature.  Effort can still lead to the understanding effortless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi jonls, im in china now and can only offer a short reply. The meditation methods can be seen as 'portals to the unmanifest'. In fact many portal practices taught by eckhart tolle are buddhism's insight meditation, like inner body practices and many more.. Including mindfulness of breathing. Buddha said that practicing mindfulness of breathing will lead to development of the four foundations of mindfulness and thus the practice leads to nirvana/unborn/unmanifest.
