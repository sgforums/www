Buddhist cultivators are often very very careful in dedication of merits when virtues are done. Dedications of merits from a Buddhist cultivator will always be that the cultivator wanting to practise the Dharma without karmic obstructions or in future lifetimes be born as a human to futher cultivate in Dharma. To be reborn as a deva (GOD) in the realms of the heaven might be blissful BUT once all the merits are spent, usually the devas will be reborn back as humans or worst, into the 3 miserable realms.<br><br>Our mind are very powerful. High practitioners are often able to taste dhayana bliss which is similar to those in the Gods realms.<br><br>Why wouldn't Buddhist cultivators want to be Gods? It is very simple. Just take a look around you in this modern society. People who are enjoying alot do not practise or cultivate. Knowing that life is good, they continued their ways and commiting evil karma is so simple. This applies to the realms of the Gods too.</div></blockquote>Even the enlightened will commit evil karma if they are still human.</div>

Just like inanimate things create effects but no karma, no afterlife, and so on. Another thing is a liberated person generally has much greater wisdom than us and probably knows better, secondly whatever he does he will not do it due to his fundamental attraction or aversion to things as he has fundamentally severed these fetters.

However, I'm very sure that Enlightened Beings are not capable of creating evil Karma as they fully understood what the five skandas are. Enlightenment also does not happen overnight. It takes aeons (great kalpa) of cultivations. A normal person may get angry easily while driving when someone cuts into his/her lane. So why does one person get angry so easily? This is due to lifetimes after lifetimes of practise on anger and not controlling one's temper. It becomes a nature to this person no matter where he/she goes.

In my point of view, basic knowledge will act as guideline on how to do things. While doing, you will gain new experiences on the things you are doing. And these experience will accumulates to the basic knowledge you already have, making you see/understand things better.<br><br>For example from the previous example "Lemon is sour" You have this basic knowledge from reading books. Once you actually go and taste the lemon you might experience "Yeeeww!!! Lemon so sour it bites my tounge and eyes tears. I'll never eat lemon like this again!" The new experiences are your tounge got "bitten" and it's so sour your eyes tears abit. From these 2 new experiences, now you can better understand and relate to how sour the lemon is.<br><br>So for your question, you will need to find out what you want to practise. If you want to know for example if "Oranges are sweet" because someone said "Oranges are sweet" in the forum, first you will have to get a good encyclopedia that is authentic and see what it says about oranges. After gathering enough information, you can try tasting the oranges. In learning Dharma, it is always good to learn from a Guru/Teacher so you will learn even more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope this is helpful to you.<br><br>Cherrio</div>

The new experiences are your tounge got "bitten" and it's so sour your eyes tears abit. From these 2 new experiences, now you can better understand and relate to how sour the lemon is.<br><br>So for your question, you will need to find out what you want to practise. If you want to know for example if "Oranges are sweet" because someone said "Oranges are sweet" in the forum, first you will have to get a good encyclopedia that is authentic and see what it says about oranges. After gathering enough information, you can try tasting the oranges. In learning Dharma, it is always good to learn from a Guru/Teacher so you will learn even more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope this is helpful to you.<br><br>Cherrio</div></blockquote>Because I find the theory of dharma as false in the first place, hence I am using logic to understand it.</div>

Worse still, you said you don't even have basic knowledge. So basically you are dismissing something which you haven't experienced (even though countless others had) and haven't even learnt or knew as 'false'.<br><br>This is the worst kind of dogma.</div>

He didn't say rebirth and karma as the direct cause of sufferings.<br><br>Also, there is evidences of rebirth, but no evidence disproving rebirth. Other than scientific evidence, there is experiential evidences. So basically, there is no reason to reject these teachings.<br><br>If you like to find out more I suggest you may attend some Buddhist classes. Best to learn from an enlightened teacher directly and practise the dharma... then eventually you can see for yourselves the truths that Buddha taught, directly.</div>
