The experience of all-pervading Presence is important (although this experience may lead to the projection of I Amness if not followed by correct 'understanding'), followed by the experience of non-dual nature of Presence/Awareness (stage 5). Remember I explained in your Brahman topic? <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=215828" rel="nofollow">so is "Brahman" correct?</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">In reply to longchen a few months back, in your topic <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=203582" rel="nofollow">how true is this website?</a><br><br>Because of subtle karmic tendencies surfacing, after the glimpse into our luminosity of our Buddha Nature, one may tend to cling to a 'formless Source', although the Source/Brahman is 'beyond forms' nevertheless there is a point of focus, therefore separating Source from manifestation. Without knowing that everything IS the marvelous activity of our Buddha Nature. That is why it is said, Manifestation IS Source.<br><br>That is why the key in advancing from 'AMness' lies in 'fusing into everything'. Master shen kai describes it as our breathe diffuses into integral space, or a small lamp put under the bright sun, the light neither decreases nor increases. Witnessing consciousness becomes one with all that is witnessed. 'Brahman' is no longer separated. This is total presence, and the rest of the journey is only refining this experience of total presence. When you ask zen masters where is Buddha, he can point to anything and say, there. All is One Reality.<br><br>Still, the experience must come with the complete realisation of emptiness, otherwise the experience of total presence can become a stage that can be entered and left, and there is still falling back to source.

And while it is true that many extraordinary powers flow from Joriki, nevertheless through it alone we cannot cut the roots of our illusionary view of the world. Mere strength of concentration is not enough for the highest types of Zen and a path not unlike Shikantaza must be considered. Concomitantly there must be Satori-awakening. In a little-known document handed down by Shih-t'ou Hsi-ch'ien (Sekito Kisen, Japanese) a follower of the Sixth Patriarch Hui-neng and founder of one of the early Zen sects, the following appears: "in our sect, realization of the Buddha-nature, and not mere devotion or strength of concentration, is paramount."[/quote]<br><br>And see my previous post:<br><br>What is the greatest supernatural powers?
