            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My experiences:</strong><br><br>Hi.<br><br>Something happened again today as it has so many times before.<br><br>When this first started two years ago, I interpreted it as the "holy spirit" had descended on me.  At that time the effect was tiny, it happened within my body and shook me to my roots.  It felt like sweet ambrosia, at the time I said "my cup runneth over" because it was so powerful and wonderful.<br><br>Later on, when I first started posting on the msn boards, I called it a "break in reality", as if the immediate reality I was experiencing somehow broke down and was reassembled in a slightly different way.<br><br>Later I started calling it the opening of the inner dimension.  All of these events were powerful and painful and stressful on the body and psyche, but it was always met with a big "YES" because it felt so wonderful, so right.<br><br>Today this phenomenon still continues, but it doesn't feel as localized as it did before.  The "presence" that emerges during this event is so wonderful and all encompassing that even though it has me on my knees and crying and completely "out of it", it also has me yelling "YES" at the top of my mental lungs.  I simply cannot get enough of It, even though it feels like it's killing  the little egoic  me.<br><br>When the phenomenon subsides, there is a powerful, almost palpable feeling of peace.<br><br>The mind truly has no idea what is going on here.<br><br>But the events are truly a  humbling experience to the mind, showing it that it has no idea about what reality truly is.<br><br>The absolute poverty of mind and it's conceptualizations is very clear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This has just been posted on another forum and I thought it may be helpful here:<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br><strong>Joel said: Meditation seems to be no more than the alert but still mind, completely focused upon now, Self. Like an orchestra trained on the conductor. </strong><br><br>I don't wish to come off as being a nit-pick but there is a basic misunderstanding here - mind is movement of consciousness as form, and being a form it cannot focus on the now. This is a subtle but important point. Mind, being movement, cannot also be still. It is not mind which focuses on Self/now, but rather, it is Self/now in which mind arises. If this isn't understood then one can get caught up in trying to get the mind to "do something" to wake up.<br><br>The alertness you mention is the stillness of consciousness itself. When the mind is no more that alertness/stillness is left standing on its own with nothing getting in the way of it - this is the natural state of awareness, what you are. That consciousness /stillness/alertness is here right now, even in the midst of mental activity - it can be felt/realized no matter what the circumstances are.<br><br>This is why formal meditation for the sake of awakening can get in the way. If one practices formal meditation to awaken the most important point in meditation is when the technique drops away along with the ego/mind and there is no more grasping/efforting at "meditating". But what often happens is that the ego hangs on to the technique with determination in order to "meditate". This is what I did for nearly 30 years. Once I saw this I could see how "I" delayed consciously waking up.<br><br>Now if I sit for formal meditation it seems ridiculously irrelevant because I can see myself efforting to get something I already am.</blockquote></div>
