You will recognise it when you have reached it. Those that have gone before can only guide you as you make the journey.<br><br>{b]It is your own journey. It is your own effort. {/b]Nobody can take credit when you have reached the destination.<br><br>If it were possible for an external source to bring you into the epic center, many more would be there. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the perspective of whether you are looking from the outside or you are looking in, the journey is your own.<br><br>The good thing about this then is that, unlike dogmatic religions, you can actually reach the destination through guidance from an internet forum. You see, it is your own effort and not somebody's teaching. (There is a duality here. It is 100% effort and 0% effort. That is not important. [b]For now you have to take it as 100% effort.)</strong><br><br>Since it is your own effort, what would be the problem if you received "bad" guidance? Whatever "guidance" you received has to pass through you. It is your effort, it is your journey. You have to work it out for yourself what is "good" and what is "bad" anyway.<br><br><strong>You have to test it. You have to taste it. </strong>The "bad" teaching can open your eyes to what is bad and that is as important as knowing what good is; if you are to reach the epic center.<br><br>It then follows that there is no "fake" Buddhism at all. That which is fake will teach you what "fake is" and that which is "true" <strong>you cannot accept anyway unless you yourself know it to be true after you have tested it and tasted it.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>But then what were those angels you were talking about?</div>

It does not exist in your mind only, because if it doesn't exist then how did all existence get here? (you should forget this statement cos you may start to put labels on it again.)<br><br>Since we are on a buddhist forum and you were telling me to walk my own path so I thought I should put in "buddha nature" in there.
