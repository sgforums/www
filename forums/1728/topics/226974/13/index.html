It does not make sense. There must be a host of conditions. Of breathing can cause hurricanes, everyday we should have billions of hurricanes in the world because everyone breathes.<br><br>Secondly enlightened people live in the same environment as us, however they stops creating karma.</div>

In fact the title "Does the Flap of a ButterflyÂ’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?" is an analogy. The butterfly flapping its wings represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena represented by the tornado. This is all an analogy.<br><br>Chaos theory is applied in many scientific disciplines: mathematics, biology, computer science, economics, engineering, finance, philosophy, physics, politics, population dynamics, psychology, and robotics. Because of the availbilty of powerful computers today, scientists are able to set small changes in the initial conditions of a given senario and run multiple simulations on the senarios to see the different effects and the accuracy of the experiments.<br><br>The breath of an enlightened being is of no difference from yours and mine (if they are still breathing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ).
