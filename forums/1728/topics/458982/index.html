              <br> When I discovered the site <a href="http://measurelessmind.ca/">Measureless Mind</a>,
               I thought, wow, what a great resource of Buddha's teachings! It is a 
              very valuable resource for all practitioners. Very well formatted, well 
              presented, all-rounded, well commented resource of Buddha's original 
              teachings in the Pali canon by Geoff (online nick: jnana in dharmawheel,
               or nana in dhammawheel). Like Loppon Namdrol/Malcolm who I often quoted
               from, Geoff (whose practice background is more of Mahamudra and 
              Theravada) is also a very knowledgeable Buddhist scholar-practitioner 
              and I often read his posts with much interest.<br> <br> I sent Thusness two of the many articles (I spent time to read the 
              entire website from beginning to end and highly recommend others to do 
              so) and Thusness also commented, "Both the articles are very very well 
              written. Put in the blog."<br> <br> <a href="http://measurelessmind.ca/anattasanna.html">http://measurelessmind.ca/anattasanna.html</a><br>
              <h6 class="caption"><span style="font-size: large;">The Recognition of Selflessness (AnattasaññÄ�)</span></h6>
              <div class="hr dotted clearfix"></div>
              <blockquote> Look at the world and see its emptiness MogharÄ�ja, always mindful,<br> Eliminating the view of self, one goes beyond death.<br> One who views the world this way is not seen by the king of death.<br> <br> — Sutta NipÄ�ta 5.15, MogharÄ�jamÄ�á¹‡avapucchÄ�</blockquote> The contemplation of selflessness is given in AN 10.60 GirimÄ�nanda Sutta:<br> <blockquote> Now what, Ä€nanda, is the recognition of selflessness? Here, 
              Ä€nanda, a monk, gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an 
              empty place, discriminates thus: ‘The eye is not-self, forms are 
              not-self; the ear is not-self, sounds are not-self; the nose is 
              not-self, odors are not-self; the tongue is not-self, flavors are 
              not-self; the body is not-self, tactual objects are not-self; the mind 
              is not-self, phenomena are not-self.’ Thus he abides contemplating 
              selflessness with regard to the six internal and external sensory 
              spheres. This, Ä€nanda, is called the recognition of selflessness.</blockquote> In practice, we need to be able to recognize this absence of self in 
              our immediate experience: When seeing, there is the coming together of 
              visible form, the eye, and visual consciousness. When hearing, there is 
              the coming together of sound, the ear, and auditory consciousness. When 
              touching, there is the coming together of tactual sensation, the body, 
              and tactile consciousness. When thinking, there is the thought, the 
              mind, and mental consciousness. These processes arise simply through 
              ‘contact.’ When a sense faculty and a sensory object make contact, the 
              corresponding sensory consciousness arises. This entire process occurs 
              through specific conditionality (idappaccayatÄ�). There is no 
              independent, fully autonomous agent or self controlling any of this.<br> An independent, autonomous self would, by definition, be:<br> <ol>
              <li>permanent</li>
              <li>satisfactory</li>
              <li>not prone to dis-ease</li>
              <li>fully self-determining (be in complete autonomous control of itself)</li>
              </ol> Thus, what is being negated is a permanent, satisfactory self which 
              is not prone to old age, sickness, and death. As SN 22.59 Pañcavaggiya 
              Sutta (abridged) states:<br> <blockquote> Monks, form, feeling, recognition, fabrications, and 
              consciousness are not-self. Were form, feeling, recognition, 
              fabrications, or consciousness self, then this form, feeling, 
              recognition, fabrications, and consciousness would not lead to dis-ease.</blockquote> This criterion of dis-ease is the context for the following statement that:<br> <blockquote> None can have it of form, feeling, recognition, 
              fabrications,  or consciousness: ‘Let my form, feeling, recognition, 
              fabrications, or consciousness be thus, let my form, feeling, 
              recognition, fabrications, or consciousness be not thus.’</blockquote> By engaging in sustained, dedicated contemplation we find only 
              impermanent processes, conditionally arisen, and not fully 
              self-determining. First we clearly see that all conditioned phenomena of
               body and mind are impermanent. Next we come to see that whatever is 
              impermanent is unsatisfactory in that it can provide no lasting 
              happiness. Then we realize that all impermanent, unsatisfactory 
              phenomena of body and mind are not-self — they can’t be the basis for a 
              self, which by definition would be permanent and (one would hope) 
              satisfactory. This relationship between the recognition of impermanence,
               the recognition of unsatisfactoriness, and the recognition of 
              selflessness is illustrated in the following diagram.<br>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://measurelessmind.ca/images/img1.jpg" alt=""></div>
              With the recognition of selflessness there is an emptying out of both
               the “subject” and “object” aspects of experience. We come to understand
               that “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to the mind and body as 
              well as all external representations is deluded. When the recognition of
               selflessness is fully developed there is no longer any reification of 
              substantial referents to be experienced in relation to subjective 
              grasping. Whatever is seen is merely the seen (diá¹­á¹­hamatta). Whatever is
               heard or sensed is merely the heard (sutamatta) and merely the sensed 
              (mutamatta). Whatever is known is merely the known (viññÄ�tamatta). This 
              is explained in Ud 1.10 BÄ�hiya Sutta:<br> <blockquote> ‘The seen will be merely the seen, the heard will be merely 
              the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the known will be 
              merely the known.’ This is how you should train, BÄ�hiya. 
              <br> <br> When, BÄ�hiya, for you the seen will be merely the seen, the heard will 
              be merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the known 
              will be merely the known, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be that. When, 
              BÄ�hiya, you are not that, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be there. When, 
              BÄ�hiya, you are not there, then BÄ�hiya, you will be neither here nor 
              beyond nor between-the-two. Just this is the end of unsatisfactoriness.</blockquote> When there is no self to be found one’s experience becomes very 
              simple, direct, and uncluttered. When seeing, there is the coming 
              together of visible form, the eye, and visual consciousness, that’s all.
               There is no separate “seer.” The seer is entirely dependent upon the 
              seen. There can be no seer independent of the seen. There is no 
              separate, independent subject or self.<br> This is also the case for the sensory object. The “seen” is entirely 
              dependent upon the eye faculty and visual consciousness. There can be no
               object seen independent of the eye faculty and cognition. This is the 
              case for all possible sensory objects. There is no separate, independent
               sensory object.<br> The same holds true for sensory consciousness as well. “Seeing” is 
              entirely dependent upon the eye and visible form. There can be no seeing
               independent of the eye and cognition. This is the case for all possible
               sensory cognitions. There is no separate, independent sensory 
              consciousness.<br> It’s important to understand this experientially. Let’s take the 
              straightforward empirical experience of you looking at this screen right
               now as an example. Conventionally speaking, you could describe the 
              experience as “I see the computer screen.” Another way of describing 
              this is that there’s a “seer” who “sees” the “seen.” But look at the 
              screen: are there really three independent and separate parts to your 
              experience? Or are “seer,” “sees,” and “seen,” just three conceptual 
              labels applied to this experience in which the three parts are entirely 
              interdependent?<br> The “seer,” “seen,” and “seeing” are all empty and insubstantial. The
               eye faculty, visible form, and visual consciousness are all 
              interdependent aspects of the same experience. You can’t peel one away 
              and still have a sensory experience — there is no separation. AN 4.24 
              KÄ�á¸·akÄ�rÄ�ma Sutta:<br> <blockquote> Thus, monks, the TathÄ�gata does not conceive an [object] 
              seen when seeing what is to be seen. He does not conceive an unseen. He 
              does not conceive a to-be-seen. He does not conceive a seer.
              <br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] heard when hearing what is to be heard.
               He does not conceive an unheard. He does not conceive a to-be-heard. He
               does not conceive a hearer.
              <br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] sensed when sensing what is to be 
              sensed. He does not conceive an unsensed. He does not conceive a 
              to-be-sensed. He does not conceive a senser. 
              <br> <br> He does not conceive an [object] known when knowing what is to be known.
               He does not conceive an unknown. He does not conceive a to-be-known. He
               does not conceive a knower.</blockquote> Sensory consciousness can’t be isolated as separate and independent. 
              Nor can any of these other interdependent phenomena. Even the 
              designations that we apply to these various phenomena are entirely 
              conventional, dependent designations. But this doesn’t mean that we 
              should now interpret our experience as being some sort of cosmic oneness
               or unity consciousness or whatever one may want to call it. That's just
               another empty, dependent label isn’t it? The whole point of this 
              analysis is to see the emptiness of all referents, and thereby stop 
              constructing and defining a “self.”<br> The purpose of correctly engaging in the contemplation of selflessness is stated in AN 7.49 DutiyasaññÄ� Sutta:<br> <blockquote> ‘The recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, 
              monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit; it 
              merges with the death-free, has the death-free as its end.’ Thus it was 
              said. In reference to what was it said? <br> <br> Monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the
               recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, his mind is rid 
              of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious body and 
              externally with regard to all representations, and has transcended 
              conceit, is at peace, and is well liberated. <br> <br> If, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with
               the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, his mind is 
              not rid of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious 
              body and externally with regard to all representations, and has not 
              transcended conceit, is not at peace, and is not well liberated, then he
               should know, ‘I have not developed the recognition of selflessness in 
              what is unsatisfactory, there is no stepwise distinction in me, I have 
              not obtained the strength of development.’ In that way he is fully aware
               there. But if, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted 
              with the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, his mind
               is rid of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious 
              body and externally with regard to all representations, and has 
              transcended conceit, is at peace, and is well liberated, then he should 
              know, ‘I have developed the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, there is stepwise distinction in me, I have obtained the
               strength of development.’ In that way he is fully aware there. <br> <br> ‘The recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, 
              monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit; it 
              merges with the death-free, has the death-free as its end.’ Thus it was 
              said. And in reference to this it was said.</blockquote> Here we get to the heart of the matter, which is one of the most 
              subtle aspects of the Buddhadhamma. Simply stated: when ignorance 
              ceases, belief in self simultaneously ceases. And when there is no self 
              to be found, then there is no self to die or take birth. This right here
               is “death-free.” And it is precisely this that the Buddha is declaring 
              when he says to MogharÄ�ja:<br> <blockquote> Look at the world and see its emptiness MogharÄ�ja, always mindful,<br> Eliminating the view of self, one goes beyond death.<br> One who views the world this way is not seen by the king of death.</blockquote> When one completely abandons the underlying tendencies which give 
              rise to mistaken apprehensions of a self — any and all notions of “I am”
               — then there is no self to die. This stilling of the “currents of 
              conceiving” over one’s imagined self, and the resulting peace that is 
              empty of birth, aging, and death, is straightforwardly presented in MN 
              140 DhÄ�tuvibhaá¹…ga Sutta:<br> <blockquote> ‘He has been stilled where the currents of conceiving do not
               flow. And when the currents of conceiving do not flow, he is said to be
               a sage at peace.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said?
               
              <br> <br> Monk, “I am” is a conceiving. “I am this” is a conceiving. “I shall be” 
              is a conceiving. “I shall not be” ... “I shall be possessed of form” ...
               “I shall be formless” ... “I shall be percipient” ... “I shall be 
              non-percipient” ... “I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient” 
              is a conceiving. Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a cancer, 
              conceiving is an arrow. By going beyond all conceiving, monk, he is said
               to be a sage at peace.
              <br> <br> Furthermore, a sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die. He
               is unagitated, and is free from longing. He has nothing whereby he 
              would be born. Not being born, how could he age? Not aging, how could he
               die? Not dying, how could he be agitated? Not being agitated, for what 
              will he long? 
              <br> <br> So it was in reference to this that it was said, ‘He has been stilled 
              where the currents of conceiving do not flow. And when the currents of 
              conceiving do not flow, he is said to be a sage at peace.’</blockquote> Truly, “a sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die.” In 
              this way, when ignorance ceases, the entire complex of conditioned 
              arising bound up with dissatisfaction also ceases. When all traces of 
              “I-making” and “mine-making” are abandoned through the fully integrated 
              threefold training of ethical conduct, meditation, and discernment, just
               this is dispassion (virÄ�ga). Just this is cessation (nirodha). Just 
              this is extinguishment (nibbÄ�na). Just this is without outflows 
              (anÄ�sava). Just this is not-born (ajÄ�ta), not-become (abhÅ«ta), not-made 
              (akata), not-fabricated (asaá¹…khata), endless (ananta), indestructible 
              (apalokita), and yes, death-free (amata). It is freedom (mutti).<br> <br>

              Sustained, dedicated practice of the recognition of selflessness will
               gradually create the optimal conditions for the arising of all seven 
              factors of awakening. SN 46.73 Anatta Sutta (abridged):<br> <blockquote> Here monks, a monk develops the awakening factor of 
              mindfulness accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of 
              dhamma-investigation accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in 
              what is unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and 
              cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of 
              energy accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of joy 
              accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of tranquility
               accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of meditative 
              composure accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of equanimity 
              accompanied by the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, 
              resulting in letting go.<br> <br> It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what is 
              unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit 
              and benefit. It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in 
              what is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that one of two 
              fruits is to be expected: either final gnosis in this very life or, if 
              there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning. It is in this
               way that the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is 
              developed and cultivated so that it leads to great good. It is in this 
              way that the recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is 
              developed and cultivated so that it leads to great security from 
              bondage. It is in this way that the recognition of selflessness in what 
              is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so that it leads to a 
              great sense of urgency. It is in this way that the recognition of 
              selflessness in what is unsatisfactory is developed and cultivated so 
              that it leads to dwelling in great comfort.</blockquote> <br> <a href="http://measurelessmind.ca/nirodhasanna.html">http://measurelessmind.ca/nirodhasanna.html</a><br> <br>
              <h6 class="caption"><span style="font-size: large;">The Recognition of Cessation (NirodhasaññÄ�)</span></h6>
              <div class="hr dotted clearfix"></div>
              <blockquote> For whom there is neither a far shore,<br> Nor a near shore, nor both,<br> Who is free from distress, without ties,<br> Him I call a brÄ�hmaá¹‡a.<br> <br> — Dhammapada 385</blockquote> When the recognition of dispassion is fully developed and realized, 
              and with no self to be found, nothing to be identified with, one 
              realizes the gnosis and vision of liberation (vimuttiñÄ�á¹‡adassana). This 
              is non-referential inner peace (ajjhattasanti). This is the full 
              recognition of cessation. AN 10.60 GirimÄ�nanda Sutta:<br> <blockquote> Now what, Ä€nanda, is the recognition of cessation? Here, 
              Ä€nanda, a monk, gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an 
              empty place, discriminates thus: ‘This is peace, this is excellent, that
               is: the calming of all fabrications, the release of all acquisitions, 
              the elimination of craving, cessation, nibbÄ�na.’ This, Ä€nanda, is called
               the recognition of cessation.</blockquote> This is the complete absence of agitation (calita natthi). Ud 8.4 NibbÄ�na Sutta:<br> <blockquote> There being no agitation, there is tranquility. There being 
              tranquility, there is no inclination. There being no inclination, there 
              is no coming or going. There being no coming or going, there is no 
              passing away or arising. There being no passing away or arising, there 
              is neither a here nor a beyond nor a between-the-two. Just this is the 
              end of unsatisfactoriness.</blockquote> This is the calming of all specific fabrication and volitional intention. MN 140 DhÄ�tuvibhaá¹…ga Sutta:<br> <blockquote> One does not form any specific fabrication or volitional 
              intention towards either existence or non-existence. Not forming any 
              specific fabrication or volitional intention towards either existence or
               non-existence, he does not cling to anything in this world. Not 
              clinging, he is not excited. Unexcited, he personally attains complete 
              nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, 
              done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here.’</blockquote> This is the freedom of absence which is revealed through the complete recognition of selflessness. Ud 1.10 BÄ�hiya Sutta:<br> <blockquote> ‘The seen will be merely the seen, the heard will be 
              merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the known will 
              be merely the known.’ This is how you should train, BÄ�hiya.
              <br> <br> When, BÄ�hiya, for you the seen will be merely the seen, the heard will 
              be merely the heard, the sensed will be merely the sensed, the known 
              will be merely the known, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be that. When, 
              BÄ�hiya, you are not that, then BÄ�hiya, you will not be there. When, 
              BÄ�hiya, you are not there, then BÄ�hiya, you will be neither here nor 
              beyond nor between-the-two. Just this is the end of unsatisfactoriness.</blockquote> This is noble liberation which is the elimination of craving and clinging. MN 106 Ä€neñjasappÄ�ya Sutta:<br> <blockquote> This is death-free, namely, the liberation of mind through not clinging.</blockquote> This is the effortless clarity of consciousness which is non-abiding 
              and not established (appatiá¹­á¹­ha viññÄ�á¹‡a). SN 22.53 Upaya Sutta:<br> <blockquote> When that consciousness is not established, not increasing, 
              not concocting, it is liberated. Being liberated, it is steady. Being 
              steady, it is content. Being content, he is not excited. Unexcited, he 
              personally attains complete nibbÄ�na. He discerns that, ‘Birth is ended, 
              the holy life fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is nothing 
              further here.’</blockquote> There is no more seeking of any kind. There is no more personal 
              agenda. There is no identifying with any phenomena or turning anything 
              into a fixed reference point. There is no “here” nor “beyond” nor 
              “between-the-two.”<br> The awakened mind is measureless (appamÄ�á¹‡acetasa), free from any sort
               of measuring (pamÄ�á¹‡a). In evocative terms, an awakened one is deep 
              (gambhÄ«ra), boundless (appameyya), and fathomless (duppariyogÄ�á¸·ha). 
              Utterly free from any reference to specifically fabricated consciousness
               (viññÄ�á¹‡asaá¹…khayavimutta). “Gone” (atthaá¹…gata), the measureless mind is 
              untraceable (ananuvejja) even here and now. It doesn’t abide in the 
              head, or in the body, or anywhere else for that matter. It doesn’t have 
              size or shape. It’s not an object or a subject.<br> Just as the sky is formless and non-illustrative, the measureless 
              mind is non-illustrative and non-indicative (anidassana). This 
              effortless clarity is unmediated by any specific fabrication or 
              volitional intention.  It is unaffected knowing: The seen is merely the 
              seen (diá¹­á¹­hamatta). The heard is merely the heard (sutamatta). The 
              sensed is merely the sensed (mutamatta). The known is merely the known 
              (viññÄ�tamatta). But there is no <em>you</em> there. Of course, this 
              liberating gnosis and vision can’t adequately be pointed out or 
              indicated by words alone. It is to be individually experienced (paccatta
               veditabba).<br> <br>
