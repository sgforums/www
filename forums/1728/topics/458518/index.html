              <p>I'm hoping someone enlightened will respond, but that's unlikely...</p>
              <p>I have trouble keeping celibate, and I'm addicted to doing, and whenever I'm with other people I can't take part in the conversation. So I'm isolated and unable to have life experiences which would make me more mature.</p>
              <p>I would like to stop all activity and become a pure witness, but it seems impossible.</p>
              <p>On top of that, because of an energy leak, every time I lie down to sleep I lose energy. There is a certain position in sleep that it seems I don't lose energy, but I always roll over into another position. I could sleep sitting down, but the bed is so tempting.</p>
              <p>Without practicing celibacy and collecting energy, and especially in isolation, it seems enlightenment is impossible. Can somebody please help?</p>
              <p>If anyone here is enlightened, could you email me at osha555555@gmail.com?</p>

              <p>Hi Chlorf, it is not necessary that you must practice celibacy, nor shun activities, in order to be enlightened. Neither do you need isolation*. There are different levels of enlightenment. However it is true that at the higher levels of enlightenment (say, anagami and arhantship), sexual desire or sense desire disappears. Those of the sotapanna and sakadagami level of enlightenment might still engage in sexual activities.</p>
              <p>More importantly you must grasp the gist of practice and have the right view. Then dedicate quality time to practice letting go and mindfulness everyday, i.e. meditation practice. In the day you can still engage in your mundane activities, though try to let go of addictive or unwholesome patterns of behaviours and be mindful as much as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*Buddha does not recommend isolation as being necessary, on the other hand he encourage people in this way:</p>

              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the <a id="sakya" name="sakya">Sakyans</a>. Now there is a Sakyan town named <a id="sakkara" name="sakkara">Sakkara</a>. There <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the 
                  Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Ananda said 
                  to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: admirable 
                  friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie."<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.002.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a></p>
              <p>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Admirable friendship, 
                  admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of 
                  the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, 
                  &amp; comrades, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble 
                  eightfold path.</p>
              <p>"<a id="eightfold" name="eightfold">And how</a> does a monk who has 
                  admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, develop &amp; 
                  pursue the noble eightfold path? There is the case where a monk develops
                   right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent 
                  on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops right resolve... 
                  right speech... right action... right livelihood... right effort... 
                  right mindfulness... right concentration dependent on seclusion, 
                  dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in 
                  relinquishment. This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, 
                  companions, &amp; colleagues, develops &amp; pursues the noble eightfold
                   path.</p>
              <p>"And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable 
                  friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually 
                  the whole of the holy life: It is in dependence on me as an admirable 
                  friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that
                   beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings 
                  subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to 
                  sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair have gained release 
                  from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. It is through 
                  this line of reasoning that one may know how admirable friendship, 
                  admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of 
                  the holy life."</p>
