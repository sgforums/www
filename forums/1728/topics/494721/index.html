              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Ken McLeod WINTER 2012 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Breaking
              free from the tyranny of reaction</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              few years ago, I was teaching a workshop on the Heart Sutra. We had just
              finished that long list of negations and everyone was a bit off balance, having
              had the rug pulled out from under them four or five different ways. The next
              lines were “Because for bodhisattvas there is no attainment, they rest,
              trusting the perfection of wisdom.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“When
              he reaches the perfection of wisdom, can a bodhisattva choose to do whatever he
              wants?” a young man asked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              illusion of choice is an indication of a lack of freedom,” I replied. He looked
              at me, stunned, then turned around and gently banged his head against the wall
              as he said, “Now my head really hurts.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Most
              people equate choice and freedom. It seems so reasonable. Freedom means you are
              free to choose, right? It means you are free from restrictions. If you can’t
              choose, then you are not free. And it would seem to follow that the more choice
              you have, the more freedom you have.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              it doesn’t work out that way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              more options you have, the more energy you have to invest in making decisions.
              Which shampoo? Which car? Which dress? Which restaurant? Which movie? Your
              energy and attention are consumed by these decisions, and you have less left
              with which to live your life. I recently met a young entrepreneur who had
              reduced the number of items he owned to 15 (including clothes, just one pair of
              jeans). His aim was to reduce choice in his daily routine so that he could
              focus his attention on his business. It reminded me that during my three-year
              retreat, I had only two sets of clothes. The aim was the same: to reduce choice
              so that I could focus attention on meditation practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              people deliberately eliminate choice and the need for decisions by adopting set
              schedules. They conserve energy for important rather than routine decisions.
              Research into consumer behavior shows that people are more likely to buy
              devices with more options, but they are less likely to use them because it
              takes too long to figure out how to do even the simplest task.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              does choice give you? One answer is that choice makes it possible for you to
              shape your world according to your preferences. All this does is to enable you
              to fashion a world that is an extension of your own patterns. With modern
              technology, you can weave a cocoon of your preferences and rarely run into
              anything that contradicts them. Google now keys its searches to fit your online
              behavior, further cocooning you in your own world. In other words, too much
              choice is a trap. You end up isolated from the richness and complexity of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Choice
              is a dubious blessing when it comes to spiritual practice—in fact, when it
              comes to any creative endeavor. Great art is often the result of restriction in
              form, in materials, in themes. The restrictions concentrate attention and spur
              creativity. It is the same in practice. How do you increase your capacity in
              paying attention? By eliminating all choice. One posture. One object. Rest
              right there. No choice. And, as all of us know, it’s not easy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              lack of choice brings you directly into contact with the way you habitually
              ignore, shut down, manipulate, or control your experience. When you have no
              choice, you have to learn how to relate to what life brings you. You can’t
              weave a comfortable cocoon. On the other hand, by restricting your choice of
              actions, you can develop an internal discipline of not reacting. This is why
              moral discipline was traditionally seen as the basis for meditation practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I look at my own path, once I started to study with Kalu Rinpoche, I didn’t
              have much choice. Tradition and instruction took over. Learn Tibetan, do these
              practices, then this practice, and so on. The three-year retreat was the same,
              one practice after another. No choice. Because of those restrictions, I
              couldn’t avoid my own emotional material. It came out in quite brutal ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              the time I left retreat, all doors to practice were closed for me in the
              tradition in which I had originally trained. Yet something else had formed—a
              firm, way-seeking mind, to use Suzuki Roshi’s phrase. In the years since, I
              have come to appreciate that a firm, way-seeking mind is the most important
              quality to cultivate. With it, you are able to work through any obstacle. I
              simply don’t see how you can develop that if you can choose just what fits with
              you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the functions of monasteries, retreats, ethical codes, and other structures
              associated with spiritual practice is to eliminate choice. When people attend
              the relatively strict discipline at Tassajara Zen Center, for instance, they
              come away feeling rejuvenated and refreshed, precisely because they have had no
              choice for a few days. They feel free, alive, awake in a way that they don’t in
              their regular lives. Prisoners who take up a meditation practice have reported
              that by restricting their range of actions even beyond the limitations of
              prison and just sitting in meditation, they find a freedom they never suspected
              was possible.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              is freedom? It is the moment-by-moment experience of not being run by one’s own
              reactive mechanisms. Does that give you more choice? Usually not. When you
              aren’t run by reactions, you see things more clearly, and there is usually only
              one, possibly two courses of action that are actually viable. Freedom from the
              tyranny of reaction leads to a way of experiencing life that leaves you with
              little else to do but take the direction that life offers you in each moment.
              Hence, the illusion of choice is an indication of a lack of freedom.</span></p>
