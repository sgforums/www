            <div class='col-md body'>Very good.. practising and cultivating buddhism has two aspect.<br><br>One is cultivate 'Fu De', one is cultivate 'Zhi Hui'. Fu de as in blessings, zhi hui as in wisdom. Other than keeping precepts, one must practise 10 Virtuous Deeds, able to give away what he has and lend help to those who need. The highest achievement is reborn in celestial realms. On the other hand, if a person only practises supramundane wisdom, but has little blessings, even if he become an arhant he receives little alms. There is a true story about this.<br><br>Fu De also got two kinds... one is Wu Lou Fu (blessings without leaking), and You Lou Fu (blessings that will leak away). If we break precepts in order to bring benefit to someone it is called You Lou Fu. If we cultivate blessings only for one's greedy intentions, or for 'merits' and 'blessings', or for the 'name', it is also You Lou Fu. Therefore don't give away money for the intention of getting rich. It is not that you will not have anything in return, but that the blessings will be very limited and small.<br><br>With regards to merits, I often say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</span><br><br>....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What are merits and blessings? Is being a vegetarian considered meritorious? How does one cultivate in accordance with the Dharma?[/b]<br><br>Merits and blessings are two different matters. Blessings are cultivated through using material or other means to benefit other people. It is a blessing when we benefit others. Merits are different. When we cultivate to a state where there are neither arisings nor ceasings in our minds, only then is it a merit.<br><br>What merit is there in being vegetarian? To observe vegetarianism is to abstain from taking lives. Abstaining from killing while also cultivating, one's merits are very great indeed. However, even if one were to be vegetarian and abstain from taking lives, if one aids others in their killing, then one is also considered to have violated the precept.</span><br><br>Another very good source of reading, this one is spoken directly from the 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng regarding merits: <a href="http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/hui_neng3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/hui_neng3.html</a></div>
