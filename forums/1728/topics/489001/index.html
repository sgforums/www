                  But some Russians believe it's a cult and, taking the lead of Vladimir Putin’s
                  revanchist movement, have outlawed it.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 1.231; text-align: left;">The history of yoga is
                  more tangled than the lotus position. This week, it’s taken yet another bizarre

              <p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">American yoga practitioners—over 8 percent of the U.S. population,

                  in fact, the spiritual and physical aspects of yoga have been vying for
                  supremacy for over a century. And the battle has only intensified of late.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">“Yoga” is a Sanskrit word that basically means “spiritual practice.” 
                  Perhaps the most central text in yogic literature, the 4<sup>th</sup>-century
                  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, sets forth eight “limbs” of yoga, referring not to
                  arms and legs but to a holistic lifestyle of physical and spiritual
                  purification. These begin with ethics and rigorous spiritual discipline
                  (neither of which get much play at secular yoga studios), continue with the
                  well-known yoga poses and breathing exercises, and culminate in four successive
                  stages of meditation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">At the most refined levels of meditation, the yogi cultivates <em>Samadhi</em>,
                  an intense concentration and absorption of the mind. Buddhists cultivate these
                  states as aids to meditation (as it happens, I am a teacher of this particular
                  form of practice), but for Hindu yogis, they are seen as ecstatic union with
                  the Divine. And indeed, <em>Samadhi </em>is a deeply profound experience.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">It’s not, however, the same as washboard abs. Neither is <em>ishvara
                  pranidhana</em>, the surrender to God (part of step two). What happened?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century—as described by Mark
                  Singleton, Stephanie Syman, and other historians—yoga encountered the West,
                  both in America and in an anti-colonial resistance to Great Britain. In the
                  United States, Americans grew fascinated with Indian contortionists on the one
                  hand (thanks in large part to the spread of photography) and with the new trend
                  of gymnastics on the other. This had the effect of enlarging the importance of
                  postures, twists, and bends, and diminishing that of rigorous diet, study of
                  sacred scriptures, and mystical states.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">It also changed yoga postures to accord with then-contemporary
                  understandings of physical exercise. Yoga poses as we know them today owe as
                  much to the YMCA as to Patanjali—and indeed, even Patanjali’s priority over
                  other Hindu sacred texts was, in part, a result of these evolutions.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">In India, meanwhile, yoga became known as an indigenous form of physical
                  exercise. The British had deemed Indians weak, and suitable for domination.
                  Yoga-as-exercise was one response: here was a distinctively Indian form of
                  physicality far superior to that found in the West. Yoga was a source of Indian
                  nationalist pride in the shadow of colonialism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Thus, what was once one eighth (or, with breathing exercises, one quarter)
                  of a rigorous spiritual discipline became, in India and the West, a kind of
                  oriental exercise. (“Oriental” meaning the “East” as seen through a Western
                  prism: exotic, mysterious, and ‘Other.’)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">But the spiritual and physical are not separate in yoga, and the
                  religio-spiritual elements never entirely disappeared. In postwar America,
                  yoga’s fusion of body and soul captivated a new generation of spiritual
                  seekers. The great yoga gurus—Indra Devi, Satchidananda—were spiritual teachers
                  first and foremost. Even the pioneer of “body-based” (mostly secular) yoga,
                  B.K.S. Iyengar, was often regarded as a sage.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Yet since the 1970s, in particular, the physical dimensions of yoga have
                  predominated, much to the chagrin of spiritual yoga practitioners. Even where
                  spirituality remains a focus, it is often a universalized New Age spirituality,
                  rather than the rigorous discipline advocated in the sutras. Other times, it’s
                  just an exercise routine.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">For example, in 2009, Michelle Obama included yoga in the White House
                  Easter Egg hunt celebrations, <a href="http://www.mindful.org/mindfulness-practice/yoga/yogas-twisted-history">saying</a>, “Our goal today is just to have fun. We want to
                  focus on activity, healthy eating. We’ve got yoga, we’ve got dancing, we’ve got
                  story-telling, we’ve got Easter-egg decorating.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">That’s a far cry from Hindu religious discipline, and it’s how the vast
                  majority of Americans encounter yoga today: as fun exercise, part of healthy
                  living.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">And that’s why yoga’s opponents look ridiculous, whether they’re Russian
                  officials banning it from the town of Nizhnevartovsk or evangelicals <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/christian-parents-sue-california-school-yoga">suing a California school district</a> to keep it out of public
                  school. To most American yoga practitioners, that’s like getting offended by
                  sit-ups.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Who’s right? Well, it depends on how you look at it. The Russians and the
                  evangelicals are clearly correct that yoga originated as part of a Hindu
                  spiritual discipline. (The word “Hindu,” by the way, is itself a relatively
                  recent, Western-originated term.) On the other hand, any Hindu specificity has
                  long been drained out of secular yoga, just as any Buddhist specificity has
                  been drained out of the secular mindfulness taught in the offices of Twitter.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">In India, meanwhile, yoga’s history has twisted yet again.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Under the nationalist leadership of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
                  yoga has become – as it was a century ago – an activity of Indian patriotism. Hilariously,
                  as reported by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/world/asia/india-modi-yoga.html">New York Times</a>, Modi’s penchant for yoga has made it a
                  mandatory practice among Indian bureaucrats, many of whom have spent decades
                  behind desks, and look like it.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">And just ten days ago, on June 21, Modi joined over 35,000 participants in
                  the largest yoga session in history (yes, officially documented as a world
                  record), part of “International Yoga Day,” a U.N.-sanctioned event which
                  included observance around the world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">The backlash has already set in. Modi’s yoga is spiritual and
                  universalist—Yoga Day is “the beginning of a new age through which we will
                  achieve greater heights of peace,” he said—but also particularist. Sanskrit
                  chants are included – and not just ‘Om’ either. Muslims have argued that the
                  Sun Salutation violates their religion. Hindu Nationalists have incorporated
                  yoga into their military drills.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">The net result is a yoga that looks a lot like Indian yoga did 100 years ago:
                  a religiously-inflected, nationalistically-oriented blend of wellness and
                  spirituality.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">It’s not known whether the ban in Nizhnevartovsk is a direct response to
                  these trends. Given the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/19/the-kremlin-s-favorite-anti-gay-hate-group-is-coming-to-utah.html">close ties between U.S. evangelicals and Russian conservatives</a>,
                  their inspiration may have been American, rather than Indian. Either way, this
                  is part of the widespread revanchist movement in Russia, led by President
                  Putin, which seeks to return to conservative values, including an
                  ultra-conservative version of Russian Orthodox Christianity. Yoga-as-occult is
                  a small part of that.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Still, the Russian yoga paroxysm is not entirely unwarranted. There are at
                  least four meanings of the word “yoga”: an ancient Hindu spiritual discipline,
                  a Victorian-influenced health regime, a New Age spiritual-physical activity,
                  and an Indian nationalist exercise. At least three of those might offend a conservative
                  Christian, whether in Siberia or San Diego.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Most of all, this controversy reflects the limitations of Western
                  categories like ‘spiritual’ and ‘physical’ to understand non-Western phenomena,
                  and the remarkable semiotic drift that yoga has enjoyed over the last 150
                  years. As with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIqL6Rzbgm0">meditation</a>, it is remarkable that an ascetic practice of a
                  4<sup>th</sup>-century Hindu sage is now taught at Crunch.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;" lang="EN">Even if not in Nizhnevartovsk.</span></p>
