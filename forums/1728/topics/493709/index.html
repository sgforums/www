              The Benefits of Contemplative Psychotherapy</span></p>

              16, 2017| Lion’s Roar</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Karen
              Kissel Wegela on therapy that starts with your basic sanity, not your neuroses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Elliot
              knew from our first session together that I saw him as basically a good person.
              As he remembered it later, he had told me his personal saga of relationship and
              work failures, and he expected I would conclude, as he had, that he was pretty
              hopeless. Instead, I said something like, “Oh, you’re not so bad.” I don’t
              remember saying that, but, as he told me, he had understood that I really did
              believe in his goodness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“That’s
              why I kept coming back,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I’m
              often asked by clients like Elliot what to expect from someone who describes
              herself as a “contemplative psychotherapist.” Here are some of the key
              principles of contemplative counseling and psychotherapy that I would outline
              for a potential client. As I have studied and practiced mostly in the Vajrayana
              tradition of Buddhism, what I say here reflects that school’s approach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Brilliant Sanity</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Contemplative
              Psychotherapy is based on the view that all of us, no matter what our problems,
              are fundamentally awake and healthy. In some schools of Buddhism this is called
              our buddhanature, and in the Shambhala teachings it’s called our basic
              goodness. In the Contemplative Psychotherapy program here at Naropa University,
              it’s referred to as brilliant sanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              contemplative approach is an optimistic one, because it points to our capacity
              for clarity, compassion, mindfulness, and awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              premise of Contemplative Psychotherapy is that we already have what we need to
              connect with our inherent wisdom and compassion. Therefore, a contemplative
              therapist is concerned primarily with helping clients reconnect with and
              develop confidence in their own inherent sanity. We are not, of course, always
              in touch with it—we have only to look around us to see there is much suffering,
              confusion, and violence in the world. Yet the contemplative approach is an
              optimistic one, because it points to our capacity for clarity, compassion,
              mindfulness, and awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Catching a Glimpse</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              experience of brilliant sanity cannot be completely captured in words. Instead,
              we tend to glimpse it in moments of clear-seeing and tender-heartedness. We
              might have a sense of being fully present when something surprises us. We might
              experience it in a time of unexpected joy, or in a period of intense grief or
              fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              such moments, we are simply right there with an open heart. Such glimpses have
              qualities of sharpness, tenderness, and letting go of thoughts. They might last
              just a few seconds, or they could last a lot longer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              example, when people are about to have a car accident, they may see precisely
              what’s happening and take whatever steps they can to avoid further damage. They
              might feel slowed down and very clear. Then afterward, they might have lots of
              thoughts crowd in about what might have happened. They might have angry
              thoughts or frightened ones. As they get caught up in their thoughts, they lose
              touch with the sense of immediacy and clarity that characterize glimpses of
              brilliant sanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Direct Experience</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is only in the present moment that we can experience our basic sanity. Because
              we can experience it, even if we cannot nail it down with words, therapists
              with a contemplative approach emphasize what their clients directly experience.
              They may ask questions like, “What are you noticing in your body right now?”
              “What do you feel inside as you are talking about what happened last night?”
              and, “As you look around the room, what do you see and hear?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Of
              course, contemplative therapists are interested in their clients’ stories,
              thoughts, and past, but they are less likely to turn therapy into an
              intellectual exploration of what went wrong and whom to blame. They are more
              interested in how what happened in the past is still manifesting in the
              present, not in the past for its own sake.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Obstacles to Experiencing Brilliant
              Sanity</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we have fundamental sanity, why are we so out of touch with it? Buddhism
              teaches that it is because we mistakenly believe we have some kind of solid and
              fixed identity. Sometimes this is called “ego,” but it is the same way the word
              is used in Western psychological theory. Unfortunately, this causes a lot of
              confusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              common use of the term “ego” refers to a sense of agency, an ability to use
              logic, or an ability to know one’s experience. These are not a problem. What is
              a problem is our attempt to create and hang on to our sense of self as
              permanent, separate, and solid. This is the way Buddhist psychology uses the
              word “ego.” Buddhism teaches that we don’t have such an identity, and all
              attempts to maintain it are doomed to failure because we are actually made up
              of experiences that keep changing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              good news is that by letting go of our struggle to maintain a fixed sense of
              self, we can be more creative, flexible, and responsive to what arises in our
              experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              mistaken idea many have about Buddhism is that it’s about giving up ego. But we
              don’t have to give up something we don’t have. From the contemplative
              viewpoint, we never actually had such a fixed identity, so there’s nothing to
              give up except our mistaken beliefs about it. The good news is that by letting
              go of our struggle to maintain a fixed sense of self, we can be more creative,
              flexible, and responsive to what arises in our experience and in our
              relationships with others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              mistake we make is believing we are completely separate from each other.
              However, our experience is always interacting with and being influenced by the
              environment and other people. Thich Nhat Hanh says that we “inter-are.” Modern
              neuroscience also points out this interdependence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the language of Contemplative Psychotherapy, we exchange with each other. If I
              am working with a client who feels very angry, I might start to feel the bodily
              signs of anger in myself. I might feel agitated and hot; I might start to have
              angry thoughts. There could be several things going on, but one thing is that I
              could be exchanging with my client.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              can be a relief for some clients to learn about exchange, because it can help
              them make sense of past experiences. A client of mine grew up with a very
              depressed mother who could barely get off the couch most of the day. Realizing
              that she was exchanging with her mother helped my client let go of her belief
              that she was inescapably fated to being depressed herself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Truth of Suffering</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              earliest teachings of Buddhism are about how suffering arises and how it can be
              reduced. The Buddha taught that there is pain simply in being alive. But he
              also taught that we add unnecessary suffering by trying to grasp that which
              inevitably falls apart, like our identity or anything material we think will
              bring us happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              Buddhist psychology makes a distinction between the inevitable pain of being
              alive—the pain of birth, old age, sickness, and death, according to the
              traditional Buddhism formulation—and the unnecessary suffering that results
              from our attempts to escape or deny reality. These include our misguided
              attempts to maintain a solid identity, to escape unavoidable pain, and to
              aggressively reject what we don’t want.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Blaming
              ourselves for being ill or experiencing pain is fertile ground for more
              unnecessary suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sometimes
              people complain that Buddhism is negative because it teaches that pain is
              inevitable. What I have seen is that knowing pain is part of being alive can be
              a big relief. It means that being in pain is not a sign that we have done
              something wrong. Many of us are quite well-practiced at self-judgment. Blaming
              ourselves for being ill or experiencing pain is fertile ground for more
              unnecessary suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whatever
              the sources of our pain are, including oppression and injustice, we need to
              take responsibility for how we respond to them. For example, internalizing the
              messages we might receive about being lesser because we are a member of a
              marginalized group can be particularly difficult to recognize and address.
              Undoing such damaging beliefs about ourselves is part of the path of reclaiming
              our natural wisdom and compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mindfulness, Awareness, and
              Loving-kindness</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha taught that the way to stop perpetuating the habits that cause us
              unnecessary suffering is to bring mindfulness and awareness to all aspects of
              our lives. In contemplative approaches to therapy, counselors work with their
              clients to develop mindfulness—the ability to bring nonjudgmental attention to
              the details of our experience. This means paying attention less to the content
              of our thoughts and more to what is happening in the present moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I work with clients, I listen for what they already know about developing
              mindfulness. Many clients know a good deal. For example, anyone who has a
              disciplined approach to playing the piano, or practices the specific skills of
              basketball, or cooks attentively, or knows a lot about butterflies already
              knows how to attend to details and to let go of mistakes. So together we
              explore how to bring what they already know to whatever issues they are dealing
              with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Awareness
              is a larger sense than the close attentiveness of mindfulness. It is helpful
              for clients to learn to take a larger view. I had one client who learned to ask
              herself “How else could I look at this?” To do that, she would “back up” and
              see if she could find a different perspective. Often this led her to find humor
              in how she was approaching the problem. It freed her up to become more creative.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              addition, contemplative therapists are interested in helping their clients
              cultivate loving-kindness. At Naropa we use the Sanskrit word maitri to refer
              to the unconditional loving-kindness that we can bring to all aspects of our
              experience. It is the opposite of self-aggression, which unfortunately is
              rampant in much of society. With maitri, we bring a warm heart and curiosity to
              whatever we are feeling, doing, and thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Wisdom Within Emotions</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Contemplative
              therapists are interested in recognizing brilliant sanity in its many forms and
              disguises, and especially in seeing the wisdom within confused emotions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              approach to working with emotions in Vajrayana differs somewhat from that of
              other Buddhist traditions. Instead of regarding our emotions as a problem to
              get rid of, the Vajrayana view is that emotions, even those we regard as
              “negative,” contain wisdom that we can tap into.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Instead
              of trying to get rid of emotions, we can bring curiosity, mindfulness, and
              loving-kindness to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Usually,
              we try one of two unsuccessful strategies to work with our emotions. We either
              try to get rid of them by repressing or ignoring them or we try to get rid of
              them by acting them out. Neither way works very well. Repressed emotions have a
              way of turning into bodily tension and illness or of popping out at
              inconvenient times. We may find ourselves exploding into tears over something
              unimportant because we have tried to push away our sadness over something else.
              On the other hand, acting out emotions tends to intensify them and often leads
              to problems in relationships. It can even lead to violence when we become
              carried away by the energy of anger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Instead
              of trying to get rid of emotions, we can bring curiosity, mindfulness, and
              loving-kindness to them. Going toward the direct experience of our emotions
              lets us get to know them well. We might find that within anger, for example,
              lies much clarity. Before we can get mad about something, we have to see it
              first. So instead of attaching a story line to the anger about how something
              supports our sense of identity or not, we can simply feel what we feel and then
              see what to do next.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Genuine Relationship and the Power of
              Exchange</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              its emphasis on direct experience and understanding interdependence,
              Contemplative Psychotherapy naturally pays attention to the relationship
              between therapist and client. In fact, a genuine relationship is a key healing
              factor in therapy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              genuine relationship between psychotherapist and client is one that is free
              from deception and, at its best, the confusion of clinging to any solid
              identity. Research supports the idea that the relationship between the people
              engaged together in therapy is the most important predictor of success.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              therapists bring mindfulness, awareness, and loving-kindness to their own
              experiences, the client may experience those qualities, too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              principle of exchange offers us some ideas about what happens in therapy, and
              therapists who aren’t familiar with it are likely to misunderstand what is
              going on. If, for example, therapists start to feel afraid during a session,
              they might conclude that a client is frightening them. But a therapist who
              understands the dynamics of exchange might be curious to see if the client is
              feeling fear, which the therapist might also be experiencing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              aspect of exchange is that it goes both ways. Not only does the therapist pick
              up on some of the client’s experience, the client also experiences exchange
              with the therapist. So if therapists bring mindfulness, awareness, and loving-kindness
              to their own experiences, the client may experience those qualities, too. This
              is a big part of what clients find valuable in contemplative therapy, because
              they are met with a nonjudgmental and welcoming atmosphere that is a helpful
              foundation for working with their pain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Therapist’s Own Practice</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              can therapists provide all that nonjudgmental mindfulness, awareness,
              curiosity, compassion, and loving-kindness? By far the most important thing
              they can do is to have an ongoing mindfulness–awareness meditation practice of
              their own. Spending time on a daily basis being present with themselves and
              practicing letting go of their own confused thoughts and mindlessness is a
              powerful way for therapists to know themselves well.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Therapists
              who practice mindfulness–awareness meditation are less likely to confuse their
              own issues with their clients’. They are more able to recognize the difference
              in themselves between having a direct experience and thinking about an
              experience. Their practice helps them cut through any tendency to latch on to a
              fixed identity about themselves as better than or fundamentally different from
              their clients. Finally, meditation gives them the opportunity to make friends
              with themselves so that they can help their clients to do the same.</span></p>
