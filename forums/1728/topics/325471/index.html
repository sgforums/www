              <p><br>Hi, there can be slightly different pronunciations, partly because within different areas of Tibet they have different accents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, in general, you could pronounce it as something like this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Om Ma Ni Pe (as in like the Chinese word è´�) Me (as in like Chinese word ç¾Ž) Hung</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have any opportunity, you could check with the Dharma teachers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In some cases, the teachers emphasize the importance of correct pronunciation; yet there are also times when Dharma teachers said that being very sincere and focused on the chanting is more important than getting the "perfect" pronunciation.</p>

              <p>Actually I prefer to sit on floor with meditation posture, all the great masters like to use this way when chanting, because it helps the person to focus and reduce the expenditure of energy.<br>side track a bit, it is said that China become relatively weaker since dynasty song when people started to sit on chair than on floor. Japanese and Koreans still maintain this good habit till now.</p>

              <p>Actually I prefer to sit on floor with meditation posture, all the great masters like to use this way when chanting, because it helps the person to focus and reduce the expenditure of energy.<br>side track a bit, it is said that China become relatively weaker since dynasty song when people started to sit on chair than on floor. Japanese and Koreans still maintain this good habit till now.</p>

              <p>There's no target for the audience ler.  All the audiences need to do is to follow the pace set by leading lamas and rinpoches on the stages.  Doesn't matter if the pronunciation is in accurate, the most important thing is to maintain a positive motivation.</p>

              <p>I went to look up on                         India Swami Nithyananda's account on his enlightenment experience. It was an inspiring talk, and it is a joy to just listen to that description of his experience/story of his awakening... partly because there is also a recognition of what is being spoken/described with my experience, just as I wrote some of my nondual experience many months back in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/310956">Death, Consciousness, Nondual Perception</a></p>
              <p>But I have to say that even that is not yet enlightenment in context of Buddhism yet.. it is intense luminosity.. it is the direct experience of your own consciousness, the luminous aspect of your Buddha-Nature.. but it is not yet the realisation of anatta and emptiness. In Buddhism, only when there is the prajna insight into anatta and emptiness can be considered enlightenment.</p>
              <p>I would say that the experience being described in the video corresponds to our moderator Thusness's stage 1 and 2 experience, which he describes in the following:</p>

                                      was about 20 years back and it all started with the question of “Before
                                      birth, who am I”. I do not know why but this question seems to capture
                                      my entire being. I can spend days and nights just sitting focusing,
                                      pondering over this question; till one day, everything seemed to come
                                      to a complete standstill, not even a single thread of thought arise.
                                      There is merely nothing and completely void, only this pure sense of
                                      existence. This mere sense of I, this Presence, what is it? It is not
                                      the body, not thought as there is no thought, nothing at all, just
                                      Existence itself. There is no need for anyone to authenticate this
                                      understanding.<br><br>At that moment of realization, I experience
                                      tremendous flow of energy being released. It is as if life is
                                      expressing itself through my body and I am merely nothing but this
                                      expression. However at that point in time, I am still unable to fully
                                      understand what this experience is and how I have misunderstood its
                                      nature.<br><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 2: The experience of “I AM Everything”</span></strong> </span></p>

                                      seems that my experience is supported by many Advaita and Hindu
                                      teachings. But the biggest mistake I made is when I spoke to a Buddhist
                                      friend, he told me about the doctrine of no-self, about no ‘I’. I
                                      rejected such doctrine outright as it is in direct contradiction with
                                      what I experienced. I was deeply confused for sometime and could not
                                      appreciate why Buddha has taught this doctrine and worst still make it
                                      a Dharma Seal. Until one day, I experienced the fusing of everything
                                      into ‘Me’ but somehow there is no ‘me’. It is like an “I-less I’. I
                                      somehow accepted the 'no I' idea but then I still insist that Buddha
                                      shouldn't have put it that way...</span></p>

                                      experience is wonderful, it is as if I am totally emancipated, a

                                      that I am no more confused so I wrote a poem (something like the below),<br><br>I am the rain<br>I am the sky<br>I am the ‘blueness’<br>The color of the sky<br>Nothing is more real than the I<br>Therefore Buddha, I am I.<br><br>There
                                      is a phrase for this experience -- Whenever and wherever there IS, the
                                      IS is Me. This phrase is like a mantra to me. I often use this to lead
                                      me back into the experience of Presence.<br><br>The rest of the journey
                                      is the unfolding and further refining of this experience of Total

                                      preventing me from recapturing the experience. It is the inability to

                                      something is blocking the natural flow of my innermost essence and
                                      preventing me from re-living the experience. Presence is still there
                                      but there is no sense of ‘totality’. It was both logically and
                                      intuitively clear that ‘I’ is the problem. It is the ‘I’ that is
                                      blocking; it is the ‘I’ that is the limit; it is the ‘I’ that is the
                                      boundary but why can’t I do away with it? At that point in time it
                                      didn’t occur to me that I should look into the nature of awareness and
                                      what awareness is all about, instead, I was too occupied with the art
                                      of entering into a state of oblivious to rid the ‘I’...this continues
                                      for the next 13+ years (in between of course there are many other minor
                                      events and the experience of total presence did occur many times but

                                      ‘I’ is the root cause of all artificialities, true freedom is in
                                      spontaneity. Surrender into complete nothingness and everything simply

                                      got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out
                                      more about the experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of
                                      impermanence syncs deeply with what I experience in life. I am faced
                                      with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by financial
                                      crisis. At that point in time I have no idea that Buddhism is so
                                      profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The mystery of life cannot
                                      be understood, I seek for a refuge in Buddhism to alleviate my sorrows
                                      caused by the financial crisis but it turned out to be the missing key
                                      towards experiencing total presence.<br><br>I wasn’t that resistant
                                      then about the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but the idea that all phenomenon
                                      existence is empty of an inherent ‘self’ or ‘Self’ did not quite get
                                      into me. Are they talking about the ‘Self’ as a personality or ‘Self’
                                      as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we do away even with the ‘Witness’ itself or
                                      the Witness is another illusion itself?<br><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is sound, no hearer<br>Suffering exists, no sufferer<br>Deeds there are, no doer<br><br>I
                                      was meditating the above stanza deeply…about its meaning until one day,
                                      suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it was so clear, there was nothing else,
                                      just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’ resounding…. It was so
                                      clear, so vivid!<br><br>That experience is so familiar, so real and so
                                      clear. It is the same experience of “I AM”….it is without thought,
                                      without concepts, without intermediary, without anyone there, without

              <p>Another rather recent and similar case... someone came to this forum to promote a Hindu form of yoga called 'Sahaja Yoga'... the teacher was also speaking from the I AM level of realisation. I wrote quite a lengthy comment, which can be found <a>here:http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/316622</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our moderator Longchen (who also gone through the stages 1 to 6, from I AM to No-Self to Emptiness, and has many writings on his insights gained along the path in <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/articles.html">http://www.dreamdatum.com/articles.html</a>) said something then:</p>
              <p><em>This thread reminds me of one incident last month.</em></p>
              <p><em>I was in one shopping center and i saw a shopfront advertising
                                          Prana and Arhatic Yoga course.</em></p>
              <p><em>Well, naturally, i was curious and went in to have a look. I
                                          have a chat with one of the persons inside. I think she is a staff
                                          or student of the course.</em></p>
              <p><em>I was looking through the brochures and ask her why the word
                                          'Arhat' was used for the Yoga course. Another lady overhead the
                                          conversation and say that the course is pitching at the same level
                                          as the Buddhist Arhat.</em></p>
              <p><em>Having browsed thru some of the brochures, I told her it is not
                                          the same. She seems to be in a hurry and asked me to check out
                                          their website.</em></p>
              <p><em>I check out their website. Their teacher talk about I AM oneness
                                          realisation.</em></p>
              <p><em>Indeed, it is not the same level of realisation as the Arhat.
                                          The teacher is at I AM level understanding. It is sad that the
                                          followers cannot tell the difference.</em></p>
              <p><em>People are doing business and earning from it. So, i thought
                                          better not to disrupt their livelihood by telling them. Also, the
                                          chances of them believing what i say will be very slim...</em></p>
