              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">In the Pali canon, the
              story is told of a king who hears a sound he has never heard before, and finds
              that sound to be “tantalizing, lovely, intoxicating, entrancing, and
              enthralling.” He asks about it and is told it is the sound of a lute. He then
              asks that this lute be brought to him so he can see what sort of thing it is.
              The lute is delivered to the king, who examines it with great interest. He
              takes the lute apart, piece by piece, until it is little more than a pile of
              splinters. He then declares disdainfully, “What a poor thing is this so-called
              lute.” Casting it aside, he asks, “Never mind this lute, bring me just the
              sound.”</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The king is patiently told,
              “This lute, sire, consists of numerous components, and it gives off a sound
              when it is played upon with its numerous components; that is, in dependence on
              the parchment sounding board, the belly, the arm, the head, the strings, the
              plectrum, and the appropriate effort of the musician.” (<em>Samyutta Nikaya</em> 35.205)</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">This story provides us with
              a useful perspective on the modern study of consciousness. It is a widespread
              assumption of scientific materialism that something like the mind (the lovely
              sound) can be reduced to the thing which produces it (the lute), and that the
              proper work of understanding the mind mostly involves a closer and closer
              investigation of the brain. Yes, the components of the lute are necessary
              conditions for the sound to be produced, but the sound itself is something
              wholly different from the lute. Too much emphasis on the physical basis misses the
              point that the music of lived experience is something enacted upon the brain
              rather than embedded in it.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The opposite assumption,
              that there must be something unconditioned, some essence beyond the normal
              matrix of cause and effect, in order to account for the sound of the lute or
              the experience of the mind, is equally prevalent. If consciousness is not
              reducible to materiality, the argument goes, it must be fundamentally
              irreducible and thus either a transcendent creation or somehow part of the
              primordial fabric of the cosmos.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">I understand this story to
              be pointing toward the middle way between these two positions: The sound is an
              entirely natural phenomenon, but one that is implemented rather than
              constituted. In other words, the mind is an <em>event that occurs</em>; it is an
              interdependent confluence of factors that never actually exists but repeatedly
              and reliably unfolds. The neurons of the brain are indeed the stage upon which
              our human drama unfolds, but it is the activity of their firing, changing by
              the millisecond, that brings our story to life. And that activity is only
              accessed by attending directly to experience.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The matter is further
              remarked upon by Buddhaghosa in the <em>Path of Purification</em> (20.96), where
              he too takes up the example of a lute to illustrate the non-materiality of the
              mind. “There is no heap or store of unarisen [mind] prior to its arising. When
              it arises, it does not come from any heap or store, and when it ceases it does
              not go in any direction. There is no heap or store acting as a depository of
              what has ceased.”</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">In the same way, the sound
              of a lute does not exist anywhere before or after its enactment; the sound does
              not come from anywhere or go anywhere. The plucking of a string is an event,
              requiring the lute, the string, the pick, and the effort of an efficient cause
              (in this case a musician). In Buddhist language, both the mind and the sound of
              the lute “not having been, are brought into being, and having been, they
              vanish.”</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The neuron is something
              that stands at the intersection of space and time, much like the string of a
              lute. As a physical object (a living cell), it is of course extended spatially.
              The fact that there are so many neurons in a brain, and that each is connected
              to so many others in a web of such daunting complexity, invites the compelling
              project of mapping out its master wiring diagram. But the essence of a neuron
              is its function, the fact that it “fires” from time to time and that these
              action potentials interact with one another as they cascade through the architecture
              of the brain—much like what happens when a string is plucked.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">From the perspective of
              lived experience, <em>where</em> things are happening in the head is irrelevant,
              while <em>when</em> they are happening is of great importance. We experience the
              flow of events, not the interconnection of structures. The practice of
              meditation involves listening closely to the music of your mind. We are not
              concerned in the moment about <em>how</em> things get to be the way they are,
              only <em>tha</em>t they are so very much exactly what they are. When a musician
              loses herself in the music, the instrument falls away—much like Dogen’s
              “casting off the body and mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">What consequences does this
              have for the way we live our lives? Notice that the story begins with the
              king’s sense of wonder at the beauty of the sound he hears. In those five
              adjectives we can find all the allure of the human condition: tantalizing,
              lovely, intoxicating, entrancing, enthralling. Yet he ends up with a pile of
              splinters, missing and dismissing the very thing that first caught his
              attention and inspired him to listen.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">By all means, let’s study
              the brain, but the conceptual model of how it works to which we aspire,
              fascinating though it is, pales beside what is accessible when we cast aside
              scrutiny of the instrument and take up instead the playing of its music. What
              is the experience of the sound when we pluck this string? And this next note,
              is it discordant or does it beautifully complement the first? How deeply can we
              feel the harmony of several strings, spaced an interval of a third or a fifth
              from one another, resonating together as they are plucked simultaneously?</span></p>

              <p class="p12" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Accounting for experience
              is a fascinating project, but living it is far more so. Just sit quietly, and
              listen to the music.</span></p>
