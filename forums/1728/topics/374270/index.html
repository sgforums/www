              <p>Short description: Zen Buddhism stresses realising one's true nature, or Buddha-Nature which is the luminous (knowing/aware) and empty nature of our mind. Seeing, realising this, is Zen. It is liberation. The method to do this taught in Zen is through practicing awareness, meditation, and sometimes koan training.</p>

              <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;">This essay is to go 
                                      into the historical sequence of how Zen Buddhism came about. It also intends 
                                      to analyze the philosophical tenets of Zen Buddhism. One has to start from 
                                      the source, which is Gautama Buddha. From the beginning in Northern India, 
                                      Gautama became enlightened and he started to teach how to deal with the 
                                      problems of life. Then Buddhism was brought by Bodhidharma to China about 
                                      600 years after Buddha passed away. In China with Buddhism as the father, 
                                      the indigenous Taoism as the mother, Zen Buddhism was begotten. To some 
                                      extent, Confucianism also played a part in the ethics and morality of Zen. 
                                      Six hundred years after Bodhidharma came to China Zen Buddhism went over to 
                                      Japan. Some sort of marriage also took place there. Chinese Zen Buddhism 
                                      merged with Japan’s indigenous religions. These were the Shin, Nichiren, 
                                      Tendai, Shingon and Jodo. All these together amalgamated with Chinese Zen to 
                                      produce Japanese Zen. In Japan Zen also split into Rinzai and Soto sects.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;">In India the states of 
                                      mind during meditation is designated ‘Dhyana’. In Pali it is called ‘Jhana’. 
                                      It is this ‘Jhana’ that eventually became ‘Chan’ in Chinese. In Japan this 
                                      ‘Chan’ became Zen. In other words Zen literally means meditation<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="margin: 0in 1.45pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today, Buddhism is divided into Theravada 
                                      and Mahayana. Theravada Buddhism prevails in Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, 
                                      Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Tibetan Lamaism 
                                      and Buddhism of Korea, China, Mongolia and Japan represent Mahayana 
                                      Buddhism. Of course, in the present day, there is quite an admixture of 
                                      Mahayana and Theravada in the South East Asian countries. Interestingly, the 
                                      difference between Zen and Tibetan Buddhism is far greater than the 
                                      difference between Zen and Theravada Buddhism. However, the dividing 
                                      principle here is Arahatship of Theravada and the Bodhisattvahood of 
                                      Mahayana.</span></span></p>

                                      Indian Buddhism became Zen. It was said in some quarters that Zen began when 
                                      Buddha held up a flower and <strong>Mahakasyapa</strong> smiled. This silent smile 
                                      represents transmission from Gautama Buddha to the first Indian Zen 
                                      Patriarch. There were twenty-eight Indian Zen patriarchs all told. 
                                      Bodhidharma was the 29<sup>th</sup> Indian Zen Patriarch and became the 
                                      first Chinese Zen Patriarch.</span></span></p>

His 
                                      Buddhism had a fair amount of Hinduism in it. There were still some strains 
                                      of Upanishads in his mental makeup. He was born in 440 AD in Kanchi in South 
                                      India. He was a Brahmin by birth and was the third son of King Simhavarman. 
                                      He was converted to Buddhism at a young age, receiving the Dharma from 
                                      Prajnatara, who also asked him to go to China. Bodhidharma left the port of 
                                      Mahaballipuram at the east coast of India and skirted around the Malay 
                                      Peninsula for 3 years to arrive in South China around 475 AD. </span></span></p>

                                      early as 65 AD and since then tens of thousands of Indian and Central Asian 
                                      monks had journeyed to China by land and sea. By the time Bodhidharma 
                                      arrived in China, there were approximately 2,000 Buddhist temples and 36,000 
                                      clergy in the South. In the North a census counted 6,500 temples and 80,000 
                                      clergy.  Less than 50 years later the figures rose to 30,000 temples and 
                                      2,000,000 clergy.</span></span></p>

                                      brought tea to China. In order not to fall asleep, he cut out his eyelids, 
                                      which fell to the ground. On the ground where the eyelids fell tea bushes 
                                      grew. Another legend quoted that he crossed the Yangtze on a hollow reed and 
                                      settled in the Northern Wei capital of Pingcheng. When the Emperor Hsiao-wen 
                                      moved his capital to Loyang, most of the monks followed suit, as they were 
                                      dependent on royal patronage. In the year 496, the Emperor ordered the 
                                      construction of the Shaolin Temple on Mount Sung. It was here in Shaoshih 
                                      Peak that Bodhidharma spent nine years meditating facing the wall in a cave. 
                                      He also must have instructed his disciples in some form of yoga, but not 
                                      specifically teaching any form of martial arts. He had only a few disciples, 
                                      and one of them was <strong>Huike</strong>, to whom he entrusted the bowl and robe. 
                                      Soon after this transfer he died in 528, apparently poisoned by a jealous 
                                      monk. Again legend has it that 3 years later an official met him walking in 
                                      the mountains of Central Asia. He was carrying a staff, from which hung a 
                                      single sandal, telling the official that he was going back to India. In 
                                      respond to sundry rumors, his tomb was opened and only a single sandal was 
                                      found. There was no body!</span></span></p>

                                      that lead to the Path: reason and practice. To enter by reason means to 
                                      realize the essence through instruction and to believe that all living 
                                      things share the same true nature. To enter by practice refers to four 
                                      practices: 1) suffering injustice, 2) adapting to conditions, 3) seeking 
                                      nothing, and 4) practicing the Dharma.</span></span></p>

                                      Because of past karma one suffers in this life. With understanding one 
                                      should accept the injustices because of one’s evil deeds in one’s past 
                                      lives. Keeping harmony with reason, one enters the Path.</span></span></p>

                                      on conditions of our fruits planted in the past lives. One should not be 
                                      happy or sad as these conditions will end. The mind, however, remains 
                                      unmoved. If this is realized, one enters the Path.</span></span></p>

All things contain nothing as their true 
                                      essence. The wise does not desire and is not attached to anything. They are 
                                      on the Path, seeking nothing.</span></span></p>

                                      includes no being because it’s free from the impurity of being, and the 
                                      Dharma includes no self because it’s free from the impurity of self”. The 
                                      wise, that believes this truth, practices charity, giving away all things 
                                      including self without bias and vanity of the giver. They also teach others 
                                      this practice of the way to enlightenment. This is practicing the Dharma.</span></span></p>

                                      things, but we will just study two of his sermons: Bloodstream Sermon and 
                                      Wake-up Sermon. These two will give an indication of the essence of his 
                                      teaching. Both sermons are taken from the “The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma”

                                      enlightenment. This is the reality of self-nature. The mind is 
                                      Buddha-nature. Whoever sees his own nature is a Buddha. It is useless 
                                      invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making offerings and keeping precepts, if 
                                      you don’t see your own nature. Running around all day looking for a Buddha 
                                      is a thorough waste of time. Just realize your own nature. There is no 
                                      Buddha outside your own Buddha-nature. The nature of this mind is basically 
                                      empty, neither pure or impure. This nature is free of cause and effect. This 
                                      Buddha-nature needs not practice or realize. It does no good or evil; it 
                                      does not observe precepts. It is not lazy or energetic. It does nothing. A 
                                      Buddha is not a Buddha. Without seeing your nature, you cannot practice 
                                      thoughtlessness all the time. This mind or Buddha-nature is not the sensual 
                                      mind. It never lived or died throughout the kalpas. The mind has no form and 
                                      its awareness no limit. “ A tathagata’s forms are endless. And so is his 
                                      awareness”. Our mind is the same as the mind of all Buddhas. “Everything 
                                      that has form is an illusion”. “ Wherever you are, there is a Buddha.” We’ve 
                                      always had our Buddha-nature. Our mind is the Buddha: don’t worship a Buddha 
                                      with a Buddha. Once a person realizes his mind or Buddha-nature, he stops 
                                      creating karma. </span></span></p>

                                      us, and this sermon also describes in detail what is the Buddha-nature. But 
                                      it does not teach us how to see our Buddha-nature.</span></span></p>

                                      to go from greed, anger and delusion to morality, meditation and wisdom. The 
                                      three poisons are also buddha-nature. Not thinking of anything is Zen. To 
                                      see emptiness and no mind is to see Buddha. To give oneself is the greatest 
                                      charity and to transcend motion and stillness is the highest meditation. 
                                      Mortals keep moving whilst arhats stay still. Using the mind to look for 
                                      reality is delusion. Not creating delusion is enlightenment. No affliction 
                                      is nirvana.</span></span></p>

                                      great bodhisattvas and Buddhas. To look on life and death as different and 
                                      motion is different from stillness is to be partial. To be impartial is to 
                                      take suffering as no different to nirvana, as both natures are empty. That 
                                      means when suffering one is in nirvana. Nirvana is beyond birth and death 
                                      and beyond nirvana. When the mind stops moving it enters nirvana, which is 
                                      an empty mind.</span></span></p>

                                      nature of phenomena and remain unattached are liberated. Not to be subjected 
                                      by affliction of appearance of phenomena is liberation. Looking at form 
                                      without the arising of the mind is the right way to look. When delusions are 
                                      absent, the mind is the land of Buddhas. When delusions are present, the 
                                      mind is in hell. Bodhisattvas see through delusions by using the mind to 
                                      give birth to mind, they remain in Buddha land. When thought arises there is 
                                      good and bad karma, heaven and hell. Where there are no thoughts, there is

                                      Buddha comes from a mind free of suffering, but the mind does not come from 
                                      Buddha. Whoever wants to see Buddha must see the mind first. Once you have 
                                      seen the Buddha, you forget about the mind. However you cannot have Buddha 
                                      without a mind. If you fill a land with impurity and filth, no Buddha will 
                                      appear. Like ice and water, mortality and Buddhahood are the same nature. To 
                                      be in the three realms is in mortality: to be purified of the three poisons 
                                      is Buddhahood. When a mortal is enlightened, he does not change his face: he 
                                      knows his mind through internal wisdom and takes care of his body through 
                                      external discipline.</span></span></p>

                                      negates affliction. Buddhas regard delusion as their father and greed as 
                                      their mother. Delusion and greed are different names for mortality.</span></span></p>

                                      the mind is truly empty, one is free of delusion and awareness. One is in 
                                      Nirvana.</span></span></p>

Next, <strong>Sengtsan </strong>received the bowl and robe 
                                      from Huike, and became the Third Patriarch. At this time there were periodic 
                                      persecutions of Buddhism with wholesale burning of sutras and images. 
                                      Sengtsan, in order to avoid persecution, wandered all over the country for 
                                      fifteen years. Sengtsan also wrote the first treatise on Zen----<em>Hsinhsinming</em>. 
                                      This is a brilliant recording of the experience, knowledge, and conviction 
                                      of the Buddha-nature. This is a description of one’s Believing Mind in 
                                      oneself where no doubt exists. It is deep, profound and famous. Sengtsan 
                                      died in 606 AD. In 592 AD he met <strong>Taohsin,</strong> who became the Fourth

                                      Patriarch. Hungjen died in 675 AD. He was renowned for having two famous and 
                                      contentious disciples named <strong>Huineng </strong>and<strong> Shenhsiu. </strong>Huineng<strong> </strong>was<strong> </strong>the notable, illiterate Sixth Patriarch. Huineng initiated 
                                      the ‘philosophy of living’ in Zen in the 7<sup>th</sup> century. His Zen is 
                                      neither Indian nor Chinese. His Zen is super-national, almost superhuman, 
                                      but not supernatural. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Huineng</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was born in 637 AD already an enlightened being and died in 713 AD. He was 
                                      re-enlightened on hearing the Diamond sutra recited in a house to which he 
                                      had just delivered some firewood. He was enlightened once again when the 
                                      Fifth Patriarch, Hungjen, repeated the same sutra. Huineng never went to 
                                      school, but I suspect that he was not as illiterate as history would like to 
                                      make him so. He was born knowing and he knew that he knew. Zazen was the 
                                      result and not the cause of his enlightenment. He taught the gospel that the 
                                      eye can see itself. The real actor is the action. Huineng’s Platform Sutra (<em>Prajnaparamitahridaya</em>) 
                                      is very long. However, two poems by Shenhsui and Huineng embody the whole 
                                      history of Buddhism. Huineng was 24 years old when he arrived at the Wang-mei 
                                      monastery of Hungjen, the Fifth Patriarch. He was asked to pound rice in the 
                                      barn. Hungjen (601-674) had asked his disciples to compose a poem to 
                                      indicate their degree of enlightenment. His foremost disciple, Shenhsui 
                                      (606-706) composed this gatha and wrote it on the temple wall:</span></span></p>

                                      He criticized Shenhsui’s advice to his own disciples to concentrate ‘their 
                                      minds on quietness as long as possible.’ To this advice, Huineng had this to 
                                      say: “<em>To concentrate the mind on quietness is a disease of the mind, and 
                                      not Zen at all.</em>” When asked how he could understand the meaning of the
                                      <em>Mahaparinirvana</em> Sutra, he answered: “<em>The profound meaning of all 
                                      the Buddhas has no connection with words and letters.</em>” “<em>The right way 
                                      to recite a sutra is according to its meaningless Meaning. To put a meaning 
                                      into it is all wrong</em>.”  </span></span></p>

                                      in southern China, and this was what he heard and saw: </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The temple flag was blowing in the wind. Two 
                                      monks were arguing about it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The other said: “<em>The wind is moving</em>.”</span></span></p>

                                      agreement. Then the Sixth Patriarch said: “<em>It is not the wind that’s 
                                      moving; it is not flag that’s moving----- it’s your mind that is moving.</em>”</span></span></p>

                                      lived in seclusion in the forests and mountains for sixteen years. Later he 
                                      lived in the monastery Pao-lin in Ts’ao-chi, Canton. Huineng passed away, 
                                      seated in the lotus position, on August 28, 713 AD at Kuo-en Temple in 
                                      Hsin-chou. His death position tells us much more about his stand on zazen 
                                      than any other postulations of his.</span></span></p>

                                      founder of the “Southern Zen of Suddenness.” This contrasts with Shenhsui’s 
                                      “Northern Zen of Gradualness” where the usual practice was gradual 
                                      meditation, which means purifying one’s mind. </span></span></p>

                  in 710 AD and this act promised two centuries of Buddhist growth and 
                  influence in all walks of social life. Temples and monasteries were built 
                  for religious functions and communications, and these led to accumulations 
                  of wealth. At the beginning this money went to social and educational 
                  purposes, but later it led to corruption of the monkhood. A great historical 
                  event came as the dedication of the Central Cathedral in Nara. It was known 
                  as the Todai-ji. Furthermore, a magnificent temple dedicated to the Buddha 
                  Vairocana made the relationship of the government to Buddhism even closer. 
                  It was during this Nara period that the merging of the three major schools 
                  of spiritual teachings took place: <strong>Shinto, Buddhism and Confucianism</strong>. 
                  Shinto happily joined the other two because it was primarily a tribal cult 
                  with a belief in protecting deities functioning through local rituals. 
                  Confucianism supplied the ethical teachings basing on virtue. The ancestor 
                  worship and filial piety of Confucianism were easily absorbed into the 
                  Hindu-influenced Buddhism’s veneration of the dead. Then corruption set in. 
                  Monks became rich and powerful. A breakdown with reformation was inevitable.</span></span></p>

                      capital was transferred from Nara to Kyoto in 794 AD. Two brilliant monks 
                      rose up to entrench Japanese Buddhism with the support of the state. <strong> Saicho </strong>(767-822) and <strong>Kukai</strong> (774-835) tried to develop new schools 
                      of Buddhism infusing Chinese Buddhism in their attempts. Saicho (Dengyo-daishi) 
                      founded a seat of learning at Mount Hiei not far from Kyoto. Here he 
                      introduced the scriptures and treatises of the </span><strong> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tendai</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> School of Chinese Buddhism. These teachings emphasized the universality of 
                      attainment of Buddhahood, embracing the lowest of beings, including beasts 
                      and insects. His concept of universal salvation and his ability to conduct 
                      mystical ceremonies won him government support. Saicho of Mount Hiei then 
                      became the supreme Buddhist power before the decay in the twelve and 
                      thirteen centuries. At one stage he was even able to control state affairs.</span></span></p>

                      also visited China and brought back a new form of Chinese Buddhism—<strong>Shingon</strong>. 
                      This has a mixture of mysticism and occultism and it was situated fifty 
                      miles from Kyoto on Mount Koya. Kukai’s reputation as a powerful occultist 
                      earned him the respect of all and sundry---influential nobles and simple 
                      folks alike. Eventually Shingon became the strongest amidst all Buddhist 
                      schools because of the esoteric aspects of its teachings.</span></span></p>

                      of Shingon Buddhism became even more powerful after Kukai died. Wealth and 
                      power were the perfect ingredients for corruption and decay in the Buddhist 
                      hierarchy and monkhood in the latter part of the ninth century onwards. It 
                      even led to the formation of monk-soldiers (<strong>sohei</strong>). From defensive 
                      these sohei became offensive intimidating the national government. The power 
                      of the sohei became so unmanageable that the Fujiwara clan had to bring in 
                      provincial warriors to put down the sohei in the 11<sup>th</sup> century. 
                      The military finally established a military government in Kamakura near 
                      Tokyo in 1185.</span></span></p>

                      new forms of Buddhism, <strong>Jodo Shin, Zen and Nichiren </strong>were established 
                      in the 13<sup>th</sup> century. Now only simple piety and spiritual excises 
                      prevailed. So finally personal experience, piety and intuition were the 
                      mainstay of the religious practice. In this period all classes including the 
                      common people came to abide by the new Buddhist schools. Buddhism for the 
                      common man was now available to layman or monk, man or woman.</span></span></p>

                      founder of Zen?”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bodhidharma</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> came to China in the 6<sup>th</sup> century and it was he that was generally 
                      credited as the founder of Zen. Some say that this was not the case. They 
                      say that <strong>Huineng</strong> was the real founder of Zen in the 8<sup>th</sup> century. Huineng’s enunciation that prajna and jhana should go together and 
                      that one should not practice jhana first until proficient was a startling 
                      reversal to the previous Patriarchs. One cannot have jhana without prajna 
                      and vice versa. Prajna is intuitive wisdom, which is equivalent to 
                      enlightenment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Noble Eightfold Path is composed of 
                      three disciplines: 1) moral precepts, 2) meditation (jhana), and 3) prajna 
                      (transcendental wisdom). So with Huineng’s teachimg, prajna (enlightenment) 
                      is synonymous with jhana (meditation). This is Zen Buddhism. Whereas before 
                      Huineng, meditation comes first, and when meditation succeeds wisdom and 
                      enlightenment arise. But prajna cannot be attained with discursive 
                      knowledge. It is intuitive knowledge. In other words, while we are thinking, 
                      talking and feeling, Zen and prajna are present at the same time. Zen and 
                      prajna are not two different items: they are one and the same thing. When 
                      one sees a flower, the flower must see one as well. This is then the real 
                      seeing. Also knowing alone is not enough. Seeing must come with knowing: 
                      seeing is direct experience and knowing is philosophical, knowing about. So 
                      in Zen context, the seeing and knowing must move up to a higher plane, and 
                      this intuitive seeing becomes prajna, which is jhana. When Zen talks about 
                      feeling and desire it should be reminded that these feelings should not 
                      refer to the selfish relative self. It should refer to something higher, so 
                      that it becomes intuition---enlightenment. It must also be collective or 
                      total intuition, which becomes real understanding of reality i.e. 
                      enlightenment. This is what Zen tries to achieve. In practice, Zen means 
                      doing anything perfectly: making mistakes perfectly etc. In other words, 
                      there is no egoism in what we are doing. The whole activity is harmonious. 
                      The perfect pain that we suffer is universal pain. The joy is universal joy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zen has no dogmas, no ritual, no mythology, 
                      no church, and no holy book. In all its varied and deep experiences of life 
                      and culture, there is usually a similar taste of depth of oneness. But there 
                      is also separation. Egolessness and ego are also absorbed in this depth of 
                      voidness. Zen is interesting and has good taste. Its mountains are more 
                      mountainous. Actually nobody understands Zen. Nobody can explain it. Zen 
                      arises spontaneously out of the human heart: not a special revelation to 
                      anyone. When goodness, truth and beauty are all present, as one, there is 
                      Zen. To grasp movement in stillness, and stillness in movement, this is Zen.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another crucial statement of Huineng is 
                      “Fundamentally not one thing exists” confirms the sunyata (emptiness) of the 
                      Wisdom Sutras. This emptiness affirms the ultimate reality that lies beyond 
                      all concepts. It also accords with the philosophy of <strong>Nagarjuna</strong>, which 
                      is not nihilism. Huineng’s enlightenment can only be realized when one’s 
                      consciousness breaks through rational and dualistic thinking. Nothing is 
                      grasped because prajna (wisdom) works in a non-objective way. This is the 
                      true, free, dynamic mirror-play of the mind.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, the two 
                      types of meditation are exemplified very discriminatively by the two Chinese 
                      phrases: <em>k’an-ching (kanjo) </em>and<em> chien-hsing (kensho). </em> K’an-ching means “paying attention to purity”, and chien-hsing means “seeing 
                      into one’s true nature.” Paying attention is an ego effort, whereas seeing 
                      into one’s Buddha-nature is transcendence. There is a world of difference 
                      here. In the quiestistic type of meditation, one must continually wipe clean 
                      the obscurities, whilst seeing into Buddha-nature the dust on the mirror is 
                      not a hindrance. In this latter case, non-dualism has already been achieved. 
                      In Huineng’s teaching, dyana and prajna are the same thing i.e. practice and 
                      enlightenment are identical. So meditation here means that it is only a 
                      process of <strong>revealing</strong> one’s enlightenment: it is not indispensable to
                      <strong>attaining</strong> enlightenment. That is why Huineng had no specific methods 
                      of meditation. There is a great deal of freedom and leeway in his meditation 
                      techniques. He warned against motionless sitting because it would obstruct 
                      the Tao, obscuring true reality. In paying attention to purity externally, 
                      one only inhibits his original Buddha-nature, because one’s inner nature is 
                      not activated.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nagarjuna</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in the school of the Middle Way postulates in the <em>Diamond Sutra</em> the 
                      theory of Voidness. Enlightened seeing is non-seeing, knowing is 
                      non-thinking (wu-nien), mind is no mind (wu-hsin). <strong>D.T. Suzuki</strong> uses 
                      the word “unconsciousness” to embrace the whole concept. His <em>Zen Doctrine 
                      of No Mind</em> signifies the ultimate reality with terms like “non-thinking, 
                      non-form, no mind, suchness, Buddha-nature etc.” In the same study, Suzuki 
                      said “self-nature which is self-being is self-seeing, that there is no Being 
                      besides Seeing which is Acting, that these three terms Being, Seeing and 
                      Acting are synonymous and interchangeable.”</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Similarly, the sutra of the Sixth Patriarch 
                      reads: “…in this teaching of mine all have set up no-thought as the main 
                      doctrine, non-form as the substance, and non-abiding as the basis. Non-form 
                      is to be separated from form even when associated with form. No-thought is 
                      not to think even when involved with thought. No-abiding is the original 
                      nature of man.” In Huineng’s Southern School of enlightenment it is an 
                      experience of ultimate reality and of Transcendence and Being. This 
                      breakthrough of duality brings the yogi to a new dimension of Being and 
                      Transcendental Unconsciousness. Thomas Merton puts it very well: “It really 
                      makes no difference whatever if external objects are present in the mirror 
                      of consciousness. There is no need to exclude or suppress them. 
                      Enlightenment does not consist in being without them. True emptiness in the 
                      realization of the light of prajna-wisdom of the Unconsciousness is attained

                      Dogen: ‘For all beings are Buddha-nature.” It is part of all beings or

                      desire, the world of form and the world of formlessness. These signify the 
                      entire universe, the totality of physical and mental reality. When one is 
                      enlightened, when the mind is awakened with practice and nirvana is reached: 
                      ‘the mind is identical with Buddha.’ Also, “Buddha-nature is all things.” 
                      All beings are Buddha-nature to the same extent. The one Buddha-nature is 
                      completely there in every moment. Buddha-nature does not manifest in a 
                      continuous series of past, present and future.</span></span></p>

                      with one’s eyes, ears or mind. Buddha-nature is open, vast, empty and lucid. 
                      The ground of the nothingness of Buddha-nature is emptiness. The nothingness 
                      of transcendence is a double weighted “absolute emptiness.” So the being of 
                      Buddha-nature is synonymous with nothingness of Buddha-nature and emptiness 
                      of Buddha-nature.</span></span></p>

                      impermanent, so is Buddha-nature. There is permanence only in becoming, but

                      enlightenment is an experience of oneness (non-duality). Ma-tsu states:</span></span></p>

                      i.e. our Buddha nature. To the Zen Buddhists, Buddha nature is first and the 
                      historical Buddha is second. In order to realize our Buddha-mind, one must 
                      practice zazen wholeheartedly. It also must include every action, speech and 
                      thought in our daily life. This Zen way of life would lead to satori or 
                      enlightenment, but satori is not the main aim. According to Dogen, 
                      meditation practice is enlightenment itself. It is told that meditation (zazen) 
                      is the main and crucial practice of all Zen Buddhists, but the Koan is also 
                      of prime importance to the <strong>Rinzai</strong> sect. </span></span></p>

                      meditation, but more importantly is the <strong>Koan</strong>. The meditation methods 
                      used usually vary from master to master, and there is a fair amount of 
                      freedom in their methods.  Whereas <strong>Soto Z</strong>en practices mainly zazen 
                      and mindfulness of daily activities. <strong>Eisai-zenji</strong> (1141-1215), founder 
                      of the <strong>Rinzai</strong> sect, went to China to study Zen at the age of 28, but 
                      he was not enlightened in this first attempt. At 49 he went to China again 
                      and this time he was successfully enlightened. He was then able to transmit 
                      the essence of <strong>Lin-chi (Rinzai)</strong> to Japan. He taught strict adherence 
                      to the vinaya, the rules of discipline for the monks and nuns. This is of 
                      the utmost importance. Zazen is secondary. He also taught that dharma, the 
                      Buddhist teachings of Law were identical to the Buddha-mind. And in order to 
                      realize the Buddha-nature, the sutras are quite useless unless one is 
                      already realized. That means Buddha-mind is transmitted from Buddha to 
                      Buddha. We are already Buddhas when born, but we do not realize it. The <strong> Rinzai</strong> method of using koans is to progress step by step in one’s 
                      meditation. Koans get more and more difficult as one goes on until one is 
                      enlightened.</span></span></p>

                      practice of religions of the world. Near the end of the T’ang period the Zen 
                      masters evolved this technique leading to enlightenment. <strong>Ruth </strong>Fuller 
                      Sasaki who was married to a Japanese Zen master, had this to say about koans: 
                      “The koan is not a conundrum to be solved by a nimble wit. It is not a 
                      verbal psychiatric device for shocking the disintegrated ego of a student 
                      into some kind of stability. Nor, in my opinion, is it ever a paradoxical 
                      statement except to those who view it from the outside. When the koan is 
                      resolved it is realized to be a simple and clear statement made from the 
                      state of consciousness which it has helped to awaken.”</span></span></p>

The koans 
                      consist of sharp retorts of masters, anecdotes from the daily life of the 
                      Zen monastery, and occasionally even verses from the sutras. The disciple is 
                      given a koan to solve by concentrating continuously with all his energy 
                      until he loses rational thinking. In this heightened atmosphere he breaks 
                      into the suprarational realm of enlightenment. Heavy concentration on the 
                      koan, day and night, will finally land the practitioner into a hyper-alert 
                      state, in which he is aware of only one thing---the koan. At first he 
                      searches for a solution of the koan, to no avail. Then he reaches a state of 
                      helplessness and he finds himself climbing up the wall, looking for the door 
                      of exit. Again it is useless. He has to have an about turn sometimes leading 
                      to a psychic explosion. The master is always there to guide and to lead the 
                      disciple. This master-disciple relationship is close and intense, like the 
                      guru in India. There are daily interviews with the student’s reports of 
                      makyo (hallucinations), his desperateness with corrections and guidance by 
                      the master. Whatever happens, the student is further exhorted to continue to 
                      work harder until the glimmer of light begins to appear. Thence to satori.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Chinese word for koan is <em>kung-an</em>. 
                      It means ‘public announcement.’ It is generally accepted that there are 
                      1,700 cases of koans, but there are probably many more. The best known are 
                      the <em>Hekiganroku </em>and the<em> Mumonkan </em>of the Sung period. The 
                      hundred cases of <em>Hekiganroku</em> paint a vivid picture of the koan world 
                      and the Zen movement in China. It is of superb literary spiritual quality. 
                      The <em>Mumonkan</em> collection of forty-eight koans is simpler, more for 
                      practical use. These were compiled by <strong>Hui-Kai </strong>(1184-1260) a hundred 
                      years later. The Zen masters seemed to prefer the <em>Mumonkan</em> precisely 
                      for their simplicity.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dogen</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> introduced Soto Zen to Japan in the early part of the Kamakura period 
                      (1185-1336). Soto Zen says that meditation awakens the individual to the 
                      fact that he is already and totally integrated to the Law of Buddha (i.e. 
                      enlightened), and meditation is to realize his inherent Buddha-nature. This 
                      principle of non-duality is known as <em>Madhyamika</em> in Buddhism. It 
                      states that thoughts of duality (subject-object, being and non-being etc) 
                      cannot arrive at the true nature of existence. The <em>Madhyamika</em> states 
                      that there are two levels of truth: the ‘supreme’ and the ‘conventional’. 
                      The supreme means insight into the transcendental, where <em>sunyata</em> (void or emptiness) dissolves the opposites. In this void, opposites do not 
                      cause any dichotomy, as they are complementary entities in the existential 
                      world. One is all and all is one. The conventional truth however points to 
                      insight into the phenomenal, which refers to the cause and effect in the 
                      doctrine of dependent origin. So Dogen’s <em>Madhyamika</em> is the practical 
                      application of non-duality.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Soto Zen states that Buddha-nature is 
                      inherent in our mind and the practice of zazen is merely to realize this 
                      inherent Buddha-nature. One cannot acquire it. In this context, zazen 
                      practice is an act of enlightenment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Seeing that Buddha-nature is universal, all 
                      men are equal with regards to Buddha-nature. Zen is therefore not an 
                      analytical philosophy but an experiential one. It also follows that man has 
                      to work, and Zen values labor in the individual practitioner. Zen 
                      consequently emphasizes harmony with the environment, which is cultivated by 
                      man on nature. This also symbolizes the Bodhisattva path, which helps to 
                      alleviate the problems of other sentient beings. Zen does not allow the life 
                      of a hermit in which the suffering of others is excluded.</span></span></p>

His father was a 
                      high-ranking government minister. At the age of four he was able to read 
                      Chinese poetry and by the age of nine he read a Chinese translation of the 
                      Abhidharma. However his childhood was marred by the deaths of his father at 
                      two and of his mother at seven. These losses made him want to find out the 
                      meaning of life and death. Thus his determination to join the monkhood. 
                      Early on he taught that one should not squander away one’s transient life, 
                      and no amount of power and wealth can prevent death. We can only take with 
                      us at death our karma.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">He became a monk at the age of thirteen at 
                      Mount Hiei, the headquarters of Tendai Buddhism. For the next several years 
                      he studied Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism under his master, Abbot <strong>Koen</strong>. 
                      His main conundrum was that “<em>if all of us are endowed with Buddha-nature, 
                      why is it so difficult to realize it?”</em> He went to many monasteries to 
                      ask this question, but none could provide him an answer, until he came to <strong> Eisai</strong> at Kennin-ji. Eisai’s answer was that all the Buddhas themselves 
                      do not think of Buddha-nature, but only the grossly deluded ponder over such 
                      problems. This assuaged Dogen to some extent. He decided to stay with Eisai 
                      and learn his Rinzai teachings, but Eisai died the next year.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">After this he studied for nine years under
                      <strong>Myozen</strong> (1184-1225), who was a disciple of Eisai. Under Myozen he 
                      learnt all the methods of the Rinzai sect. After so many years under Myozen, 
                      Dogen is still unfulfilled. Then he went to China with Myozen in 1223 to 
                      further study Zen Buddhism. After arrival in China, he stayed on the ship 
                      for sometime. It is in this ship that he learnt from a tenzo-monk, who was a 
                      cook of a large monastery that <em>Zen must be expressed through our daily 
                      actions, be it cooking, cleaning or sewing.</em> He went to T’ien-t’ung 
                      monastery and trained under Abott <strong>Wu-chi</strong>. It was here that he was 
                      discriminated against because he was a foreign monk. His protest against 
                      this racial discrimination was not heeded. It was only after he appealed to 
                      the Emperor that this racial discrimination was redressed. In spite of this, 
                      his understanding of Zen deepened. When Abott Wu-chi died he came back to 
                      China to study under Abott <strong>Ju-ching</strong>. The latter taught him to 
                      practice zazen day and night without stop. Then one day he heard Ju-ching 
                      admonishing a fellow monk next to him dozing off. “In practicing zazen, body 
                      and mind have been cast off; you cannot attain it by sleeping!” With this 
                      admonishment, Dogen became fully enlightened. He continued to stay with 
                      Ju-ching for another two years, <em>for practice after enlightenment is just 
                      as important as before enlightenment.</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In 1227, he decided to return to Japan. On 
                      returning, he was disappointed by the standard of practice in his old 
                      temple, Kennin-ji. So he moved to An-yo-in temple. Here he wrote “A 
                      Universal Recommendation for Zazen”, which teaches correct zazen and essence 
                      of Zen Buddhism. It was also here that he wrote “The Practice of the Way”, 
                      which was the first section of his great master-piece, the Shobo-genzo.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">When he moved to Kosho-ji temple, he had his 
                      first meditation hall built for monks and lay people alike. At the same time 
                      he warned against building fine temples and carving of Buddha images. When 
                      this hall was built, his reputation became so popular that the hall was too 
                      small when it was completed. He had to start a new hall. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The two main points of Dogen’s teachings are 
                      1) there is no difference between zazen and enlightenment, maintaining that 
                      zazen itself is an enlightenment practice and 2) right daily behavior is 
                      Buddhism itself. However, he also stressed the importance of the sutras, 
                      which he taught to be one with Truth. He also opposed koan practice. 
                      Nonetheless, even to this day, some Soto masters still teach the koan 
                      practice</span></span></p>

                      from Dogen’s thought:</span></span></p>

                      Zazen is the complete realization of self, identifying with others. He said: 
                      “To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the 
                      self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things. To be 
                      enlightened by all things is to remove the barriers between one’s self and 
                      others.”</span></span></p>

                      enlightenment</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. There is no 
                      difference between practice and enlightenment. There should not be any 
                      attachment to the outcome of the practice.</span></span></p>

                      and Zen Buddhism</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Novice monks 
                      must know the 16 Bodhisattvas precepts before becoming monks. There is no 
                      difference between the precepts and Zen itself. When enlightened he is 
                      already endowed with the precepts.</span></span></p>

                      and hate death, nobody can avoid death. Once you come to terms with death, 
                      there is no life or death to love or hate. Both are part of the life of a 
                      Buddha.</span></span></p>

Time can only be experienced but cannot be 
                      cognized. Now is now which includes past, present and the future. Without 
                      now there are no others. Now is absolute and eternal. Once lost it never 
                      returns. So practice continuously without delay.</span></span></p>

                      and vice versa. In non-dualistic terms, both are absolutes. So we have both 
                      the Buddha-nature and we also do not have the Buddha-nature in non-dualistic 
                      viewpoint. Nonbeing in Zen is never the nothing of nihilism but it is a 
                      lively and creative function of the Way.</span></span></p>

                      to men and women equally.</span></span></p>

Lay people can 
                      pursue the Way but their practice must be intense and persistent. Of course 
                      the best is to become monks and follow the precepts. Remember Dogen’s 
                      teaching is that practice takes precedence over theory.</span></span></p>

                      to the letters and sutras is itself a hindrance. So it is the attachment to 
                      the letters and not the letters that must be cast away.</span></span></p>

                      importance. He advised: “You should cease from practice based on 
                      intellectual understanding and pursuing words. Instead turn inwards and 
                      illuminate your self. <em>Body and mind should drop away</em>, and your 
                      original face will be manifest. If you want to attain suchness 
                      (Buddha-nature), you should practice suchness without delay.</span></span></p>

                      two cushions, placed one on top of the other, in a quiet room, in the full 
                      or half lotus position, the left hand placed on the right, thumb tips 
                      touching. Thus sit upright in a correct bodily posture, neither inclining to 
                      the left nor to the right, neither leaning forward nor backward. All efforts 
                      should be directed at overcoming the inner unrest that arises from 
                      discursive thinking. Cast aside all involvement and cease all affairs. Do 
                      not think good or bad. Do not administer pros and cons. Cease all the 
                      movements of the conscious mind, the gauging of all thoughts and views. Have 
                      no designs on becoming a Buddha. This has nothing to do with sitting or 
                      lying down.</em></span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This … is the essential art of zazen…..It is 
                      simply the Dharma-gate of repose and bliss. This practice requires a great 
                      deal of effort. It must be persistent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zazen is enlightenment according to Dogen, 
                      when body and mind (ego) are cast off. His first satori came when he heard 
                      Ju-ching admonishing his fellow monk in China about sleeping. This satori 
                      was the result of casting off of the ego from his consciousness, and this 
                      memory remained with him for the rest of his life. This is his conscious and 
                      luminous experience of enlightenment perceived in zazen. He had broken into 
                      the non-dualistic Unconsciousness of Buddha-nature. Thus satori is an 
                      experience of Being. This is his “taking one step beyond the top of a 
                      hundred-foot pole”, when his normal consciousness is released and 
                      transcended during zazen. Dogen formally instructed his students with this: 
                      The most important point in the study of the Way is zazen. Many in China 
                      gained enlightenment solely through the strength of zazen… The Way of the 
                      Buddha and Patriarch is zazen alone. When asked about the value of sutras, 
                      he retorted: “Even though you study a thousand sutras and ten thousand 
                      sastras and sit so hard that you break through the zazen seat, you cannot 
                      gain the Way of the Buddhas and the Patriarchs without this determination to 
                      cast off body and mind, which is the very quintessence of being enlightened.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">He again said: “In the Buddha Dharma, 
                      practice and realization are identical. Because one’s present practice is 
                      practice in realization, one’s initial negotiation of the Way in itself is 
                      the whole of original realization… As it is already realization in practice, 
                      realization is endless; as it is practice in realization, practice is 
                      beginningless.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This view shows that satori is a shining 
                      forth of Buddha-nature. Achieving of satori is not the end. Practice must 
                      continue after satori because it is practice in enlightenment, which must be 
                      continually confirmed by practice. Therefore his <em>shikantaza</em> (merely 
                      sitting) is the fullness of the Buddha-way</span></span></p>

                      breakthrough from this dualistic world to the non-dualistic realm of 
                      Reality. This is the goal of all mystics of all religions. When one is in 
                      that realm, there are signs and symptoms pertaining to that state. However, 
                      it is ineffable in that when one returns to dualism no words can describe 
                      that state. There are, however, mental, psychological, emotional and 
                      physical signs that do not come close to presenting the actual Ultimate 
                      State of Consciousness. The Ultimate State of Consciousness is superbly 
                      glorious with bliss, joy and happiness co-existent with calmness, serenity 
                      and tranquillity.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Firstly, there are physical signs of 
                      approaching satori, but not the real thing. Heat, vibrations up and down 
                      one’s spine, trembling all over the body, pain, sometimes excruciating, are 
                      some of the premonitory signs. Then the feeling of lightness, as if one is 
                      floating in the air. Makyo, in the form of hallucinations and visions are 
                      rather often, especially after prolonged and intensive meditation. Some 
                      truly go into psychotic states. Makyo must be recognized and stopped by the 
                      master or else the disciple is led up the garden path and indelible damage 
                      is done. This is because the student thinks he is being enlightened. Zen 
                      masters call them “devil’s realm.” Then the surest one is Light: all objects 
                      in the room and the room itself are lit up as if a search light is blasted 
                      on to everything in that room. If other people are present in that room 
                      sometimes some of them can also see the light. Students also experience 
                      different colored lights and all modes of sound and music. Visions of Kuan 
                      Yin, Buddhist saints and Buddha himself are not uncommon, leading to this 
                      advice: “If you see the Buddha, kill him!” All these devil’s realms must be 
                      apprehended by the master, who will lead the practitioners back to the path. 
                      Also pain is not an infrequent symptom. Sharp, piercing pain like being 
                      stuck with needles up and down the spine is also a common symptom. <strong>When 
                      satori breaks through</strong> there is a great sense of joy and happiness. They 
                      laugh out without any control. They also cry for happiness. They dance and 
                      they sing on top of their voices. There is a freedom that is equivalent to 
                      being let out of prison after decades of incarceration.  Of course the 
                      liberation is much more exhilarating than a breakout from prison. </span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cosmic consciousness</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The nearest comparison to satori is a glimpse of cosmic consciousness. Here 
                      in the Zen context, the most frequent exclamation is “nothingness.” Every 
                      thought, every vision, every master, every concept is transformed into 
                      nothingness. Before this breakthrough there is high tension. There maybe 
                      lights or maybe total darkness. Then abruptly the infinite space turns into 
                      nothingness. Or ‘I and the universe are one’ is a common comment. This 
                      breakthrough may be precipitated by a sound caused by a pebble striking a 
                      bamboo or a striking of a clock or a shout by the roshi. After the 
                      enlightening episode, the practitioner is a bit confused and absent-minded. 
                      He needs some time to adjust, to shout or cry it all out. Of course he also 
                      needs to have confirmation by the master.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.45pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">These satoris may start with a weak one at 
                      first. Then they are repeated again and again, each one stronger than the 
                      previous one. These mini-satoris gather strength as they practice into full 
                      fledge satoris. The final one is the maha-satori. From thence onwards, there 
                      is no more doubt and not the slightest chance of retracement. He is now 
                      established in that state of enlightenment but he has to continue to 
                      practice. This enlightening practice of zazen has to continue until death. 
                      However, he is now endowed with Buddha’s Eight aspects of Enlightenment, 
                      which lead to Nirvana. These eight aspects are: 1) Freedom from greed 2) 
                      Satisfaction with whatever he has 3) Quiet and solitary life.  4) Diligence. 
                      5) Right mindfulness. 6) Samadhi: to remain undisturbed. 7) Wisdom for 
                      self-reflection. He has now the power to see the Truth with his naked eyes.  
                      8) Freedom from random discussions and thoughts.</span></span></p>

                      means the ‘doctrine of the elders’. The term Hinayana has also been used for 
                      this form of Buddhism, but it is a misnomer. This term has been used by the 
                      Mahayana Buddhists, who reckoned that they were followers of the ‘greater 
                      vehicle’. The Mahayanists to differentiate themselves from the Theravadins 
                      called the latter Hinayana, the lesser vehicle. In the pre-Mahayana period 
                      there was truly a collateral sect called the Hinayana, but this sect is not 
                      the Theravada of today. This confusion was unfortunate, and therefore, it is 
                      better to avoid the term Hinayana altogether. Any attempt to label two 
                      different forms of Buddhism as ‘greater’ and ‘lesser’ is odious.</span></span></p>

                      the main sacred language used and it depends on the Pali Canon for its 
                      practice. In Pali, the texts that are crucial in the teaching are called the 
                      Tipitaka, which are in three parts. These three are 1) Vinaya Pitaka, the 
                      rules and disciplines of the Sangha. There are 227 rules governing the 
                      monks. 2) Sutta Pitaka, Buddha’s sermons, poetry and miscellaneous texts. 3) 
                      Abhidharmma Pitaka, systematic philosophy, which consists of scholastic 
                      analysis of doctrines and the working of the mind. Then associated with the 
                      Tipitaka, there are the commentaries, most of which came about after Buddha 
                      died. An ancillary work by the monk Buddhaghosa, the Visuddhi Magga, (<em>The 
                      Path to Purity</em>) is a classic commentary. It was written in the 5<sup>th</sup> century and it is read more frequently than the Tipitaka.</span></span></p>

                      He was born as Gautama, a clan name, which was used before his 
                      enlightenment. His father also gave him a personal name as Siddhartha. 
                      Retrospectively the name Shakyamuni was bestowed on Buddha as the sage of 
                      the Sakya people. Buddha is a universal name for anybody who is enlightened 
                      or awakened. Tathagata is synonymous with Buddha, and it means “sovereign 
                      freedom over one’s personal destiny”. Gautama lived for 80 years, and he 
                      died about 486 BC. As an only son of a wealthy king, he was very sheltered 
                      and pampered. He had the best of everything: clothes, food, education, 
                      servants and all sorts of entertainment. He was so sheltered that he knew 
                      nothing of the suffering in illnesses, old age and death. One day he was 
                      confronted with the reality of all of them. The suffering that arose with 
                      these events of a human being makes life precarious and transient. Where is 
                      the perpetual happiness? Actually after he was enlightened, he realised that 
                      these events were points of sorrow only if one clung on to them as ‘I’ and 
                      ‘mine’. After seeing these events this conundrum plagued him thereafter. 
                      Until he saw a monk whom he was told could release him to liberation. With 
                      this knowledge, he decided to walk the homeless path and decided to give up 
                      the throne waiting for him. He had learnt that power and wealth are of 
                      temporary use in this life of sorrow and suffering. He decided to forego the 
                      pleasures of his luxurious home and the power of a king.</span></span></p>

                      years old and wandered all over the valley of the Ganges River for six 
                      years. During this time he apprenticed himself to two well-known teachers 
                      and learnt all that he could learn from them. But nothing in the teachings 
                      could relieve him from his underlying sorrow and discontentment. Then he 
                      left to search for liberation on his own. He tried all forms of austerities 
                      but failed. So he began to nourish himself in order not to die of 
                      starvation, and this worked. One day sitting underneath a Bodhi tree in Bodh 
                      Gaya he became enlightened. His meditation was deep with mindfulness. Four 
                      stages were described in his meditation. The first was that thought started 
                      to arise and he followed the thoughts through his mind. This gave him joyful 
                      elation. Secondly, all his thoughts were allowed to subside and no new 
                      thoughts were allowed to arise. He now experiences tranquillity with his 
                      one-pointedness. Joy is still present. Thirdly, rapture and bliss are 
                      allowed to subside to be replaced by equanimity. Mindfulness is still 
                      steadfast. He was then in the fourth jhana in full control and awareness. 
                      Next came the three kinds of knowledge.</span></span></p>

                      watch of the night when he recollected all his previous lives. He remembered 
                      thousands of his own lives and how he arrived to where he was with karma and 
                      rebirth. He knew who he was! </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>

                      the second watch. Here he could see the coming and passing away of all 
                      sentient beings of the universe. He was able to know the conditions of all 
                      of them: whether they are well or miserable, good fortune or bad according 
                      to their karmic deeds.</span></span></p>

                      knowledge was achieved at the third watch of the night. He was finally free. 
                      It meant that he had ‘Knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.’ The 
                      three cankers are: sense-pleasures, rebirth and ignorance. In other words 
                      the four noble truths. At last, no more rebirths. He was now able to realise

                      realised that he was awakened by his own human ability. He was human and not 
                      a God. And that means he is no more accessible to us. However, seeing that 
                      he was human, it also gives us great encouragement with our own search. By 
                      the same token, it is useless to pray to him for help. We must be a lamp 
                      unto ourselves.</span></span></p>

                      god, Brahma, which probably meant in his cosmic vision, he reluctantly 
                      agreed to teach other people the way and the path to liberation. He was 
                      reluctant because he thought that the knowledge and experience would be 
                      almost impossible to come by. But after casting his prescient eye all over 
                      the world, he saw that some sentient beings already had their eyes partially 
                      opened. So he agreed. Thence, he wandered all over the region for about 
                      forty five years, teaching all and sundry, the poor and the rich, royalties 
                      and commoners, intelligent and stupid. He also did not distinguish between 
                      his students. He kept no secrets from them: he taught them with an open 
                      hand. However, he taught according to the spiritual level of his students.</span></span></p>

                      assets (money), status, power and security. At the back of our mind, we know 
                      that ill health, ageing and death will take away what we already possess. 
                      Without the right path we are bound to remain confused and discontented

                      a practice to see things as they are in the here and now. One must directly 
                      perceive Reality itself. But a belief can also obstruct the Truth. It is 
                      only with direct perception that one can really see Reality. The Zen 
                      practitioners call it experiencing Buddha-nature. When you see you know 
                      immediately. It is an awakening or satori. You are already well equipped now 
                      to be awakened. Nothing more is needed.</span></span></p>

                      age and death. One also suffers when what one loves is taken away, and what 
                      one detests is nearby. One also suffers when one is unable to obtain what 
                      one wants. However, life is still not all suffering. There are times and 
                      days when life is good. Few people remember the good times, but most people 
                      complain about the bad times. The unpleasant things one remembers vary from 
                      the trivial to the very serious, always not realising that one’s life is so 
                      very temporary. There is never any satisfaction.</span></span></p>

                      constant fear, anxiety and worry. We are too frightened to go out for a 
                      short journey to the supermarket in case of mugging. Fearful of going for a 
                      picnic as it may rain or storm. The car is too old and we are afraid of a 
                      breakdown on the way to church. The priest is covertly watching me: is my 
                      guilt so transparent? These and innumerable other concerns constitute the <strong> perennial problem</strong>, which has been plaguing the human race for thousands 
                      of years. Buddha called it the ‘eighty four problems’, the eighty-fourth 
                      being ‘not to have any problems’.</span></span></p>

                      which is generally interpreted as suffering, but this is only a partial 
                      explanation. Dukkha includes discontentment, unsatisfactoriness and not at 
                      peace. There is always a constant turpitude, an underlying smouldering of 
                      dis-ease in the subconscious. Dukkha means all these and more. Generally, 
                      one can classify Dukkha into three categories:</span></span></p>

As long as we have a body, we cannot avoid pain 
                      and suffering due to injury, accidents, sickness and death. These physical 
                      episodes naturally translate into mental pain, which in a worrier can be 
                      exaggerated to unbelievable proportions. Then there is real mental pain 
                      itself without the physical component. This comes from real worries and 
                      anxieties in our daily living. Especially in a city, life is competitive, 
                      intricate and full of machinations. There is sexual and asexual harassment. 
                      There is that grouchy boss who insists on perfection in the shortest of 
                      time. Then living in a home within a small budget together with the 
                      travelling in a crowded city constitutes a problem. Also the bringing up of 
                      children up to adulthood is far from easy. All these may mean dukkha to 
                      some, but not to others. In running away from dukkha may in turn bring more 
                      dukkha. One of the most frequent causes of dukkha is worrying of what the 
                      future may bring: pessimistic expectations of future losses of jobs and 
                      assets or worrying of our own and children’s health. Are the children able 
                      to study and what schools shall we put them in? Throughout one’s life, there 
                      is always something to be anxious about. There is never any peace or 
                      contentment. The above is a litany of woes in an ordinary family. What about 
                      a broken family or a family where crimes are habitually committed? There is 
                      no end.</span></span></p>

                      mind are subjected to change. The blood chemistry, skin, muscle, bones and 
                      all the organs are changing every second through wear and tear or through 
                      growth. Our thoughts change even faster. Nothing in this world exists 
                      without changing. Everything is in constant flux. We do not like change. We 
                      would like to remain static or young forever. We do not want our children to 
                      grow up. We do not want our houses or cars to grow old. We do not want to 
                      grow old ourselves. We do not want our money to dwindle as we spend. In 
                      order to control the situation, we try to take charge to prevent these 
                      changes. Quite often this attempt to control makes things worse. 
                      Occasionally we succeed, but only for a short while. Thence the 
                      deterioration resumes. The most constant thing in the world is change. If 
                      one does not accept that, then one suffers---dukkha. </span></span></p>

                      change or control his or her G-plan. There is no where to escape to. Suicide

                      easy to see. If you are in duality and see your-self as a separate entity 
                      from the rest of the world, you will continue to be in dukkha until you 
                      breakthrough to non-duality. The suffering and depression will not subside. 
                      One needs to meditate more on this subject. One is never totally separate. 
                      One’s connections with all the other entities are obvious as well as 
                      invisible. The workers in the supermarket need your custom. The restaurants 
                      also depend on you to survive. The most obvious conditional fact is your 
                      family's dependency on you. So are your co-workers in your office. The 
                      lumberjack is dependent on you because you’ve bought a desk and a house made 
                      of wood. The workers in the waterworks and electrical plants owe you a 
                      living. So if you sit down to work out all these details, you will find that 
                      you are also dependent on the rest of the community for your living. Then 
                      the most important questions are ‘who am I?’ ‘why am I here?’, ‘ is there a 
                      purpose in living?’ and ‘what happens when I die?’</span></span></p>

                      teaching of all religions is that we must all learn to love others as 
                      ourselves. When you hurt someone else you hurt yourself. When you succour 
                      someone else you help yourself. This is because every person, animal, 
                      vegetable and mineral is part and parcel of an integral whole. Nobody or 
                      nothing is separate. You kill an insect in one part of the world, the entire 
                      world is affected by that killing. If you become enlightened, the whole 
                      world is affected. So you are not and never separate.</span></span></p>

                      suffering. Craving for sense-pleasures, craving for further existence and 
                      craving for dis-becoming are the main components. Dis-becoming is craving to 
                      opt out of living, e.g. suicide.</span></span></p>

                      for all human beings, no matter rich or poor. Besides the physical, we also 
                      desire intellectual stimulation and satisfaction. So all in all, most of our 
                      cravings are mental.</span></span></p>

                      poverty, do not want to die. So we crave for existence. Even those who are 
                      in the throes of death do not want to die. We want to live forever.</span></span></p>

                      afflicted with a terminal illness may want to die because the suffering is 
                      too intolerable. Similarly the mentally depressed due to a variety of causes 
                      would also desire to opt out of life. Of course these instances are rare but 
                      nevertheless relevant.</span></span></p>

                      cover all the causes of dukkha. That is why our daily pre-occupations center 
                      on acquisitions of money, assets, fame and status. This pursuit itself 
                      causes pain and suffering. When we are thwarted in acquiring these objects 
                      we suffer more dukkha. After these objects are in our possession, we do not 
                      want to lose them. In fact, we want more. Or our cars and houses begin to 
                      age. Both situations are undesirable and therefore dukkha again.</span></span></p>

                      and good periods. When the going is good, we boast that we are clever and 
                      astute. When the time is bad, we suffer dukkha and blame everything and 
                      every body. There is no controlling of our G-plans. What one has to do is to 
                      see that there is a roller coaster of events in our lives (G-plan). One 
                      cannot control or influence our G-plans. If one can attune to this, where we 
                      are totally helpless, then we are beginning to ‘see’ the totality of the 
                      situation. Once we see it dukkha is partially eradicated. Lastly, we suffer 
                      when one has to choose. Choices always lead to suffering. We don’t suffer if 
                      there is no choice. An awakened one lives choicelessly. And of course, when 
                      one has an intention that is choice to begin with.</span></span></p>

                      also cease. Cessation of dukkha means Nibbana, which is a state of the 
                      unborn, uncreated and the unconditioned. So Buddha was offering an escape 
                      route. This 3<sup>rd</sup> Noble Truth is freedom form suffering. It is 
                      emancipation, liberation from continuous dukkha. Nibbana is a supramundane 
                      state in which the yogin has achieved through his arduous practice of the 
                      Four Noble Truths. Being in non-duality this extinction of thirst is quite 
                      ineffable: words are inadequate to express this state of Absolute Reality. 
                      It is the result of the extinction of desire, the extinction of hatred and 
                      extinction of illusion. The greatest of all illusions is the existence of a 
                      self. In his Anatta doctrine he denies the existence of self. Buddha had 
                      heard the signs and symptoms and diagnosed the disease. He is now 
                      pronouncing the extinction of the disease with the prescription to follow in 
                      the 4<sup>th</sup> Noble Truth. The Anatta doctrine is used by opponents to 
                      blame Buddha for preaching nihilism. Being in non-duality, there is no way 
                      to describe Absolute Reality, which is inexpressible in words.. Some hint of 
                      this Reality can be gotten from deep meditation. The deep meditation brings 
                      out the wisdom with its realisation that every single thing in this world is 
                      relative, conditioned and impermanent. Therefore it is not worth while to 
                      cling to anything in this world. Without clinging, there is no anxiety. 
                      Without anxiety, calm and tranquillity are the mainstay of the person’s 
                      character. He is already on the way towards Nibbana. At this stage when he 
                      experienced a sensation, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, he is 
                      unattached to that sensation. He knows that the sensation will pass, so why 
                      cling? He now sees the Absolute Truth due to the extinction of dukkha----Nibbana. 
                      This truth also tells us that there is no unchanging, everlasting, absolute 
                      substance like Self, Soul or Atman within us.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB">Nibbana is not the result of 
                      the extinction of desires. It is not the result of a cause or effect. <strong> Nibbana just is</strong>. It is beyond cause and effect. The 4<sup>th</sup> Noble 
                      truth can lead to realisation of Nibbana, but it is not the result of the 
                      path. Nibbana is simply there for you to realise. Seeing that Nibbana is the 
                      ultimate truth, there is nothing beyond Nibbana. There is also no question 
                      of ‘entering into Nibbana’. When a person realises Nibbana while alive, when 
                      he dies, he ‘fully passes away’, or is ‘fully blown out’ or ‘fully extinct’, 
                      as he will not be reborn after death. There is no answer to the question, ‘ 
                      what happens to an arahant after his death?’ The five aggregates (body, 
                      sensation, perception, mental activities and consciousness) of an arahant 
                      are totally destroyed, never to rise again. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB">The famous saying of Buddha: 
                      “Within this fathom-long sentient body itself, I postulate the world, the 
                      arising of the world, the cessation of the world, and the path leading to 
                      the cessation of the world.” This sentence explains a great deal. It means 
                      that there is no Self or Atman who realises Nibbana. Everything devolves 
                      down to the five aggregates. There is no thinker: it is the thought that 
                      thinks. Similarly, it is wisdom that becomes enlightened: there is no one 
                      that became enlightened. Put it in another way, dukkha arises because of 
                      craving and it ceases because of wisdom. Craving and wisdom are within the 
                      five aggregates. And after the death of an arahant, the five aggregates 
                      become extinct: there is also no more self to be reborn! Unlike other 
                      religions, in Buddhism one can be in Nibbana while still alive. In other 
                      religions, one has to die before entering heaven.</span></span></p>

                      is in a wonderful state of happiness, full of joy and peace. He has no more 
                      worries or anxiety, but is filled with compassion, love, kindness, 
                      equanimity and sympathetic joy for others. He is in a non-dual state all the 
                      time, and whatever he does is for others, as he is purely selfless. We will 
                      now embark on the path of the Fourth Noble Truth.</span></span></p>

                      see the Wholeness of the situation, which is always in a state of flux. One

              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB">This is the most unique feature 
                      of Buddhism. It is not found in any other religion in the world. Buddha 
                      formulated this doctrine and gave ample reasons to support it. In all the 
                      other religions there exists a Soul or a Self or Atman in humans. This is a 
                      permanent, unchanging, everlasting essence or entity in man. In some 
                      religions, this soul will end up in heaven or hell eternally after death. In 
                      Hinduism the Atman after many life times of purification will finally unite 
                      with God or Brahman. This Self or soul is the thinker of thoughts, feeler of 
                      sensations and receiver of rewards and punishments. Buddhism reckons that 
                      this soul is the cause of all evils and misdeeds because of the selfishness 
                      of ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Selfishness leads to all other defilements like hatred, 
                      ill will, conceit and pride.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Buddha explained that each individual is 
                      composed of five constituents: body, feeling, perception, mental factors 
                      (habitual tendencies) and consciousness. At birth these five constituents 
                      propel the karmic forces to form an individual in this life. At death, the 
                      five constituents break up to leave the forces in the spirit world during 
                      which no individual is in existence. In a subsequent birth these five 
                      separate constituents will reform another individual according to the karma 
                      accrued by that individual in his past life. So the theory goes: in life 
                      these five constituents are inconstant, forever changing and are 
                      impermanent. When impermanent the individual composing of the five 
                      constituents is consistently suffering. These five constituents being ever 
                      changing have no organizing principle or soul or permanent essence apart 
                      from the constituents. This is the rationale of the anatta doctrine.</span></span></p>

                      invented the idea of God and Soul for self-protection and self-preservation. 
                      God is supposed to protect man for safety and security. For 
                      self-preservation, man conceives of a Soul or Atman, which will live 
                      eternally. All other religions cling on to these entities of God and Soul 
                      due to selfish motives.  Buddha argued that these ideas are false and 
                      deep-rooted conjured in the minds of the Brahmins. After his enlightenment 
                      he postulated two theories to counter the concept of God and Atman. These 
                      are the <strong>Five Aggregates</strong> and the <strong>Conditioned Genesis</strong>.</span></span></p>

                      which are 1) the body, 2) feelings, 3) perception 4) mental tendencies and 
                      5) consciousness. Try as hard as one may, one can find no essence or a Self 
                      or an Atman in any of these constituents. He also emphasized that there is 
                      no other essence or substance outside these five constituents. These 
                      conditioned and ever changing constituents are subjected to suffering---dukkha.</span></span></p>

                      point is to stop at the point where contact gives rise to sensation or 
                      feeling. Even if sensation or feelings have arisen, one should prevent the 
                      feelings from concocting craving and clinging. It is at this point of 
                      craving that kamma is generated. So without craving, clinging and being, no 
                      dukkha is generated as no kamma has been earned.</span></span></p>

                      circle of links of the Conditioned Genesis (Dependent Origination) are 
                      conditioned and conditioning. They are relative, interdependent and 
                      interconnected. Nothing is independent and absolute and there is no first 
                      cause. If the five aggregates and all the other things are conditioned and 
                      interdependent, there should also be no free will. With this Conditioned 
                      Genesis together with the analysis of the Five Aggregates, one finds that 
                      there is also no immortal abiding essence in man. Whether this essence is 
                      called Atman or soul it does not matter. This is the Buddhist doctrine of 
                      Anatta, No-Soul or No-Self. In conventional truth or daily conversation we 
                      use the word “I” merely to signify an individual separate from other 
                      individuals. However in ultimate truth there is no essence or abiding 
                      substance behind this individual. ‘A person should be mentioned as existing

                      things are impermanent and therefore involved in dukkha, sorrow and 
                      suffering. But verse 279 emphasized that <strong>‘All states’</strong> are <strong>without 
                      self</strong> (anatta). The word used to denote ‘all states’ is dhamma. The word 
                      dhamma includes both conditioned and unconditioned things and states, the 
                      Absolute and Nibbana. That means there is no Self or Atman in the Five 
                      Aggregates or outside the Five Aggregates. Furthermore, there is also no 
                      Self or Atman in the unconditioned --- the Absolute and Nibbana.</span></span></p>

                      consciousness, Buddha replied that it is better to take the body as self, 
                      because the body is more solid. Also the mind or consciousness changes much 
                      faster than the body. The vague feeling of ‘I Am’ gives the false impression 
                      that there is a self in us. To cure this spiritual disease is to see 
                      objectively that <strong><em>the Five Aggregates work interdependently in a 
                      constant flux within the law of cause and effect, and that there is no 
                      eternal, unchanging, and permanent essence in all conditioned and

                      The Theravadin emphasizes on anatta, whilst the Mahayanist accentuates on 
                      sunnata. Both are the same. According to Huang Po <em>Sunnata is the Dhamma, 
                      Sunnata is the Buddha, and Sunnata is the One Mind. </em>Inner Sunnata is the 
                      natural and normal state of mind that is not scattered and confused. When 
                      the mind is not grasping or clinging and not attached to anything it is 
                      Sunnata (voidness). When voidness is practiced to the utmost it becomes 
                      Nibbana. We must empty the mind of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ until it is absolutely 
                      void. Then Nibbana is there. Dukkha arises because we cling to ‘I’ and 
                      ‘mine’. If we comprehend this, then we can empty the mind of dukkha. If this 
                      happens, we will see dhamma, which becomes Sunnata. <strong>Sunnata is Nibbana</strong>. 
                      To remedy mental dukkha, we should continuously see our thoughts: they are 
                      either painful or pleasurable. Whether painful or pleasurable as long as we 
                      do not cling on to them, there will not be any dukkha. This is the process 
                      of cure by the method of sunnata. Anatta is the voidness of self. When there 
                      is no self, there is no egoism; there is no selfishness and there is no 
                      clinging to objects and concepts. If this is the case the doctrine of anatta 
                      contributes to Nibbana, which is also Sunnata. Sunnata is eternal and 
                      immutable. It is forever, unlike other dhammas. Sunnata is neither born nor 
                      dies. Once absolutely seen in its purest state it will remain forever. There 
                      is no more rebirth. Buddha said that ‘You should look on the world as being 
                      void. When you are always mindful of the Sunnata of the world as being void, 
                      death will not find you.’ The point emphasized here is that the fundamental 
                      nature of all things and all mental states is void, Sunnata. The spiritual 
                      realms are also Sunnata. It also means that if you take yourself as anatta 
                      and the world as sunnata, you will be free of dukkha (suffering). As Buddha 
                      said: </span></span></p>

              <p>Brieftly divided into Theravada &amp; Mahayana. Most of the teachings of Theravada like four noble truths are actually recognized by Mahayana (inclusive). And then within Mahayana you have Pureland, Tendai (å¤©å�°ï¼‰, Zen, Tantric (Tibetan), Sanlun ï¼ˆä¸‰è®ºï¼‰, Prajna paramita (ä¸­è§‚ï¼‰, WeiShi (Consciousness Only) &amp; Humanistic (like Tzu Chi).</p>
              <p>Basically different human beings have different capacities &amp; likings. Some prefer to emphasize faith (e.g. like Pureland), some prefer to emphasize wisdom (e.g. prajna paramita), some prefer to emphasize compassion (e.g. Humanistic), some prefer a quick enlightenment (e.g. Theravada / Zen).  </p>

              <p>Although there are so many different sects. They share common teachings like 4 noble truths &amp; dependent origination. First of all, you must believe in 4 noble truths (which is  logical) and practise the eight fold paths. Briefly, suffering is due to delusion (e.g. false perception of self &amp; concept of ownership). End of suffering means you must follow the right path i.e. the eight fold path which can be categorized as <a title="Sila" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sila">sila</a> (conduct), samadhi (<a title="Attention" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">concentration</a>)&amp; <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pañña" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%C3%B1%C3%B1a">pañña</a> (wisdom)in that order. First of all you must have sila (i.e. Buddha says don't do pls don't do). The right sila will facilitate the right concentration and ultimately lead the right wisdom which destroys delusion and lead to liberation.</p>
              <p>For example in pureland, with the right sila &amp; devoted chanting of Amitabha after a long time can achieve different levels of right concentrations and eventually lead to right understanding of the nature of universe.</p>

              <p>Yes...</p>
              <p>All traditions of Buddhism, eventually only point to our true nature or fundamental awareness as the basis and goal of our journey.</p>
              <p>Without discovering our true nature and uprooting ignorance, no matter what we do we will never overcome suffering.</p>
              <p>Instead of living in a state of distraction, lost in past, present and future, we should live in continuous recognition of our innate nature, to maintain the presence of this recognition regardless of whatever we experience and the circumstances.</p>
              <p>What is Buddha? It means Awareness. Our Buddha-Nature which is intrinsically complete in all beings is of the nature of Pure Awareness.</p>
              <p>When we recognize that the nature of mind is a bright awareness like a mirror that reflects everything (all thoughts, feelings, sensations) without exception as a whole... regardless pleasant/unpleasant... and theres no distance between the mind and its appearance, between you and the scenery, everything just appears where it is as a reflection of mind/awareness... the sense of a 'me' is also just an object in the field of awareness and isn't truly substantial.</p>
              <p>Can't find a centerpoint or observer but awareness is like an open field naturally reflecting everything. When we experience this theres also a sense that awareness is more effortless than we usually think and isnt obstructed by apparent thoughts or anything at all since everything is just a reflection of awareness. It is our true nature.</p>
              <p>In such recognition the seeing, hearing itself, every movement of awareness becomes blissful, it is pure energy, pure love. This is what I meant by the bliss that is not of feeling but of Awareness... the bliss that is unconditioned.</p>
