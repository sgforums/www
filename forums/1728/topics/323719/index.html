              <p>Thank you Isis. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm hoping to find some courses that are not too intensive and introduced in a way that suits the needs of modern execs, mainly for the purpose of relaxation and developing concentration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would anybody who has attended any particular meditation course kindly share your view/experiences?</p>

              <p><br>My old friend,</p>
              <p>I would agree if you had said something like this, "Some people find chanting easier/more effective for them."</p>
              <p>Due to our different inclinations and capacities, each of us responds to various methods differently. For some people, chanting may be faster; but others may feel more drawn to the practice of meditation. So it would not be very appropriate to generalize that a particular method works better for everyone. My friends, in particular, have expressed their wish to learn meditation, so it would be helpful if you could give some suggestions on places that provide good meditation courses.</p>
              <p>I have never read/heard that chanting leads to Samadhi faster than meditation. Please let me know where you learnt this from, as I am interested to know more. On the other hand, more than once have I heard great Dharma teachers underscore the importance of meditation. Perhaps to leave a deep impression on students about how important and meritorious meditation really is, one of the teachers even exclaimed that even one minute of meditation is much better than lots of prostrations, lots of mantra recitations.</p>
              <p>In all schools of Buddhism, meditation is taught as one of the most essential practices. Meditation is the key to gaining insight into the nature of one's own mind. All the Buddhas of past, present and future gain enlightenment through the practice of meditation. As such, I feel encouraged that at this degenerate times, there are people (and even non-Buddhists) who are interested to learn meditation. I believe it's helpful for us to maintain an attitude of rejoicing when we hear that people are keen to learn the Dharma (even if it's just a little bit of interest, and even if the person's choice of practice method/path differs from our own preferences). </p>
              <p>May all beings be liberated from suffering whose source is the "ego".</p>

              <p>for me no prejudice, as chanting <em>is</em> a form of meditation, perhaps an <em>active</em> meditation. true that it depends on inclinations and capacities, also depends on what one chant.</p>
              <p>i mean the definition of meditation is :-</p>

              <p><em>Meditation means the gradual process of training the mind to focus on a single object and to remain fixed upon the object without wavering. The constant practice of meditation helps one to develop a calm and concentrated mind and help to prepare one for the attainment of Wisdom and Enlightenment ultimately.</em></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">like for example, <span style="color: #000000;">Meditate reciting Buddho</span>:-</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Meditate reciting Buddho, Buddho 2 until it penetrates deep into the heart of your consciousness (citta). The word ''Buddho'' represents the awareness and wisdom of the Buddha. In practice, you must depend on this word more than anything else. The awareness it brings will lead you to understand the truth about your own mind. It's a true refuge, which means that there is both mindfulness and insight present.</p>

              <p>I really cannot understand what you're trying to express; and it does appear to me that you are not getting what I'm trying to convey either. Well, what I can say is that as a fellow Dharma friend, I spent some time generating thoughts of kind intention before writing my reply above. However, due to my own ignorance - thus lack of skilful means and perfect speech - I may not have been able to convey those intentions clearly to you.</p>

              <p>==============================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something not exactly related here; I attended meditation teaching by Garchen Rinpoche few days ago. He emphasized a lot of times that we should try to merge meditation and post-meditation, by trying to bring mindfulness and awareness into our lives at every moment, whatever we're doing. If we're able to generate loving-kindness and compassion, and maintain mindfulness and awareness in all our actions, then all our activities will become the practice of 6 Paramitas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some nice excerpts from his talk:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When discursive thoughts or afflictive emotions arise, if we have mindfulness/awareness, the discursive thoughts and afflictive emotions will not drag us to create karma. They will just arise and dissolve."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If afflictive emotion, e.g. anger arises, stop following the thought. Make sure that mindfulness/awareness is firm in its own place. Do not be shaken by the arising anger. If you're familiar with the practice, anger disappears instantly. If you are not familiar but continue practising, it will go away gradually."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Without mindfulness/awareness, we become victims to discursive thoughts. These thoughts bind us to Samsara. Therefore, being free from discursive thoughts is to be free from Samsara."</p>

              <p>Depends on how one practice. Usually chanting practiced by the majority is only a form of concentration exercise or samatha practice. Chanting is a practice found in all religious traditions, not only Buddhism, which shows that it is effective otherwise why so many people practice it, even outside Buddhism? But still this kind of practice can at most lead to samadhi/absorption but not enlightenment. In Buddhism, we say that samatha/concentration practices alone do not lead to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>There are many levels of å¿µä½›. If people recite by lips but not by heart, and one's mind wander everywhere while chanting, then is also pretty useless, å¿µç ´å˜´çš®ä¸�è§�å¼¥é™€. Even if one recites single mindedly, there are also many levels. The highest level of å¿µä½› is described as itself the contemplation on the nature of reality: ã€Šä½›è—�ç»�ã€‹ï¼š“èˆ�åˆ©å¼—ã€‚äº‘ä½•å��ä¸ºå¿µä½›ã€‚è§�æ— æ‰€æœ‰å��ä¸ºå¿µä½›èˆ�åˆ©å¼—ã€‚è¯¸ä½›æ— é‡�ä¸�å�¯æ€�è®®ä¸�å�¯ç§°é‡�ã€‚ä»¥æ˜¯ä¹‰æ•…ã€‚è§�æ— æ‰€æœ‰å��ä¸ºå¿µä½›ã€‚å®žå��æ— åˆ†åˆ«ã€‚è¯¸

              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br> Within the Judeo-Christian tradition we find two overlapping 
                                            practices called prayer and contemplation. Prayer is a direct 
                                            address to some spiritual entity. Contemplation in a prolonged 
                                            period of conscious thought about some specific topic, usually 
                                            a religious ideal or scriptural passage. From the standpoint 
                                            of mental culture, both of these activities are exercises in 
                                            concentration. The normal deluge of conscious thought is restricted, 
                                            and the mind is brought to one conscious area of operation. 
                                            The results are those you find in any concentrative practice: 
                                            deep calm, a physiological slowing of the metabolism and a sense 
                                            of peace and well-being.<br> <br> Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation, which is 
                                            also purely concentrative. The traditional basic exercises consist 
                                            of focusing the mind on a single object a stone, a candle flame, 
                                            a syllable or whatever, and not allowing it to wander. Having 
                                            acquired the basic skill, the Yogi proceeds to expand his practice 
                                            by taking on more complex objects of meditation chants, colorful 
                                            religious images, energy channels in the body and so forth. 
                                            Still, no matter how complex the object of meditation, the meditation 
                                            itself remains purely an exercise in concentration.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Within the Buddhist tradition, concentration is also highly 
                                            valued. But a new element is added and more highly stressed. 
                                            That element is awareness. All Buddhist meditation aims at the 
                                            development of awareness, using concentration as a tool. </strong></span>The 
                                            Buddhist tradition is very wide, however, and there are several 
                                            diverse routes to this goal. Zen meditation uses two separate 
                                            tacks. The first is the direct plunge into awareness by sheer 
                                            force of will. You sit down and you just sit, meaning that you 
                                            toss out of your mind everything except pure awareness of sitting. 
                                            This sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial will demonstrate 
                                            just how difficult it really is. The second Zen approach used 
                                            in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious 
                                            thought and into pure awareness. This is done by giving the 
                                            student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway, and 
                                            by placing him in a horrendous training situation. Since he 
                                            cannot flee from the pain of the situation, he must flee into 
                                            a pure experience of the moment. There is nowhere else to go. 
                                            Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but it is really 
                                            tough.<br> <br> Another stratagem, Tantric Buddhism, is nearly the reverse. 
                                            Conscious thought, at least the way we usually do it, is the 
                                            manifestation of ego, the you that you usually think that you 
                                            are. Conscious thought is tightly connected with self-concept. 
                                            The self-concept or ego is nothing more than a set of reactions 
                                            and mental images which are artificially pasted to the flowing 
                                            process of pure awareness. Tantra seeks to obtain pure awareness 
                                            by destroying this ego image. This is accomplished by a process 
                                            of visualization. The student is given a particular religious 
                                            image to meditate upon, for example, one of the deities from 
                                            the Tantric pantheon. He does this in so thorough a fashion 
                                            that he becomes that entity. He takes off his own identity and 
                                            puts on another. This takes a while, as you might imagine, but 
                                            it works. During the process, he is able to watch the way that 
                                            the ego is constructed and put in place. He comes to recognize 
                                            the arbitrary nature of all egos, including his own, and he 
                                            escapes from bondage to the ego. He is left in a state where 
                                            he may have an ego if he so chooses, either his own or whichever 
                                            other he might wish, or he can do without one. Result: pure 
                                            awareness. Tantra is not exactly a game of patty cake either.<br> <br> Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The 
                                            method comes directly from the Sitipatthana Sutta, a discourse 
                                            attributed to Buddha himself. Vipassana is a direct and gradual 
                                            cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by 
                                            piece over a period of years. The student's attention is carefully 
                                            directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his 
                                            own existence. The meditator is trained to notice more and more 
                                            of his own flowing life experience. Vipassana is a gentle technique. 
                                            But it also is very , very thorough. It is an ancient and codified 
                                            system of sensitivity training, a set of exercises dedicated 
                                            to becoming more and more receptive to your own life experience. 
                                            It is attentive listening, total seeing and careful testing. 
                                            We learn to smell acutely, to touch fully and really pay attention 
                                            to what we feel. We learn to listen to our own thoughts without 
                                            being caught up in them.<br> <br> The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay attention. 
                                            We think we are doing this already, but that is an illusion. 
                                            It comes from the fact that we are paying so little attention 
                                            to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might 
                                            just as well be asleep. We are simply not paying enough attention 
                                            to notice that we are not paying attention. It is another Catch-22. </span></p>

              <p><br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Ok. I think when we
                                              view consciousness, we have to understand that there are a few
                                              things. We cannot keep on thinking about the objective world first.
                                              We must see how consciousness reacts. That is if we react very
                                              intensely, strongly towards symbols, then whatever reactions will
                                              go back deep into your consciousness. This is one thing. My
                                              perspective is that when you chant, you are not dealing with our
                                              luminous clarity. We're dealing with propensities deep in your
                                              consciousness. Insight meditation itself deals directly with this
                                              clarity. That is the luminous clarity. But if we were to continue
                                              to chant, you are actually focusing more on the deeper layers of
                                              consciousness that deals with propensities and the power of
                                              concentration. Do you see what I mean? It's not so much of the
                                              luminosity. However, the chanting itself, when it takes strength,
                                              it creates a kind of momentum. A momentum that synchronises not
                                              only with your sub-conscious or the deeper layers of your
                                              consciousness, but also your conscious level. This means it can
                                              sync the two layers into one. This syncing the two into one clears
                                              your mind, clears your thoughts. And then at this time, you ask who
                                              you are, that is, not letting the momentum take place, but just
                                              feel and sense... then you ask what is it. At that moment, you
                                              might see your reality. But your mind must be able to settle down
                                              first. But you must know there is a difference between working at
                                              the concentration level, dealing with the karmic propensities and
                                              creating new momentums, and practicing insight meditation that
                                              touch directly the clarity and the luminous nature, are two
                                              different things. You see what I mean or not?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: Yeah I think so.
                                              This means that I still need to do insight meditation?<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes you have to do
                                              insight meditation. Even if you attain calmness you still have to
                                              do insight meditation. You must feel the awareness... You must
                                              sense it everywhere... That is very important for liberation.</strong></span> Now
                                              when we talk about awareness, we don't call it Self or we don't
                                              call it Mind. Why people call it Awareness is because they do not
                                              want to call it Self, because there is no Self. The reason they
                                              said Awareness, is because Awareness is not an entity. It is not a
                                              thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. It is just clarity.
                                              But because we are so accustomed to thinking things in terms of
                                              object and subject, we always take Awareness as something. It must
                                              be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if it is not residing
                                              inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace. This is the
                                              problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be aware. We always
                                              think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                              they always look for a place, they always look for a something.
                                              This is how the mind react, this is what I call a momentum. They
                                              always behave this way. They do not know how to say Â“Just do
                                              nothing. Everything is expressing itself by clarity.Â” They always
                                              want to react, you see what I mean?</p>

              <p><em>My reply to someone asking about the external signs related to
                                      the fruition of chanting:</em></p>
              <p><em>------------</em></p>
              <p><em>Icic... maybe you can search the internet for some of the
                                      benefits of mantras. It is a good practice so keep it up.</em></p>
              <p><em>But the most important benefit is that it can calm your mind...
                                      when you are chanting, you must be aware of the chanting. If your
                                      mind wanders on what you are going to do next, or what someone has
                                      done to you, what happened to you, i.e. past and future, then the
                                      chanting will not be of much effect.</em></p>
              <p><em>My local dharma teacher tells of 3 stages of chanting... I can
                                      only type from what I remember, briefly:</em></p>
              <p><em>1) Chanting as a means to control our mind. Our mind is lost in
                                      discursive thinking, and lost its calmness. So by focusing our
                                      attention on chanting, we can prevent the discursive mind from
                                      wandering again. Unfortunately, many people at this stage simply
                                      'chants with his mouth'. That is useless. His mind wanders on other
                                      things, and is not even aware that is chanting. It is only his
                                      mouth that 'chants'. The mind is not chanting. We must avoid this
                                      by all means, and chant with sincerity and one pointedness.</em></p>
              <p><em>2) When we chant for a long period of time, the chanting itself
                                      becomes a momentum that gathers strength and helps us in daily
                                      life, constantly 24/7. Even in sleep. That means lets say you chant
                                      Amitabha (or any other chant), you will reach a stage where you
                                      automatically chant the mantra... its like motor going by itself in
                                      your head... you just keep chanting, the chanting takes place
                                      'automatically' even without your intention to start chanting. This
                                      is important so that whenever you face any situations, you will not
                                      lose your calm and samadhi (one pointedness). Even in sleep, even
                                      in dreams, if you have a nightmare or you dream of ghosts chasing
                                      you, you will automatically start chanting... and free yourself
                                      from such situations. If something bad happens to you, even if your
                                      past life debtors or spirits want to take away your life, you will
                                      automatically chant and even if you die you will be able to be born
                                      in higher realms or in the pure lands.</em></p>
              <p><em>3) Be-with-buddha chanting. You maintain ever present awareness
                                      that knows your chanting. That means, you are aware of chanting
                                      Om-ma-ni-pad-me-hum... totally present, aware, as you chant. This
                                      awareness is also aware of every arising thought, or even when
                                      there is no thoughts, it is present. With this awareness you will
                                      not be tricked by ignorant thoughts, whether the thought is good or
                                      bad, awareness is present and knows. When you reach this level, it
                                      is 'nian zhong you fo'. Every 'nian' got 'Buddha'. What is Buddha?
                                      Buddha is our Awareness. It is our true nature that is ever present
                                      and inherent in every being. If you reach this level, you are being
                                      with buddha'.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>So if you see yourself progressing along these lines, then you
                                      do not need to rely on external signs to increase your faith in the
                                      mantra or chanting. The clarity/awareness, calmness, bliss is
                                      itself assuring. You will want to keep practicing to experience
                                      these qualities and you will see it help you even in daily lives.
                                      What is important is also to practice in daily lives, to 'extend'
                                      these qualities to meet daily lives situation.</em></p>
              <p><em>You do not need to see or hear the Buddha, if you Be With
                                      Buddha, you will "be with" Buddha (Awareness) right in this moment,
                                      you will be one with all Buddhas in the 10 directions. It is not
                                      through seeking him in forms and sound, as the Buddha taught:</em></p>

              <p><br> Thank you for posting on this. Very true indeed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>==============================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something not exactly related here; I attended meditation
              teaching by Garchen Rinpoche few days ago. He emphasized a lot of
              times that we should try to merge meditation and post-meditation,
              by trying to bring mindfulness and awareness into our lives at
              every moment, whatever we're doing. If we're able to generate
              loving-kindness and compassion, and maintain mindfulness and
              awareness in all our actions, then all our activities will become
              the practice of 6 Paramitas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some nice excerpts from his talk:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When discursive thoughts or afflictive emotions arise, if we
              have mindfulness/awareness, the discursive thoughts and afflictive
              emotions will not drag us to create karma. They will just arise and
              dissolve."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If afflictive emotion, e.g. anger arises, stop following the
              thought. Make sure that mindfulness/awareness is firm in its own
              place. Do not be shaken by the arising anger. If you're familiar
              with the practice, anger disappears instantly. If you are not

              thoughts. These thoughts bind us to Samsara. Therefore, being free
              from discursive thoughts is to be free from Samsara."</p>
