                  Washington. After zazen and morning ceremony, we eat a modest breakfast of
                  oatmeal and tea and still feel hungry. This is good, as one should not go
                  begging on a full stomach. The rain has held off, but it is misty, windless,
                  and raw. Streets and alleys are full of puddles. Only students who have
                  requested this opportunity are participating, and two are doing takuhatsu for
                  the first time. There will just be four of us. We are not trying to create a
                  spectacle; we are practicing a tradition of Zen that dates to the time of
                  Shakyamuni Buddha and has been passed down with the begging bowl to the
                  lineages of the present day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>I am a priest and trained at Entsuji temple in
                  Japan, where Ryokan (l758-1831), the poet, priest, and hermit, trained before
                  embarking upon a life outside the monastery, totally dependent on takuhatsu.
                  Takuhatsu brings the monastery directly into the marketplace. On the
                  alms-round, I wear the traditional takuhatsu clothing of the monk: kimono and horomo
                  hiked up and tied at the waist so that the white cloth leggings show below the
                  knee; half-gloves covering the visible portion of the forearm; towel around the
                  head to keep the wide straw woven hat from slipping; grass sandals over tabi,
                  the Japanese socks with the big toe separated from the other toes, like
                  mittens. Students wear their street shoes and standard Japanese temple work
                  clothing to clearly identify them with our temple. They will also wear arahusu,
                  the "little robe," and a takuhatsu bag to collect offerings and
                  display our affiliation, Olympia Zen Center. We all carry begging bowls. I also
                  carry a tall stick with three rings on top that will make a clear ching-ching
                  as it taps along the pathway, leading the procession.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Takuhatsu is one of the deepest traditions of my
                  Soto Zen lineage. We recognize the influence of Ryokan, who spent his life in
                  solitude and utmost simplicity, writing poems and painting, teaching through
                  the example of kindness and goodwill, relying only on the fruits of takuhatsu
                  for his food and sustenance. It was along the narrow streets near Entsuji that
                  the sound of Ryokan-san's begging stick first rang out against the mud walls of
                  the old farm buildings. Later he returned to his hometown and wandered from
                  there throughout the Bunsui plain, living as a mendicant. The tradition of
                  takuhatsu remains unbroken in Japanese Zen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Begging is legal in Olympia as long as one does not
                  engage in aggressive panhandling. "Panhandling," an American
                  colloquialism borrowed from the homeless, literally refers to the use of a pan
                  with a handle for begging. In the United States, religious begging has all but
                  disappeared. Years ago, members of the Salvation Army, the last of the street
                  religious beggars, would come out at Christmas with their unmistakable Army
                  bells as shoppers entered the supermarket. As late as the 1950s, religious
                  organizations practiced begging on city streets in the State of New York. They
                  went from door to door, or stood at train stations or outside factories,
                  accepting donations. This was acceptable and recognized as virtuous practice.
                  As begging became popular—though not completely acceptable—during the hippie
                  movement of the late 1960s, young people took to America's streets,
                  demonstrating the need for changing values in society. They did not hesitate to
                  ask for money, and people were curious and generally responsive. That era ended
                  with an increase in homelessness, and as the homeless population grew, the
                  practice of begging persisted and the public became impatient with the
                  continuing visibility of the poor. Other areas were beset by members of the
                  Hare Krishna movement, who had aggressive and confrontational methods. Some
                  cities passed ordinances to prevent beggars from annoying people. Begging is
                  now illegal in some parts of the United States and restricted elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Few
                  religious groups practice poverty today in the manner of Ryokan, or even in
                  that of St. Francis of Assisi, who taught his monks to store no more food than
                  they could use for one day. At the same time, begging has been
                  institutionalized in the form of fund-raising, conducted by every church and
                  nonprofit corporation in America. Giving is no longer a direct transaction from
                  the donor to the begging bowl. Americans make appeals through the mail
                  requesting donations for every imaginable cause. If donors are moved, they send
                  a check. There is no contact, no communal prayer, no immediate direct
                  eye-to-eye gesture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>I was raised in a begging tradition. During my
                  childhood in Brooklyn in the 1940s and' 50s, the Great Depression was still a
                  recent enough memory for most people to appreciate that begging had once been
                  commonplace. Catholic monastics practiced begging, and it was not unusual to
                  see clerics sitting outside shops holding coffee cups to collect coins. On Thanksgiving,
                  children would dress up in old, torn clothing and go from door to door to beg.
                  The practice reminded householders that kindness to beggars, especially on such
                  a holiday, was virtuous, and it taught children that all people were worthy of
                  notice and that sharing goods was the right thing to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Because I had come of age in that milieu, takuhatsu
                  seemed natural to me. I practiced Zen for many years in California with Kobun
                  Chino Otogawa Roshi before traveling to Japan to teach English. One day I wandered
                  into Entsuji temple. The abbot, Niho Roshi, saw me in the garden and invited me
                  in. At that moment, my practice of takuhatsu began.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>In Olympia, just as at Entsuji, before leaving the
                  zendo we face one another in a line and chant Hannya Shingyo, the Heart Sutra.
                  We open the door and emerge into the cold winter air, and feel a sudden
                  vulnerability. There is no hiding, no way to disguise what we are doing. We are
                  suddenly visible to everyone. Feelings of joy at the opportunity to carry on a
                  deep tradition, fear that we will be ridiculed and misunderstood, courage to go
                  out and practice, trepidation in the face of our physical vulnerability, all
                  mingle with the wisps of fog that catch around our ears as we walk in single
                  file. A little more chanting and then down the hill into town we intone a deep
                  "Hooooooooooooo," which means "the rain of dharma," and it
                  echoes from the belly in a long vibrating stream. Our breathing is staggered
                  and the echo is continuous. Cold hits the hand, and the fingers numb around the
                  bowl.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>As far as we know, no Zen communities in America
                  are practicing takuhatsu in this particular ancient form. Our sangha has had
                  long discussions about why, although it was practiced and taught by Shakyamuni
                  Buddha and all Zen monks since, takuhatsu has not been transmitted to America.
                  Why is it that Americans have embraced zazen meditation and yet do not
                  incorporate takuhatsu in their practice? Even many Japanese teachers say,
                  "Takuhatsu is impossible for Americans." They may have been reticent
                  to transmit the practice in America for several reasons. We are a violent
                  nation; Americans are outspoken and don't hesitate to belittle or ridicule what
                  we don't understand. In takuhatsu, there is no cover from the dangerous, the
                  rude or obscene. Japanese teachers may have seen the practice as too
                  controversial, too problematic outside their own culture, and felt that to
                  establish it at all, takuhatsu had to be acceptable to society. It had to find
                  its way into the mainstream of daily life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Although we hold the bowl open for an offering, the
                  practice of takuhatsu does not teach us to be dependent upon society, asking
                  for something that is not earned, or pressuring a community for an entitlement
                  to food or goods. Rather, it teaches us the fundamental lessons of the Buddha:
                  to be dependent on everyone, to live our original homelessness, to include the
                  homeless in thought and deed, to share everything, to accept what comes to us,
                  to be generous, to be humble in society, to recognize the timid, to resist
                  fame, to be modest, to resist the acquisition of goods, to throw off ego, to
                  have the courage to be fully visible in practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>We reach the main road and its heavy traffic.
                  Pedestrians see us and stare. Our begging bowls are held out in one hand, the
                  other held under the arakusu, eyes cast down. We cross the streets with the
                  traffic lights and pass in front of motorists who now see us head-on. The
                  insistent ching-ching of the stick keeps us concentrated: we are a living
                  sangha, moving in a single body through the city.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Our first direct encounter is at Bread and Roses,
                  the Catholic Worker soup kitchen. About ten men are gathered on the sidewalk
                  talking as we turn the corner and walk toward them. We appear as a small attack
                  force arriving out of nowhere. There is no precedent for this, no picture that
                  they can turn to for reference. We are moving at a moderate pace, chanting <em>Enmei
                  Jihhu Kannon Gyo</em>, the <em>Kannon Sutra of Timeless Life</em>, a devotion to
                  Avalokiteshvara, the same prayer chanted at Entsuji temple and by Ryokan. The
                  men on the street are facing us and staring. This is their block, their
                  territory, and many who are standing here now will be begging later in front of
                  various shops or huddling in the doorways of businesses that have closed for
                  the weekend. Shopkeepers will ask them to move, saying they are bad for
                  business and that they keep shoppers away.<br> <br> <strong>I look out from under</strong> the hat, and my eyes meet one man's eyes. His are
                  deep, tired, and watery from the cold. His look is questioning, but in an
                  instant we both recognize something: the takuhatsu I am doing is engaged in
                  prayer; his begging is a raw kind of desperation that fights back incessant
                  hunger and cold. I can go home and shower; he cannot. I have a place to sleep;
                  he may not. We are exactly face to face. But though our material circumstances
                  are indeed different, we are on the same ground; there is no difference in the
                  essential truth of our humanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Our group is pulled along by the action of walking,
                  by the silence of going forward step by step in our meditation. We try to give
                  the man a paper that explains what we are doing, but he doesn't want to take
                  it. He shakes his hand and his head simultaneously. Finally, another man
                  accepts. We go on our way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Making
                  money or filling the bowl in takuhatsu is not the point. The point is the
                  practice of acceptance, humility, poverty. It addresses the arrogance of our
                  material times. When we see that we are all homeless, we can fully exchange the
                  meaning of this practice. Our giving away and our receiving are the same act.
                  The spiritual gesture of takuhatsu reminds us where our true treasures lie and
                  that the begging bowl and the hand filling it are always empty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>But coming to that realization on American ground
                  is a path rife with questions and doubts, even for sincere practitioners.
                  Because we live in an area populated by Christian fundamentalists, some
                  followers fear that through takuhatsu we will be misunderstood, and to be
                  misunderstood means to be discriminated against. Others speak of what it means
                  to face the homeless or feel that by begging we might take what would otherwise
                  be given to a homeless beggar. But perhaps the deepest, most debilitating
                  notion—and one that hits the entire nation, not just those contemplating
                  takuhatsu—is the terror of being perceived as, or associated with, the poor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Takuhatsu is not about experiencing oneself as
                  invisible to society in the sense of being unrecognized, overlooked, forgotten
                  like the homeless, the poor or the aged. It is about realizing the
                  "small" self as invisible. In the practice, we experience
                  invisibility because the person we know by name—the usual daily self—is
                  transformed; there is no one there to need to be noticed. It is the practice of
                  liberation. Of course, we may be tempted to use takuhatsu as a spiritual masquerade,
                  to enjoy accolades because of the exotic nature of the robes or the work. But
                  sincere Zen practice is a mirror where attempts to inflate the ego are leveled
                  again and again. We are brought to see the truth of ourselves—that ego itself
                  is delusion.</span></p>

                  visible monastic stream must flourish. While householder Zen takes hold, such
                  practice must rest on a foundation where training and a clear understanding of
                  dharma are solidly planted. In lay practice, we risk becoming a Sunday-only
                  congregation, using the cushions occasionally but not when it interferes with
                  the primary schedule of family life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">The
                  Buddha lived as a mendicant, knowing that poverty—that is, a life of
                  nonacquiring—is necessary to learn nonattachment and acceptance. The alms-round
                  permitted the monks to practice poverty and humility, to overcome vanity. They
                  also learned acceptance, since they were completely dependent upon what was
                  offered, eating only what was put in the bowl, and only once a day. The
                  disciple Makakasho is said to have eaten a leper's finger that had dropped into
                  his bowl, an extreme practice of indiscriminate acceptance. Ryokan ate food
                  that had been shared by insects and grubs, going beyond discrimination of the
                  condition of the food. The laity benefited through receiving the teachings the
                  monks transmitted and gained merit through acts of generosity.</span></p>

                  a tourist against the backdrop of the State Capitol Building, a dome that is
                  the copy of our capitol in Washington, D.C. We follow the boats to the farmers'
                  market, where we stand in one area for half an hour. One of us gives the
                  handout to the curious, who walk slowly away, reading. Some, when they understand,
                  return and make an offering. One man gives us a bagel that we later eat for
                  lunch. Back at the zendo, we chant, wash our feet, and place the offerings on
                  the altar. We drink tea, have lunch, feel the stiffness and soreness set into
                  the muscles and joints. We begin to appreciate the life of a mendicant, the
                  life of simplicity in poverty. Poverty: not an end in itself, but a means to a
                  life in Buddha, complete and free.</span></p>

              <p>I never hear anything great about priest. They are just proud to be prist. I saw priest in Thailand begging for food to feed his disciples. He was  thinking that he is doing a noble job. He even received some can of Coke. Just imagine if every body going to follow his foot step what is going to happen to the world. What will happen to economic. Who are going to hold the jobs. Buddha went alone to seek alightment. Since you already get Buddha elightment thru his book. What are you seeking now.</p>
              <p>Just remember a simple rule, a rule must me applied to every one without effecting his daily life. It should'nt effect their economic which effect the country.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">People in the Buddhist monastic order in Thailand are not called priest, they are called monks. They do not just go out begging for food to feed their disciples and feel noble about the ‘job’. How did you know that was what he is thinking? You got the power of telepathy? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddhist faith have being in existence for more than 2500years, it have not bankrupt any country because of the fact that everyone have decide to be a monk. Such a situation will never happen. That kind of life is not everyone ‘cup of tea’. Your ‘imagination’ of everybody taking up the life of a monk is just that, an imagination.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By the way reading Buddhist books alone will never make you into an enlightened person. You can go, read all the books in the world on how to get rich, do you think at the end of the day you are going to be rich? Don’t be so simplistic.</span></p>
