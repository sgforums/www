              <p>Well, it is really not too difficult to meditate till you can see past lives.. You just have to put in effort, I've heard stories of many people who can meditate till they can recall past lives, especially in the meditative traditions like the Pa Auk Tradition which has a system for meditation. In fact, in the Pa Auk system, recalling past lives is an integral part of the syllabus to understand karma and dependent origination. So basically, just follow the system and you should be able to do it sooner or later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may want to read the books Workings of Karma and Knowing and Seeing by Pa Auk Sayadaw.</p>

              <p>I personally don't think dreams are reliable for telling one's past lives. Usually past lives recalled through meditation and hypnosis is accurate and is recalled in such clarity that it leaves no trace of doubt in the meditator, he is as certain of his past lives as he is certain of drinking a cup of tea this evening. Sometimes he remembers the memory with such clarity that he is actually 're-living' the event with his whole body, even clearer than watching a movie.</p>

              <p>In Buddhism, meditation is the way. But I do not encourage too much interest in this, first not everyone is ready to experience it (it is likely that one will become confused or even upset by his memories), second it is more important to develope wisdom and awareness that leads to liberation.</p>

              <p><br>Icic. But is it possible that someone may create a false memory during past life regression?</p>
              <p>Nope, I am not able to control the dream content.</p>
              <p>By lucid dreaming, I mean that it was so real as if I was the one experiencing the whole events as the 1st party at that moment. I could feel so strongly about the emotions I had in there.</p>
              <p>However at the same time, I do realise that I was actually sleeping during the process and I had the same dream before, therefore I do know the outcome. Just as expected, in the end, the outcome turned up to be the same.</p>
              <p>To add on, as the events in my dream took place in another era, I was totally lost about my whereabout when I woke up. As what I had earlier was too real (just like reality), I couldnt differentiate between the 'real' reality and 'fake' reality.</p>
              <p>I'm someone who will dream almost every night and I will wake up knowing that that's just a normal dream. But that previous experience left me with doubts about what exactly was that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, another question which I had forgot to include previously was, will those grp of people who are related to you in your past lives, appear in another role in your present life? And also, (for eg.) those people whom you met on the bus, are the people who you actually met in your past lives too?</p>

              <p>By lucid dreaming, I mean that it was so real as if I
                      was the one experiencing the whole events as the 1st party at that
                      moment. I could feel so strongly about the emotions I had in
                      there.</p>
              <p>However at the same time, I do realise that I was
                      actually sleeping during the process and I had the same dream
                      before, therefore I do know the outcome. Just as expected, in the
                      end, the outcome turned up to be the same.</p>
              <p>To add on, as the events in my dream took place in another era,
                      I was totally lost about my whereabout when I woke up. As what
                      I had earlier was too real (just like reality), I couldnt
                      differentiate between the 'real' reality and 'fake' reality.</p>
              <p>I'm someone who will dream almost every night and I will wake up
                      knowing that that's just a normal dream. But that previous
                      experience left me with doubts about what exactly was
                      that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, another question which I had forgot to include previously
                      was, will those grp of people who are related to you in your past
                      lives, appear in another role in your present life? And
                      also, (for eg.) those people whom you met on the bus, are the
                      people who you actually met in your past lives too?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't know if your dream is related to your past life, but theres a possibility.</p>
              <p>Regarding your second question, most certainly. And my Master once said if someone meets someone and have a positive feeling on first sight, that means you must have at least a 6 month+ positive relation (friend, or anything else) with that person in a previous lifetime.</p>
              <p>Our moderator Longchen told me stories of how he remembered and realised who those people he met in this life, and not just his wife, were in his past lives.</p>

              <p>I also notice future events unfold according to what I've dreamt.</p>
              <p>From my Master's book...</p>
              <p><br> 10 kinds of dreams:<br> 1) se yin chan meng (form-based dreams) - what we see in color can
                                      become dream. Example you see a base-ball tournament, then when you
                                      come back you dream about it.<br> 2) shou yin chan meng (feeling-based dreams) - you go to a place
                                      and there's feelings, example when people insult you or praise you.
                                      They can cause one to dream about it.<br> 3) xiang yin chan meng (perception-based dreams) - think of it now
                                      and daily, like thinking of fishing, then one day, you really will
                                      go fishing.<br> 4) xing yin chan meng (mental fabrication-based dreams) - example
                                      when you come back from fishing, and you feel happy about it, then
                                      when you dream, you'll still dream of fishing.<br> 5) si yin chan meng (consciousness-based dreams) - 'si' or
                                      consciousness is dualism. Thinking of how in the past people used
                                      to fish and how people use to fish now, then when you see
                                      documentary on fishing and you knew the know how. Our dualistic
                                      views can cause dreams too.<br> 6) sickness/4 elements imbalance based dreams - Another form of
                                      dreaming is condition by the weather or in other word the 4
                                      elements. Due to sickness, our 4 elements are in balance.<br> 7) karma seed based dreams - Dreams that are due to the
                                      accumulation of karma seeds be it good or bad, in our Alaya (Stored
                                      Consciouness) through out our cycle of rebirths.<br> <strong>8 ) karma fruition based dreams - Dreams that are due to
                                      the coming fruition of karma (future karmic events about to
                                      unfold)</strong><br> 9) emotional based dreams - Dreams that are due to family love,
                                      friendship love, spouse love, etcs. The emotion of 2 party coming
                                      together<br> 10) divine intervention based dreams - Dreams that are cause by
                                      intervention of Buddha, bodhisattvas or saints, for the sake of
                                      delivering sentient beings.</p>

              <p>From our moderator Longchen, who has a lot of experiences with dream interpretation (he runs the website <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com">www.dreamdatum.com</a>) even before coming into Buddhism, wrote from his experience a year ago:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The grips and control of unconscious and subconscious karmic
                                          pattern is extremely strong and incredibly numerous. Without
                                          meditation, this tendencies are almost 100% controlling the
                                          behaviour of a person. It is that strong.</em></p>
              <p><em>Also, the events that happen in your life are 'controlled' by
                                          the subconscious impulses that are 'held' very deeply into the
                                          consciousness. You can call this the karma effects.</em></p>
              <p><em>That is why dreams can be used to foretell events that are about
                                          to happen. In the dream state, the physical 'realm' is momentarily
                                          suspended to allow for a different type of conditions to arise...
                                          in this case the dream state. The dream state is a symbolic
                                          representation of the karmic and intention imprints and tendencies
                                          that are held within the deepest subsconscious. This deepest
                                          subconscious should be the same as the alaya consciousness.</em></p>
              <p><em>What happen is that the dream plays a story with all the karmic
                                          influences symbolically represented. These karmic influences are
                                          actually about to surface and manifest soon... that is why they
                                          manifest as dreams first. Next, within a few weeks or months, the
                                          karma consequence manifest in the 'physical realm'.</em></p>
              <p><em>From my understanding and experience, the deepest subconscious
                                          (alaya consciousness?) is not accessible without meditation. In the
                                          deepest subconscious is 'held' the original state of the 'imprints'
                                          and 'intentions'. The deepest subconscious with its pure imprints
                                          can actually be very different from the manifested personality. The
                                          'reasons' for the rebirth are also felt in that realm.</em></p>
              <p><em>just my opinion only.</em></p>
              <p><em>PS: when i use the word 'realm' please understand that it is not
                                          any place elsewhere. It is mainly for easy explanation.</em></p>
