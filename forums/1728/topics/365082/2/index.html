              <p>its not important to know the past life. its already over. i think its important to focus on the actions and decisions we make in the present to gain  good merits for our future.</p>

              <p><br>True. However I do believe that what happen to you now is the karmic seed you planted during your past life. For some people who need to find a way out or a reason behind certain events (for eg, some people are just born with disability [and of course, we shall exclude the scientific explanation in this case for the time being]), knowing their past lives may allow them to understand it better.</p>
              <p>No doubt that some people will feel more dejected or æ”¾ä¸�å¼€ after knowing what they did previously, but I believed that there will definitely be some people out there who will feel that they have lifted a stone off their shoulder, in turn become è±�ç„¶å¼€æœ—. =)</p>
              <p>Haha.. Just my opinion.</p>

              <p>My first experience is a long story but I'll try to shorten it.</p>
              <p>About 17 years ago-Was watching a World Cup match in the afternoon...fell asleep and woke up under tree in a beautiful tropical beach....three teenage boys were calling me to join them for a swim and they called me under a different name and was speaking a strange language close to Bahasa Indonesia...a young girl came to me introduced herself as my wife but was puzzled when I denied who I was and couldnt recognize any of them ....she showed me a mirror I was shocked to see a dark skinny teenager's face in the mirror....'No this cant' be me!!! I was watching TV just 5 minutes ago,I must be dreaming!!'.'What is a TV?' they asked......story to be continued only if there is anyone here really interested to know the rest of it</p>

              <p><br>Icic. But is it possible that someone may create a false memory during past life regression?</p>
              <p>Nope, I am not able to control the dream content.</p>
              <p>By lucid dreaming, I mean that it was so real as if I was the one experiencing the whole events as the 1st party at that moment. I could feel so strongly about the emotions I had in there.</p>
              <p>However at the same time, I do realise that I was actually sleeping during the process and I had the same dream before, therefore I do know the outcome. Just as expected, in the end, the outcome turned up to be the same.</p>
              <p>To add on, as the events in my dream took place in another era, I was totally lost about my whereabout when I woke up. As what I had earlier was too real (just like reality), I couldnt differentiate between the 'real' reality and 'fake' reality.</p>
              <p>I'm someone who will dream almost every night and I will wake up knowing that that's just a normal dream. But that previous experience left me with doubts about what exactly was that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, another question which I had forgot to include previously was, will those grp of people who are related to you in your past lives, appear in another role in your present life? And also, (for eg.) those people whom you met on the bus, are the people who you actually met in your past lives too?</p>

              <p><br>You are a natural lucid dreamer and should be able to control the contend of your dreams with ease,you just need a little practice that is all.Your next stop is Astral projection but I would rather not discuss this here.</p>
