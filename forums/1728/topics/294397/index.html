In the conventional sense, that is.<br><br>Why? Because rather than judging and grasping on what is outside, we should shine the light (awareness) within to look in ourselves.<br><br>If we always shine a spotlight on others, and see how dirty they are, we will forever miss the 'dirt' that is within our very own minds.<br><br>That is like being able to distinguish everything out there, but know nothing about ourselves. This is not the way to liberation.<br><br>Zen Master Dogen Zenji says,<br><br>Â“To study Buddha Dharma [or Buddhism], is to study the self. And to study the self is to forget the self [or to let go of the self]. And to let go of the self, is to be enlightened by all things [the Â“10,000 dharmasÂ”]. To be enlight-ened by the 10,000 dharmas is to find perfect freedom for yourself and for others, and this trace- less enlightenment goes on and on and on, not leaving any trace at all.Â”<br><br>To be able to realise no-self, first of all, we must learn what this self is about.<br><br>Now in the ultimate sense, there is no inner or outer. No self. So in terms of insight practice, we are taught to just observe everything without judgement. And then eventually we will be able to penetrate the subject-object duality -- in seeing, only the seen, no seer. In hearing, only the heard, no hearer. In thinking, only the thought, no thinker. Everything that is self-arising is self-luminous and self-liberating, inseparable from conditions.<br><br>At that time you will not ask if there is relationship between 'inner' and 'outer', because everything is seen in Wholeness. There is no inner to relate to outer in the first place.</div>

What this is saying is just like what Shurangama Sutra is saying - when sound is taken to be objective reality, it is seen to have birth and death. We must not grasp on the concept of sound bcos that is to grasp on birth and death, we must not chase after sound bcos that is chasing a concept and getting lost in conceptual 'birth and death', and lose our own nature. Our own nature is not lost, but we are obscured from seeing it.<br><br>But ultimately there is no sound 'out there' apart from the hearing nature, and the hearing nature is the sound. Not in terms of concept, but the bell ringing is Buddha Nature. That is what is meant by 'hearing nature'. There is no coming and going. Sound is not an object 'out there'. It is pristine awareness.<br><br>There is no sound 'out there', there is no sound that can have birth and death, there is only hearing, the hearing is the sound (not as the conceptual object that comes as go, but as the riingggg of the bell)<br><br>As a Zen master said..<br><br>Â“When I heard the sound of<br>the bell ringing, there was no I,<br>and no bell, just the ringing.Â”</div>

Although it is good to reflect internally, but if he got stuck somewhere and cannot proceed, he will need to seek advise from an experienced practitioner or a teacher, so the teacher will be able to diminish his wrong view.<br>But eventually he still need to focus back on himself until when self is no longer exist.</div>
