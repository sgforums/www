              humans have attempted to answer the most complex and perplexing questions of
              the universe through religious beliefs. Questions such as why are we here? How
              did we come to be?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Religions worldwide set out a
              set of moral and ethical guidelines on how one should live and interact with
              the world. This leads to a vast number of teachings on peace and conflict, how
              to behave when at war and how to avoid it all together.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>In today’s world, Islam is seen
              as one of the most violent and war-like religions. However, this is not the
              case. Many of their ancient scriptures and teachings from the Quran and from
              their prophet Muhammad talk of avoiding violence at all costs.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>On the other side of the coin,
              Buddhism is seen as one of the most peaceful religions in the world. By all
              accounts it is. The Buddha preached love and kindness and the ending of all
              suffering. However, due to political and religious turmoil, many Buddhists have
              turned to violence and hate. Buddhist monks are now persecuting Muslims in
              Burma.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>With Buddhism, there is an
              emphasis on peace and peaceful living but this comes from a focus on
              suffering and the ending of all suffering. The<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s02.htm"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #0054a6;'>Four
              Nobel Truths</span></a><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>are the
              centre of Buddhism. These truths centre around suffering, the cause of
              suffering, the end of suffering and how one can end suffering. Within Buddhism,
              there is a large focus on inner peace or “enlightenment”. Once one reaches
              enlightenment, you no longer suffer and your aim is to ease the suffering of
              others by aiding them in their path to enlightenment. The very basis of
              Buddhist teachings is one of peace.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>If you wish to end suffering,
              the most obvious way to do that is to be peaceful.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>To learn how Islam strives for
              peace, you must look to see when it was established and in what political and
              religious climate. The prophet Muhammad was born into an extremely violent
              tribal culture. In his thirties, Muhammad experienced “divine revelations” from
              God which led to the writing of the Quran. In these teachings, Muhammad said
              that God, or Allah, wished for peace for his people. These teachings also
              preached patience and kindness. These teachings were alien to pre-Islamic Arabia.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Muhammad advocated a policy of
              non-violent resistance and like Buddhism, Islamic teachings, at their core,
              call for peace and patience. The Holy Quran 49:10 states ‘Humanity is but a
              single brotherhood; so make peace with your brethren.’ The word ‘Islam’ even
              comes from the world ‘Salam’ meaning ‘peace’.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Today, members and leaders of
              the Islamic faith actively condemn acts of violence. They speak out against
              injustices and work together with other Abrahamic faiths in interfaith
              dialogues to aid the spread of understanding and peace. Muslim communities in
              Australia are working with the federal and state governments to combat the
              radicalisation of Muslim youths.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Obviously, the glaring
              contradiction is terrorist organisations such as Islamic State and Boko Haram.
              However, these organisations do not work in the name of Allah, or in any way
              embody the teachings of Muhammad. These contradictions result from a
              misunderstanding and misinterpretation of Islamic text. With all religious
              text, one must continually re-interpret it as society evolves.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>In reality, the Quran is no
              more violent than the Christian bible, it just so happens that there are groups
              of people who insist on taking portions of the Quran out of context to fit
              their radical agenda.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>In the modern world, Buddhism
              works with many people and religions in an effort towards peace. Organisations
              such as The Soka Gakkai International is a global movement of people who are
              connected through Buddhism. They attempt to bring a “revolution of peace” to
              the world. This organisation has roots leading back to the Cold War where they
              rallied against the use of nuclear arms. The then president of the
              organisation, Josei Toda, called for the complete prohibition of all nuclear
              weapons.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>The Soka Gakkai organisation
              has always said that open dialogue among the various faiths and cultures is the
              key to peace. They published dialogues with the former soviet president<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.biography.com/people/mikhail-sergeyevich-gorbachev-9315721"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #0054a6;'>Mikhail

              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Like Islam, there is still the
              radical sect of Buddhism who insist on interpreting the sacred texts to suit
              their own agenda. This is never more obvious than with the persecution of
              Muslims in Burma at the hands of Buddhist monks. The origin of this violence is
              vague at best and there are disputing claims as to why and when these
              persecutions began. The persecution included boycotting Muslim business and
              attacking and killing Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Some claim that the Buddhists
              of Burma became angry at the influx of Muslim migrants to the country. Others
              say that the Buddhist monks became angry at the accumulated wealth of the
              Muslims, effectively blaming them for the poverty of their own people. Whatever
              the origin, these events show that no religion is immune from violent
              extremism. But these episodes of violence should in no way over-shadow the good
              done by other Buddhists and Buddhist organisations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>It is safe to say, that the
              goal for every religion is to reach a state of peace, whether it’s inner peace,
              or world peace. The radical sects of some religions do not speak for these
              religions as a whole, and the majority of adherents of these religions are
              appalled at the things done in the name of, say, Allah and Buddha. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Through the teachings of
              Muhammad, Muslims are instructed to be patient, to be kind to those of
              differing faiths.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Buddhists have a similar view.
              They must not cause suffering and should shy away from violence. Much like
              Muhammad, they preach non-violent resistance.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #444444;'>Many people would be shocked to
              think of Islam and Buddhism being comparable in any way and yet if you look
              closely at their teachings, and their efforts towards peace, they are more
              similar than one may suspect. </span></p>

              <p>There three mains parts which I'll like to raise;</p>
              <p>First, as a Buddhist, I take the belief that people are essentially good, so even in a bad situation, goodness can manifest itself. People do unwholesome or bad thing due to deluded or false views. We try to do kind deeds and good thing when we are all well and good, but when discontent is rife, false views arise. We justify our bad behavior. It takes some contemplation and practice to be a good Buddhist. As if calling oneself a Buddhist will automatically make us instantly good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, there may good religion and bad religion. Also good people, bad people. </p>
              <p>But then, there are good religion, bad people. Also, bad religion, good people. Good religion have good teachings, if you do not heed goodness, it is not the religion's fault is it.</p>
              <p>Bad religion, good people. If people are not discontent or not all the time angry and indignant , then they are naturally good as they do not need the more extreme excuses or motivations. And yes, I am simplifying things! </p>
              <p>Here we have on one side an inclusive and then an exclusionary religion.</p>
              <p>One preaches unconditional loving kindness and compassion. The other, if you don't embrace me, you go to hell. Very transactional and conditional love, don't you think!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Mohammed preached love and tolerance, he was getting no where. Only when he engaged in warfare did Islam finally became widespread, under the sword. In fact, Muslim proselytization are no less violent than the Mongolian conquests.</p>
              <p>There is no god, but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger. Whether Mohammed is a flawed person or not is for another debate, he still carries the words of Allah. Then there are abrogations to earlier Quranic verses by Prophet Mohammed, who is the messenger of Allah. I don't see any vigorous denunciations of these verses, only of them as misinterpretations due to the violent times and conditions when the abrogations  were made. Perhaps, someone will kindly show fatwas regarding this issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From an non Muslim individual point of view, I am an infidel, not people of the book. I can be lied to, killed or forced under the sword to convert, because Allah, through His Messenger, wills it.  Then you have Shia taqiyah, which allows deception when Muslims are a minority or under threat to lie.  You won't see much indignance when infidels, whichever definition fit the situation, are on the receiving end. </p>
              <p>So, perhaps political Islam may well be the proper way of practising. So moral of the story? To trust or not to trust, that is the question!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sidenote(I don't know what to think, of videos on YouTube of exhortations of "Allah Akbar" every time they fire a missile or shoot somebody, sending someone to his/her Maker, so to speak?!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps I seriously flawed and wrong, I would like to be corrected lest I be prejudiced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, on the Myanmar issue, I feel it is more of a national identity per se than a religious one. Being Buddhist is being a Myanmar national, culturally Burmese if you will. The impression that I was given, perhaps erroneously, was that a lot of Muslims were imported by the British during colonial times, and they are have never assimilated, and they work for the British who exploited the land and people. I put a forward this view as one given to me by an Myanmar national. Even the name Burma was given by the British.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's go back to when Myanmar have Kings. The monarchies, employed Muslims soldier mercenaries?) as there personal armies as there are little chance of assimilation, and having the Muslim soldiers subsequently turned against their masters. These Muslims remainly segregated by religion and over time gotten quite well to do under the Royal patronage.</p>
              <p>Then the Rohingyas, who are considered interlopers who never left. They came with the British, when given a chance, destroyed Buddhist monasteries, pagodas and homes . Remember, I said Buddhism as part of the cultural identity. These people not only are unable to assimilate, but attempted to destroy the culture heritage. How can there not be bad blood?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you would look up issues such as abrogations in the Koran and taqiyah in the net. Also of rohingyas' history in Wikipedia. I welcome correction to any erroneous, so I may not fall prey to prejudicial views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At no time do I condone violence by people who called the Buddhists or by donning  safron robes make them enlightened and holy. But it does sully the name of Buddhism by lumping the complex issue of cultural and national identity and the essential Buddhism practice.</p>

Buddhists should only focus Buddhism on the inherent Tranquility &amp; Patience (means Buddha or Buddhism) which both are the same essence, liken to the unlimited depth, broadness, timeless and omnipresent of space. Buddhists should not be diverted or explain on behalf of other religions but harness the essence of tranquility patience of all beings to regain back this buddha mind of all beings :) Buddha mind is the true identity of all beings and is the supreme culture that forms are an emptiness and emptiness is inseparable of forms. </p></div>

Therefore, the 1255 disciples were always following buddha instead of externalism for 49 years are an awesome example not to deviate from inherent essence. Even when you attainment like Buddha, you also can't change the externalist in this life, but many lifespans later upon condition is ready on the perspective of externalist.
