One day he saw a device on a television program that immediately fired his imagination. It consisted of two concentric glass cylinders, the space between them being filled with glycerin, a highly viscous fluid. If a droplet of ink is placed in the fluid and the outer cylinder is turned, the droplet is drawn out into a thread that eventually becomes so thin that it disappears from view; the ink particles are enfolded into the glycerin. But if the cylinder is then turned in the opposite direction, the thread-form reappears and rebecomes a droplet; the droplet is unfolded again. Bohm realized that when the ink was diffused through the glycerin it was not in a state of 'disorder' but possessed a hidden, or nonmanifest, order.<br><br>In Bohm's view, all the separate objects, entities, structures, and events in the visible or explicate world around us are relatively autonomous, stable, and temporary 'subtotalities' derived from a deeper, implicate order of unbroken wholeness. Bohm gives the analogy of a flowing stream:<br><br>On this stream, one may see an ever-changing pattern of vortices, ripples, waves, splashes, etc., which evidently have no independent existence as such. Rather, they are abstracted from the flowing movement, arising and vanishing in the total process of the flow. Such transitory subsistence as may be possessed by these abstracted forms implies only a relative independence or autonomy of behaviour, rather than absolutely independent existence as ultimate substances....[2]<br><br>We must learn to view everything as part of 'Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement' [3]...</span></strong><br><br>-----------------------<br><br><img src="http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/9845/order1gl8.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img369.imageshack.us/img369/1392/order2fj5.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img374.imageshack.us/img374/1066/order3gm5.jpg"><br><br>~ The Holographic Universe[/b]</blockquote>Oh my Fark, you have trying to hide the inadequacies of your religion behind a flurry of quotations. While Bohm has predicted about order in chaos but if you read carefully, the converse is true, i.e chaos in order.</div>

But they definitely know everything as in you throw any question at them, they will know how to respond in the right way towards each unique individual.

That would be equated to the Christian concept of god - All-Knowing.<br>We are 'enlightened' in our own ways as we learn, work, socialise and so forth. The ability to 'see' or have an 'insight' is enlightenment. Of course, not everyone has this ability!  But there were already many enlightened people from the beginning of time and even today. So, we have great scientists, philosphers, thinkers, teachers, tinkers, even gamblers and convicts!<br>But it is very natural of human to elevate another human to 'god-like' status when they are very profound thinkers, leaders or teachers.

When they asked him what to should do, among many other things he said that followers of Gautama must let people know four things:<br><br>- Siddhartha, a normal ordinary human being came to the earth.<br>- He achieved enlightenment.<br>- He taught others how he achieved enlightenment.<br>- He passed into parinirvana.<br><br>The first message, that an ordinary human being called Siddhartha came, is very important because it indicates that he was an ordinary man just like us before he achieved enlightenment.<br>This second message is a very important message, as it indicates that an ordinary human being can achieve enlightenment.<br>The third message tells us that itÂ’s not as though only the Buddha can achieve enlightenment, and the rest of us have to somehow try our best and remain secondary. ItÂ’s not like that. He taught the path through which everyone can achieve enlightenment equally, just like him.<br>The fourth message is very important Â– itÂ’s not as though enlightenment is something like becoming a god, or attaining a state that is unchanging, ultimate and permanent like some kind of god realm, despite what we might think. The Buddha actually passed into the parinirvana. This last message is very important. I think it is taught in the Mahaparinirvana-sutra. This is also why he said that Buddhists, those who wish to follow him in the future, must go to four places: Lumbini, where an ordinary man was born; Bodh Gaya, where this ordinary person achieved enlightenment, and so forth.
