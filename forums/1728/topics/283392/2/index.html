            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">People like George Bush tells you that it is belief and Faith. Why can't you accept that but you can accept what some other people tell you? What is the standard, the yardstick, the rule that can be used to make a decision to accept or not to accept?<br><br>There is such a yardstick and it has worked very well as we can see from the tangible advancements so far.</div></blockquote>Actually yes, Buddhists should have faith in the triple gems and Buddha's words. Though at the same time we must strive to find out and experience the truth ourselves.<br><br>Like Thusness said -- we cannot run away from faith and belief, because knowledge has NO certainty, though whether it is 'good faith' or 'rational faith' is another matter -- i.e if countless people tell you they have done the experiment and you can do it too, and you have faith in them to do the experiment, this is probably 'good' and 'rational faith'.<br><br>If the police who has information about a terrorist plot tell you there's a bomb in the building, you leave the building immediately. You have to have faith in what is being said, there is no choice because there is no certainty in knowledge.<br><br>Similarly if the Buddha experienced Nirvana and tell you how to liberate from samsara you must accept it with faith at first but it need not be blind faith, and furthermore you can see the truth for yourself -- the Buddha actually gave you the scientific method to experiment and realise the truths. So our faith is rational.<br><br>It is actually being discussed before at <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=273281" rel="nofollow">Faith in Belief Systems</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Thusness:<br><strong>Interesting topic and I think I will skew a little to talk about science and faith since AEN was discussing a related thread yesterday.<br><br>Faith is necessary because there is no certainty in knowledge.  Even in exact science, no certainty is to be found.  Of course certainty versus probable knowledge is a topic relating to Epistemology (the theory on Knowledge) but still, it is pivotal towards understanding why the need for faith at all.  How science has led to the common misunderstanding that faith is not necessary is amazing but it is mostly due to the predictive nature of these scientific theories derived from thorough experimentation.  This is, however, mainly due to the fact that the pool of data made available for the derivation of these theories does not go beyond our man-size world.  As we know, Newtonian physics or classical science works well for a man-size world but not quite well in the macro and micro universe.  Our ordinary experiences do not permit us to experience something having the mass of a star or traveling at half-speed of light, we presume that the entire universe must obey the laws of the man-size world.  But when we are exposed to things not so ordinary, like traveling at a speed much faster then our ordinary experience of Â‘speedÂ’, we are lost because phenomena just donÂ’t behave the way we expected it to be.  The idea that time travel slower when they are approaching the speed of light and halt at speed of light is mind boggling.  Similarly when scientists begin to deal with the universe of the outer space Â– the macro universe, they are dealing with much more massive objects than the man-size world, a billion times more.  The idea that space curves and time halt at the speed of light came as a shocked to the classical scientists.  This applies true when we deal with the micro universe of the quantum world.  The world of the electrons does not comply with Newtonian nor Einstein theory.  This includes the spooky non-local behavior of particles that AEN brought up in another thread.  [b]When Heisenberg introduced the Â‘uncertaintyÂ’ principle, it is so weird that even Einstein rejected it and thus, Einstein famous remark -- Â“God does not play diceÂ”.  But Â“God does not play diceÂ” is a belief system!  </strong> I canÂ’t remember where I read it but I could clearly recalled that even Stephen Hawking used phrases like Â“official dogmaÂ”, Â“deep emotional attachment to determinismÂ” to describe scientists like Einstein.  Stephen Hawking even went further to say that Einstein was doubly wrong when he said Â“God does not play diceÂ”.<br><br>I will not dwell too deeply into it but the purpose is simply to illustrate that our knowledge is nothing certain nor absolute.  Science is itself a belief system for us to better understand the phenomenon existence.  It is its certainty in predictability within a prescribed environment that convinces us that faith is not necessary.  It creates the impression of certainty and made a probable knowledge appears absolute but in actual case, science itself is a belief system and a great deal of faith (maybe good and rational faith in this case) is vested in science unknowingly.<br><br>My 2 cents.
