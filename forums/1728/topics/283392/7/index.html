Actually it isn't very easy... because we cannot judge a person's enlightenment by his behavior and actions alone. Because a person may be very good in his behavior and action, but may not have transcendental insights. A person with transcendental insights may have behavior far from perfect.<br><br>I believe the criteria to see someone's enlightenment is by the criteria of insight. This is the tricky part, because firstly ppl like us do not have that insight firsthand, and therefore we have to judge based on many factors. It is not easy... many things to take into account. Get familiar with their teachings, practises and know more about the teacher.<br><br>Generally speaking, go for recognised lineages, and here are some advises and things to look out for: <a href="http://www.chagchen.org/aw/choosing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chagchen.org/aw/choosing.htm</a><br><br>Interesting article too -- <a href="http://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/2854F3F2-472F-47BB-9CE1-7D7F32A749C1.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/2854F3F2-472F-47BB-9CE1-7D7F32A749C1.html</a></div>
