            <div class='col-md body'>I have also asked the same questions to Christians: Why tell me to believe in something that cannot be proven by science? Of course, Christians do have many books and other relevant materials that sought to explain from various angles and evidence, that science complements Christianity and vice versa. But now I think I don't need to.<br><br>Because I now choose to focus on similarities which are important in the sense that they advocate or teach values common to most world religions which has survived the ravages of Time and insecurities of men. Values and behaviour that should be learnt by any man regardless of race or religion.<br><br>The strong insistence on using any scientific theories or knowledge discovered by and known to men, to prove the validity of religious concepts and doctrines will, in my personal opinion, hardly yield anything but more and more excitement initially, but resentment later on the part of the questioner and maybe the person to whom the question is posed.<br><br>Such highly intellectual individuals who pose questions that seemingly ask for logic and scientific evidence, are themselves people who have not had a particular religion or belief in most of their lives for the simple reason that he doesn't need or want to. Most of them have absolutely no intention to accept anything less than what is reported in and scientifically proven by the mass media. They belong to groups such as free-thinkers, atheists, academics, and/or a scientist. The list goes on to any group or type of people of course.<br><br>If you are not open to accepting anything but science, human logic and philosophy alone, why waste your time to so-called ask questions regarding any religion?<br><br>Just my personal opinion on what I have observed about others and myself.<br></div>

When we ask Â“When?Â”, there is no Â“When?Â” It can be 10 million miles away. It can be in another planet. The teaching is consistent. It does not require a Â“WhoÂ”, a Â“WhereÂ”, a Â“WhenÂ”. Condition arises, it is there. It is not stored in any place, or anywhere. This is the teaching...<br><br>...When I say that things happen, it is not like those people that subscribe to think that anything is just taking by itself, itÂ’s nature. Mainly what is important is conditions. You must have the conditions, then things can surface. When the conditions is there, they just surfaces, and manifest. If there is cause in ten million miles away or ten million light years away, or whatever it is, or in other realms, as long as there is conditions, it WILL surface, it is not travelling {inaudible}. Can you understand this part? Condition is there, they just manifest. This is one thing...<br><br>...That is there is no I, there is no Where, and there is no When. This is very important. Do not hold anything at all, then you can experience it. <strong>You see, when we talk about cause and effect, the philosopherÂ’s cause and effect is different from what the Buddha taught.</strong> Cause and effect always involve an entity taking place at a certain date some time later... means, there is an entity, or a first cause, or something, taking a process. Means there is changing Â‘thingsÂ’ going through a process and after certain time interval, takes place. This seeing things as entities. Now, to experience Reality you must not see things this way...</span><br><br>BTW, though karma has an order, it is too complex to ponder for an ordinary being like us, therefore being one of the 4 imponderables (for ordinary ppl). Karma is also not a predeterministic system -- conditioned arising/dependent origination is not a predeterministic teaching --<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyway Chaos Theory is really good.

Initial cause does not result into a predetermined action.  From a spiritual perspective,<br>the rigidity of Â‘IÂ’ as a fixed pattern order must be broken down for life to be experienced in its full dynamics as wondrous manifestation.</span></div></blockquote>-------------------<br><br><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/bohm.htm" rel="nofollow">David Bohm and the Implicate Order</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>...In the 1960s Bohm began to take a closer look at the notion of order. One day he saw a device on a television program that immediately fired his imagination. It consisted of two concentric glass cylinders, the space between them being filled with glycerin, a highly viscous fluid. If a droplet of ink is placed in the fluid and the outer cylinder is turned, the droplet is drawn out into a thread that eventually becomes so thin that it disappears from view; the ink particles are enfolded into the glycerin. But if the cylinder is then turned in the opposite direction, the thread-form reappears and rebecomes a droplet; the droplet is unfolded again. Bohm realized that when the ink was diffused through the glycerin it was not in a state of 'disorder' but possessed a hidden, or nonmanifest, order.<br><br>In Bohm's view, all the separate objects, entities, structures, and events in the visible or explicate world around us are relatively autonomous, stable, and temporary 'subtotalities' derived from a deeper, implicate order of unbroken wholeness. Bohm gives the analogy of a flowing stream:<br><br>On this stream, one may see an ever-changing pattern of vortices, ripples, waves, splashes, etc., which evidently have no independent existence as such. Rather, they are abstracted from the flowing movement, arising and vanishing in the total process of the flow. Such transitory subsistence as may be possessed by these abstracted forms implies only a relative independence or autonomy of behaviour, rather than absolutely independent existence as ultimate substances....[2]<br><br>We must learn to view everything as part of 'Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement' [3]...</strong></span><br><br>-----------------------<br><br><img src="http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/9845/order1gl8.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img369.imageshack.us/img369/1392/order2fj5.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img374.imageshack.us/img374/1066/order3gm5.jpg"><br><br>~ The Holographic Universe</div>

You differentiate between events that are<br>Â“good for meÂ” and those that are Â“bad.Â” This is a fragmented perception of<br>the wholeness of life in which everything is interconnected, in which every<br>event has its necessary place and function within the totality. The totality,<br>whoever, is more than the surface appearance of things, more than the sum<br>total of its parts, more than whatever your life or the world contains.<br>Behind the sometimes seemingly random or even chaotic succession<br>of events in our lives as well as in the world lies concealed the unfolding of a<br>higher order and purpose. This is beautifully expressed in the Zen saying<br>Â“The snow falls, each flake in its appropriate place.Â” We can never<br>understand this higher order through thinking about it because whatever we<br>think about is content; whereas, the higher order emanates from the formless<br>realm of consciousness, from universal intelligence. But we can glimpse it,<br>and more than that, align ourselves with it, which means be conscious<br>participants in the unfolding of that higher purpose.<br><br>When we go into a forest that has not been interfered with by man, our<br>thinking mind will see only disorder and chaos all around us. It won't even<br>be able to differentiate between life (good) and death (bad) anymore since<br>everywhere new life grows out of rotting and decaying matter. Only if we are<br>still enough inside and the noise of thinking subsides can we become aware<br>that there is a hidden harmony here, a sacredness, a higher order in which<br>everything has its perfect place and could not be other than what it is and the<br>way it is.<br><br>The mind is comfortable in a landscaped park because it has been<br>planned through thought; it has not grown organically. There is an order here<br>that the mind can understand. In the forest, there is an incomprehensible<br>order that to the mind looks like chaos. It is beyond the mental categories of<br>god and bad. You cannot understand it through thought, but you can sense it<br>when you let go of thought, become still and alert, and don't try to<br>understand or explain. Only then can you be aware of he sacredness of the<br>forest. As soon as you sense that hidden harmony, that sacredness, you<br>realize you are not separate from it, and when you realize that, you become a conscious participant in it. In this way, nature can help you become realigned with the wholeness of life.<br><br><strong>GOOD AND BAD</strong><br><br>At some point in their lives, most people become aware that there is<br>not only birth, growth, success, good health, pleasure, and winning, but also<br>loss, failure, sickness, old age, decay, pain and death. Conventionally these<br>are labeled Â“goodÂ” and Â“bad,Â” order and disorder. The Â“meaningÂ” of people's<br>lives is usually associated with what they term the Â“good,Â” but the good is<br>continually threatened by collapse, breakdown, disorder; threatened by<br>meaninglessness and the Â“bad,Â” when explanations fail and life ceases to<br>make sense. Sooner or later, disorder will irrupt into everyone's life no<br>matter how many insurance policies he or she has. It may come in the form<br>of loss or accident, sickness, disability, old age, death. However, the<br>irruption of disorder into a person's life, and the resultant collapse of a<br>mentally defined meaning, can become the opening into a higher order.<br>Â“The wisdom of this world is folly with God,Â” says the Bible.3 What is<br>the wisdom of this world? The movement of thought, and meaning that is<br>defined exclusively by thought.<br><br>Thinking isolates a situation or event and calls it good or bad, as if it<br>had a separate existence. Through excessive reliance on thinking, reality<br>becomes fragmented. This fragmentation is an illusion, but it seems very real<br>while you are trapped in it. And yet the universe is an indivisible whole in<br>which all things are interconnected, in which nothing exists in isolation.<br>The deeper interconnectedness of all things and events implies that the<br>mental labels of Â“goodÂ” and badÂ” are ultimately illusory. They always imply<br>a limited perspective and so are true only relatively and temporarily. This is<br>illustrated in the story of a wise man who won an expensive car in a lottery.<br>His family and friends were very happy for him and came to celebrate. Â“Isn't<br>it great!Â” they said. Â“You are so lucky.Â” The man smiled and said Â“Maybe.Â”<br>For a few weeks he enjoyed driving the car. Then one day a drunken driver<br>crashed into his new car at an intersection and he ended up in the hospital,<br>with multiple injuries. His family and friends came to see him and said,<br>Â“That was really unfortunate. Â“ Again the man smiled and said, Â“Maybe.Â”<br>While he was still in the hospital, one night there was a landslide and his<br>house fell into the sea. Again his friends came the next day and said,<br>Â“Weren't you lucky to have been here in hospital.Â” Again he said, Â“Maybe.Â”<br><br>The wise man's Â“maybeÂ” signifies a refusal to judge anything that<br>happens. Instead of judging what is, he accepts it and so enters into<br>conscious alignment with the higher order. He knows that often it is<br>impossible for the mind to understand what place or purpose a seemingly<br>random event has in the tapestry of the whole. But there are no random<br>events, nor are there events or things that exist by and for themselves, in<br>isolation. The atoms that make up your body were once forged inside stars,<br>and the causes of even the smallest event are virtually infinite and connected<br>with the whole in incomprehensible ways. If you wanted to trace back the<br>cause of any event, you would have to go back all the way to the beginning<br>of creation. The cosmos is not chaotic. The very word cosmos means order.<br>But this is not an order the human mind can ever comprehend, although it<br>can sometimes glimpse it.</blockquote>~ A New Earth, Eckhart Tolle</div>
