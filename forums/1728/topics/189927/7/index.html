            <div class='col-md body'>Topic: Disturbing the peace<br><br>I remembered I saw a picture of myself talking to a young man. I had a hand phone and I was talking over the hand phone with my friend, and I was upset and angry, my voice got loud and louder. The passenger behind me was also talking on his hand phone: and he told me to calm down and talk softer. I got angry with him because I saw him talking and he was just as noisily as me. I turn around and face him in the travel coach seat. I asked him Â“ What do U want?Â” He was kind of confused but I guess his pride and cowardice got mixed. Â“Do you want me to tell you that you are talking just as loud.. And what do you mean when you patted on my backside, U want to me fcuk your Mother ?Â’Â’. Did you talk just as loud, so U want me, what? Want to fightÂ…? And I confronted him for a period of about five extra long minutes. I was angry and got angrier and angrier and my emotions run completely out almost out of control. However, those emotions have yet not got out of complete of my control because it was not a fight and the coward apologized, and we shake hands, and I still want to fcuk his Mother..Lor..then eventually I sat down. I almost slap him which was really asking for a fight<i><br><br>Meanwhile, one of the passengers got her hand phone and was taking all the wonderful scenes during the commotion, and now you can have a good look of exactly what happenedÂ…Was it call <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disturbing the peace</span>? Would the public bother? Would the Police come if someone call? The scene is what I saw repeated many times in China when I was traveling in buses and trains. I think they should ban the use of hand phones on all tourist buses. Perhaps such bullies should never allow using it, just liking banning on the Internet for all cahts and forums? I have never seen it elsewhere outside China and Hongkong!<br>Could China, Hongkong or STaiwan or Sinapore do it? It is a loudstanding joke to even suggest it..it <strong>raw human nature at works</strong>..irregardless of religions..<br><br><a href="http://www.twistedhopes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.twistedhopes.com</a> taken by another passenger!<br><br>Alien2<br><br>P.S.If someone apologies it should be enough! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> It's call facing saving! in Chinese..so say sorrylah!<br><br></i></div>
