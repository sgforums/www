Jue-Hsing<br><br>A scholar once asked, "Buddhism seems a great theory, and I find it useful. Is Buddhism a Philosophy?"<br><br>"Master Shen-Kai once said 'Buddhism is not Philosophy but beyond Philosophy,'" I replied.<br><br>"Why so?" The scholar asked.<br><br>"Philosophy is a system of thoughts based upon logical reasoning." I answered. "However, Buddhism is about realizing truths while detaching from thoughts."</blockquote>Therefore as you can see Buddhism isn't a bunch of intellectual theories - the truths that Buddha realised is not derived by discursive thoughts and they are not theories - but by clear SEEING what things really are, the nature of existence. The path of awakening may be the best way to describe Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.<br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</div></blockquote>In a way it can be considered a science of the mind and we can all follow the Buddha's teachings and directions and see for ourselves - the result of what is known as enlightenment.<br><br>------------------<br><br>[quote]The next time a monk come to me for alms...I will buy him some bowls of good tasting Chinese porridge to bring back..

This difference in practice depends on the different emphasis of each tradition: the emphasis of the Theravadin teaching is to eliminate attachment toward sense objects and to cease the discriminating mind that says, "I like this and not that." Thus, when the monks go out on alms round, they are to accept silently and with gratitude whatever is offered to them, be it meat or not. It would not only offend the benefactors but would also harm a monkÂ’s own practice of detachment, if he said, "I cannot eat meat, so give me more of those delicious vegetables." Thus, provided that the meat comes from an animal that the monk neither orders to be killed, nor sees, hears or suspects is killed to give him the meat, he is permitted to eat it. However, it is wise for those who make offerings to remember that the principal premise of Buddhism is not to harm others, and to choose what they offer accordingly.<br><br>Upon the foundation of detachment, compassion for other beings is emphasized, especially in the Mahayana tradition. Thus, for such a practitioner it is advisable not to eat meat to avoid inflicting pain on any being and to prevent potential butchers from committing negative actions. Also, because of the vibration of meat, it can impede an ordinary practitioner from developing great compassion. Therefore, vegetarianism is recommended.<br><br>The tantric path or Vajrayana has four classes. In the lower classes, external cleanliness and purity are emphasized as a technique for the practitioners to generate internal purity of mind. Therefore, these practitioners do not eat meat, which is regarded as impure. On the other hand, in the highest yoga tantra, on the basis of detachment and compassion, a qualified practitioner does meditation on the subtle nervous system, and for this, oneÂ’s bodily elements need to be very strong. Thus, meat is recommended for such a person. Also, this class of tantra stresses the transformation of ordinary objects through meditation on selflessness. Such a practitioner, by virtue of his/her profound meditation, is not greedily eating meat for his/her own pleasure.<br><br>In Tibet, there is an additional factor to consider: due to the high altitude and harsh climate, there is little to eat besides ground barley, dairy products and meat. To stay alive, the people have to eat meat. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has encouraged those Tibetans in exile, who now live in countries where vegetables and fruits are more plentiful, to refrain from eating meat whenever possible. Also, if a practitioner has severe problems with his/her health due to not eating meat, then the master may give permission to take it. Thus, each person must check his/her own level of practice and bodily requirements and eat accordingly.<br><br>The fact that there is such variety within the Buddhist doctrine attests to the BuddhaÂ’s skill in being able to guide people according to their dispositions and needs. It is extremely important not to be partial and sectarian, but to have respect for all the traditions and their practitioners.<br><br></div>

His idea of God was along the line of 'Spinoza' and you can say that albert einstein also holds certain pantheistic ideas.<br><br>Also, it is wrong to say Buddhism is pantheistic because pantheism implies equating a particular Deity with the entire universe. In this case, Hinduism would be close to pantheism. Buddhism is not pantheism as we do not worship deities or anyone including the Buddha. A Buddha is simply a great teacher and an example to us, and we all aim to be awakened/enlightened like him. As such, Buddhism isn't considered as a religion in a sense.<br><br>And Buddha also explained clearly all the questions you asked.<br>Also regarding 'life is an illusion', in Buddhism life is LIKE an illusion, not necessarily IS illusion. It is illusory - dream-like - until we have awakened from our ignorance and delusions - and from then, freed from all sufferings, vexations, living in a state of complete and perfect Bliss even in this lifetime.<br><br>----<br><br>Secondly pls see the post I just replied to norey and also read the Kalama Sutra in full:<br><br>The goal of Buddhists is not about anything supernatural - but to be liberated from all vexations and sufferings, to achieve the state of pure mind free from all defilements, and to be awakened to the nature of things - to see it as they truely are.<br><br>Furthermore another reason why I said that godlike is irrelevant to Buddhism is because, 'godlike' figures usually demand authority and faith and holds a higher status than all other beings who will not be able to achieve what he has achieved:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Kalama Sutra</strong><br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha</blockquote>See the full version of the Kalama Sutra which is a very valuable read: <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/the_kalama_sutra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/the_kalama_sutra.htm</a></div>

I am not that smart like Einstein who dreamed of sunbeams traveling into the blue beyond and came out with his mathematical ''mind'' formula ofEnergy equal to the Mass multiply by  C, the velocity to the ''square root'' of 2; or The Great Isaac Newton when an lucky apple came down upon his hard head then suddenly he came out with the theory of gravityBTW, What is life ? Does anyone know, yes the true <span style="font-style: italic;">purpose of life</span>, and what's this: expanse or universe they called? Who am I really ME my identity? Moreover, [b]why am I here</strong>?<br><br>*At the end of his life when the great Einstein  had nothing to fall upon and he returned to his old belief in Judaism, a religion too! Newton was a Christian. I am a Christian too, but the story of my faith had been a long road all the way from Singapore to Canada and around the world looking for some of those answers! I went to enrolled with Bible institutions and colleges to study about my faith. I had been very diligent to find those answers myself. I read the fine print too about the Bible and  Christianity<br>*The Great Buddha was a sincere seeker too, and he founded a great religion after his great awakening..however, I reckon he could ''never'' resolve those questions. His great ideas of "rebirth" reincarnation was not unlike the Big Bang theory or Einstein idea of the expanding universe! All of these great thinkers were pantheistic in their philosophy. The Chinese idea of  contentment "sacred life" are wonderful [[idea]]s. Still at the conclusion he  commented "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">life is  an illusion </span>''<br>They said Einstein and Buddha had a lot in common!

Many of its fundamental tenets, such as the doctrine of Original Sin,  have their origins in a literal interpretation of Genesis, and are completely at variance with scientific evidence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Christianity is thus unable to mount a convincing defense against materialism.In contrast, Buddhism is a robust and consistent philosophical system which does not suffer from internal logical contradictions.
