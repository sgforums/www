            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by casino_king:<br>What does Buddha teach about compassion?[/b]</blockquote>that Compassion and Wisdom are of the same side of the coin.<br>Wisdom is quite different from Knowledge.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom and compassion are the essence of an enlightened life.<br><br>Wisdom and compassion are inextricably linked. They are two sides of the same coin. They are a unit. Separating them is an artificial, intellectual act.<br><br>When compassion is taken out of the equation, wisdom turns into worthless platitudes, which easily become destructive. Without compassion, wisdom degenerates into an escapist entanglement in concepts, theories and dogmas.<br><br>Wisdom is more than just cleverness plus compassion. It differs in quality to a point where it may seem to have little to do with cleverness. Sometimes, the actions of wise people seem to go against common sense. In fact, wise people often act in ways which are considered foolish by clever people.<br><br>When wisdom is taken out of the equation, compassion is perverted, for it loses direction totally. It becomes like a lost ship without navigational means drifting aimlessly on a stormy ocean. A good example of love without wisdom is when parents spoil their children, giving them everything they want, without giving them direction in life. Another example is if someone lacks the courage to tell his friend when she is wrong out of fear he might lose her friendship. A friend that allows you to go astray does not qualify as a friend.<br><br>Without wisdom, compassion lacks the detachment essential to perspective and constructive support. Wisdom gives the compassionate person the strength to act against her own personal interests and desires.<br><br>Often, compassion is mistaken for a feeling of love. True compassion is independent of emotions. It may produce feelings, but these feelings are not its substance. Compassion is a commitment to constructive support. Love as mere emotion is fickle and unreliable.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Compassion without wisdom does not exist. There is no such thing as wisdom without compassion.<br><br>Only when wisdom and compassion fuse do they become a tremendous force working for the good of everyone and everything.<br><br></span><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

In Buddhism, keep an open mind and then see for yourselves.<br><br>You see the human conditioning is that we are always protecting our own egoic identity as has been displayed in your reactions to my post. The mind identifies beliefs as part of its ego. When the ego is threatened, it will react strongly to protect the identity.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192177" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192177</a><br><br><blockquote>And so religions, to a large extent, became divisive rather than unifying forces. Instead of bringing about an end of violence and hatred through a realisation of the fundamental oneness of all life, they brought more violence and hatred, more divisions between people as well as between different religions and even within the same religion. They became ideologies; belief systems people could identify with and so use them to enhance their false sense of self. Through them, they could make themselves Â“rightÂ” and others Â“wrongÂ” and thus define their identity through their enemies, the Â“others,Â” the Â“nonbelieversÂ” or Â“wrong believersÂ” who not infrequently they saw themselves justified in killing. Man made Â“GodÂ” in his own image. The eternal, the infinite, and unnameable was reduced to a mental idol that you had to believe in and worship as Â“my godÂ” or Â“our god.Â”</blockquote><blockquote>What is the role of the established religions in the arising of the new consciousness? Many people are already aware of the difference between spirituality and religion. They realise that having a belief system Â– a set of thoughts that you regard as the absolute truth Â– does not make you spiritual no matter what the nature of those beliefs is. In fact, the more you make your thoughts (beliefs) into your identity, the more cut off you are from the spiritual dimension within yourself. Many Â“religiousÂ” people are stuck at that level. They equate truth with thought, and as they are completely identified with thought (their mind), they claim to be in sole possession of the truth in an unconscious attempt to protect their identity. They donÂ’t realise the limitations of thought. Unless you believe (think) exactly as they do, you are wrong in their eyes, and in the not-too-distant past, they would have justified in killing you for that. And some still do, even now.</blockquote>Pls read the entire article there.</div>
