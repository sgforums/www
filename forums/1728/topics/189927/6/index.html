Whoever destroys, damages or defiles any place of worship, or any object held sacred by any class of persons, with the intention of thereby insulting the religion of any class of persons, or with the knowledge that any class of persons is likely to consider such destruction, damage or defilement as an insult to their religion, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.<br><br>Disturbing a religious assembly.<br>296. Whoever voluntarily causes disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.<br><br>Trespassing on burial places, etc.<br>297. Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby, commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sepulture or any place set apart for the performance of funeral rites, or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.<br><br>Uttering words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person.<br>298.

The law is old and has been in Singapore for a long time.<br><br>Regardless of age you still have to abide the law. There is no such thing as allowing criminals to go on due to his age and I do not care how old you are.</div>
