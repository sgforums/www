              dressed them and saw the family through their grief. It was part of the life of
              a Southern woman to do that. Being with the dying is the work of village
              women everywhere. The fact that my grandmother was comfort­ able with dying

In
              1970 I went to work at the University of Miami School of Medicine as a medical
              anthropologist. Dying people were basically ignored in hospital settings
              because they were a "lost cause." In 1972, I married 
              [psychiatrist and LSD researcher] Stanislav Grof, and we worked with people
              dying of cancer, using LSD as an adjunct to psychotherapy. I was inspired to be
              with people who were facing extreme situations. During the LSD sessions, I was
              usually lying on the couch with the dying person, holding him or her. Often I
              felt like a mother who was holding her suffering child or a child holding a
              dying parent.</span></p>

              1974, when I began working at Sloan-Kettering, and only now are we
              beginning to try to change that. As a student, there were times that I'd know
              one of my clients was dying, even if I was at home. I just had a sense about
              connecting with people in some way, talking to them—nobody had even mentioned
              that in the training. I was learning about what it was like to be with a person
              who was dying, that each death had a different energy and tempo and rhythm, and
              that it had nothing to do with what the doctors talked about in terms of
              prognosis. The people we were told would soon be released from the hospital
              often went into their own dying process, and died. And often ones who we were
              sure were going to go-they lived very long and healthy lives.</span></p>

              twenty-one years ago my husband was diagnosed with acute leukemia. It was
              really my first personal encounter with a death, and I realized I didn't have a
              clue what death was. I didn't have any spiritual belief at the time, or any
              images or concepts about death. All I could draw on was what I had learned in
              our society, which is that it is some­ thing very tragic and hopeless. And I
              said to my husband, "If that's all that death is, then we're just going to
              feel like victims of this illness and the rest of the time that you live, our
              lives will just be a sad story playing itself out." So we decided instead
              to view death as a gift in our lives. This view of death helped us get through
              the suffering of that year and find a deeper appreciation of life. By the time
              he died a year later, when we said our goodbyes, we had a feeling of
              "Thank you. I'm sorry for all the trouble that there's been, but at the
              same time, thank you for being there, and for this year, and for what we've
              learned together." And that allowed me to feel very peaceful at his death.</span></p>

              later, I joined a group of people in northern California who were starting a
              hospice program. Because of the positive aspects of my husband's death, I had a
              strong wish to give something back to others. I hoped I might help other people
              avoid some of the unnecessary suffering my husband and I went through during
              the year of his illness.</span></p>

              what we are "doing" is listening. Usually, we're not doing guided
              visualizations. We're not giving advice. We're not doing psychotherapy. We're
              not administering medications. We are being present. And that presence requires
              listening—to what is said, what isn't said, even to silence. One person I
              worked with, a very wonderful man, had just gotten discharged from the hospital
              and he said, "Thirty, forty, fifty people come see me in a typical
              hospital day, asking me questions. Not one person sat in silence with me, and
              that's all I wanted. Just somebody to be with me." That's our true work.
              It's not applying fancy meditative technologies. It's practicing radical
              optimism. In this work, you need to be fearless. And that's what we give: no
              fear.</span></p>

              try to be myself, which is usually pretty fearless, and I think that provides
              some comfort to people. I work with respecting them and making a lot of eye
              contact and trying to remind them of their qualities and strengths and really
              encourage them to find out who they are before they go. I think that helps fear
              go away. Of course, believing in themselves is work that they have to do on
              their own. But I think seeing and paying attention to them helps someone who's

              what teaches us what we need to say or pay attention to. There are so many ways

              use therapeutic touch. Or I may<em> </em>encourage friends and family to come in.
              Basically, I'm trying to read what the person is saying on so many subtle
              levels of their being, whether it's in the intonation of their voice, their

              pain medication. Fear often comes from not feeling safe, not feeling accepted
              or loved, not being connected genuinely to anyone or anything. Even for someone
              with no spiritual beliefs, the bottom line, as the teachings say, is to help

              trying chemotherapy and radiation as long as they can. Hospice is not a death
              sentence. It doesn't have to be "this means the treatments aren't

              be nicer to have more time with them to get to know them better and to make
