              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">BANGKOK<span><span style="color: #222222;"> </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">— If military government takes no action –<span><span style="color: #222222;"> </span></span>or
              the wrong action – against the controversial abbot of the powerful
              Dhammakaya Buddhist sect, it could become a threat to the junta, said a
              prominent defector who spent nearly 20 years in the order.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Speaking at a discussion on Buddhism and politics nearly shut
              down by the authorities, Mano Mettanando Laohavanich said the organization in
              which he once served as a senior monk poses an existential threat to the junta
              known as the National Council for Peace and Order, or NCPO.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“If the NCPO doesn’t do anything, this will become a threat
              to the military junta,” Mano, a lecturer at Thammasat University’s Chulabhorn
              International College of Medicine, told the audience Wednesday evening at the
              Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Wanted by the Department of Special Investigation on charges
              of accepting embezzled funds, Abbot Dhammachayo became a fugitive from justice
              when he failed to appear in response to a warrant issued for his arrest. An
              attempt by police to take him into custody last week ended quickly when his
              disciples blocked officers. The temple has said Dhammachayo is ill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Mano, who was a Dhammakaya monk for 19 years before leaving
              in 1999, warned that a covert operation to capture the abbot of “the largest
              [Buddhist] organization Thailand has ever seen not associated with the
              government” could turn bloody.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“If the government uses excessive force, the government will
              be victimized and this could lead to the end of the NCPO,” Mano said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The possibility of violence posed by sending commandos in at
              night is likely giving pause to junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“I think Mr. Prayuth is thinking hard whether he will invade
              the community compound. There will be bloodshed at night time. I think that is
              a dream and too risky for a fragile military.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Mano, who consulted with the DSI on its raid of the sprawling
              temple complex north of the capital, said any further raids should be conducted
              during the day and accompanied by journalists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Mano, who accused the abbot of proclaiming himself to be
              primordial Buddha, or even God, criticized the sect for being obsessed with
              attracting maximum donations from followers as well as storing weapons. At one
              point Mano even compared the sect’s organizational structures to Hitler’s Third
              Reich and more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“It’s like Star Wars together with The Matrix. When you have
              the two, you have Dhammakaya. Light and darkness. It must be true. And we live
              in the matrix.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Mano said he had been willing to sacrifice his life for the
              sect until he saw orders for weapons procurement and confronted the abbot about
              it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“He was trying to convince me he was primordial Buddha. He
              was God. I can work for a man but not God,” Mano said. “He wanted to conquer
              the world by creating the Vatican of Buddhism, Mecca of Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On Thursday, a temple spokesman wrote in response to a
              reporter’s inquiry that the discussion was one-sided opinion without basis in
              fact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“What was discussed … last night was criticism without any
              evidence or proof,” wrote Phra Pasura Dantamano, who said his views were his
              own and not those of the temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“Why do we have to respond to all these false claims made
              without evidence? If that is so, anyone can just say anything. [Sulak] is
              someone who has personal bias against every institution, including Dhammakaya,”
              he wrote. “The moderator asked the audience to make a defense because they did
              not invite any speakers from Dhammakaya. This is obvious proof that this was a
              one-sided panel.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">He went on to further criticize the club.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“I question the moral ethics and transparency of the FCCT for
              holding this panel. We would like to hear the response from the FCCT on these
              issues.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Event organizers said including a temple representative was
              just not possible as it would have guaranteed it being shut down by police. As
              it stands, the club had to change the scope and title of the event after
              authorities<span><span style="color: #222222;"> </span></span></span><a href="http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2016/06/17/religion-politics-not-discussed-junta-tells-press-club/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #9b0000;">said it should be
              canceled</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"> last week.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Regardless, speakers were told they could be held accountable
              if they were deemed to have broken any laws, according to club President Nirmal
              Ghosh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Speaking Wednesday, Mano, who studied theology at Oxford,
              said the standoff could continue for months if not years. He added that he
              doesn’t think Dhammakhaya could survive post-Dhammachayo, who is 72, as it’s a
              “a cult of one person.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Another speaker, Buddhist scholar Sulak Sivaraksa, described
              Dhammachayo as “evil,” and tainted by links to fugitive former premier Thaksin
              Shinawatra, who </span><a href="http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/06/12/yellow-red-seen-orange-folds-dhammakaya-scandal/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #9b0000;">supported the temple</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“The man is evil,” said Sulak.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">He also lashed out at junta leader Prayuth for not taking decisive
              action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“They’re just like puppies,” Sulak said. He then turned to
              the plainclothes officers  monitoring the talk and instructed them to tell
              their commander, “Your boss is bloody no good.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Vichak Panich, a meditation instructor and panelist however
              discounted fears of the Dhammkaya as emblematic of the fears harbored by the
              cultural establishment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“If you think differently from the status quo, they will say
              you were hired by Thaksin,” Vichak said.</span></p>
