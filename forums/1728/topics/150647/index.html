Amnesia affects the human brain not the transcended Mind, the Buddha Mind.<br><br>Another twist to the original question:<br>When Buddha died, did he cease to be a Buddha? Did his Buddha nature die with him? The answer is obvious!<br><br>It depends at what point amnesia happens to ther person.<br><br>If it happens after he was enlightened, he would have realised enlightenment anyway.<br><br>If it happens while trying to attain enlightenment, his efforts will have been wasted, but because he is on the right karman path, he will get another chance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is that so?<br><br>I have a Taiwanese dharma teacher (my master's dharma successor) who had to go through hospital operations. Because of his practise, no anesthetic could affect him. He got twice the usual dose, usually one dose is enough to make a person unconscious. However, he remains fully conscious. He told the doctors and nurses that no amount of anesthetic could make him unconscious, so go ahead with the operation. The whole operation went ahead with him fully conscious, observing everything that happened in the hospital.<br><br>Another similar true story of the 16th Karmapa who died in 1981:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As death approached, he had taken a half-dozen deadly diseases upon himself. Using his yogic power, he removed much of their harmfulness, at least for those in his powerfield. He also allowed the physicians to test their medicines on him. Some of their findings were amazing: even the highest doses of sedatives had absolutely no effect on him. He cared for their well-being and never talked about himself.<br><br>On the evening of November 5th, the day of Liberatrice, the doctors had routinely entered his room. Seeing that his machines had apparently turned themselves off, all had the same thought, "He's playing a joke on us." At the very moment, they started up again, worked for five minutes and then stopped completely. The next morning, when the staff wanted to remove his body from the bed, the lineage holders asked if all signs of death were present. They were not. Karmapa's body was still warm and supple, and especially his heart center was so hot that one could feel it at a good distance. This is how he stayed.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.karmapa.org/history/karmapa_16/16ka3_9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.karmapa.org/history/karmapa_16/16ka3_9.htm</a><br><br>Sometimes, persons with high level of cultivation can go beyond these.</div>
