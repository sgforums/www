            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is good as its worshippers do not believe in a creator or so called god unlike some religion like christianality .<br><br>secondly , it encourages a vegetarian life which also promote gd health . Eating meat is also sinful .<br><br>thirdly , meditation and chanting reduces stress and anxiety , keeping my mind clear . An unclear mind cannot think rationally .<br><br>Fourthly , it discourages ppl from commiting sins .<br><br>It also discourage ppl from drinking alcoholic drinks , gamble or engaged in prositution .<br><br>I will certainly chose buddhism .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Venerable Shravasti Dhammika gave a very good answer...<br><br>No Buddhist who understands the Buddha's teaching thinks that other religions are wrong. No one who, has made a genuine effort to examine other religions with an open mind could think like that either. The first thing you notice when you study the different religions is just how much they have in common. All religions acknowledge that man's present state is unsatisfactory. All believe that a change of attitude and behaviours is needed if man's situation is to improve. All teach an ethics that includes love, kindness, patience, generosity and social responsibility and all accept the existence of some form of Absolute. They use different languages, different names and different symbols to describe and explain these things; and it is only when they narrowÂ­mindedly cling to their one way of seeing things that religious intolerance, pride and selfÂ­righteousness arise.<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br><br>Imagine an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Chinese and an Indonesian all looking at a cup. The Englishman says, <span style="color: blue;">"That's a cup"</span>. The Frenchman answers, "No it's not. <span style="color: blue;">It's a tasse</span>". The Chinese comments, You're both wrong. <span style="color: blue;">It's a pet". </span>And the Indonesian laughs at the others and says "What fools you are. <span style="color: blue;">It's a cawan." </span>The Englishman gets a dictionary and shows it to the others saying, "I can prove that it is a cup. My dictionary says so". "Then your dictionary is wrong", says the FrenchÂ­man "because my dictionary clearly says it is a tasse". The Chinese scoffs at them. "My dictionary is thousands of years older than yours, so my dictionary must be right. And besides, more people speak Chinese than any other language, so it must be a pet". While they are squabbling and arguing with each other, <strong>a Buddhist comes up and drinks from the cup. After he has drunk, he says to the others,</strong> <span style="color: blue;">"Whether you call it a cup, a tasse, a pet or a cawan, the purpose of the cup is to be used. Stop arguing and drink, stop squabbling and refresh your thirst"</span>. <strong>This is the Buddhist attitude to other religions</strong>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My own opinion, correct me if i am wrong. i attended to christian meetings few years back, being pulled by my friend. i think christians are obessed and idolizes, more than they understand the teachings. the way they pray confirm my discomfort. its not that i dislike them. i also respect their religion. But some can be rude towards other religions and beliefs.<br>my finance is a christian.  try to avoid touching on these issues, cos we always end up quarreling.<br>what i trying to say is that we may have different beliefs, but we can always live in harmony if we can respect one another.</div>
