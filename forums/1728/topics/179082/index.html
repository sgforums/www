            <div class='col-md body'>Hello again, good pple of the ~ Buddhism : Wisdom Bliss ~ forum,<br><br>Because Buddhism is a philosophy rather than a religion, not everyone here may be interested in discussions such as the Creationism vs Darwinsim debate. However, for those interested, here is my view :<br><br>If you agree with me, I always tell people that there's no such thing as the 'supernatural', because everthing that happens or exists, is actually part of Nature - just because human science on Earth is not yet ready to understand it fully doesn't make it any less natural. Or if you prefer, we could also say that everything is supernatural, because Nature is super.<br><br>Researcher, author and lectuter Lloyd Pye, the man behind the Intervention Theory (which states that the only possible explanation covering the flaws of both the Creationism and Darwinism theories, is ExtraTerrestrial Intervention), had his article titled "Darwinism : A Crumbling Theory" published in Nexus Magazine, Volume 10, Number 1 (Dec 02 - Jan 03).<br><br>You can read his article mirrored here on my website :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Darwinism" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Darwinism</a><br><br>Lloyd Pye's Intervention Theory website :<br><a href="http://www.lloydpye.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lloydpye.com/</a><br><br>Lloyd Pye's Starchild Skull website :<br><a href="http://www.starchildproject.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.starchildproject.com/</a><br><br>(Note : The Starchild skull, currently in the possession of Lloyd Pye, is believed to be an actual skull of an alien-human hybrid. Visit his website for more informaton.)<br><br>Regarding this topic of the nature of Human Evolution then, I have posted on this on both the Astral Pulse forum (<a href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22128" rel="nofollow">http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22128</a>) and on the Afterlife Knowledge Forum (<a href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=afterlife_knowledge;action=display;num=1140003630;start=15#22" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=afterlife_knowledge;action=display;num=1140003630;start=15#22</a>).

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i find it hard to swallow that intervention theory is probable. why?<br><br>1) based on the DNA test on the sample extracted from the starchild skull, it shows that the mitochondrial DNA is exactly the same as Native Americans. this implies that even if aliens do exist, at the point of the alien's sperm fertilizing the egg, the human species is already developed because the mitochondrial DNA sequence is identical to modern human.<br><br>2) interspecies marriage is not very probable to lead to a successful birth of a baby. it is because the number of chromosomes in the maternal and paternal gametes must be identical for it to happen. while it has been shown in the lab that even if the egg and the sperm have different number of chromosomes, the sperm still can fertilize the egg, but it will also end up in miscarriage, that is, the embryo never succeed to be concieved to full term. that is why human and its closest species, chimpanzees, even cannot have a baby together.<br><br>3) let's assume that both alien and human have same number of chromosome, so (2) is now void. it is still even more hard to be convinced that an alien from outer space could evolve until it is identical to the human species on Earth. this process of convergent evolution is unbelievable!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW Kyo, maybe you have not known, but Buddha also expounded on the origination of humans.<br><br>See the topic in our forum: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=152581" rel="nofollow">The Earth People: Genesis in Buddhism</a><br><br>Basically, human kind originated from one of the Jhana planes. Jhana planes are the higher 'celestial planes' and consists of 8 levels, 4 Form and 4 Formless. By practising meditation and reaching the Jhanas-absorption, one will therefore be able to be born in these higher planes in the subsequent lifetime. However this is not ultimate, because reaching the higher planes <strong>is not enlightenment nor liberation</strong>.<br><br>Humanity originated from the 2nd Form Jhana planes... in this plane the Brahmas do not speak verbally, but they communicate by emitting certain light/aura. This is how their message gets across. Therefore they are called the 'Light-Sound Heaven'. Initially when they attained the physical form of the human after consuming certain things, they do not have sexual difference. It is a latter development.<br><br>See how Buddha expounded Evolution: <a href="http://www.webcastmy.com.my/bodhivision/aganna/lesson3/pt3.htm" rel="nofollow"><br>Lesson 3: Development of Life</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think buddhism is quite happy with the theory of evolution. In fact Buddhist philosophy actually requires evolution to take place -  all things are seen as being transient, constantly becoming, existing for a while and then fading.  The idea of unchanging species would not be compatible with Buddhist ontology<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
