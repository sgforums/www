              <p>I think there is a possibility though not 100% perfect. But it may be attributed to previous lives contact with dharma.</p>
              <p>I hv personally witness one person who has never read buddhism before but practice yoga and Taoist meditation, while trying to find escape from suffering, he came out with suffering, cause is suffering and solution to prevent suffering, although system is not complete like eightfold path. Sure as he practice down the road he did not meet perfection and now using eightfold path system.</p>
              <p>Looking for the way due to suffering, I think is logic thinking. Probably in the field if psychology there are thinkers along same line, but of course the system is not complete as Buddha teaching.</p>

              <p>there was a discussion on what is one-pointed mind and query whether, if one person attain one pointed mindfulness is it close to Enlightenment. the Theravada is inclined toward saying yes. it is like a person walking a tie rope, he need to "balance" his mind, be focus yet not too focus. not focus will fall, too focus on his feet will also fall.</p>
              <p>then a Vajrayana person argued that a sniper can also be said to have one-pointed mind when targeting to kill.  is that Right? HHDL said the first motivation and or aspiration or morality is more important.</p>
              <p>so have to ask the aim/aspiration of the person who has never read buddhism before but practice yoga and Taoist meditation</p>

              <p>Ramana Maharshi's path is not the same as Buddha's eightfold path, as his View is based on Self-View - the view of an ultimate Self or Brahman. That would be considered the wrong view in Buddhism. And as we know, Right View is taught to be the forerunner of the noble eightfold path. With right view comes all the other 'rights' up to right mindfulness and right concentration.<br><br>Also in my experience, there can be no release if the view causes clinging. After I realized I AMness, there is clinging to the formless infinite pure consciousness as Self and the practice is always to sustain and cling to it for all day and night. In Buddhism, any kind of clinging will cause samsara. It can lead to rebirth in formless planes for a long time but it is not Nirvana. The Hindus see the realization of Atman-Brahman as their liberation, but not Buddhism.<br><br>For the purpose of realizing I AMness (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a> , <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html</a>) however I will recommend reading Ramana Maharshi's work. I passed my Ramana Maharshi's book to a self-inquiry practitioner some time back and encouraged him to practice it.<br><br><br><span><span><span>"</span><span>In
                           the AlagaddÅ«pama Sutta (MN.22), the Buddha framed a discussion with 
                          bhikkhus on a set of ‘six positions on views’ (chayimÄ�ni … 
                          diá¹­á¹­hiá¹­á¹­hÄ�nÄ�ni) that were held by the untaught commoner (assutavÄ� 
                          puthujjano), and through this discussion leveled a sweeping refutation 
                          of the of the Upaniá¹£adic theory of Ä€tman, Brahman Absolute or ‘The All 
                          is Brahman … this self of mine in the heart, that is Brahman’ ‘sarvam 
                          khalv idaá¹ƒ brahma … eá¹£a ma Ä�tmÄ�ntar há¹›daye etad brahma’ (CU. III, 14:1 
                          &amp; 4). MN.22 was specifically punning on YÄ�jñavalkya’s view in 
                          Bá¹›had-Ä�raá¹‡yaka Upaniá¹£ad, IV, 5.6.</span><br><br><span>With
                           reference to this case example and others, K.R. Norman and R.F. 
                          Gombrich have soundly argued that the Buddha and his followers were well
                           aware of the brÄ�hmaá¹‡a culture of the time, and that the attÄ� he was 
                          refuting as nonexistent (asat) is the dogma of Ä�tman just as we find it 
                          in the Upaniá¹£ads. "</span></span></span></p>
