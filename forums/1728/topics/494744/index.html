              A Visit to Xuanzhong Monastery</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Guoying Stacy Zhang
              Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-09-22 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to the major sutras of Pure Land Buddhism, the Larger Sukhavativyuha and the Smaller
              Sukhavativyuha, Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land (Skt. Sukhavati) lies beyond 10
              billion Buddha-lands west of our World of Endurance. Having been fully
              developed from the mid-6th to the early 9th centuries, the belief in rebirth in
              such a place and the recitation of Amitabha’s name to achieve this goal became
              central to Pure Land Buddhism, serving as an expedient for the meditative path
              to enlightenment or even as a method of equal importance since the Ming dynasty
              (1368–1644). To better understand the nature of the Pure Land and how it is
              related to the world in which we sentient beings live, I visited one of the
              birthplaces of Pure Land Buddhism—Xuanzhong Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">çŽ„ä¸­å¯º</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">) in Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              its establishment in 472, Xuanzhong Monastery has stood on the same site in the
              Shibi Mountains, remote and secluded. Three patriarchs of the Pure Land school,
              Tan Luan (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">æ›‡é¸ž</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">,
              476–542), Dao Chuo (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">é�“ç¶½</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, 562–645), and Shan Dao (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å–„å°Ž</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, 613–81), resided and spread the teachings there. For
              this reason, Xuanzhong Monastery received continuous imperial patronage during
              the Tang dynasty (618–907). When Kublai Khan ruled China, he also granted the
              monastery imperial protection. Khan’s edict, inscribed in stone in both Chinese
              and the ‘Phags-pa script,* has been well preserved in the monastery’s stele
              collection. Today, Xuanzhong Monastery is lauded as an ancestral court by Pure
              Land Buddhists in China, as well as by followers of Jodo Shu and Jodo
              Shinshu—two Pure Land sects in Japan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During
              my stay at Xuanzhong Monastery, I was warmly received by Venerable Wufeng (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">æ‚Ÿå³°</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">). He has been the acting
              abbot since the passing of the former abbot Venerable Master Gentong (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">æ ¹é€š</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">, 1928–2015), who was born
              in Guandong Province, and later became an influential Buddhist leader in Shanxi
              Province and the seventh vice director of the Chinese Buddhist Association.
              Venerable Wufeng is from Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang Uyghur
              Autonomous Region. In his teens, his interest in Buddhism was ignited by the
              1982 film The Shaolin Temple, and he was determined to become a kung fu master
              to benefit the world. However, during his initial monastic life at the Shaolin
              Temple, Venerable Wufeng realized that his desire to learn kung fu was driven
              by fame and self-interest, and he became convinced that true happiness and
              perfection cannot be achieved by combat, but rather, by wisdom. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nowadays,
              success is usually measured by action and tangible outcome. For those
              unfamiliar with Buddhism, it may be difficult to comprehend how the monastic
              sangha can contribute to the world while choosing to withdraw from it. “It is
              true that at the turn of the 20th century—a time of turmoil in China—many
              sangha members either focused on self-cultivation or on performing rituals for
              the dead,” Venerable Wufeng explained. “As a response, Venerable Master Taixu
              (1890–1947) pioneered the idea of Humanistic Buddhism, calling on sangha
              members to construct a Pure Land on Earth by engaging with society, integrating
              Buddhist teachings into everyday life, and guiding people in good conduct, mind
              purification, and spiritual cultivation.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              effort to build a Pure Land on Earth is in every way compatible with faith in
              Amitabha’s Pure Land. While clearing defilements from their minds and from this
              world, Pure Land Buddhists long for an even better place—a perfect and
              magnificent realm free of suffering. On the surface, Amitabha’s Pure Land in
              Mahayana Buddhism and Heaven in Christianity may sound similar: both are of a
              metaphorical nature, describing a state of consciousness or condition of
              existence. Nevertheless, they reflect two fundamentally different tenets of
              cosmology and soteriology. “For instance,” Venerable Wufeng clarified, “in
              Buddhism, heaven is yet found in the six realms of samsara, but Pure Land is
              beyond that, transcending the cycle of rebirth. Moreover, in the Christian
              Heaven, each being is a subject of God, while in the Buddhist Pure Land, each
              being becomes a Buddha themselves, possessing the same virtue and capacity as
              the Buddha.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              one hand, the path to Amitabha’s Pure Land lies in the merit gained from this
              life and our past lives. On the other, as Venerable Wufeng elucidates, the
              vision of Amitabha’s Pure Land makes us less attached to this world. In the
              Buddhist view, all wars and killing originate from nothing but human
              selfishness. Venerable Wufeng commented, “Kings and warriors are heroes because
              they conquer others. The members of the Buddhist sangha are sages because they
              conquer themselves. They are masters of their own minds, so they are able to
              spread wisdom and compassion, benefiting others in a selfless way.” Indeed,
              since the beginning of the 20th century, Xuanzhong Monastery has played an
              instrumental role in Sino-Japan relations. During the Second World War,
              Venerable Ekei Sugawara (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">è�…åŽŸæ�µæ…¶</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">), a Pure Land master from Japan, traveled to
              Xuanzhong Monastery to pay homage. Having devoted the rest of his life to the
              research and promotion of Pure Land Buddhism, his ashes were buried at
              Xuanzhong Monastery at his request. This gesture was not just a religious
              statement, but also one for world peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Chinese
              Buddhism developed the concept of various Pure Lands, such as Maitreya’s
              Tusita, Bhaisajyaguru’s Vaiduryanirbhasa, and Vairocana’s Padmagarbha, all
              expressing a general goal of rebirth in an ideal place. However, Amitabha’s
              Pure Land became the most popular, thanks to the nianfo (</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å¿µä½›</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">), the method of reciting
              Amitabha’s name devised by the Pure Land school patriarchs. It is so
              approachable that even the least enlightened person can recite “Namo Amituofo”
              for salvation anytime and anywhere. Today, “Amituofo” has become a greeting
              among Buddhists in China, regardless of the Buddhist tradition one is
              affiliated with. You could be facing a layman, a Chan master, or even a Tibetan
              lama, and as soon as you start a conversation with “Amituofo” and joined palms,
              you already have their goodwill and trust. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;" lang="EN-US">“</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Reciting the
              name of Amitabha can be compared to using a point-and-shoot camera. It looks
              simple, but it has all the necessary functions. This method is like a small
              spring, and ultimately it flows into the ocean of Buddhist teachings”,
              Venerable Wufeng explained to me. Apart from merely reciting Amitabha’s name,
              there are another three nianfo methods for people of different meditative and
              spiritual capacities, namely reciting the name of Amitabha in front of his
              image, reciting the name of Amitabha while visualizing his image, and reciting
              the ultimate essence of Amitabha.** According to Venerable Wufeng, in the
              practice of the last nianfo method, one experiences the merging of Amitabha’s
              name being recited and the mind that recites Amitabha’s name. He elaborated:
              “If Amitabha’s name is snow, the ultimate essence of Amitabha is water, as snow
              melts into water; if Amitabha’s name is floating clouds, the ultimate essence
              of Amitabha is void, as clouds disappear into the void. Through this method,
              one sees Buddha nature (Skt. tathagatagarbha) and the Buddha’s true body (Skt.
              dharmakaya). The method itself is Chan, is esoteric knowledge.”</span></p>
