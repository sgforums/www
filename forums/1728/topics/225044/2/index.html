Just as you would not be conscious of space if there were no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: "If there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment." It is through the world and ultimately through you that the Unmanifested knows itself. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold.

I want to spread the Dharma for the benefit of all sentient beings. I want to devote myself to Buddhism, practise BuddhaÂ’s teachings and follow the Bodhisattva path. This is my purpose in life.<br><br>Some people have no desire to be good, they want to steal or rob. If you ask him about his purpose of life, he will tell you life is meaningful if he can strike a "big one", or continue with his sinful ways. Then, there are those who are capable of earning money, and they would say, "I want to be the richest person in the world." These to them are very meaningful. Many people who are well off have no desire to be engaged in useful employment. I have been told of a very rich lady who travelled from country to country to "beg" for money. In reality she was already a multi-millionaire. Ask her what is her interest in life, and she would say she enjoys begging.<br><br>So, what kind of life is meaningful? Human beings have one common objective, and that is living. But to live meaningfully, we must pursue bliss. I believe that is also our common objective. What Buddhism teaches is a bliss culture, so let us promote this bliss culture so that everyone can achieve bliss and happiness. Thus, I feel that only a life that seeks bliss and happiness is truly meaningful.</blockquote></div>
