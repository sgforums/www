You already know how to practise but it is difficult to maintain mindfulness all the time so it is not so simple. One needs the right effort to practise it consistently and also do meditation to gain strength. Secondly it'll be good if you can practise meditation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking i think you see too much tv show . And besides , even if you were given those powers , i doubt you know when or how to use them appropriately . Powers are like money , the more desperate you are for getting them , the easier corrupted you may get . Improper use of them may cause more trouble to pple then is beneficial to you , ever heard of the saying " a contented person is a happy person " , a person who is never satisfied will never be happy for long . Quit hankering after so called supernatural powers as it may not be a good thing to have them . So what if you can see pples or even your own past life ? What can you do even if you were to know ? Sometimes ignorance is bliss as knowing too much may bring you unwanted " burden " or even trauma . Why do you want to control pple ? This alone shows that you're really interested into buddhism but rather is to get powers to show off or even getting revenge . I suggest you try to get a peacefull and quiet mind before " jumping " into any religion to get any so called " powers " that you heard of in tv or anywhere .</div>

Quit hankering after so called supernatural powers as it may not be a good thing to have them . So what if you can see pples or even your own past life ? What can you do even if you were to know ? Sometimes ignorance is bliss as knowing too much may bring you unwanted " burden " or even trauma . Why do you want to control pple ? This alone shows that you're really interested into buddhism but rather is to get powers to show off or even getting revenge . I suggest you try to get a peacefull and quiet mind before " jumping " into any religion to get any so called " powers " that you heard of in tv or anywhere .</div></blockquote>it's ok, i just want a taste of them and i'll get bored of them very easily.</div>

In Buddhism we do not purposely cultivate special yogic techniques just to gain supernatural powers. Buddha saw it as purposeless. We should not cultivate the externalists' way, but the Buddhist way.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html</a><br><br>One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tinhla01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tinhla01.htm</a><br><br>It must, however, be understood that the Buddha did not consider every trance to be necessarily good, for it must aim at the right end. He, however, realised that there were those who devoted to yogic exercises to acquire supernatural powers. So the Buddha refined the practice by telling them that even such powers could be acquired only through the practice of righteouaness and wisdom. ( Akankheyya Sutta, S. B. E. Vol. XI, ) Acquisition of supernatural powers does not confer any spiritual advantage. It was for this reason that the Buddha forbade his disciples to work miracles for display.</blockquote>Anyway you mentioned omnipotent. Not anyone, even the Buddha, is omnipotent. This is because the Buddha cannot simply just interfere with our karma and grant us enlightenment. If they are able to, then all sentient beings would be enlightened by now. They can only teach, and guide us.<br><br>But omniscience is possible. It is through chan2 ding4.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no such thing as just to have a taste of them so i take it as you are just curious over how it feels to have those powers , when you have some powers , you will always feel tempted to use them every now and then . Haste makes waste , the more eager you are to attain enlightenment , the further you are away from it . i recomend you to study some basic teachings of buddhism or even tao te jing if you want , then spend some time to think about what it actually means and how to apply it into your everyday life rather then just to know those teachings and preach ard like some learned pple or even jump into deeper teachings like sutras , etc without getting a proper foundations for it as you may misintepret the actuall meaning of it .</div>
