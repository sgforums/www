            <div class='col-md body'>there are so many other racial and cultures and religions in a country, if apply religious views with politics, think it might not look fair to others. perhaps some might say they use rojak religious values all mix together to politics or ruling a country, but again, there will not be smooth agreeement because some may like this some like that, some don't like this and that.<br><br>if it is with no "label" that works towards serving a political agreement or compromise that serves to benefit people, then perhaps things might have a good chance to work out well. the key perhaps is common sense and harmony.<br><br>but first we still have to get the basics correctly.<br><br>well, just a cent worth of thought.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for the response.<br><br>I'm quite disappointed by the lack of reference to local (singapore) politics in this discussion. I presume most are still unaware of the happenings, esp during the elections period. There is much injustic occuring at the national level. Sometimes when I encounter ppl who are being left out of the system, my heart goes out to them. But I reckon that as long as the bulk of sporeans remain apathetic to local politics, this will just go on and on.<br><br>Sometimes when I pay tax, I do not know if my money will go out to helping Burmese druglords in their blood money. If this claim is true, Spore will only suffer from collective karma in a matter of time.<br><br>I have the privilege to meet some of the more awakened and motivated Sporeans, some of them very religious, who believe in common progress for all. Buddhism is a logical religion. It encourages logical undertstanding and reasoning. I hope more more Bodhisattvas can come up and fight for the welfare and progress of this society at a higher level. Let the truth empower the ppl of spore<br><br></div>

U made some observant remarks too.<br><br>Any system in this world is never perfect, complete. Which is why the Buddha mentions Dukha. Being so, similarly no political system is perfect and comprehensive. But that doesnt mean we should not improve on existing situations.<br><br>Lord Buddha did mention a way for the world. A solution that would center on mankind, his environment and society. This is the path of the Middle Way, noble 8-foldpath. By ensuring a good balance of all things in life, progress can be made.<br><br>This country is severely displaced and inbalanced. We have gross 1-sided views (Thanks to our 140th Straits Times) and the opression caused by elitism and money politics.  Despite all that I believe that no man is evil. All we need is a gradual awakening, one and all, to bring back progress and happiness for the nation.</div>
