              <p>Buddhism is a great religion which enlightened humanity twenty-five centuries ago and released from all bondages, superstitious practices. It is a scientific religion. Gotama the Buddha is honoured today by every cultured and intelectual man irrespective of whatever religion he may profess, while the founders of most of the other religions are honoured only by their followers. Not only those who belong to some religions but also so-called free thinkers respect this world honoured Supreme Enlightened One. From the historical point of view there never lived any other Teacher who has ever given so much religious freedom as well as due credit to humanity. Before the advent of the Buddha, religion had been owned and monopolised only by a certain section of the society. The Buddha was the Teacher in history who indiscriminately opened the gate of religion to each and every man society. The Buddha has advised his followers to cultivate and develop the latent power of man and showed him how to make the best use of his willpower and intelligance without being a slave to an unknown being to find eternal hapiness which He proclaimed to the world through His own experience but not through therories, mere beliefs and traditional practices. His teaching is such that anyone can practise it without having any religious brand.</p>
              <p>To compile this book I have selected various statements made by eminent philosophers, scholars, historians, scientists, writers, religious dignitaries, social reformers and politicians who are well-known to the modern-world as most intellectual people. Among them many are non-Buddhist and free thinkers. According to them, Buddhism is the most practical and rational religion which will apeal to scientific knowledge and which really can do a better service to mankind if the followers practise this religion properly.</p>
              <p>It therefore gives me great pleasure to present these valuable quotations extracted from various books and articles. Whatever may be the opinion of those who have given Buddhism the topmost place in the religious field, the compiler by quoting them, does not mean to belittle other religious beliefs, for the idea of publishing this book is not to show the superiority of Buddhism over other religions but on the contrary to reflect the unbiased views expressed by various intellectuals.</p>
              <p>All the captions to the statements in this book were given by the compiler.</p>

              <p><strong>THE BUDDHA</strong></p>
              <p>The Buddha?s greatness</p>
              <p>I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people known to history ? I think I should put Buddha above him in those respects. <em></em>Bertrand Russell<em>, " Why I am not a Christian"</em></p>
              <p>-</p>
              <p>Embodiment of virtues</p>
              <p>Buddha was the embodiment of all virtues he preached. During his successful and eventful ministry of 45 years he translated all his words into action; and in no place did he give vent to any human frailty, or any base passion. The Buddha?s moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known.</p>
              <p>- Prof. Max Muller, <em>German Scholar</em></p>
              <p>Blossom of the human tree</p>
              <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>This is the blossom on our human tree<br>Which opens in many a myriad years<br>But opened, fills the world with wisdom?s scent<br>And love?s dropped honey. </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
              <p>- Sir Edwin Arnold, <em>"Light of Asia"</em></p>
              <p>Buddha is nearer to us</p>
              <p>You see clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for light, a vivid human personality, not a myth. Beneath a mass of miraculous fable I feel that there also was a man. He too, gave a message to mankind universal in its character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to selfishness. Selfishness takes three forms ? one, the desire to satisfy the senses; second, the craving for immortality; and the third the desire for prosperity and worldliness. Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself.</p>
              <p>Then he merges into a great being. Buddha in a different language called men to self-forgetfulness five hundred years before Christ. In some ways he was nearer to us and our needs. Buddha was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ, and less ambiguous upon the queation of personal immortality.</p>
              <p>- H.G. Wells</p>
              <p>Most Noble of Mankind</p>
              <p>If you desire to see the most noble of mankind, look at the king in beggar?s clothing; it is he whose sanctity is great among men.</p>
              <p>- Abdul Atahiya, <em>A Muslim Poet</em></p>
              <p>Buddha?s Method</p>
              <p>If any question has to be considered, it has to be considered peacefully and democratically in the way taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>- Nehru</p>
              <p>Lunatic and a Sane Man</p>
              <p>The difference between the Buddha and an ordinary man is like the difference between a sane man and a lunatic</p>
              <p>- A writer</p>
              <p>Homage to Buddha</p>
              <p>Lord Buddha could be very easily singled out as the one person known to man who received homage from the greatest number of mankind.</p>
              <p>-Prof. Saunders, <em>Literary Secretary Y.M.C.A.</em> <em>India, Burma, Ceylon</em></p>
              <p>Buddha?s Message</p>
              <p>The Buddha has been something greater than all doctrine and dogma, and his eternal message has thrilled humanity through the ages. Perhaps at no time in past history was his message of peace more needed for a suffering and distracted humanity than it is today.</p>
              <p>- Nehru</p>
              <p>Negative Answer of The Buddha</p>
              <p>If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say ?no?; if we ask whether the electron?s position changes with time, we must say ?no?; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say ?no?. The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man?s self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.</p>
              <p>- J. Robert Oppenheimer</p>
              <p>We are impressed by His spirit of Reason</p>
              <p>When we read Buddha?s discourses, we are impressed by his spirit of reason. His ethical path has for its first step right views, a rational outlook. He endeavours to brush aside all cobwebs that interfere with mankind?s vision of itself and its destiny.</p>
              <p>- Dr. S Radhakrishnan,<em>"Gautama The Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>Cool Head and Loving Heart</p>
              <p>The most striking thing about the Buddha is almost a unique combination of a cool scientific head and profound sympathy of a warm and loving heart. The world today turns more and more towards the Buddha, for he alone represents the consience of humanity.</p>
              <p>- Moni Bagghee,<em>"Our Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>Philosophic genius</p>
              <p>The Buddha was a pioneer as a lover of men, and a philosophic genius rolled into a single vigorous and radiant personality. He had things to say that no man or woman, after 2500 years of bustling and hustling and chattering round the fountain of knowledge, can afford to ignore. Greater perhaps than his wisdom was the example he set.</p>
              <p>-Moni Bagghee,<em>"Our Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>He does not speak of sin</p>
              <p>Serenity of spirit and love for all sentient creation are enjoined by the Buddha. He does not speak of sin, but only of ignorance and foolishness which could be cured by enlightenment and sympathy.</p>
              <p>- Dr. S Radhakrisnan,<em>"Gautama the Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>Buddha is like a physician</p>
              <p>The Buddha is like a physician. Just as a doctor must know the diagnosis of the different kinds of illness, their causes, the antidotes and remedies, and must be able to apply them, so also the Buddha has taught the Four Holy Truths which indicate the range of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the way which lead to its cessation.</p>
              <p>- Dr. Edward Conze,<em>"Buddhism"</em></p>
              <p>Buddha is for whole mankind</p>
              <p>The Buddha is not a property of Buddhists only. He is the property of whole mankind. His teaching is common to everybody. Every religion, which came into existence after the Buddha, has borrowed many good ideas from the Buddha.</p>
              <p>- A Muslim Scholar</p>
              <p>A Wise Father</p>
              <p>Buddha is one who sees his children playing in the consuming fire of worldliness and employs different expedients to bring them out of this burning house and lead them to the safe asylum of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>- Prof.Lakshimi Nasaru, <em>"The Essence of Buddhism"</em></p>
              <p>Buddha is the way</p>
              <p>I feel more and more that Sakyamuni is the nearest in character and effect to Him who is the Way, the Truth, and The Life.</p>
              <p>- Bishop Milman</p>
              <p>A Radiant Sun</p>
              <p>In this world of storm and strife, hatred and violence, the message of the Buddha shines like a radiant sun. Perhaps at no time was that message more needed than in the world of atomic and hydrogen bombs. Two thousand five hundred years have only added to the vitality and truth of that message. Let us remember that immortal message and try to fashion our thoughts and actions in the light of the teaching. We may face with equanimity even the terrors of the atomic bomb age and help a little in promoting right thinking and right action.</p>
              <p>- Nehru</p>
              <p>Greatest man ever born</p>
              <p>Here is a teaching we can follow with confidence. Where in the world of religions, cults and creeds, can we find a master of such brilliance? In a pageant of stars he was a giant of the greatest magnitude. Little wonder that scientists, philosophers, and men of literature have proclaimed Him ?the Greatest man ever born?. The radiance of this great teacher goes through a world of suffering and darkness, like a beacon light to guide and illuminate mankind.</p>

              <p><strong>BUDDHISM</strong></p>
              <p>Fundamental Teachings of The Buddha</p>
              <p>Gentleness, serenity, compasion, through liberation from selfish-craving - are the fundamental teachings of the great Oriental religion of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>- E.A.Burtt, <em>"The Compassionate Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>Well Built Bridge</p>
              <p>Buddha Dharma is like a bridge well built of flexible steel, it gives a little to wind and water, it adapts itself to changing circumstances, but at the same time it has secured foundations and offers a safe way to the Deathless, to Nirvana.</p>
              <p>- Phra Khantipalo,<em>"Tolerance"</em></p>
              <p>To Awake the Human Heart</p>
              <p>Surely the mysteriously East, that fertile mother of religions, has given us in Buddhism a true revelation, since it makes known to us the moral beauty and purity that lies in the deep of human nature needing no other divinity than that which abides in the human heart to awake them into living glory.</p>
              <p>- Charles T.Gorham</p>
              <p>Nothing to Surpass Buddhism</p>
              <p>Buddhist or not Buddhist, I have examined everyone of the great religious systems of the world, and in none of them have I found anything to surpass, in beauty and comprehensiveness, the Noble Eightford Path and the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha. I am content to shape my life according to that path.</p>
              <p>- Prof. Rhys Davids</p>
              <p>Buddhism does not leas us to a Fool?s Paradise</p>
              <p>Buddhism is realistic, for it takes a realistic view of life and the world. It does not falsely pull us into living in a fool?s paradis, nor does it frighten and agonize us with all kinds of imaginary fears and guilt-feelings. It calls us exactly and objectively what we are and what the world around us is, and shows us the way to perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness.</p>
              <p>- Ven. Dr. W. Rahula</p>
              <p>The Buddha?s Mission</p>
              <p>The mission of the Buddha was quite unique in it?s character, and therefore it stands quite apart from the many other religions of the world. His mission was to bring the birds of idealism flying in the air nearer to the earth, because the food for their bodies belonged to the earth.</p>
              <p>- Hazrat Inayat Khan,<em>"The Sufi Message"</em></p>
              <p>A cosmic religion</p>
              <p>The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description.</p>
              <p>- Albert Einstein</p>
              <p>Buddhism will remain unaffected</p>
              <p>The doctrines of Buddha Dhamma stand today, as unaffected by the march of time and the expansion of knowledge as when they were first enunciated. No matter to what lengths increase scientific knowledge can extend man?s mental horizon, within the frame work of the Dhamma there is room for the acceptance and assimilation of the further discovery. It does not rely for it?s appeal upon limited concepts of primitive minds not for it?s power upon the negation of thought.</p>
              <p>- Francis Story <em>,"Buddhism as World Religion</em></p>
              <p>Joyful religion</p>
              <p>Buddhism is quite opposed to the melancholic, sorrowful, petinent and gloomy attitude of mind which is considered a hindrance to the realization of Truth. On the other hand, it is interesting to remember here that joy is one of the seven ?Factors of Illumination?, the essential qualities to be cultivated for the realization of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>- Ven.Dr. W. Rahula,<em> "What the Buddha Taught"</em></p>
              <p>Challenge to other religions</p>
              <p>It is Buddhismas we find it actually recorded, not hypothetical primitive system, which still forms a challenge to other religions.</p>
              <p>- Bishop Gore,<em> "Buddha and the Christ."</em></p>
              <p>No assumption in Buddhism</p>
              <p>It is a glory of Buddhism that it makes intellactual enlightenment an essential condition of salvation. In Buddhism morality and interlectual enlightenment are inseparable from one another. While morality forms the basis of the higher life, knowledge and wisdom complete it. Without a perfect understanding of the law of casuality and transformation (Pratityasamutpada), no one else can even be said to be truly moral if he does not possess the necessary insight and knowledge. In this respect Buddhism differs from all other religions. All montheistic religions start with certain assumption, and when these assumptions are contradicted by the growth of knowledge it increases sorrow. But Buddhism starts with no assumptions. It stands on the firm rock of facts, and can therefore never shun the dry light of knowledge.</p>
              <p>- Prof. Lakhsmi Naras,.<em>"The Essence of Buddhism"</em></p>
              <p>Buddha has seen deeper them modern idealists</p>
              <p>Gautama got rid of even that shade of a shadow of permanent existance by a metaphysical tour de force of great interest to the student of philosophy, seeing that it supplies the wanting half of Bishop Berkeley?s well-known idealist argument. It is a remarkable indication of the subtlety of Indian speculation that Gautama should have seen deeper than the greatest of modern idealists. The tendency of enlightened thought of all today all the world over is not towards theology, but philosophy and psychology. The bark of theological dualism is drifting into danger. The fundamental principles of evolution and monism are being accepted by the thoughtful.</p>
              <p>- Prof.Huxley,<em>"Evolution And Ethics"</em></p>
              <p>Religious Revolution</p>
              <p>Twenty- five centuries ago India witnessed an intellectual and religious revolution which culminated in the overthrow of monotheism, priestly selfishness, and the establishment of a synthetic religion, a system of light and thought which was appropriately called Dhamma ? Philosophical Religion.</p>
              <p>- Anagarika Dharmapala,<em>"The World debt to Buddha"</em></p>
              <p>A Plan for Living</p>
              <p>Buddhism is a plan for living in such a way as to derive highest benefit from life. It is a religion of wisdom where knowledge and intelligence predominate. The Buddha did not preach to win converts but to enlighten listeners. <em></em>- A Western writer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come and See</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not always a question of knowing and seeing and not that of believing. The teaching of the Buddha is qualified as Ehi-Passiko, inviting you to come and see, but not to come and believe.</p>
              <p>- Ven. Dr. W. Rahula,<em>"What the Buddha Taught"</em></p>
              <p>Religion of Man</p>
              <p>Buddhism will last as long as the sun and moon last and the human race exists upon the earth, for it is the religion of man, of humanity as a whole.</p>
              <p>- Bandaranaike, Former Prime Minister of Srilanka</p>
              <p>Buddhist is not a slave to anybody</p>
              <p>A Buddhist is not a slave to a book or to any person. Nor does he sacrifice his freedom of thought by becoming a follower of the Buddha. He can exercise his own free will and develop his knowledge even to the extent of attaining Buddhahood himself, for all are potential Buddhas.</p>
              <p>- Ven. Narada Maha Thera<em>, "What is Buddhism"</em></p>
              <p>Life by principle</p>
              <p>Buddhism taught a life not by rule, but by principle, a life of beauty; and as a consequence, it was a religion of tolerance. It was the most charitable system under the sun.</p>
              <p>- Rev. Joseph Wain</p>
              <p>Buddhism would remain</p>
              <p>Buddhism would remain what it is even if it were proved that the Buddha never lived.</p>
              <p>- Christmas Humphreys, <em>"Buddhism"</em></p>
              <p>Modern Problems</p>
              <p>To read a little Buddhism is to realise that the Buddhists knew, two thousand five hundred years ago, far more about our modern problems of psychology than they have yet been given credit for. They studied these problems long ago and found their answers too.</p>
              <p>- Dr. Graham Howe</p>
              <p>Mind Training</p>
              <p>We hear much nowadays of thought-power, but Buddhism is the most complete and effective system of mind-training yet placed before the world.</p>
              <p>- Dudley Wright</p>
              <p>New Race</p>
              <p>The Buddha created a new race of men, a race of moral heroes, a race of salvation-workers, a race of Buddhas.</p>
              <p>- Manmatha Nath Sastri</p>
              <p>First Missionary</p>
              <p>Buddhism is the first missionary religion in the history of humanity with a universal message of salvation for all mankind. The Buddha after his Enlightenment sent out sixty-one disciples in different directions asking them to preach the doctrine for the weal and welfare of mankind.</p>
              <p>- Dr. K.N. Jayatilleke, <em>"Buddhism and Peace"</em></p>
              <p>No forced conversion</p>
              <p>It was never, however, the buddhist way to proselytise ? in the sense of forcing ideas and beliefs upon an unwilling audience, much less to exert pressure of any kind, or any kind of flattery, deceit or cajolery, to win adherence to one?s own point of view. Buddhist missionaries have never competed for converts in the marketplace.</p>
              <p>- Dr. G.P.Malalasekara</p>
              <p>Ultimate fact of reality</p>
              <p>Here it is necessary to draw attention to another unique feature of the religion of the buddha, namely, that it is the only religion of any relgious teacher, which is the outcome of a consistent philosophy, which claims to tell us about the ultimate facts of existance and reality. The religion of the Buddha is a way of life resulting from the acceptance of a view of life, which is said to be factual. His philosophy is not without an account of the nature of knowledge.</p>
              <p>- Dr. K.N. Jayatilleke,<em> "Buddhism and Peace"</em></p>
              <p>No Fanaticism</p>
              <p>Of Buddha alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. It?s aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self conquest, how can it have a recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.</p>

              <p>Buddhism is not a melancholy religion</p>
              <p>Some people think that Buddhism is a dark and melancholy religion. It is not so; it will it?s followers bright and cheerful. When we read the birth stories of Bodhisatva, the future Buddha, we learn how he cultivated the Perfection of patience and forbearance. It will help as to be cheerful even in midst of great troubles and to take delight in other?s welfare.</p>

              <p>Buddhism and social welfare</p>
              <p>Those who think that Buddhism is interested only in lofty ideals, high moral and philosophy thought, ignores any social and economic of welfare people, are wrong. The Buddha was interested in happiness of men. To him, happiness was not possible without leading a pure life based on moral and spiritual principles. But he knew that leading such a life was hard in unfavourable material and social conditions.</p>
              <p>Buddhism does not material welfare as an end in itself; it is only a means to an end ? a higher and nobler end. But it is a means which is indispensable, indespensable in achieving a higher purpose for man?s happiness. So Buddhism recognizes the need of certain minimum material conditions favourable to spiritual success ? even that of a monk engaged in meditation in some solitary place.</p>

              <p>Dhamma is the law</p>
              <p>All teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in one word: "Dhamma". The law of righteousness, exist not only in a man?s heart but it exists in the universe also. All the universe is an embodiment or revelation of Dhamma. The laws of nature which modern science have discovered are revelations of Dhamma.</p>
              <p>If the Moon rises and sets, it is because of Dhamma, for Dhamma is that law residing in the universe that makes metter act in the ways studied in physics, chemistry, zoology, botany and astronomy. Dhamma exists in the universe just as Dhamma exists in the heart of man. If man will live by Dhamma, he will escape misery and attain Nibbana.</p>

              <p>Without senuous pleasure would life be endurable? Without belief in immorality can man be moral? Without worship of a God can man advance towards righteousness? Yes, replies the Buddha, these ends can be attained by knowledge; knowledge alone the key to higher path, the one worth pursuing in life; knowledge is that which brings calmness and peace to life, which renderd man indifferent to the storms of phenomenal world.</p>

              <p>Respect other religions</p>
              <p>One should not honour only one?s own religion and condemn the religions of others, but one should honour other?s religions for this or that reason. So doing, one helps one?s own religion to grow and renders service to the religions of others too. In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one?s own religion and also does harm to other religions. Whosever honours his own religion and condemns other religions, thinking "I will glorify my own religion". But on the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely. So concord is good: Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by others.</p>

              <p>It can also be said that India discovered the unconsciousness earlier than the Western psycholigists. For them the unconscious consists in the totality of the impressions which slumber in the individual as the inheritance from his previous existance. The Buddhis technique of meditation, which is concerned with the latent forces, is thus a fore-runner of modern psycho-analysis, of autogenic mental trainingetc.</p>

              <p>- H.G. Wells</p>
              <p>Parliamentary system borrowed from Buddhism</p>
              <p>It is probable that the tendency towards self government evidenced by these various forms of corporate activity received fresh impetus from the Buddhist rejection of the authority of the priesthood and further but its doctrine of equality as exemplified by its repudiation of caste. It is indeed to the Buddhist books that we have to turn for an account of the manner in which the affairs of the early examples of representative self-governing institutions were conducted. It may come as a surprise to many to learn that in assemblies of Buddhists in India 2500 years and more ago are to be found the rudiments of our own parliamentary practice of the present day.</p>
              <p>The dignity of the assembly was preserved by the appointment of a special officer ? the embryo of "Mr. Speaker" in our house of commons. A second officer was appointed to see that when necessary a quorum was secured ? the prototype of the Parliamentary Chief Whip, in our own system. A member initiating business did so in the form of a motion which was then open to discussion. In some cases, this was done once only, in others three times, thus anticipating the practise of Parliament in requiring that a bill be read a third time before it becomes law. If discussion disclosed a difference of opinion the matter was decided by the vote of the majority, the voting being by ballot.</p>

              <p>Man is greater that the blind forces of nature because even though he is crushed by them he remains superior by virtue of his understanding of them.

              <p>Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denyingthe existence of such a Soul, Self, ot Atman. According to the teaching of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary, false belief which has no corresponding reality, and it produces harmful thoughts or ?me? and ?mine?, selfish desire craving, attachment, hatred, illwill, conceit, pride, egoism, and other defilement, impurities and problems. It is the source of all troubles in the world from personal conflicts to wars between nations. In short, to this flase view can be traced all the evils in the world.</p>

              <p>The difference between death and birth is only a thought moment: the last thought moment in this life conditions the first thought moment in the so called next life, which in fact is the continually of tha same series. During this life itself, too, one thought moment conditions the next thought moment.

For 2500 years it has satisfied that spiritual science and a way of life, which is reasonable, practical and all embracing. For 2500 years it has satisfied the spirtual needs of nearly one third of mankind. It appeals to the West, insists on self reliance coupled with tolerance for the other ?s points of view, embraces science, relgion, philosophy, psychology, ethics and art, and points to man alone as the creator of his present life and sole designer of his destiny.</p>

And this is clear enough to anyone who has made a study of Buddism. For, through Buddhist Meditation, the atomic constituents making up matter have been seen and felt, and the sorrow, or unsatifactoriness, of their ?arising and passing away? (dependant on causes) has made itself with what we call a ?soul? or ?atma? ? the illusion of Sakkayadithi, as it is called in the Buddha?s teaching.</p>

He doesn?t need much punishment and condemnation so much as he needs instruction. He is not regarded as ?violating God?s commands? or as one who mest beg for divine mercy and forgiveness. Rather it is necessary fo rthe sinner?s friends to make him reason in the human way.

              <p>Unsatifactory world.</p>
              <p>Buddha was not angry with the world. He thought of it as unsatisfactory and transitory rather than wicked, as ignorant rather than rebelliou. He troubled little about people who would not listen to him and showed no nervous irritablity.</p>
              <p>- Prof. Eliot,<em> "Buddhism and Hinduism"</em></p>
              <p>A great Battle</p>
              <p>The whole universe is a vast field of battle. Everywhere there is fighting. Existance is nothing but a vain struggle against germs of dreadful diseases, molecules against molecules, atoms against atoms, and electrons. Mind is still more scene of battle. Forms, sounds, tastes, etc. are resultants of counteracting and belligerant forces. Ther very existance of war proves that there is a state of Perfect Peace. It is what we call Nibbana.</p>
              <p>- Ven. Narada Thera, <em>"The Bodhisatta Ideal"</em></p>
