Reality is the 'union of dependent origination and emptiness'.<br><br>"And as David Loy said so nicely in The Difference between Samsara and Nirvana: There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Samsara is the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time. Nirvana is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, Madhyamika insists, cannot be characterized (Chandrakirti: "Nirvana or Reality is that which is absolved of all thought-construction" ), but which Yogacara nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature";; and so forth."<br><br>The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana:<br><br>"A.

It is only through illusions that all things come to be differentiated. If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will be no appearances (lakshana) of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness. All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting Suchness.<br><br>The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak, the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence the name Suchness."</div></blockquote>The ""Mind" or "Buddhanature";; and so forth.""<br>refers to what and why is ""Mind" or "Buddhanature";; and so forth.""

            <div class='col-md body'>"In Buddhism we have relative truth and absolute truth. From the viewpoint of absolute truth, what we feel and experience in our ordinary daily life is all delusion. Of all the various delusions, the sense of discrimination between oneself and others is the worst form, as it creates nothing but unpleasantness for both sides. If we can realize and meditate on ultimate truth, it will cleanse our impurities of mind and thus eradicate the sense of discrimination. This will help to create true love for one another. The search for ultimate truth is, therefore, vitally important.<br><br>"Nowadays the world is becoming increasingly materialistic, and mankind is reaching toward the very zenith of external progress, driven by an insatiable desire for power and vast possessions. Yet by this vain striving for perfection in a world where everything is relative, they wander even further away from inward peace and happiness of the mind. This we can all bear witness to, living as we do plagued by unremitting anxiety Â… It becomes more and more imperative that the life of the spirit be avowed as the only firm basis upon which to establish happiness and peace. I truly believe that individuals can make a difference in society. Since periods of change such as the present one come so rarely in human history, it is up to each of us to make the best use of our time to help create a happier world.<br><br>"If you have a particular faith or religion, that is good. But you can survive without it if you have a love, compassion, and tolerance. The clear proof of a personÂ’s love of God is if that person genuinely shows love to fellow human beings. I pray for a more friendly, more caring, and more understanding human family on this planet.<br><br>To all who dislike suffering, who cherish lasting happiness ~ this is my heartfelt appeal.<br><br>"I believe deeply that we must find, all of us together, a new spirituality. This new concept ought to be elaborated alongside the religions, in such a way that all people of good will could adhere to it. We ought to promote this concept with the help of scientists. It could lead us to what we are looking for.<br>"I am open to the guidance of synchronicity, and do not let expectations hinder my path. I find hope in the darkest of days, and focus in the brightest. I do not judge the universe.<br><br>"A new way of thinking has become the necessary condition for responsible living and acting. If we maintain obsolete values and beliefs, a fragmented consciousness and self-centered spirit, we will continue to hold onto outdated goals and behaviors. Such an attitude by a large number of people would block the entire transition to an interdependent yet peaceful and cooperative global society.<br><br>"This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.<br><br>"We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves. If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."  The Dalai Lama</div>

When this is understood, our true nature cannot be said to be separated from changing phenomena. Our true nature cannot be separated from conditions. One of the important teachings of Zen Master Dogen is that 'Buddha Nature is Impermanence'. If I can find a good article to explain this, I will post it here.</div></blockquote>This is not an explanation, but a quote attributed to Zen Master Dogen.<br><br>Interpreting a sutra passage, Dogen concludes: "By way of illustration, <span style="font-style: italic;">if you wish to know the Buddha-nature's meaning</span> might be read, you are directly knowing the Buddha-nature's meaning. <span style="font-style: italic;">You should watch for temporal conditions</span> means you are directly knowing temporal conditions. If you wish to know the Buddha-nature, you should know that it is precisely temporal conditions themselves." 7</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found a great quote:<br><br>What appears is at the same time disappearing, the arising and the passing away, a single movement, without beginning or end. This is the preciousness of life, this amazing constellation of feelings, thoughts, sensations, and the mystery of wakefulness that illuminates them all, here and then gone in a flash.<br><br>And the extraordinary paradox is that this which is ever changing is, at the same time, changeless. A bird, a tear, a star- all the movement of a single life, one ocean dancing as a thousand different waves and yet always remaining itself.<br><br>~ John Astin</div>

These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, and are in phase with each other.
