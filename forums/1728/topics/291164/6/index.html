            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body"> If there is no objective reality, then how can you decide whether to climb the mountain or not climb the mountain?<br><br>Can you decide to climb the mountain that exists in your mind only?<br><br>Picture a mountain that is in your mind... now, climb it... you can't because it is subjective reality and the mountain in your mind does not have objective reality to enable you or someone else to physically climb it.<br><br>What is this "objective reality" that allows people to climb it?<br><br>That is where your confusion lies. The lack of inherent existence is a description of the "objective reality" and not the denial of the "objective reality" because to deny the existence of the  "objective reality" is to deny the existence of it thereof.<br><br>You agree that Buddhism is not about non-existence but you keep using words and phrases that says "non-existence", without knowing it and simply deny that the words does not imply or impute "non-existence".<br><br>It is not easy... the ability to see objective reality as non-inherently existing without being dualistic and without seeing it as non-existing and if you say that you can do that, then you should be able to describe it without using words and phrases that says: "non-existing".</div></blockquote>Your post is full of assumption. That is why I say the dualistic mind thinks that to deny inherent existence means to impute non-existence, and will never get the point of what emptiness is about. I never meant that (non-existence) in my post. Mountain and genting highlands is also dependent arising, Conditions what. Climbing is also dependent arising and Conditions.<br><br>If you are still seeing dualistically -- that there is a 'Self' or 'Climber' that is interacting with a 'Mountain' instead of all being merely dependent arising empty of self and other, then I suggest you read on, and read the highlighted text by David Loy.<br><br>Furthermore... the dog is not going to experience the same mountain as a climber (neither does the dog experience something different, btw.. don't think dualistically). Someone high on LSD is going to see very colourful visions, we are going to see a coloured vision and a dog is going to see an uncoloured vision.<br><br>BTW, there are a few ways we can use to talk about 'subjective' and 'objective' worlds. In the relative sense, we may say that dreams belong to the subjective world... for it contains only images and symbols. When we are in the waking world, we deal with the 'objective' world.<br><br>But in ultimate reality there is No Duality, both Subject and Object are empty. When I say 'All is Mind' or 'there is no objective world' I do not mean anything like all world are merely the projection of our subjective world -- though we all experience conditions differently because our individual karmic conditions give rise to different karmic vision. An insect or reptile may see something even more different... or a came-from-the-future quantum vision guy. None of them are seeing the same things.<br><br>What I mean in regards to Ultimate Non-Duality is that Reality is completely empty of 'Self' and 'Other', Subject and Object. Ultimately there can be no line of demarcation between subject and object -- there is nothing that can be ultimately called 'subjective' or 'objective' -- there is only what is happening, there is no inside and out there. There is only ONE TASTE. Since there is no 'out there', there is no objective reality, which means there is no inherently existing mountain at all. Note again: I never say anything about non-existence.<br><br>There is only what is appearing in a field empty of self and other, there is only One World that is not split into a subjective or objective world -- and that is Mind. And yet appearances arise in diversity due to Conditions, due to Dependent Arising, and EACH arising is a universe in itself. The mountain is the universe, just as a mote of dust is an entire universe. I believe this is the core teachings of Avatamsaka Sutra. Just like the Net of Indra... it is oneness but each is a jewel by itself.<br><br>Can you see? I wrote previously in <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=287232&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">The nature of the separate self, duality</a>,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"And as David Loy said so nicely in <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm" rel="nofollow">The Difference between Samsara and Nirvana</a>: There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Samsara is the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time. Nirvana is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, Madhyamika insists, cannot be characterized (Chandrakirti: "Nirvana or Reality is that which is absolved of all thought-construction" ), but which Yogacara nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature"; and so forth."</strong><br><br>"In reality, there only is the universe manifesting as it is in itself, conditioned arising, a mere happening that happens to no-one. Whatever arises at that moment, is as it is. If pain arises, it is not 'your pain' from 'your body'. The universe is pain and it is happening to no one because there is no self apart from manifestation. "<br><br><strong>"Whatever arises is the whole universe manifesting as that moment. Know that the universe is giving its very best for this moment to arise. All conditions and causes are just right for the birth a moment of manifestation. When this is understood, the 'conditioned arising' is really unconditioned, all spontaneously arise."</strong><br><br>"So Buddha Nature is not one! There is no 'The Absolute' but all moments are a reality/'absolute' in itself! (just like there is no 'Essence of Flower', only conditioned manifestation according to causes and conditions) Because Buddha Nature really is the manifold -- the whole universe, everything, as conditioned arising that is empty and never fixed, everchanging. Yet it is not many either! Because all that is inseparable in One Taste, being all the manifestation of our pristine awareness, and being an inseparable wholeness, also known as One Reality or One Mind but really it does not have a single nor multiple realities because its nature is empty. (See the recent topic, the last few posts, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=288962" rel="nofollow">A nightmare</a>)"</span><br><br>So... When you see the mountain, there is no YOU (subject) seeing 'THE' mountain (object) as if it is an inherently existing entity out there, all there is is simply dependent arising appearance that is empty of any inherent existence, being merely like reflections on water, void of any essence and primordially unborn. And Appearance/Manifestation is itself Mind/Source! And so, the dog that sees a black and white mountain is seeing a Universe absolute in itself, the man that sees a colourful mountain is also seeing a Universe absolute in itself, the quantum vision guy that sees only void is also seeing a Universe absolute in itself.<br><br>Same goes to the notion of there being a 'Climber' or a 'Self' interacting with 'The Mountain'. You have not understood what is the Universe eating apple, the Universe climbing mountain. There is absolutely no doer interacting with the world (perceived to be a collection of entities/objects).<br><br>The Buddha taught: When seeing there is just the seen, no seer. When hearing there is just the heard, no hearer. The whole of that moment is just the sound! And sound is that reality... all of it. All of the universe is this sound.<br><br>That is all there is -- self-luminous appearances -- there is no subjective observer nor an object observed -- only dependent arising that is itself self-aware, self-luminous... gone as it arise! Utterly empty, appearances arising and subsiding in diversity like reflections.<br><br>No watcher needed, the process (the world) itself knows and rolls as Venerable Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga.<br><br>(continued in the next post)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from previous post)<br><br>Every arising is an entire Universe itself void of subject and object/self or other. Of course if you wear quantum glasses and see the reality that science knows, you will see almost completely void, so don't think that what you see is an objective reality. All is merely Conditions -- the scenery, the sound, texts appearing on screen, and Conditions = Pristine Awareness/Consciousness. Mind-Only.<br><br>At human level with the limitation of senses and body, the entire universe is conditioned according our limitation of senses... but the appearance in terms of Presence is as real as it can be.<br><br>BTW quite recently, I have showed Thusness some of the quotations from an E-Sangha administrator and dharma teacher, Loppon Namdrol. Thusness commented (from these posts) that the writer is an enlightened persons.<br><blockquote>But in the end, one's rigpa is one's own rigpa, and not anyone elses. And when it is totally realized, all sense of self and other vanish anyway, so the identity issue will also vanish.  But in terms of experiencing rigpa, it is your own rigpa you are experiencing, no one else's.<br><br>N<br><br>N</blockquote><blockquote>Because the rigpa you experience is your own, and it isn't anyone else's; just as when you taste sweet, it is your own experience, and no one else's.</blockquote><blockquote>Okay, the rigpa is one's own... but then doing guru yoga, aren't we (in instant presence) one with the guru's nature....indivisible... or is that somehow not the case?<br><br>PS-- thanks everyone for many wonderful posts above....<br>*<br><br>The knowledge is the same. It is like, for example, when two people are looking at the same thing and both recognize it at the same time, at that moment, though their experience is personal, it concerns the same thing.<br><br>N</blockquote><blockquote>You should not focus on words like "primordial state" other than to understand it refers to the union of dependent origination and emptiness in a Dzogchen context.</blockquote></div>

No subject nor object. Neither is there the question of existence or non existence.<br><br>Dependent arising continues to display as appearances in diversity -- but merely as appearances, reflections, empty &amp; unborn. Reality is the 'union of dependent origination and emptiness'.<br><br>"And as David Loy said so nicely in The Difference between Samsara and Nirvana: There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Samsara is the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time. Nirvana is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, Madhyamika insists, cannot be characterized (Chandrakirti: "Nirvana or Reality is that which is absolved of all thought-construction" ), but which Yogacara nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature";; and so forth."<br><br>The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana:<br><br>"A. Mind in Terms of the Absolute<br><br>The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality (dharmadhatu) and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality.<br><br>That which is called "the essential nature of the Mind" is unborn and is imperishable. It is only through illusions that all things come to be differentiated. If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will be no appearances (lakshana) of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness. All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting Suchness.<br><br>The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak, the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence the name Suchness."</div>
