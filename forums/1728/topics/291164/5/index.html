The middle way is that there is merely APPEARANCES -- Emptiness cannot be separated from appearances. Mountain is not an objective reality, it is dependent arising apperances, it is Conditions, and that is Mind-Only.<br><br>................................<br><br></blockquote>I find this one interesting.. esp for the four extreme which i can't grasp the concept intellectually or come to conceive the truth of it yet. Middle way is either nihilism or absoluteness. It makes sense to use "middle way" to describe things/appearance as 'it' exist and does not exist forever; 'it' can also come and go in a snap of a finger, arise and go with conditions/dependent arisng.<br><br>"The middle way which is merely appearance". What the author meant is that everything is not substantial by nature as it is constantly changing due to interaction of changes of conditions that make up of it. Am i correct in my of understanding of it here ? Conceptually-speaking, cause and conditions are related and co-exist as one??<br><br>The cause and product is empty of inherent existence.<br>The condition that arise is empty of inherent existence right?<br>Yes the mountain exists but has no substantiality by nature.<br><br>I think.. i guess.. what AEN is talking about is there is no duality in term of "experiencing" it.<br><br>In order to experience some thing out "there", you need to have someone "here" to identify it. But when we examine the no-self theory, we realise that there isn't a self to perceive something out there. Furthermore, there is no here and there.. it is a fabricated concept.<br><br>I think...<br><br>Relative reality depends on inter-relationships of conditions.<br>While Ultimate reality is just emptiness.

Firstly, i have never said i have.. Our naked eyes can't see the bacteria in the air and so does that means there is no microscopic organisms here? Of course, i'm not asking you to eat my words and rather contemplate and see it for yourself.<br><br>Relative reality 'exists' but has no inherent existence- there is you have to understand the meaning of buddhism' s term emptiness. Firstly, i think you have misunderstand what i mean: Buddhist ( refer if you are practising correctly) are never in self-denial of things and i can tell you we do not deny relative truth either!<br><br>"Ultimate reality has no negation" is partially quoted from a Gesha, a teacher, a scholar who has studies essays, sutra, research papers on emptiness. I do not dare to say i have realised emptiness. Why the term Ultimate is used to cos it describing this ultimate truth is ultimate cos it has no negation. It has no BUT. It is simply so.. i'm just explaining what i mean by "ultimate"<br><br>i'm pointing out the differences between the two: Relative and Ultimate reality. Does there mean it is denying one another. If you deny ultimate reality, aren't you also denying relative reality ? As i have said, we aren't denying relative reality here.<br><br>At a gross level, u see mechanism of relative reality but if you examine the relative reality deeper and more subtly, you will see ultimate reality where relative reality spurts from.<br><br>ps: pls read this with wisdom.<br><br></div>

It makes sense to use "middle way" to describe things/appearance as 'it' exist and does not exist forever; 'it' can also come and go in a snap of a finger, arise and go with conditions/dependent arisng.<br><br>"The middle way which is merely appearance". What the author meant is that everything is not substantial by nature as it is constantly changing due to interaction of changes of conditions that make up of it.
