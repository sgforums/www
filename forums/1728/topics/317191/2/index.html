              <p>Hi An-Eternal-Now,</p>
              <p>I received your PM, tks.</p>
              <p>The "guai" is now i think spelt a bit wrongly that is why all
                                                this confusion. I was told by that medium that he could see if one
                                                has "guain1" around their bodies and ppl can 'accumulate' that
                                                through chanting 'namo-o-ni-to-fo'.</p>
              <p>According to your understanding, is it true -</p>
              <p>1. True that through chanting, a person can accumulate this kind
                                                of 'brightness' around him/her</p>
              <p>2. And, this 'brightness' can help a person in achieving his/her
                                                goal?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When
                                        one has brightness, that means one has clarity, wisdom, awareness. He
                                        will know what he should do and what he should not do. His mind will
                                        not be deluded and ignorant. So in this sense, it can help a person in
                                        achieving his/her goal.</p>
              <p>For example, one will work to
                                        acquire the knowledge and skills and so on and work towards achieving
                                        his/her goal. He will not resort to ignorant, harmful, or
                                        unwholesome/immoral/evil ways to accomplish his goals.</p>
              <p>Also,
                                        to resort to superstition is also a form of ignorance... if a medium or
                                        anyone starts telling you that this and that is what is going to happen
                                        to you and you have to do this and that... and you wholeheartedly
                                        believe in it, become fearful, and so on are all superstitions. A
                                        superstitious mind is a mind with darkness. So we should not cling to
                                        superstitions.</p>
              <p>When we let go of all superstitions, and in
                                        fact all attachments, and all our sentient thoughts... brightness,
                                        wisdom, awareness will naturally manifest. With a clear mind, whatever
                                        we do will be done with wisdom and one will be blissful, liberated.</p>
              <p>But
                                        we should not be attached or have expectations... in times of crisis,
                                        it is most important to learn how to take and stand...

There should
                                            be wisdom of belief and not superstition. We need to understand the
                                            Truth taught by Buddha, rather than to worship superstitiously. If we
                                            do not know what is going on, and just worship muddle-headedly, then
                                            that is superstitious worshipping.<br> <br> We need to understand Buddhadharma. What does the word ‘Buddha’
                                            mean? Simply put, it means ‘pure awareness and enlightenment’. Jen Chen
                                            (Humanity Vehicle) Buddhism is the teaching guiding humanity to aspire
                                            towards awakening and enlightenment.<br> <br> ‘Pure awareness’ is actually very simple. For example, when the weather
                                            turns cold, we put on more clothing. When the weather is too hot, we
                                            quickly change into thinner clothing. We know that the weather has
                                            cooled or warmed. This is our awareness-nature. Not only do we human
                                            beings have awareness-nature, but so do all living things, including
                                            worms, insects and ants. However, sometimes we human beings are
                                            deceived by ourselves. Muddle-headedly, we obscure our pure awareness
                                            and awakening. Say for example, you have a habit of drinking alcohol,
                                            which is very bad. But because you lack awareness, you think drinking
                                            alcohol is wonderful. And so, you get yourself dead drunk and end up
                                            driving into a ditch. Therefore, whenever and wherever we are, we need
                                            to constantly heighten our own awareness and be awakened. This is Jen
                                            Chen (Humanity Vehicle) Buddhism’s concept of learning Buddhism with
                                            right faith and understanding.<img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></span></li>

              <p>   Whatever you said abt this medium sounds fishy to me . Regardless of whether he is a geniue medium or not , a real authentic medium will never ask you to be naked for him to cleanse your body . Not to even mention having to book hostel or do it at your home with nobody ard except for you and him only . Some medium are just 30% god possessed ( or possessed by whatever spirits our buddhist friend here prefer to call it ) and 70% still in their concious state or some not being possessed at all . Which means they may use their gods name to do make you do whatever they want cos they know you are at your wits end and is easy to manipulate and bluffed . Even if ok give them the benefit of the doubt that you really are not clean ( just assume only ) they will usually give you a talisman or a packet of jasmine soaked inside some water or ask you to go market get jasmine flower or maybe 5 diff colour of flower then " burn " the talisman ( if any ) let the ashes drop into the water to bath in WITHOUT THE MEDIUM BEING ANYWHERE AROUND YOU AND AT YOUR OWN PRIVACY OF COURSE .</p>
              <p>    Remember  any medium whom ask you to be naked or near naked to let them " clean " your body is a faker . Most likely they are up to no good by trying to use gods name for their own beastly desire .</p>
              <p>    As for our own fate , if you think that your life or fate is very bad then go do more charitable deeds or merits to help change your fate . Anyway my life isn't any better also so i've been trying to do more merits to help change my own fate . There is a saying which says " our present life is based on our merits and demerits of our past lives . But you can still improve it by doing more merits in your present life . "</p>

              <p>2. What is hte purpose of turning that dharma Prayer wheel? Does it really grant wishes?</p>
              <p>3. What is 'dana'? What does it do it we do give dana to monks? What special things will happen if we manage to give dana to highly respected monks?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>For your question 1 &amp; 2:</p>
              <p>The Dharma prayer wheel at Buddha Tooth Relics temple contains various sutra and if u turn it one round clockwise, it signifies that you have recited the sutras that are kept inside the prayer wheel. It helps to purify negative karma and obstruction, and to cause us to actualize the realizations of the path to enlightenment.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The practise according to wiki</span>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel</a></p>
              <p>The rules surrounding the prayer wheels are very specific (although occasionally vary according to tradition). The practitioner must spin the wheel clockwise. This was determined because this is the direction the mantras are written. Before and after the practitioner turns the wheel, he or she must repeat the mantra, or no merit will be incurred by the wheels use. However, some traditions state that repeating a mantra simply (or greatly) enhances the effects of the prayer wheel, and just turning it has benefits and merits alone. Each revolution is considered as meritous as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll. The wheel must not be spun frantically, but held straight (if a hand-held wheel) and turned smoothly with the motivation and spirit of compassion and <em>bodhichitta</em> (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings). Which, it's been stated, are some of the benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel. It helps compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner. The practitioner should also repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel, and keep a calm meditative mind. Also, there's a tradition of asking the Buddhas and bodhisattvas to dedicate your accumulated merits to all sentient beings after a session of meditation (with or without the wheel).</p>
              <p>For your question 3:</p>
              <p>3. There are much benefits for giving dana to monks that has attain certain fruits of enlightenment. You can also give dana to temple or any monks. In a way, you are supporting the lifehood and dharma activites which in turn, benefits all the sentient beings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>- King Asoka -</p>
              <p>1. DANA</p>
              <p>DANA is a Pali word that can be translated as giving, generosity, charity, <br>and liberality.</p>
              <p>It occupies an important part in the Buddha's teaching, which is often <br>formulated under three headings - dana, sila, bhavana (giving, morality, <br>meditation or mental cultivation). That dana is one heading underscores its <br>importance. Buddhists should take heed and cultivate a good spirit of dana.</p>
              <p>It is a first step towards eliminating the defilement of greed, hatred and <br>delusion (lobka, dosa, moha), for every act of giving is an act of <br>non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion. When you give you have loving-kindness <br>(metta) and compassion (karuna) in your heart. So at that time greed, hatred <br>or ill-will, and delusion would be absent.</p>
              <p>"Giving" is a word that has very wide connotations. It does not mean that <br>you give only to monks. It does not mean that you give only expensive <br>things. And it does not mean that you give only material things that cost <br>money.</p>
              <p>For you can give many immaterial things which may count even more than <br>material things. What I mean is that when we are kind to each other, we are <br>giving kindness, gentleness, comfort, peace, happiness, etc. So we can give <br>by being kind. For example, we can lend a sympathetic ear to a troubled <br>person, listen to him (or her) with compassion and give him comfort and <br>encouragement.</p>
              <p>To the troubled person, your giving time to listen to him is more important <br>than if he were to receive a material gift. So when we are living in a <br>community, we should cultivate care and concern for each other, reaching out <br>to help whenever we can. Then we give more kindness by speaking gently, <br>soothingly, not harshly or angrily. This can bring much cheer to people, as <br>the following poem shows:</p>
              <p>Loving words will cost but little <br>Journeying up the hill of life <br>But they make the weak and weary <br>Stronger, braver for the strife <br>So, as up life's hill we journey <br>Let us scatter all the way <br>Kindly words, to be as sunshine <br>In the dark and cloudy day.</p>
              <p>When we bring happiness into the lives of others, we are giving in a very <br>meaningful way. In this context, giving would mean more than just giving <br>material things. The attitude involved is also important.</p>
              <p>For example, during the time of the Buddha, there was one, Prince Payasi, <br>who established a charity for ascetics and Brahmins, wayfarers, beggars and <br>the needy. And he gave such food as broken rice and sour gruel and also <br>rough clothing. A young Brahmin called Uttara was put in charge of the distribution.</p>
              <p>One day Uttara made some uncomplimentary remarks about Prince Payasi. The Prince called him up and asked: "But why did you say such a thing? Friend Uttara, don't we who wish to gain merit expect a reward for our charity?"</p>
              <p>Uttara replied: "But Lord, the food you give-broken rice with sour gruel-you <br>would not care to touch it with your foot, much less eat it! And the rough <br>clothes - you would not care to set foot on them, much less wear them!"</p>
              <p>Prince Payasi then asked Uttara to arrange to supply better food and <br>clothing, and the latter did so. When Prince Payasi died he was reborn in an <br>empty mansion in a low heavenly realm. Uttara was reborn in a higher <br>heavenly realm in the company of the 33 gods.</p>
              <p>This was because Prince Payasi had established his charity grudgingly, not <br>with his own hands, and without proper concern, like something casually <br>tossed aside. But Uttara had given the charity ungrudgingly, with his own <br>hands and with proper concern, not like something tossed aside.</p>
              <p>This account from Payasi Sutta of Digha Nikaya shows the importance of <br>having true care and concern. So when doing dana, we should take care to <br>cultivate a heart of true loving-kindness and compassion. Buddhists are <br>taught to offer food, robes, medicine and monastery buildings to monks. <br>Monks are considered a field of merit and worthy of support.</p>
              <p>It is understandable that Buddhists should give full support to the Sangha, <br>for the monks are the ones who are in a position to study, practice and <br>safeguard the Dhamma for the present and future generations. Without the <br>Dhamma, Buddhism would be lost. The monks too keep 227 precepts, which <br>restrain them from indulgence in sensual pleasures.</p>
              <p>Lay Buddhists thus consider monks to be in a better position to cultivate <br>mental purity. So monks generally receive good support from lay Buddhists <br>and this is as it should be. But in the true spirit of dana, Buddhists <br>should not confine their giving to monks only They should relate well with <br>their fellow Buddhists, showing care and concern and sharing what they can.</p>
              <p>Whenever somebody is in trouble and needs help, they should respond if they <br>are able to. Furthermore, they should extend the same loving-kindness to <br>society at large, to people of all races and creeds. They can donate <br>liberally according to their ability to hospitals, old folks' homes, <br>handicapped institutions and all worthy causes. They can also get together <br>and set up such institutions, Such a broad attitude will make life <br>meaningful and rewarding.</p>
              <p>2. VOLITION</p>
              <p>In doing dana, such as offering of food to monks, the donor should be happy <br>before, during and after the offering. This means that before the offering, <br>during the preparatory stage, the donor should go about the planning and <br>preparation happily.</p>
              <p>He should realise and appreciate that what he is thinking, planning and <br>doing is very commendable and wholesome. He should be glad on that account. <br>Then when offering the food he should be happy, mindful and aware of what he <br>is doing. He should not be absent-minded and think about other things while <br>making the offering.</p>
              <p>After the offering, whenever he recalls his good deed, he should rejoice and <br>be glad. Some people may not have such an attitude. For example, they may <br>have the intention to do dana but failed to carry it out. Or when doing <br>dana, they may not be mindful and are thinking of something else. And after <br>making the offering, some may even regret doing so. In this way, the result <br>(vipaka) of the deed varies.</p>
              <p>There are instances in the Buddhist text where a person who regretted making <br>an offering to a monk, was later reborn with wealth which he, however, was <br>unable to enjoy because of miserliness. So we should take care to have <br>purity of mind before, during and after the deed.</p>
              <p>3. BELIEF IN KAMMA</p>
              <p>Furthermore, dana should be done with understanding of the law of action and <br>result (kamma-vipaka). We understand that we are the owner of our deeds. <br>Whatever we do will rebound back on us. Good will beget good, and bad will <br>beget bad. Dana when done with the belief in the law of kamma is accompanied <br>by wisdom.</p>
              <p>So when we enjoy the results such as wealth in later or future lives, it <br>will be accompanied by wisdom. Not understanding and believing in the law of <br>kamma is a setback to the practice of meditation. Being strongly attached to <br>wrong views, it will be difficult to make progress and attain higher insight <br>knowledge and Nibbana.</p>

              <p>I once spent up to 2 and a half month looking for a job , which is my current job. I was looking for  a "dream" job . Due to my inexperience and desperation , i applied for this job and many other jobs which only requires an N' level qualification. I have a diploma , but i think one cannot afford to be choosy when one is driven to despearation.</p>
              <p>Current solution is , just get any job that you can find if you desperately need one. After applying jobs for over a year , you more or less know the reason for not getting a job liao.</p>

              <p>I think better not go to the medium.</p>
              <p>Your main concern is to find a stable mean of earning a living. I think you should focus on that part.</p>
              <p>The medium incident will only complicate your life.</p>

              <p>Hi Isis, Longchen, knightIII, Rokkie,</p>
              <p>Tks so much for your thoughts. I appreciate.</p>
              <p>hi Rokkie,</p>
              <p>I am not sure if i should call this medium as fortune teller, cos he is not quite. If i can summarise what i have experienced with him, he is like a person who has / claims to have god's powers.</p>
              <p>What he usually does is to read my palm, sometimes write something onto my palms before he tells me things that I want to know. I also noticed that he will look at a person very intentionally for a few seconds before i sit down with him.</p>
              <p>Perhaps hte most appropriate name ot call him is 'medium'.</p>
              <p>btw, why do you say that palm reading is not realiable? You have experience of this?</p>

              <p>I would suggest one should be careful in choosing your very first job, becoz this will determind your career path...becoz from hoping industry to industry will greatly affect your human asset value. Do take note...find a job is tough, but yet...its a process in life, one should learn how to handle interviews and resume..as this are the crucial parts in job hunting..you ever wonder why you are not selected...sometimes its not that you are not qualified just that the person feel that you want to be overqualified in the position...meaning high expectation...It takes time to poblish your interview skills...I gone through many interviews....and just share some experiences here...</p>

              <p>As such art has been fake around by people to earn money, so just be careful, if you need to go to a medium to seek help, we should get someone who is verse in the knowledge of that to accompany one to the medium.</p>

              <p>Fortune telling and geomarcy prediction is rather different from mediumship, the teller did not get process by any being, they use tactics to predict your destiny, but yet..its a prediction, could act only as a guide, if you believe in karma, then we should be more reflective in our own doings and do not let such prediction harass your life.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for your advice. Savings was dwindling and CNY was around the corner at that time , thus have to take up the job , really cant afford to be choosy. However , the company's culture give me limited prospect. Now that with this job around , it gives me time to breathe and to save as much as i could. Minimum save $500 per month.</p>
              <p>My second one will be of my choice and not forced by circumstance. ^ ^</p>

              <p>Can try small cars and brands like Daihatsu and Perodua. They are bought over by Toyota and used Toyota engines. Save fuel as well.</p>
              <p>Earn more , save more , use the money saved to earn more money. ^^</p>
              <p>Anyway , it is always better to earn more than less. More power comes with more responsibilities.  I am sure Lord Buddha will agree with me . hehe.........</p>
              <p>Buddhism says one's fate can be changed , however that person has to be in cultivation.</p>

              <p> "was feeling not comfortable with this idea cos i have heard of bad things like this. I asked him how it would be like and etc which he replies as that it can be a bit 'inconveient' cos I need to be <strong>naked </strong>but the important parts will be covered. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get a life pretty Windflower...just read up the newspaper and you can see lots of these cases..don't be cheated</p>
              <p>if the so call medium is so powerful, you do not need to be naked to be cleansed. What's wrong with clothes on? If the material (clothing) can block the good power, I am sure it can also block the bad elements...</p>
