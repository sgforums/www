              <p>   Frankly speaking this particuliar medium you said is a fake . So don't go to him again and also tell the friend that introduce you to this medium off . If its your good friend who is guinely concerned abt you then just keep quiet if not then you may scold him/her off . As for your job search , i don't know what job you looking for and also your qualifications , perhaps you may have set your pay or expectations too high or you don't know how to speak properly during interviews . Nevermind after a few interviews , reflect what you could have done wrong and their remarks like no related experience or pay too high . If they said that then its time to lower your expected pay lor , its better to take a low pay to get some experience first then you can jump to a better job with more pay . Try to learn from trial and error , whatever reason they give or response they have bear it in mind and find out  what do they mean or why they react that way .  Once you able to learn then i belive  you will be able to get a job soon . I too experienced such problems  in my job search .  And i too visit mediums to ask for help .  So thats why i know abt mediums stuff . In every religion , theres always some black sheep among them . So does buddhism too , its just that we don't know untill we encounter them . But don't be too disheartened ,  Oh yah , only some of those mediums keep kunmanthong , and mostly its for their personal use like warning them of danger , gathering news or for those evil at heart do evil . Kunmanthng are not all evil , most of them are just spirits of babies who have diead young and being chanted into those " statues " to help their masters . Of cos the whole process is not so simple but i see no reason to explain it . I am one of those who visit medium to ask for help and also have helped those mediums before  . But i also read up buddhism books to learn abt buddhism , just that i am more open minded of religion then some of those devout buddhist pple . So all the best for your job search and cheer up be positive , who knows when you will get your first job , maybe after you read my reply ? Kekeke wish you luck .</p>

              <p>I had seen/visited some mediums too. However, one last medium I came across advised that asking favours from gods and dieties and your wish granted, you must pay back somehow. So just wish for good tidings and good health. You wish for monetary kind, you would have to pay back somehow...just my thoughts <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>to TS, you should report the so called medium to the police. obviously he is up to no good. more ppl will get hurt. not many ppl will be like you, rational enough to seek other opinions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my personal opinion is that mediums may really have some powers, but more often, many used them in bad ways to reach their selfish objectives, be it money or whatever. they may really know predictions etc, but i think they will actually use black magic on the victims to let them believe. thus this is the beginning of all evil.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>     Well , its true that you have to pay back for your wishes but its in the form of your merits ,  thats why some medium ask you to help them out after you get your wishes . My side mediums also told us not to insist on asking for favours esp money . If the god willing to give or say you have then good . But if they say you don't have the money luck or refuse to give then don't insist . Cos if they were to give after you insist you will have to pay it back someday .</p></div>

              <p>To all,</p>
              <p>It has been very interesting conversation here that I enjoy very much.</p>
              <p>It is definately that I enjoy what I have experienced, but i really enjoy all these ideas and various experiences that get into this discussion.</p>
              <p>Since some days ago i have already said that i would not go see the medium for cleansing act. So this definately will not happen. But all these things, be that accurate or not, still appear interesting to me. There are many things that await our discovery in this world.</p>
              <p>Whether or not I will report this to the police, or any other actions that I will take out, I will think about it and then do accordingly. I have the thoughts of making me as the bait and let hte police catch him red-handed, but i have also been advised that the police may not really come and it will be me that will be in trouble. I never thought of this, perhaps I have watched too much of the movies, thinking that things will go as they are planned. Reason for me doing so is that, as Jacqn has said, not many ppl will seek second opinion and they may end up to be victims. This is not what i want to see. Yes, in a way, i am a bit lucky as i jump out of this trap before it is too late.</p>
              <p>I have also been advised that if i were to rake up this issue it could also be that I will be 'punished' by the medium using evil force. So, this can be a tough decision to make.</p>
              <p>There are some in this tread saying that for those ppl who ask for things, they will have to pay back one day. Who knows whether this is true? We are not those mediums and they may or may not choose to help us. Or, they may just be pretending......</p>
              <p>I really enjoy all the thoughts that have been chipped in thus far. You guys have been helping me in one way or another. I really appreciate!</p>
              <p>I wish all of you well!</p>

I like to read and find out about spiritual and personal well-being. I have read a little on Christianity, Islamic teachings. Recently, I am reading topics on Buddhism and Taoism and I really like the findings. I am also curious and read a little about BaZi analysis. What I had learnt is that we are living in a world full of emotions. So how can we find inner peace and happiness? Learn to “let go” of cravings for worldly belongings (like what Buddhism preaches) and set your heart free! In this way, you can truly find inner happiness. Taoism preaches the idea of “</span></span><span style="font-family: SimSun;      "><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;      " lang="ZH-CN">æ— ä¸º</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style='font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  '>” where one self must live in harmony and balance in life. So I am not saying you have to laze around and give up hopes of finding a job. Just learn to be happy and spend quality time to do things you like, for eg, walk your dog, accompany your love ones, etc. Focus on “happiness now” and let go of the worries. Then nature and balance of life will take care of you.</span></span></span></p>

It was recently when I started studying Buddhism and Taoism when I start to realize the power of awakening. And when I watched the show, at that very moment I was able to find my inner peace because I listen to my heart. We just need to focus on happiness and let go of the worldly cravings in life.

              <p>Actually all of us already have Buddha-Nature (which is awareness-nature)... the ability to perceive, feel, smell, etc are all natural functionings of our Buddha-Nature's clarity. The sound of keyboard typing, words appearing on screen, are all expressions of that. But we are so caught up in the small ego story of the false self (along with the fear and dissatisfaction, etc) that we miss what we truly are -- Life in this moment expressing itself in all forms.</p>
              <p>Buddha-nature/awareness is aware of the thoughts that arises (and whether they are good and bad, and so on) and also aware of the gap between thoughts... a gap of no-mind which will increase/lenghthen as we practice. When practicing we become more aware of ourselves, its a non-judgmental awareness like a mirror in which everything from a single arising thought to the speck of dust passing in front of your eyes is revealed. Every arising sensation, perception and thought is arising in and AS the mirror. No inner-outer division. Everything IS awareness, an expression/functioning of awareness, and nothing is outside awareness.</p>
              <p>When pure awareness is experienced it's realised to be an impersonal energy, awareness expressing in the infinite forms. There's no 'I' or a 'me' at the center of it -- the ego (sense of a separate self) completely dissolve into this pure awareness. Here there is simply the pure experience itself, of everything, but without a perspective of a 'self' or a 'center', which has completely dissolved. Hence we should completely drop this self/center, and we will experience an expansion and immense liberation. Actually there never was a 'self', but due to our ignorance we continue to give our illusory sense of self an excessive sense of reality/solidity.</p>
              <p>When we maintain a mindful presence of awareness there is a natural seeing that does not abide. The mirror simply reflects everything as it is, non-judgementally, does not label things as good or bad. If an apple appears, its just apple reflected. If sound of crying appears, its just sound perceived. Just Isness. No duality between self and other, seer and seen -- in seeing and hearing there is only scenery, only sound; sound hears, thought thinks (no thinker or hearer).</p>
              <p>No traces ever 'stains' the mirror.<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> </span>All phenomena (whether pleasant or unpleasnt) never leave a trace in the mirror, arise and subsides in its own accord... transient and self-liberating, like painting on the surface of a pond... vividly clear and intantly gone. (See<a href="/forums/1728/topics/274492"> http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/274492</a>) But too often we get caught up in the appearances, believing in their 'absolute reality', believing in our illusions... hence this self-liberating nature is apparently obscured.</p>
              <p>As we rest in awareness, and stop giving our thoughts, stories, and experiences an excessive sense of solidity/reality, we see that everything is naturally 'letting go' as it arise by the very nature of impermanence -- arising and subsiding by itself in this vast empty awareness, and none of them matters or affects you... there is no 'you', only vast aware space that encompasses everything. Only an impersonal happening without a 'you' experiencing. There is a feeling of freedom and liberation from the confinement to the body/mind.</p>
              <p>This is also the end of endless chasing of "external forms" (which are just projections without reality). We can participate in the game of living but is aware that the appearances, though vividly experienced in awareness, are just actually like mirages, illusory, dependently co-arisen and thus empty. In seeing the unreality of it all there is no worries, anxiety, stress, and so on. You remain the peaceful, unmoved spacious awareness of the immediacy of life.</p>
              <p>Though I do not know much about Chuang Tzu and Taoism, there's a verse by Chuang Tzu which I think is good: “The perfect man employs his mind as a mirror. It grasps nothing; it refuses nothing; it receives but does not keep.”</p>
              <p>The mirror is our buddha-mind, which is a pure, all-encompassing, intrinsic awareness that has no form of its own and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. Everything is simply reflected as it is without labelling, discrimination, judgement, or grasping. It is as it is. 'It grasps nothing, it refuses nothing, it receives but does not keep'.</p>
              <p>So moment to moment we just drop all our attachments and experience in bare the immediate... whenever we caught ourselves in worrying/anxieties and so on, and we drop everything and rest in naked awareness... our primordial awareness/wisdom reveals itself like clouds dissipating to reveal the sun. What is experience here is the miracle of life. We surrender to/accept 'What Is' (which is not the same thing as 'giving up' or stop doing anything to achieve your goals, i.e. it is not passive, as actions can still arise in What Is, yet it may be seen that actions and deeds actually arise all along without a doer)</p>
              <p><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">.....</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>It's not that "I" hear the birds, it's just hearing the birds. Let yourself be seeing, hearing, thinking. That is what sitting is. It is the false "I" that interrupts the wonder with the constant desire to think about "I." <strong>And all the while the wonder is occurring, the birds sing, the cars go by, the body sensations continue, the heart beating - life is a second-by-second miracle, but dreaming our I-dreams we miss it.</strong> So let's just sit with what may seem like confusion. Just feel it, be it, appreciate it. Then we may more often see through the false dream which obscures our life. And then, what is there?<br><br>.....<br><br>What does it mean to shatter our usual way of seeing our life? My ordinary experience of life is centered around myself. After all, I am experiencing these ongoing impressions - I can't have your experience of your life. I always have my own. And what inevitably happens is that I come to believe that there is an "I" central to my life, since the experiences of my life seem to be centered around "I". "I" see, "I" hear, "I" feel, "I" think, "I" have this opinion. We rarely question this "I." Now in the enlightened state there is no "I"; there is simply life itself, a pulsation of timeless energy whose very nature includes -or is - everything.<br><br>.....<br><br>"Who is there?" asks God.<br>"It is I."<br>"Go away," God says...<br>Later...<br>"Who is there?" asks God.<br>"It is Thou."<br>"Enter," replies God.<br><br>..................<br><br>I have been asked, "Isn't observing a dualistic practice? Because when we are observing, something is observing something else." But in fact it's not dualistic. The observer is empty. Instead of a separate observer, we should say there is just observing. There is no one that hears, there is just hearing. There is no one that sees, there is just seeing. But we don't quite grasp that. if we practice hard enough, however, we learn that not only is the observer empty, but that which is observed is also empty. At this point the observer (or witness) collapses. This is the final stage of practice, we don't need to worry about it. Why does the observer finally collapse? <strong>When nothing sees nothing, what do we have? Just the wonder of life. There is no one who is separated from anything. There is just life living itself: hearing, touching, seeing, smelling, thinking. That is the state of love or compassion: not "It is I," but "It is Thou."</strong></span><br><br>~ Zen teacher, Charlotte Joko Beck, author of 'Everyday Zen'</p>

              <p>Hi GuanYu77,</p>
              <p>Tks so much for taking double effort in writting to me. I am a person with inquisite mind too, i like to find out things that interest me, although whether or not i will keep on doing the researching is another issue.</p>
              <p>Two months is nothing from my point of view when it is compared to my time of almost a year. I broke down a few times whenever i think about my situation. I hope so much that i can join the workforce, waking up early in the morning and then doing something, and end of hte day bringing in paycheck which i can then use to purchase things that i need.</p>
              <p>I am now using my past savings, and it is not fun seeing the amount keeps doing down every time when you do withdrawing.</p>
              <p>Lucky thing is that i do have friends that care for me and so i dont feel as if i am being all by myself, this will be a even more terrible feeling.</p>
              <p>I have read through your writting and will read through it again as i am getting a bit tired right now.</p>
              <p>Tks for your thoughts, and tks for taking the effort to write again to me!</p>
              <p>Once things settle down, perhaps we can meet!</p>
              <p>I wish you the best!</p>

              <p><span class="question">Vishrant</span>: ( long silence ).......All 
                                our lives we tend to embrace what gives us pleasure and try to push 
                                away that which gives us pain . This leads to stress as there are 
                                forever things we don't like to experience . Many years ago while 
                                experiencing a bout of depression I found myself trying to say no 
                                , i don't want this , anything but this. I became aware that the 
                                attempting to push this experience away was actually causing more 
                                pain than the depression itself . On seeing this i decided to go 
                                the opposite direction and allow the depression to be present. To 
                                let it be without trying in any way to change it. The depression 
                                was a part of this mind that could not be separate even though i 
                                had wanted it to be. I started to see the depression as a part of 
                                this personality that really needed acceptance and love, not rejection. 
                                In so doing this brought acceptance and love to this condition that 
                                i thought had been a plague. To my surprise i discovered that even 
                                in depression there is a sweetness, a beauty, a peace. The door 
                                was simply acceptance and love. I soon found that this door included 
                                all the emotional states i had previously considered negative and 
                                not welcome. What a blessing something so simply has been , to totally 
                                accept all of the personality , not just the parts considered good. 
                                What a beautiful sweetness in all . Acceptance of what is, is the 
                                answer.</p>

                                a form of imprisonment . So as these latent tendencies of the mind 
                                raise themselves you have the opportunity for freedom . There is

              <p>Hi Windflower,</p>
              <p>Wow, 1 year is indeed a long time without a career as compared to my 2 months. :p I am currently working parttime and waiting for my job applications to be approved (hopefully, though no news yet). Probably you can try working parttime to have some cashflow?</p>
              <p>Just to add what AEN has mentioned, everything around us is transient and non-existence. What I learnt after the "awakening" is that never never compare yourself with others. æ‰€è°““äººæ¯”äººï¼Œæ°”æ­»äºº”. Life is like a never-ending cycle when one starts to compare himself/herself with others. "Wow, that guy has a BMW! I must work hard to buy that car!" "It is so powerful to be a managing director! I must strive hard to reach that position!" What I realised is that alot of people are constantly struggling in this never ending cycle just to prove that they are indeed "better" than others. In the end, they are constantly unhappy and thinking of ways to further "improve" themselves. But how do we for sure know that this system of comparison is beneficial to oneself's inner happiness? Do you think that when one has achieve certain level of fame and fortune, one can be eternally happy?</p>
              <p>Probably let me share a story with you. Once there are 2 farmers. One farmer A is relaxing under a tree to enjoy the scenery after he had worked enough on his farm to provide for his family. The other farmer B is working and toiling endlessly to ensure that he can have a huge harvest.</p>
              <p>When farmer B saw farmer A resting, he said:"Why are you so lazy? You should work as hard as me!"</p>
              <p>Farmer A :"Why are you working so hard for?"</p>
              <p>Farmer B:"So as to have a good harvest!"</p>
              <p>Farmer A:"So why do you need a good harvest?"</p>
              <p>Farmer B:"So that I can sell it to the city for good money!"</p>
              <p>Farmer A:"But why do you need so much money?"</p>
              <p>Farmer B:"So that I can rest under the tree when I am old and relax!"</p>
              <p>From my point of view, our lifes are just like the story, a never-ending cycle of trying to fulfill expectations of others and working meaningless until one dies. To me, this kind of life is really meaningless and non-fruitful as one will never be able to find happiness in his life. If only one can just stop for the moment and realise that happiness can be acquire instantly and easily when one decides to forgo life's transient things, our world will be a much peaceful place to stay in.</p>
              <p>Please do not mistaken me that I am trying to point to you not to find a job. I am not that holy yet so I am not in any position to advise you on this issue. I am a believer of once you have a job, you have to work hard and play hard, with balance of life being the top priority, never overdo on either side. </p>
              <p>Personally, with my level of understanding, I find that to find that right balance in life, one has to let go of the emotional attachments to money &amp; status. They are both just empty shells which will definitely not guarantee you happiness. Live within one's means and we can still enjoy the wonders of life.</p>
              <p>Again, like what I had mentioned earlier, do not fret about tomorrow, as tomorrow will take care of itself. Do not think of the past, as one cannot change one's past. Focus on the present, and enjoy what life has to give to you. Worrying too much about the future will only deterioate your health both physically and mentally. Once you have done all you need to acquire a job, just relax and let nature takes its course. :)</p>
              <p>Sorry for being too lo so again. Haha! :p</p>

              <p>Hi, it is best not to self-learn meditation but to receive proper guidance lest one practices wrongly or have wrong understandings. The best is to learn form qualified Buddhist teacher... you can also read from books as long as the books are from orthodox Buddhist sources, not cults or non-buddhist sources which teach different meditations and thus does not lead to awakening or lead to different results.</p>
              <p>There are many Buddhist centers in Singapore that teaches meditation that you can learn from. As for books, I can recommend <a class="l" href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"><strong><strong>Mindfulness In Plain English</strong></strong></a></p>

              <p>Hi GuanYu77,</p>
              <p>Tks for your comments. I am infact working part time now in order to have some cash to buy things i need. But of course, i still hope that i can get into something more permanent and that something that i like to do. I want to develop a career on long term basis, so i dont really feel like going into doing something which i dont feel/see the future.</p>
              <p>It is ok if i were to start from something more basis, as long as i can see the development potential in hte company. I am infact asking a relative of mine to help pull the string. I have been through the first round interview met up with the Executive Director, his comment is ok.</p>
              <p>This string is a bit complicated - My relative know a person (A) who was his ex-colleague before. She is one of hte pionners there. My relative mentioned to her about my situation and she was very willing to help and so she arranged an interview which i have passed. The problem is, however, there is no exact fit between the current positions available within the company and my background, so i guess the executive director was i think just leaving my case KIV.</p>
              <p>A week later i approached my relative again telling him that i really would like to work there, even starting from something more basic. I see hte potential working there and so i dont mind a lower post. I think this is better than working in places i dont like, or working on part-time basis, cos both situations are not going to bring long-term solution.</p>
              <p>(A) received the message and so according to her she would make some 'arrangements' talking to hte departmental head (there was infact till now 6 persons within the comapny that have left, chances are higher but as my background does not provide exact match, there may seem to be a problem for them, in any case, (A) has mentioned that she will teach me if i manage to come in).</p>
              <p>I know to get a job through other ways would be more long-winded so i kind of pin my hopes in this. Really hope that things will materialise........</p>
              <p>This relative of mine infact knows the CEO (the biggest man) of hte company. But he does not really want to use this king-card, he mentioned. Things are really out of my control. I want to see result here, but i cant push too hard.</p>
              <p>Any idea you have about this that I can do to maximise my chance?</p>
              <p>btw, i dont mind you asking question using my thread. Infact, i welcome this. Not a problem.</p>

              <p>Hi GuanYu77,</p>
              <p>Tks for your comments. I am infact working part time now in order to have some cash to buy things i need. But of course, i still hope that i can get into something more permanent and that something that i like to do. I want to develop a career on long term basis, so i dont really feel like going into doing something which i dont feel/see the future.</p>
              <p>It is ok if i were to start from something more basis, as long as i can see the development potential in hte company. I am infact asking a relative of mine to help pull the string. I have been through the first round interview met up with the Executive Director, his comment is ok.</p>
              <p>This string is a bit complicated - My relative know a person (A) who was his ex-colleague before. She is one of hte pionners there. My relative mentioned to her about my situation and she was very willing to help and so she arranged an interview which i have passed.

              <p>(A) received the message and so according to her she would make some 'arrangements' talking to hte departmental head (there was infact till now 6 persons within the comapny that have left, chances are higher but as my background does not provide exact match, there may seem to be a problem for them, in any case, (A) has mentioned that she will teach me if i manage to come in).</p>
              <p>I know to get a job through other ways would be more long-winded so i kind of pin my hopes in this. Really hope that things will materialise........</p>
              <p>This relative of mine infact knows the CEO (the biggest man) of hte company. But he does not really want to use this king-card, he mentioned. Things are really out of my control. I want to see result here, but i cant push too hard.</p>
              <p>Any idea you have about this that I can do to maximise my chance?</p>
              <p>btw, i dont mind you asking question using my thread. Infact, i welcome this. Not a problem.</p>

              <p>Hi GuanYu77,</p>
              <p>Tks for your comments. I am infact working part time now in order to have some cash to buy things i need. But of course, i still hope that i can get into something more permanent and that something that i like to do. I want to develop a career on long term basis, so i dont really feel like going into doing something which i dont feel/see the future.</p>
              <p>It is ok if i were to start from something more basis, as long as i can see the development potential in hte company. I am infact asking a relative of mine to help pull the string. I have been through the first round interview met up with the Executive Director, his comment is ok.</p>
              <p>This string is a bit complicated - My relative know a person (A) who was his ex-colleague before. She is one of hte pionners there. My relative mentioned to her about my situation and she was very willing to help and so she arranged an interview which i have passed. The problem is, however, there is no exact fit between the current positions available within the company and my background, so i guess the executive director was i think just leaving my case KIV.</p>

              <p>Hi Windflower,</p>
              <p>I am not an expert in advising how to acquire jobs as I am in the same situation as you are haha.</p>
              <p>From your context, probably you can just wait for the company to get back to you. (See.... I dun have any good suggestions haha) Just do your best not to have any emotional attachments like what you have mentioned: "pinning your hopes" as such emotions will drag you down if the results turn out to be otherwise.</p>
              <p>You can try to apply for more jobs that appears on the newspaper?</p>
              <p>Or you can try Fengshui audit to your place to improve your luck? I am not in any position to comment about this ancient method as I am not an expert in this area. For me, so long as the practice is not unethical or morally unacceptable, plus many famous practitioners, like our local "å®�èˆ¹æ³•å¸ˆ", have seemed to help alot of people through this method, no harm trying right?</p>
              <p>If really still can't find a job, cut cut and cut down on expenses. Sometimes, I find it funny because when I was a student, my expenses never exceed $300 a month. Now when I am working part time, my expenses are so much higher although I have cut down alot of useless expenses. :p So long can eat, sleep and play with the pay check, why worry? :) Of course, dun overspend lah, muz have savings... (I always amazed at how the simple idea of "balance in life" can be applied to so many areas in our life. Money management is also one of them)</p>
              <p>By the way, are there external factors like family expectations, peer pressure, social status, shame to family if jobless, etc, that is "pressing" you to "find a job"? If yes, these are again like what I mentioned, "external factors" which should not interfere with your emotions.</p>
              <p>From my point of view, again, the root source of your "worries" seemed to be these emotional attachments to such empty "external factors". I have mentioned before these are just illusions and empty shells which in the first place should not have the ability to interfere with one's thoughts, unless one chooses to put them into their minds. Hope you can slowly let go of these pressures and lead a happy life :)</p>
              <p>Dun worry, I was like you before, always full of "worries". It takes time to cultivate your mind to throw away these gabbage.</p>
              <p>May you find peace and happiness :)</p>

              <p>Yup, probably I have stated wrongly in my previous message the concept of æ— ä¸ºæ— ä¸�ä¸º. Sorry about this.</p>
              <p>Probably I often read about this concept in Mandarin plus my written English is not so good. Thats why I might have left out the core concept of é�“. Sorry sorry....</p>
              <p>You sounded very unhappy about my misintepretation. Please dun be angry with me ok? As I am still learning about this profound idea. Cheers! :)</p>

              <p>Cycle, you are right in saying that you are not me and hence you dont feel how i feel - I have been in the job search for nearly 1 year and so it is not fun. In situation like this human beings resort to other ways which they hope can get them out of hte situation.</p>
              <p>One question that i would like to have reply on - how i can reach dharma teacher? I have asked this twice but have yet to receive any reply.</p>
              <p>btw, an-eternal-now, is it true that chanting namo ao-ni-to-fo will create 'brightness' around our bodies? Or, in chinese called 'guai'?</p>

              <p>Buddhism is about purifying your mind not those nonsense. Guan Yin stands for compassion, therefore is not god. Just be brave and walk on. With persistent and hardwork, you will find your job. don't get into these medium thing. It's not Buddhism</p>

              <p><br>Hi werther,</p>
              <p>I am no master in this area like what rokkie had pointed out before. I am just a beginner like you :)</p>
              <p>What I like to stress is that we should do our best to support others who are emotionally down as this is, from my point of view, what we humans existed in the first place.</p>
              <p>We are born not to create wars, unhappiness, etc, with others. We are born to create peace and harmony, have respect to others and fillial piety to the elders and parents, to help others who are in need. This has always been the important aspects of life that many have thrown away due to the pursuit of so-called "materialistic happiness" in life and often losing our innate compassion for life in the process.</p>
              <p>Hope we can learn from each other too :)</p>
