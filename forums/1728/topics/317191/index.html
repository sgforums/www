              <p>I am writting this in the hope that I can reach you - An Eternal Now...</p>
              <p>Recently i have been pretty puzzled by the relationship between buddhism and medium - those who claim to have god's power, and those who claim to be able to predict the future and know the past.</p>
              <p>I personally am not really into religion. But recently I have been having quite a bit of problems with my job search and through a friend of mine I came to know a man who claim to have powers of "Thousand Hands Kuan Yin".</p>
              <p>He worship 'Thousand Hands Kuan Yin" and (I think) "Toa Pei Gong" in his house. He stays with his wife, his father, children and one grandson in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I have been to his place four times, all asking about my job search. I do not wish to go into details cos it can be pretty lengthy. But in general, for some, he can say it well - like, when he looks at my palm, he says that i have back problem (during hte first visit), which is pretty right, cos i have problem with my back (nerves issues) and feel pains when i turn my body around even in bed. Now the situation is better.</p>
              <p>He made prediction on my job search, which didnt come true and this is how the story starts - He came to my house, and the conclusion is that my gate door is not good and so all the goods lucks are blocked away. He asked us to plant a coconut tree in front of our house, and also to shift our ancestor's table........</p>
              <p>The main point is that, later on, he said that he could help by passing over a jade to me, which has been 'kai guan'. This I have collected.</p>
              <p>On the same day, he looked at both my palms again and said that my job would not come that fast, it most probably will be in August (chinese's calender), I was so sad htat i burst into tears.</p>
              <p>At hte same time, he also said that my life would go downhill. My health is not going to be good after my marriage and that even if i get married, there may be divorce later on.</p>
              <p>THEN, he mentioned to me about the 'cleansing' thing - that he can perform a ritual on me that my life will be good later on. He said that the first three months i will be feeling sick cos that is hte time all hte bad things will 'leave' my body . He also said that my life will only be average for the beginning three years, but later on it will be good.</p>
              <p>I was feeling not comfortable with this idea cos i have heard of bad things like this. I asked him how it would be like and etc which he replies as that it can be a bit 'inconveient' cos I need to be naked but the important parts will be covered. He said that some things are needed, such as preparation of flowers etc but he also said that these he can prepare.</p>
              <p>He ever mention that we can do it in my family which I rejected upfront cos with my family staying with me this is quite impossible. Then he mentioend about those hostels on hourly charge....</p>
              <p>I think i have said things long enough and now I would like to hear from you - An Ethernal Now - what is your thoughts on this as you seem to know quite a bit about Buddishim.</p>
              <p>I chanced upon a line which you wrote about "guan yin" that those could be "ghost-deity"..</p>
              <p>I have talked to a friend of mine who said that these so-called mediums have 'kumonthong" (evil baby) that helps them, is this true?</p>
              <p>He always ask us to read "Na mo O Ni Tuo Fo" in our heart. He said that this will invite good things into our lives. Is this true?</p>
              <p>I look forward to your thoughts!</p>

              <p>What I meant is that many mediums that claim to be communicating with Guan Yin is actually communicating with spirits but is not really 'Guan Yin'.</p>
              <p>As for what the medium advised you to do, I have no comments... I think you should ask my dharma teacher and she will give you better answers.</p>
              <p>As for chanting Namo Amituofuo, it is true that this habit of chanting is very beneficial. See <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no2e.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no2e.htm</a></p>

              <p>Pls don't go.</p>
              <p>There are many ways and solutions to life's problems. Just my intuition, don't go for such cleansing... being naked and in hotel and who knows what...</p>
              <p>Just don't go.</p>
              <p>Most probably becos I 'm not in a dire situations as yours now, so maybe i could see the danger more clearly. Sometimes when we are trapped in a predicament, we tend to be blinded by our own desperations to be able to think clearly and logically. This is normal for many ppl. So pls calm down first.</p>
              <p>Yes, pls try to chant " namo ambituofo" slowly, clearly in your heart. Breathe slowly and deeply. yes, can try to get in touch with AEN's teacher.</p>
              <p>May you be well and fine. Be patient, don't panic, then you can see a way out...  </p>

              <p>Our original nature/buddha-nature is innately luminous, its empty-luminous-awareness. But due to our defilements and ignorance, there is 'darkness'... just like clouds temporarily obscuring the sky or the sun. The sun and the vast sky is always there, but temporarily obscured by the clouds, so the brightness does not 'manifest'.</p>
              <p>Awareness and wisdom is like brightness... </p>

                                refers to what our body feels. For example, we don't feel well when we are 
                                ill, or we may feel that something is amiss with a particular person. These 
                                are feelings. They are the responses of our body when our six sense organs 
                                (six roots), namely, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind come into contact 
                                with sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and the occurrence of a phenomenon 
                                (six dirt's) respectively. <br> <br> Awareness does not depend on the six sense organs but on our own wisdom. 
                                A person who has awareness is aware of all matters and phenomena. Awareness 
                                takes notice of all matters and phenomena but it does not give rise to any 
                                mental delusions. When all delusions have been purified, it gives rise to 
                                a kind of brightness and this is called brightness-awareness. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Vesak day is coming and it is a wonderful day to gain merits. It is said that the merits that are done on that day has an effect of 10,000 times more.</p>
              <p>What i could suggest is you go temple and give dana ( any amounts as you deemed is suitable ). How about going to Buddha Tooth relics temple and pray for blessing and good luck. Turn the dharma Prayer wheel which is located on the top ot the temple 7 times clockwise. There are plently of dharma activites on Vesak day which included blessing of relics, dharma talk and also a good chance to give dana to highly-esteemed monks.</p>

              <p>I'm a skeptic towards the medium, frankly. There are stories about how medium con victims into sexual intercourse. Please don't go on the safe side.</p>
              <p>Chanting Namo Amituofo and Namo Guan shi yin could help, esp when you are in dire trouble or any other time when you feel like it.</p>
              <p>May you have peace, be well and happy.</p>

                                    everything in the room can be seen. But our mind is often dark; it lacks

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">From day to night, 
                                  at every moment, the human mind is engaged in ceaseless thoughts which 
                                  are infinite. These distracting and illusory thoughts are our inner sentient 
                                  being. Thus, the sentient beings in this world and in this universe are 
                                  infinite because in every person’s mind the inner sentient being 
                                  is infinite. Buddhism therefore advocates guiding these infinite minds, 
                                  these infinite sentient beings to the path of Enlightenment. <br> <br> Sentient being is synonymous with darkness; brightness is synonymous with 
                                  wisdom. When we constantly eliminate our own inner sentient being, and 
                                  maintain a state where the inner sentient being does not exist, then we 
                                  attain brightness. From this, everybody can understand the way to guide 
                                  sentient beings to the path of Enlightenment. When you don’t have 
                                  even a single distracting thought in your mind, then it means that you 
                                  have overcome your sentient being. When you maintain in this state forever, 
                                  it proves that you have eliminated your inner sentient being. If every 
                                  person knows about guiding his own inner sentient being, then there will 
                                  be many Bodhisattvas in this world. In future, there will be numerous 
                                  Bodhisattvas coming to this world to guide the other sentient beings. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">What is Bodhisattva? 
                                  When one has already eliminated his own inner sentient being and can see 
                                  that his mind is purified, then this is called the Bodhisattva. When we 
                                  have not reined in the sentient being in our mind and we are fuzzy, then 
                                  we cannot think of guiding the other sentient beings. That is impossible. 
                                  That is, “a sentient being guiding another sentient being”. 
                                  To be a Bodhisattva is a quicker way to guide sentient beings to the path 
                                  of Enlightenment. If the mind is free of distracting and illusory thoughts 
                                  and is completely purified, then you will know how to guide all sentient 
                                  beings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This is an expedient 
                                  way to become a Bodhisattva. Let us not engage in distracting and illusory 
                                  thoughts anymore. Let us guide our own inner sentient beings first, and 
                                  then the other sentient beings.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: normal;"> In contrast, when we are cultivating the Great Dharma, 
                                  during meditation we extinguish this transient-invisible-body. By the 
                                  non-arising (and therefore non-cessation) of the mind the sentient being 
                                  inside you no longer exists. We thereby awake our own Buddha-nature. At 
                                  this point the transient-invisible-body is extinguished by the brightness 
                                  of Buddha-nature. This is because the transient-invisible-body gathers 
                                  darkness, and when we have awakened our Buddha-nature, brightness will 
                                  manifest and the transient-invisible-body naturally disappears. <br> <br> The human being’s seventh mind-consciousness is the “I”. 
                                  Because of “I”, it gives rise to “my”. Because 
                                  of “me”, it gives rise to self-attachment, followed by attachment 
                                  of perception such as “I like it this way …” or “I 
                                  like it that way …” In the end, people become attached to 
                                  everything, be it right or wrong. This is the root cause of distress and 
                                  suffering. “Ignorance” means darkness and without brightness. 
                                  People lose their temper because of ignorance. If we investigate the reason 
                                  for being angry, at the beginning most people will blame it on others. 
                                  On further investigation, we will discover that the anger stems from self-ignorance. 
                                  When we have understood this principle, we will realize that these are 
                                  due to this “I” (seventh mind-consciousness, transient-invisible 
                                  body). Therefore if we allow it (the ignorance) to further develop and 
                                  lead according to the wishes of this “I”, we will certainly 
                                  descend to a lower realm of life, because the root of this “I” 
                                  is ignorance.</span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: normal;">...When we practise 
                                  the Great Dharma, we spontaneously transform our seventh mind-consciousness 
                                  or “transient-invisible-body” into light. That light is the 
                                  same as the quintessence of Buddha. When we stop breathing, our breath 
                                  actually diffuses into space and becomes an integral part of space. Thus, 
                                  if we are skilful in practising the Great Dharma, we do not have the “transient-invisible-body”. 
                                  It is transformed into brightness and returned to the quintessence of 
                                  Buddha of the Dharma World. This brightness is not the sunlight. It is 
                                  also not the brightness of a lamp, but the quintessence of Buddha (known 
                                  as ?? [Ji-Guang] in Mandarin). </span></p>
               <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;">When our mind is completely pure, devoid of arising and 
                                  ceasing of thoughts, it naturally produces brightness. Our brightness 
                                  is the same as that of all Buddha’s and Bodhisattva’s. At 
                                  that point in time, we should not ask, “Where am I going?” 
                                  It is because sentient beings have this habit of self attachment, the 
                                  moment thoughts pertaining to the self arise, such as “Where am 
                                  I?”, or “What is happening to my possessions?” arise, 
                                  it produces the transient-invisible-body again and transmigration will 
                                  take place</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;">When our brightness merges with the brightness of Buddha, 
                                  we become a “greater self” in the quintessence of the universe 
                                  and no longer the “little self” of an ordinary being. The 
                                  quintessence of Buddha is the real self, whereas the self of an ordinary 
                                  being is false. </span></p>

                              advantages in taking refuge. If you were to ask somebody about the advantages of going to
                              university, he will tell you about the many advantages: you can become an engineer or a
                              doctor after graduating from the university. There is an enormous amount of knowledge,
                              principles and theories which one would be able to understand when one goes to university.
                              It is the same with taking refuge. The many things which we do not understand before,
                              become clear to us when we have unfold our wisdom after taking refuge to learn Buddhism.
                              Being without wisdom is like the night, the room is dark and we do not know how many
                              people are in it. With wisdom is like turning on the light, with one look we know what is
                              in the room and how many people are there. Turning on the light is analogous to the
                              brightness in our mind. With brightness we can understand many things. These are the
                              advantages of taking refuge, learning Buddhism and unfolding our wisdom.</span></strong></td>

              <p>I received your PM, tks.</p>
              <p>The "guai" is now i think spelt a bit wrongly that is why all this confusion. I was told by that medium that he could see if one has "guain1" around their bodies and ppl can 'accumulate' that through chanting 'namo-o-ni-to-fo'.</p>
              <p>According to your understanding, is it true -</p>
              <p>1. True that through chanting, a person can accumulate this kind of 'brightness' around him/her</p>
              <p>2. And, this 'brightness' can help a person in achieving his/her goal?</p>
              <p>I have your contact for your teacher, how should i introduce myself? Saying that I am brought to her by you through this forum? And, I can ask her almost everything? Especially how i can help myself out of this situation?</p>
              <p>To all,</p>
              <p>To my amazement many ppl drop their thoughts towards this topic over a short time span of around 2 hours. I appreciate so much for your time.</p>
              <p>There seems to be a lot of infomration that has been given to this topic, I will read through it.</p>

              <p>I am writting this in the hope that I can reach you - An Eternal Now...</p>
              <p>Recently i have been pretty puzzled by the relationship between buddhism and medium - those who claim to have god's power, and those who claim to be able to predict the future and know the past.</p>
              <p>I personally am not really into religion. But recently I have been having quite a bit of problems with my job search and through a friend of mine I came to know a man who claim to have powers of "Thousand Hands Kuan Yin".</p>
              <p>He worship 'Thousand Hands Kuan Yin" and (I think) "Toa Pei Gong" in his house. He stays with his wife, his father, children and one grandson in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I have been to his place four times, all asking about my job search. I do not wish to go into details cos it can be pretty lengthy. But in general, for some, he can say it well - like, when he looks at my palm, he says that i have back problem (during hte first visit), which is pretty right, cos i have problem with my back (nerves issues) and feel pains when i turn my body around even in bed. Now the situation is better.</p>
              <p>He made prediction on my job search, which didnt come true and this is how the story starts - He came to my house, and the conclusion is that my gate door is not good and so all the goods lucks are blocked away. He asked us to plant a coconut tree in front of our house, and also to shift our ancestor's table........</p>
              <p>The main point is that, later on, he said that he could help by passing over a jade to me, which has been 'kai guan'. This I have collected.</p>
              <p>On the same day, he looked at both my palms again and said that my job would not come that fast, it most probably will be in August (chinese's calender), I was so sad htat i burst into tears.</p>
              <p>At hte same time, he also said that my life would go downhill. My health is not going to be good after my marriage and that even if i get married, there may be divorce later on.</p>
              <p>THEN, he mentioned to me about the 'cleansing' thing - that he can perform a ritual on me that my life will be good later on. He said that the first three months i will be feeling sick cos that is hte time all hte bad things will 'leave' my body . He also said that my life will only be average for the beginning three years, but later on it will be good.</p>
              <p>I was feeling not comfortable with this idea cos i have heard of bad things like this. I asked him how it would be like and etc which he replies as that it can be a bit 'inconveient' cos I need to be naked but the important parts will be covered. He said that some things are needed, such as preparation of flowers etc but he also said that these he can prepare.</p>
              <p>He ever mention that we can do it in my family which I rejected upfront cos with my family staying with me this is quite impossible. Then he mentioend about those hostels on hourly charge....</p>
              <p>I think i have said things long enough and now I would like to hear from you - An Ethernal Now - what is your thoughts on this as you seem to know quite a bit about Buddishim.</p>
              <p>I chanced upon a line which you wrote about "guan yin" that those could be "ghost-deity"..</p>
              <p>I have talked to a friend of mine who said that these so-called mediums have 'kumonthong" (evil baby) that helps them, is this true?</p>
              <p>He always ask us to read "Na mo O Ni Tuo Fo" in our heart. He said that this will invite good things into our lives. Is this true?</p>
              <p>I look forward to your thoughts!</p>

              <p>Windflower, pls treat whatever bad things you're experiencing now as bad karma accumulated previously.  But you can take heart that bad karma will be expiated.  You can also be sure that when your mind becomes pure and compassionate, things will also become better for you. </p>
              <p>No need to go to any temple or even turn the prayer wheel.  Only you can change your destiny by becoming a better person.  Of course, I do encourage you to recite some mantras (e.g the great compassion mantra) to cultivate your Bodhi and compasionate heart.  Also pls do not expect any things in return for doing all these.  They will come naturally.</p>
              <p>I hope the best for you.</p>
