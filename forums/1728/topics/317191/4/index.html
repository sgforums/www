              <p>Hi GuanYu77,</p>
              <p>Tks for your return mail.</p>
              <p>You are right in saying that tying our expectations on something may create disappointments, as we expect certain results.</p>
              <p>I do try checking on various sources - internet, newspapers, etc and also contacting my friends for job opportunities, and all these did produce results, but NOT the exact result - ie, got a job at hte end - that i wanted.</p>
              <p>Yes, something could be wrong about what i said over the interviews, but looking backwards, we only know that it is wrong when we look back. Right? When we dont get call after 2 days, we know that we have said something wrong. For isntance, in one interview, i was asked what is my long term career goal, which i answered as that i want to get into more of hte strategy, planning roles later one after  a few years. The guy then said that it could be that there will be no such role after about 5 years time. When i talked to my friend later, she said that i should have said....this and that.</p>
              <p>Never forget that when it comes to interview, we are dealing with subjective factors, including things such as if we are able to built rapport with the other party. Sometimes you dont just get to do that, so who's fault is that? If that interviewer just have a bad hair day on that particular day, whoes fault is that?</p>
              <p>That is why i hope much that i could get something out of that lead, cos that should be easier.......</p>
              <p>Can you tell me where can i locate 'hon juah' master (sorry i dont know how to type in chinese)?</p>
              <p>Tks!</p>

              <p>Yup, probably I have stated wrongly in my previous message the concept of æ— ä¸ºæ— ä¸�ä¸º. Sorry about this.</p>
              <p>Probably I often read about this concept in Mandarin plus my written English is not so good. Thats why I might have left out the core concept of é�“. Sorry sorry....</p>

              <p><br>Hi werther,</p>
              <p>I am no master in this area like what rokkie had pointed out before. I am just a beginner like you :)</p>
              <p>What I like to stress is that we should do our best to support others who are emotionally down as this is, from my point of view, what we humans existed in the first place.</p>
              <p>We are born not to create wars, unhappiness, etc, with others. We are born to create peace and harmony, have respect to others and fillial piety to the elders and parents, to help others who are in need. This has always been the important aspects of life that many have thrown away due to the pursuit of so-called "materialistic happiness" in life and often losing our innate compassion for life in the process.</p>
              <p>Hope we can learn from each other too :)</p>

              <p><br>In fact i never trust the fengshui thing,because i read up i ching ,i never found a single bit matter with fengshui.It's just a tactical thing build at later stage ,but they say they root in i ching,which i think it's not ture.As i said i feel that it's just a way for entertainment,nothing big deal.And i have once read up some stuff on internet about fengshui.You luck is decided by é˜´å®… ï¼Œé˜³å®…ã€‚</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I guess when it comes to fengsui, just like many other issues, we are left with unsure minds. How do we know if it works or not, perhaps, even the practitioners cant be sure.</p>
              <p>Specifically when it comes to feng sui, for instance, how do you know what you have set up according to hte fengsui masters really work? When your life gets better, it could be attributed by the merits that you hvae done, it could be that you feel good after the visit and you do something different that is what actually bring in the good things? Who knows?</p>
              <p>FengSui, some believe in it, some dont. For me, I half-believe in it.</p>
              <p>There are many fengsui masters in the world, it is really hard to name or to find one unless we get info from friends, or friend's friends, who have engaged the service and have solid proof of success.</p>
              <p>But anyway, welcome anyone who knows any such good master. I may engage their service later on.</p>

              <p>I see as it is all in the mind. If you see somethings powerful and when you are super-believing in it, you are probably bestowing power to itself. You might be fufilling the self-prophecies act when it is actually nothing in the first place.</p>
              <p>Sometime, we do not understand what is karma and thus creating bad karma for ourselves. For instances, killing livestocks/buying non-vegetarian food  to pray for the deceased is actually creating bad karma for the deceased.</p>
              <p>Fengshui, is a form of science. It is common sense in terms of furniture arrangement and sometime, for good interior design. It also makes one feel more comfortable after doing the ritual.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>Let me recall what I wrote just now.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>I am a Free Thinker and I am an inquisitive individual. I like to read and find out about spiritual and personal well-being. I have read a little on Christianity, Islamic teachings. Recently, I am reading topics on Buddhism and Taoism and I really like the findings. I am also curious and read a little about BaZi analysis. What I had learnt is that we are living in a world full of emotions. So how can we find inner peace and happiness? Learn to “let go” of cravings for worldly belongings (like what Buddhism preaches) and set your heart free! In this way, you can truly find inner happiness. Taoism preaches the idea of “</span></span><span style="font-family: SimSun;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;">æ— ä¸º</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>” where one self must live in harmony and balance in life. So I am not saying you have to laze around and give up hopes of finding a job. Just learn to be happy and spend quality time to do things you like, for eg, walk your dog, accompany your love ones, etc. Focus on “happiness now” and let go of the worries. Then nature and balance of life will take care of you.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>Personally, I am currently in a situation like you. I am looking for a job for the past 2 months and I had not succeeded.

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>The topic that opens my mind is when the professor mentioned about “</span></span><span style="font-family: SimSun;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;">è§‰æ‚Ÿ</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>”<span>. In these Chinese characters, we can clearly see “</span></span></span><span style="font-family: SimSun;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;">å�¾è§�å¿ƒ</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>” <span>which can literally mean “I see my heart”.”</span></span></span> <span style="font-family: SimSun;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;">è§‰</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>” is an awakening process which happens instantly at that very moment, and”</span></span> <span style="font-family: SimSun;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: SimSun;">æ‚Ÿ</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>” means awakening through experience and learning. I had been searching, for many years, for inner happiness through means of acquiring more wealth and material things but was not able to find inner peace at all. It was recently when I started studying Buddhism and Taoism when I start to realize the power of awakening. And when I watched the show, at that very moment I was able to find my inner peace because I listen to my heart. We just need to focus on happiness and let go of the worldly cravings in life. I am not sure how to explain to you, but I believe you will be able to find yours soon</span></span> <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>yup, agree that there are many fengshui masters around.<br>There are also many unskillful fengshui "master" around. I not saying they cheat people's money, but it is rather difficult to master in this area.<br>I personally know a monk that is really good in fengshui.

              <p>I agree with what you say. But i dont know why some buddhist say that sutras say like :"If you build a buddha statue out of gold and fine materials, you will receive good karma and so on" and they claim this to be what buddha said. But im very sure buddha did not told us to build something so extraordinary made up of gold just to venerate or worship him. He would be very glad that we use the money to save lives and do more charitable activities.</p>

              <p>To answer your question, Master Venerable Chin Kung once said
                                      that the objective of building Buddha statue is to remind us of his
                                      teachings and to be good. Statue in general, does not posses any
                                      power or so. Building and constructing Buddha statue can influence
                                      people in thinking that the Buddha is great. When we look upon the
                                      Buddha, most people would not dare to commit crimes, being afraid
                                      of punishments. You can see how a statue can influence people into
                                      doing good, hence reaping positive karam to the person who has
                                      constructed or build it. The Buddha statue is also a kind of symbol
                                      of Buddhism. Why are there so many people claiming that there are
                                      ultimate powers in the statue or amulet? It's very simple. Human
                                      are consistently manupulate many different ideologies for business
                                      aims. They claim that by letting their master or what-so-ever bless
                                      the statue, it will be filled with auspicious power. Let me ask you
                                      a very logical question, if the person claim that it can be blessed
                                      by himself/herself, aren't they claiming that they are stronger and
                                      more auspicious than the statue? However, for the amulet issue, it
                                      depends on what kind of amulet. There are thousands of amulets
                                      claimed by different people who said it possess different
                                      protection. I have not research on that yet but, there is an amulet
                                      which will never be a fraud one, that is, The Surangama Mantra.</p>

              <p>Yes youre right. I agree that there are many people claiming there are ultimate powers in statues or amulet just to make money. Statues arent bad, but they are misused by people</p>
