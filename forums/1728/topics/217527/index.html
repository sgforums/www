            <div class='col-md body'>My family and I have been Therevadan Buddhists for sometime but we were first introduced to Buddhism via Chinese Gelugpa. We used to be fervent devotees of the association, even setting up a shrine specially for (the controversial) Dorje Shungden on the advice of the chief rinpoche.<br><br>It has been half a decade since we moved to Therevada Buddhism but the shrine of Dorje Shungden still remain in the household.<br><br>On the advice of many Buddhist friends online and offline, I was encouraged to remove the shrine and return all religious artefacts and books relating to the sect back. I have always procrastinated but did so this evening.<br><br>My parents being traditional, felt that since the household has been fine and peaceful, there shouldn't be any reason why we should remove it. Even our Therevadan Bhante felt that it was fine to leave the shrine there as long as we don't seek any favours from it.<br><br>As I am not well-versed with Vajrayana Buddhism, I would like to seek my fellow brothers and sisters in the Dhamma on how to deal with this situation. As my family is quite uneasy with this episode, I would hope that someone can guide me as I would like to return all the artefacts back to the association tomorrow.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi it's best to remove the shrine, since Shugden is harmful to the Dharma. Even though your family is no longer following the path, it'll probably be best that there be as little connection as possible between your family and Shugden. Perhaps you could consider returning the shrine to the organization. Otherwise, as bohiruci sugg, perhaps you can seek advice from Charitable Assistance Society, or Amitabha Buddhist Centre.<br><br>Gelugpa is itself a school that is full of wisdom and skilful means. Unfortunately,  many Shugden-associated orgs use names like "Chinese Gelugpa" or other common Buddhist names and start to confuse people. They also typically start off with teaching basic buddhism, then eventually intro the Shugden practice. In S'pore, currently the two known Shugden groups are "Gelugpa Buddhist Association (Singapore)" and "Oddiyana Buddhist Meditation Society". One should really try to keep one's path away from them.<br><br>You may read more information from HH Dalai Lama's office: http://www.dalailama.com/page.132.htm<br><br>Hope the above would be helpful for you.<br><br>May you and your family be continually guided by the Dharma. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Thanks for the replies..well... guess what...<br>I was still lazing in bed and my parents just went straight ahead and sent back all the portraits and scriptures and amulets with regrads to Dorje Shugden.<br><br>We have no plans for a Vajrayana priest to come and help cleanse if there is a need to but I'[ll leave it up to fate if we ever chance upon a lama to do so.<br><br>In the meantime, nothing can harm my household as long as we have faith and devotiong in the teachings of Lord Buddha.<br><br>That's the most powerful refuge you can ever find in the universe!</div>
