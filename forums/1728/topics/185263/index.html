This group came to my<br>attention about a year ago when they started posting their<br>Harvest Newsletter to a Theravadin list that I was moderating.<br>You correctly note that their language is more like that of<br>Evangelical Christianity than Buddhism. But this is more than a<br>mere coincidence. I noticed one day that several of the<br>'scriptural verses' they quoted seemed very familiar. Searching<br>Google I found that they had just taken some verses from one of<br>St. Paul's Epistles and changed a few words to make them seem<br>vaguely Buddhist. With further searching I discovered that nearly<br>everything in the Newsletter was plagiarised from Christian<br>websites with small changes (e.g. changing 'Jesus' to 'Buddha').<br><br>If you read any of their past newsletters, pick out a few key<br>phrases and search Google you will nearly always come to a<br>Christian article that is nearly identical. A couple of examples:<br><br>Compare the "intercession prayer" here:<br><br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TheMonthlyHarvest/message/168<br><br>with the "prayer to conquer fear" here:<br><br>http://shaun99.freeservers.com/aprayer.htm<br><br>Compare Pst Jack Chia's article "Is Money Power?"<br><br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TheMonthlyHarvest/message/128<br><br>with a Christian article, also called "Is Money Power?"<br><br>http://www.lasan.org/meditations/daily-bre...b-0%20(187).htm<br><br>Buddhist:<br>"Money is power." That principle drives most cultures of the<br>world.

He<br>had power to Teach, and He taught for 45 years for the goodwill<br>of all sentient beings. He had power over the universe, and He<br>became the Teacher of all gods and men.

            <div class='col-md body'>so..... it was afterall a christianised buddhist practice culture in PYC......<br><br>after analysing their "sermon" section, they use the word "pastors"....? but frankly honestly... i have never come across in any buddhist stories or scriptures mentioning the word pastor or any translation to the word pastor....<br><br>the word evangelist.... all are so very "christianity" which you can read from the url....<br><br>their efforts and intentions seemed good to spread the dharma for the benefit of people but i feel the appropriate way is essential as to not to mislead people from misintepretating the teachings of the dharma because that's the worst "crime" one has to pay for misguiding people .....wrongly.<br><br></div>
