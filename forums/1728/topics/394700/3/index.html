              <p>Allow me to quote this story from Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows Sutra:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Moreover, long and infinite aeons ago, Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes came 
              into the world. This Buddha’s lifespan is forty aeons. The immortal 
              Buddha, Pure-Lotus-Eyes existed during the Dharma-Image Age – at the 
              time when images were used for worship. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There was an arahant who 
              instructed many people little by little with his fortunate merits. <strong>This 
              arahant met a woman, Bright Eyes, who prepared sacrificial offerings for 
              him. The arahant asked her what she wanted.</strong> Bright Eyes answered, “I have 
              prayed and given offerings in memory of my mother since the day she 
              died. I wish to know where my mother is now.” <strong>The arahant felt compassion 
              for Bright Eyes. He meditated and saw that her mother had fallen into an
               evil level and had suffered great pain.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The arahant asked Bright Eyes, “What did your mother do when she was 
              alive? She is now suffering in hell.” Bright Eyes answered, “My mother 
              loved eating fish, especially baby fish. She fried or boiled thousands 
              of baby fish, willfully, as she pleased. Please nobel one be merciful 
              and help my mother.” <strong>The arahant felt compassion for her and advised 
              Bright Eyes, “Reverently recite the name of Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes and 
              draw an image of him to benefit all those beings either living or dead.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So Bright Eyes sold all her favorite things as soon as she heard the 
              arhan’s instructions. Then she asked a painter to draw the Buddha’s 
              portrait. She gave offerings in sacrifice, and with a reverent heart 
              sorrowfully wept as she worshipped the Buddha. Unexpectedly one night, 
              as if in a dream, she saw a Buddha who was as tall as Mount Sumeru, 
              emitting bright and shining light. This Buddha told Bright Eyes, “Your 
              mother will be soon reborn in your house. She will be able to speak soon
               after she feels hunger and cold.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After some time, a maidservant of Bright Eyes family bore a baby. 
              This baby could speak three days after her birth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bowing her head and 
              crying, she told Bright Eyes, “One has to suffer the consequences and 
              retributions of one’s own doing throughout life and death. I was your 
              mother. I stayed in hell for a long time. Since we parted, I have fallen
               into hell several times. Because of you, I am born here as a servant. 
              But I will die early; I will only live until I am thirteen years old. 
              After I die, I will fall into an evil level again. Do you have any way 
              to relieve me from these sufferings?” </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After listening to the words of 
              the servant’s baby, Bright Eyes realized this baby was her mother. She 
              asked her sorrowfully, and with tears, “When you were my mother, do you 
              know what you did to make you fall into an evil level?” The baby 
              answered, “I am suffering this retribution due to the karma of killing 
              and slandering. If it were not for you saving me from suffering, I would
               not be released from such karma.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bright Eyes asked about the situation
               in hell and the baby answered, “It was so horrible that I dare not 
              remind myself of it again. And the sufferings there cannot be stated 
              even in thousands of years.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bright Eyes wept and wailed after listening to the baby’s statement. 
              She swore into empty space, “May my mother leave hell forever and not 
              fall into evil again after her thirteen years on earth. Please all 
              Buddhas from the Ten Directions have mercy upon me; listen to my solemn 
              pledge for my mother. If my mother can leave the three evil levels 
              forever, and does not take any humble position or ever be born as woman,
               I vow, in front of Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes that from now on I will save 
              and work towards cultivating all beings in all worlds, hells and evil 
              levels out of suffering. I do not want to become a Buddha until all of 
              them become Buddhas.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bright Eyes then clearly heard Buddha Pure-Lotus- Eyes who told her, 
              “Bright Eyes, you have great benevolent and compassion to make such a 
              great vow for your mother. After your mother finishes thirteen years’ 
              retribution, she will be born into Brahmin class for one hundred years. 
              In her next life, she will again be born into the <strong>Land of No Concern</strong> for
               uncountable aeons. Then, she will become a Buddha to help to cross over
               as many human and heavenly beings as there are sands in the Ganges.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Buddha told Bodhisattva Self-Existent King, “The arahant who helped Bright
               Eyes at that time is now the Bodhisattva Inexhaustible-Intention. The 
              mother of Bright Eyes is the Bodhisattva Liberation. And Bright Eyes 
              herself is now the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. Throughout many aeons, 
              Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has crossed over all beings by his benevolence 
              and compassion. He has made as many vows to rescue living beings as 
              there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</span></p>
              <p>From <a href="http://venchinkung.com/ksitigarbha-sutra/4/">http://venchinkung.com/ksitigarbha-sutra/4/</a></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>*Land of No-Concern - interpreted by some Buddhist books and Venerables to be Amitabha Buddha's Pureland.</p>
              <p>Note that the arahant voluntarily ask what he could do to help Bright Eyes after he had finished his meal. <strong>This is definitely pro-active compassion in my humble opinion.</strong></p>
