              Cupitt may be the most radical Christian theologian alive today. Yet his work
              is hardly known in the United States. Born in England in 1933, he is an
              Anglican priest, a lecturer in the philosophy of religion at the University of
              Cambridge, and a fellow and former dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Author
              of more than thirty books, he is the founder of the Sea of Faith movement,
              which calls for a radical rethinking of our faith traditions. He has been
              accused of being a heretic by the more conservative wings of the Church, and
              has been described as being closer in his thinking to Buddhism than to
              Christianity. In Emptiness and Brightness, Cupitt writes: “Of our religions,
              only Buddhism offers a serious and disinterested attempt to understand human
              unhappiness, diagnose its causes, and propose a therapy that, if persevered in
              for long enough, actually has some chance of working.” Risking It All and
              Wrestling with Life, a two-volume study of Cupitt’s life and work by Nigel
              Leaves, will be published in 2004 by Polebridge Press. <em>Tricycle</em> contributing editor Stephen Batchelor interviewed Cupitt at Emmanuel College in
              April of this year.</span></p>

              you published a book entitled Taking Leave of God. For some this must have
              seemed a shocking idea for a theologian and Anglican priest to propose. It
              would seem to threaten the very foundation of Christian religious life.</span></strong><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> </span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Although
              I’ve been temperamentally religious all my life, my philosophy of religion
              turned critical with the publication of <em>Taking Leave of God</em>. I argued
              that we should regard God not as a metaphysical being, an infinite spirit, but
              rather as a guiding spiritual ideal by which to orient one’s life. This idea of
              God was explicitly put forward by Kant, and arguably has always been present in
              the Lutheran tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The older
              realistic understanding of and language about God leads to impossible
              intellectual difficulties. How can a person be infinite, timeless, simple, and
              immutable? It seems to be essential to most Christians’ idea of God that God
              should somehow be thought of as personal, as having dealings with us, but the
              philosophical attributes of God make that unthinkable. To me it makes more
              sense to see God as a spiritual ideal. And perhaps the best way to interpret
              Christianity is to say that Christians see in Christ that ideal embodied in a
              human life. So I demythologize the idea of an incarnation of God in Christ into
              the idea of embodiment of Christian values in Christ, in his teaching. I see
              Christianity as a spiritual path in which one pursues various values, tells
              certain stories, follows examples that in the end go back chiefly to Jesus of
              Nazareth.</span></p>

              extent was your taking leave of God a movement toward other faiths, in
              particular Buddhism? </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Yes, that was the time when my path and [author] Iris
              Murdoch’s crossed. She was getting very interested in Buddhism and was taking
              instruction in meditation. Both of us were beginning to feel that the
              metaphysical side of Christian belief was coming to an end. We were attracted
              to Buddhism because Buddhism has always known how to bracket the metaphysical
              questions, and to put the following of the path first. Christians have a maxim,
              lex orandi lex credendi: the way you pray should give you the general shape of
              what you believe; the way you practice your religion should come before the
              ideological form you later cast it in.</span></p>

              always liked Buddhism. I like its phenomenalist side, its desire for a unified
              conception of reality as something like a flux of minute events. The self is
              indissolubly part of that, so the self is not a spirit that peers into the
              world from the outside. The self is itself a cloud of minute events and as such
              is part of the world.</span></p>

              religious thought I don’t try to save our immortal soul from a wicked world but
              rather to realize my complete immersion in this one world of ours. I want to
              get myself into harmony and into step with the world we’ve actually got. I
              don’t believe we should look to any metaphysical order on the far side of
              experience nor to any metaphysical subject on the near side of experience but
              simply, as it were, to life. We are our lives. If we give ourselves wholly to
              our own lives, we’ll find the best happiness that we as human beings are
              capable of. I strongly oppose religions that ask us to distance ourselves a bit
              from life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Surely
              Buddhism has a long record of distancing itself from life. At times it can
              appear almost life-denying.</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> Buddhism arose at a time when in India, as in
              Greece, there was a feeling that the development of a state society required a
              disciplining of the passions, some distancing of oneself from one’s own
              passions. For me, though, the problem now is rather the other way ’round. Ever
              since the Romantic movement began, we in the West have been struggling for an
              integral life of the body, the emotions, and religion. We want to get our
              values, our feelings, our senses, our bodies all singing from the same hymn
              sheet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>I’m
              looking for a more unified selfhood. I like the more integrated, this-worldly
              humanism that Christianity has always wanted but has very seldom consistently
              pursued. Evangelicals like to say how horrible secular humanism is, but in
              Christianity you might say that God is a secular humanist. God becomes man in
              the world; the human being is the best miniature of what the world is. We
              shouldn’t try to split ourselves into different bits or separate ourselves from
              the world.</span></p>

              I’m a bit of an emotivist. I define religion as cosmic emotion: a feeling for
              it all, a desire to place oneself in relation to everything. To understand what
              we are, how we should live, what we can hope for, how we should orient our
              lives, where we belong in the whole scheme of things. I stress the priority of
              the passions and would say that our emotional health is the fundamental
              precondition for personal happiness. This, I know, is rather different from
              some traditional Buddhist teaching, but I’ve noticed how many younger Buddhists
              in the West are not too keen on Buddhist asceticism and don’t think that sexual
              asceticism is necessary for personal happiness at all.</span></p>

              you think precipitated this radical shift in your thinking? Was it the natural
              scientific understanding of reality that forced you to cast aside old
              metaphysical certainties? </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Yes, that’s right. But I emphasize history
              nowadays. Our life is not controlled by a timeless order or standards. It is
              profoundly historical. I’ve always been historically minded. I’ve always
              thought I could only be the person I am in the particular historical period in
              which I live. So I now see religious belief systems and practices and values
              all as historical. We ourselves evolve within the historical process and the
              standards by which we measure ourselves and our lives. We shouldn’t see
              ourselves as hooked up to an extra-historical order. For me, critical history
              is even more important than natural science in requiring us to go over to a
              thoroughly this-worldly, humanistic kind of religion.</span></p>

              a new religious way. </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>My correspondence indicates to me that almost all
              people of my generation and younger are aware that their whole lives are spent
              in a personal religious quest. People feel the need to begin all over again. I
              think we are becoming detraditionalized very quickly. I now feel that we need a

              it this way: The only religious convictions that are of any value to you are
              ones you have formulated yourself and worked out and tested in your own life
              and in debate with other people. In 1993 I came very close to death, and my own
              convictions and beliefs were tested. Not only was I going through a very severe
              period of poor mental health, but I also had a burst cerebral aneurysm. Surgery
              left me with severe head pain, and for a time it seemed I would never write or
              work again. I managed to survive that period. But I asked myself afterward how
              I had got through such an extreme time and how it was I had known moments of
              great happiness in that period. Out of the self-questioning that began early in
              1994, all my later thinking developed. It reflects a complete break with
              dogmatism and a desire to make a fresh start in the religious life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Isn’t
              there a danger that this approach might lead one to become rather

              of the Church while Buddhists speak of belonging to the sangha. </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>They both
              stress that religious life must be grounded in a sense of community. I like
              community, but I’m always afraid of the extent to which religious communities
              bully and pressure their own members into conformity, and tend to fall under
              the control of dominant personalities for whom the religious community is a
              theater in which they enact their own power fantasies. The Sea of Faith has
              always tried to be a completely free religious society in which people can
              debate and argue with each other, develop their vocabulary but also find their
              own voice, develop their own views. Most religious communities emphasize
              obedience and deference to religious superiors and vows as if they’re trying to
              stop individuals thinking freely for themselves.</span></p>

              there to be a much greater degree of religious freedom than we have yet known.

              know a lot about the Christian tradition but be largely independent of orthodox
              Christian religious commitments, for they seem to inhibit thought and stop
              people from responding spontaneously to life. I’m looking for postdogmatic
              religion, led by the individual’s personal quest, the search for values and

              then, does it mean nowadays to have a religious identity in the traditional
              sense, to think of oneself as a “Christian” or “Buddhist”? </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>I’m keen
              on religious and political eclecticism. Traditional identities are a bit of a
              mistake. I don’t want to go back to any supposedly pure, original, and
              exclusive religious identity. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries,
              it was usually believed that at the beginning of the Christian tradition the
              faith was pure. So if you went back you’d find that everyone agreed, everyone
              held a pure and simple form of the faith. What modern historical critical
              scholarship has shown is that in the New Testament period there was the most
              appalling jumble of different ideas, out of which something which considered
              itself orthodoxy did not develop for about four hundred years. There never was
              an original, pure, primitive identity. Dreams of purity are almost always a
              complete mistake. I don’t see why one shouldn’t be highly eclectic. Notice how
              the most gifted revolutionaries, intellectual and artistic, always know their
              tradition very well and are quite happy to borrow from the most unexpected
              places. I approve of the modern religious supermarket and the huge artistic,
              religious, and cultural wealth that is available to us nowadays to choose from
              and explore. I want to encourage people to find their own way.</span></p>

              in a monastic order. I like Buddhism because of its independence and
              intellectual purity of mind. There is a simplicity and clarity in Buddhist
              thinking which I approve of. Buddhism is cool, and that coolness is a great
              relief from Christianity’s often overheated personalism. Perhaps a quarter of
              me is Christian, a quarter Jewish, and a quarter Buddhist, and I don’t see why
              we shouldn’t be eclectic nowadays. Our societies are becoming multifaith, and

              that consciousness develops because the world takes definite shape—and becomes
              beautiful and bright—only in our language and in our theory. There’s a certain
              sense in which we can’t avoid anthropocentrism, but I also want to
              demythologize our sense of ourselves. I don’t want to say that man is the crown
              of creation. So it’s an “Empty Humanism.” Here I refer to the traditional
              no-self doctrine of the Buddhists, anatta—"empty," in the Buddhist
              philosophical sense of nonmetaphysical, noninflated. I rather like the humanism
              of respect and even veneration for elderly or weak people that you find among
              the Jews and the best Christian artists: a humanism of human weakness and
              compassion, but not heroic. <br> <strong><br> You also say in your book that rather than meditating on emptiness, we should
              discover how to live emptiness as freedom. How does that work in practice?</strong> The studies I've done on the word "life" and the way it's used in
              English show that increasingly we want to live life to the full, to commit
              ourselves ro life. That means accepting that we are passing away all the time.
              The more we pour ourselves out into life, the more we live by passing away.
              This requires us to be very nonmetaphysical, nondefensive, not holding onto the
              self but giving ourselves away all the time, taking risks.</span></p>

              call "solar living" is living as the sun does or living as a fire
              does. I like personal magnanimity and generosity rather than the traditional
              reserve and caution of the Christian who says "Don't touch me!" and
              shrinks back. In Christian art, the classic image here is that of the risen
              Christ recoiling from Mary Magdalene and saying, "Don't touch me!" It
              is that fearful, defensive attitude that I want to get away from. I would like
              a religion of personal recklessness and generosity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The
              phrase "Emptiness and Brightness" is reminiscent of the Tibetan
              Dzogchen teaching that the nature of mind is empty, radiant, and unimpededly
              responsive. Were you thinking of that?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> No. In my own history it
              comes from the fact that I'm a highly visual person. I get intense religious
              and artistic pleasure from the sense of sight every day of my life. I develop
              enthusiasms for birds, for butterflies, for trees, for geology. The great
              enrichment of the human apprehension of the world, because of the extenr to
              which we've described what is around us, gives us a very vivid and brilliant
              sense of the world just through our eyes. That to me is brightness, the sense
              in which the glowing cosmos takes shape in our seeing of it, covered all over
              with human language, very finely described, appropriated by us. This is a hard
              thing to describe. It means for me that the sense of sight is very important in
              our cosmology and a great source of religious happiness.</span></p>

              there were a better education of the senses in the Western tradition. In the
              West, education is almost always seen in terms of drilling people into
              conformity, of repression, of preventing kids from knowing toO much about
              things that we do not want them to know about. I'd like education to be a
              formation of the senses and in particular of the sense of sight. Perhaps
              leading to an education of the body, of movement. We haven't yet developed the
              sort of education that human beings of the future will want. <strong> </strong></span></p>

              about the future? Can you see your ideas and those akin to them ever making
              much headway against a tide that seems to be moving in the opposite direction?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> It's a
              hard battle to encourage people to develop new religious ways of thinking as an
              alternative to fundamentalism. The deterioration of my own tradition during my
              own lifetime has been very depressing. When I was young, the Church of England
              still had some weight and was closely linked with the national culture.
              Nowadays it's mediocre. The outlook for religion might seem to be poor. But I
              think there is great need for it.</span></p>

              far, in terms of the stability and length of our lives and the cultural
              resources available to us, we're not as happy as we should be. I'd like to see
              politics more oriented toward the question of happiness; certainly I'd like to
              see religion more concerned with making integral, happy people and raising the

              about the quality of personal life and personal happiness. My religious
              humanism is about trying to invest this life of ours with very high religious value.
              I think it can be done. I think our best thinkers, people like Nietzsche or D.
              H. Lawrence, knew that this is what religious thought nowadays should be
              concerned about. We must press on with that even in difficult times, because it
              is what we need in the long run.</span></p>
