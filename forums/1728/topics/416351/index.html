              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"How could I sleep well?" exclaimed the king. "Just before daybreak I dreamed sixteen incredible dreams, and I have been lying here terrified ever since! Since you are my advisors, tell me what these dreams mean."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"What were your dreams, sire?" the brahmans asked. "Surely we will be able to judge their importance."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">As the king was telling them his dreams, the brahmans looked very worried and began wringing their hands.</p>

These are evil dreams. They are full of peril."</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"They portend one of three calamities, sire â€” great harm to your kingdom, to your wealth, or to your life."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Is there any remedy?"</p>

Still, we will find a remedy, otherwise what is the use of our vast study and learning?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"How do you propose to avert the evil?" asked the king.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Wherever four roads meet, we will offer appropriate sacrifices, sire."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"My advisors," cried the king. "My life is in your hands! Hurry and do your best to save me!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Each of the exultant brahmans had the same thought: "We are going to make a fortune from these dreams. Soon we will feast on the choicest foods."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">As soon as they had left the king's presence, they began scurrying about, happily giving orders in every direction. They ordered laborers to dig huge sacrificial pits. They demanded herds of various four-footed creatures, all without blemish. They called for baskets of pure white birds of many kinds. Again and again, they discovered something or other lacking. Messengers raced back and forth to inform the king of each new request.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Noticing all the commotion, Queen Mallika went to the king and asked why the brahmans and their servants kept coming to him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"I envy you," said the king sarcastically. "A snake in your ear, and you don't even know it!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"What does your majesty mean?" asked the queen.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"I have dreamed such unlucky dreams! The brahmans tell me they point to disaster. They keep coming here because they are anxious to protect me from the evil by offering sacrifices."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Has your majesty consulted the Chief Brahman of all the worlds about this?" asked the queen.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Who do you mean, my dear?" asked the king.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Of course, I mean Lord Buddha. He will surely understand your dreams. Go to Jetavana and ask him."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"A good idea, my queen," answered the king. "I will go at once."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">When the king reached the monastery, he paid his respects to the Buddha and sat down.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"What brings your majesty here so early in the morning?" asked the Buddha.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Just before daybreak, venerable sir, I dreamed sixteen terrifying dreams. My brahmans have warned me that my dreams foretell calamity. To avert the evil, they are preparing to sacrifice many animals wherever four roads meet. Queen Mallika suggested that I ask you to tell me what these dreams really mean and what will come of them."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"It is true, sire, that I alone can explain the significance of your dreams and tell you what will come of them. Tell me your dreams as they appeared to you."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"I will, Blessed One," answered the king, and he began relating his dreams.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>"In the first dream, I saw four jet-black bulls," the king began. "They came together from the four cardinal directions to the royal courtyard with every intention to fight. A great crowd of people gathered to see the bullfight. The bulls, however, only made a show of fighting, pawing and bellowing. Finally, they went off without fighting at all.</strong> This was my first dream. What will come of it?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Sire, that dream will have no result in your lifetime or mine. But in the distant future, when kings are stingy, when citizens are unrighteous, when the world is perverted, and when good is waning and evil waxing, in those days of the world's decline, no rain will fall from the heavens, the monsoons will forget their season, the crops will wither, and famine will stalk the land. At that time immense clouds will gather from the four quarters of the heavens as if for rain. Farmers will rush to bring in the rice they had spread to dry in the sun. Men will take their spades and hurry to repair the dikes. The thunder will roar, and the lightning will flash from the clouds. However, just as the bulls in your dream didn't fight, these clouds will retreat without giving any rain. This is what shall come of this dream. But no harm shall come to you from this dream because it applies only to the remote future. The brahmans only said what they said to get some profit for themselves. Now tell me your second dream, sire."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>"My second dream was about tiny trees and shrubs which burst through the soil. When they were scarcely more than a few inches high, they flowered and bore fruit.</strong> This was my second dream. What will come of it?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Sire," said the Buddha, "this dream will be realized in future days when the world has fallen into decay and when human lives are short. Passions then will be so strong that even very young girls will cohabitate with men. Despite their immaturity, they will get pregnant and have children. The flowers and fruit symbolize their babies. However, you have nothing to fear from this. Tell me your third dream."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>"I saw cows sucking milk from their very own newborn calves. This was my third dream.</strong> What can it possibly mean?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"This dream will come about only when age is no longer respected. In that future time young people will have no regard for their parents or parents-in-law. Children will handle the family estate themselves. If it pleases them, they will give food and clothing to the old folks, but, if it doesn't suit them, they will withhold their gifts. Thus the old people, destitute and dependent, will survive only by the favor and whim of their own children, like big cows suckled by day-old calves. However, you have nothing to fear from this. Tell me your fourth dream."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>"Men unyoked a team of strong, sturdy oxen, and replaced them with young steers, too weak to draw the load. Those young steers refused to pull. They stood stock-still, so that the wagons didn't move at all. This was my fourth dream.</strong> What will come of it?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">"Here again the dream will not come to pass until the future, in the days of wicked kings. In days to come, unjust and parsimonious kings will show no honor to wise leaders, skilled in diplomacy. They will not appoint experienced, learned judges to the courts. On the contrary, they will honor the very young and foolish, and will appoint the most inexperienced and unprincipled to the courts. Naturally, these appointees, because of their ignorance of statecraft and the law, will not be able to bear the burden of their responsibilities. Because of their incompetence they will have to throw off the yoke of public office. When that happens, the aged and wise lords will remember being passed over, and, even though they are able to cope with all difficulties, they will refuse to help, saying: 'It is no business of ours since we have become outsiders.' They will remain aloof, and the government will fall to ruins. It is just like when the young steers, not strong enough for the burden, were yoked instead of the team of sturdy oxen. However, you have nothing to fear from this. Tell me your fifth dream."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>"I saw an incredible horse with a mouth on each side of its head being fed fodder on both sides. That dreadful horse ate voraciously with both its mouths. This was my fifth dream.</strong> What will come of it?"</p>

These despicable magistrates, blind to virtue and honesty, will take bribes from both sides as they sit in the seat of judgment. They will be doubly corrupt, just like the horse that ate fodder with two mouths at once. However, you have nothing to fear from this. Tell me your sixth dream."</p>

"Let me hear the dreams as you dreamed them."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The king proceeded to tell the dreams exactly as King Pasenadi told them to the Buddha.</p>

"You have nothing to fear from any of these dreams."</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.33em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Remaining firm in the teaching he had heard and spending the rest of his days in alms-giving and other good works, the king passed away to fare according to his deserts.</p>

Stop the sacrifice!" Then the Buddha identified the Birth by saying, "Ananda was the king of those days, Sariputta was the young brahman, and I was the ascetic."<br><br>[1]Â The crow is: destructive, reckless, greedy, gluttonous, rough, merciless, weak, noisy, forgetful, and wasteful.</p>
