               are having a great time with my uncle around these days. My father is 
              enjoying himself so much and I am so happy to see them together and to 
              be with them. Every hour of every day is full of blessings, it's really 
              like "a shower of blessings". All of us here are having a lot of great 
              opportunities to receive very precious Wang or Empowerment or Initiation
               from my uncle. I didn't get anyone to make big fuss about my uncle's 
              presence. As you all know, I always feel that Dharma is too precious to 
              be "sold" in the worldly ways. Unless one has a perfectly pure 
              motivation, I even think that Dharma should not be marketed in a way 
              like a commercial product where a guru acts like salesman to sell the 
              "product" which is the Dharma in crowded or popular places because 
              sometimes Dharma becomes an unrespected commodity that is not valued in 
              any place, by anyone.</p>
              <p>This time, as a result of my "unworldly" thinking, we 
              are participating in such a great gathering in a humble place like Druk 
              Amitabha Mountain, without many people knowing. On top of that, I didn't
               even bother to make 1 page of leaflet, and make 1 single telephone call
               to let people know. Yet strangely, people are starting to pile up. We 
              are now worrying about the conditions of living, eating facility 
              and even parking. But of course, in another way, I am very happy to have
               as many people as possible to come to join us, because it will have 
              great benefit.</p>
              <p>The beauty of this gathering is that it's very simple, yet it's full 
              of blessings. And also whenever I hear thousands of times from people 
              saying, "I didn't know that such a big initiation is happening 
              there", egoistically speaking I am very proud, as this is an indication 
              that I have not been influenced by the worldly dharmas.</p>
              <p>Speaking about the worldy dharmas, the Buddha Dharma should never be 
              practised with the mentality of selling it for the sake of one's own 
              fame and wealth. Of course, to be successful in this world, we need 
              wealth, fame and health, we need many things! But I think that all these
               things should be provided by other means, rather than by selling the 
              Buddha Dharma. Once you start to sell the Buddha Dharma for the sake 
              of your own well-being, this is a practice of worldly dharmas, which I 
              think and if I may say, Buddha Shakyamuni would hate it. The main 
              purpose of Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching in Triyana is to kill that sort 
              of motivation and attitude. But most of us nowadays in this world are 
              nourishing that kind of attitude whenever we do any kind of Buddha 
              Dharma practice. When I look at myself, I also feel very sad, I seem to 
              be swimming in that mud sometimes, even though I try my best to step out
               and dry myself immediately with the towel of wisdom or awareness. But 
              from time to time, without awareness, I am often back into the muddy 
              pool of worldly dharmas, that I feel very sad about.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how colourful your life is, how wealthy or how 
              famous you are, as long as you are in that muddy pool, it's really a 
              very difficult situation. Sometimes, especially these days, when I look 
              at this particular occasion that my uncle is presiding over, I am really
               happy that myself together with all the practitioners on Druk Amitabha 
              Mountain are able to survive without selling the Dharma. My uncle is 
              such a great master and he is giving such a great teaching with such a 
              great vibration, to such a wonderful group of devoted little girls, our 
              so called nuns at Druk Amitabha Mountain and also many monks who have 
              been practising under my strict direction here. I would say that the 
              entire assembly of guru and devotees are relatively divine in the sense 
              of carrying themselves with correct motivation and behaving very nicely 
              in the sense that they naturally do not have that much of wordly harmic 
              attitude, in connection with this kind of divine occasions. If Dharma is
               not practised for enlightenment but for socializing or getting 
              political affiliations, then what is the point of calling it Dharma. I 
              believe that we can always do other activities for our own pleasure and 
              leave Dharma alone as it supposed to be. Let Dharma function as a 
              medicine to cure the suffering of samsara and don't let it function as a
               poison. If Dharma is for sale for personal enjoyment, then lineage can 
              be for sale for that and your soul and spirit can be for sale for that 
              too.</p>
              <p>I don't mean that one should never be wanting the fame, the food 
              or the wealth. What I am trying to say is that one should never be 
              enjoying the worldly attractions for one's own pleasure by selling 
              the Buddha Dharma. That's the only thing that I am struggling to let 
              everyone know. All of you should also know what I am driving at. By 
              saying this here, it helps me to drive myself out of the muddy pool. By 
              typing this, I am serving 2 big purposes, one is to help myself getting 
              out of this mess and two is to hopefully make many people understand 
              what Buddha Dharma actually means, in what way Buddha Dharma should be 
              practised, and what is the motivation of Buddha Shakyamuni when he 
              started to give teaching of Triyana.</p>
              <p>These days, my uncle or our initiation master keeps on pushing and 
              encouraging us to pray for the well being of the world and for the 
              beings in the world. I don't think he knows about all these disasters 
              that are happening recently, because he has no knowledge of internet, 
              since he is from an old generation and he doesn't handle this sort of 
              new technology. But because of his omniscience, he knows that prayers 
              are very much needed. Every morning, afternoon and night, he keeps on 
              enocuraging us to pray and dedicate our prayers. I am very amazed by his
               omniscience. We modern people know about these things through modern 
              technology. Even though my uncle has not been informed, yet he has been 
              very much concerned. So through his encouragement, we are doing 
              practices of different sorts, to bring peace in the world.</p>
              <p>As I always say, no matter what sort of prayers we do and how we 
              pray, all these have to be supported by correct deeds. Otherwise, 
              prayers will never be answered! Instead, all the disasters which are 
              manmade will keep on happening everywhere, as you all can understand by 
              reading news. We are very clever to say that these are natural 
              disasters, but they are very much to do with us. We human beings are the
               ones who are creating the causes of disaters. So we really have to be 
              educated, instead of blaming on nature. Nature has the beauty of its own
               that does not have that kind of negative attitude, we are the ones who 
              are creating this. We are so crooked to name this as natural disaster, 
              it's very sad. I always feel very funny when I think of how crooked and 
              how irresponsible we humans are.</p>
              <p>To all the readers of this message, I want to request everyone to 
              practise the actions of LOVE and do all GOOD DEEDS with GENUINELY GOOD 
              MOTIVATION.</p>
