              Soft Power Limits of Chinese Theravada Buddhism</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Zi Yang August 15, 2017 The
              Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Chinese
              Theravada Buddhism is in no position to serve as a tool of soft power for the
              state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              centuries Yunnan has served as China’s gateway to Southeast Asia. Besides
              trade, an important component of this linkage is the exchange of religion and
              religious groups, in this case Theravada Buddhism. Since its 7th century
              arrival in Yunnan via Myanmar, Theravada Buddhism has retained a position of
              deep influence among the Dai, Blang, and Palaung nationalities of the region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Today,
              Theravada Buddhism remains a significant cultural linkage between China and
              Southeast Asia. Countries with the most Theravada Buddhists — Myanmar,
              Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia — also happen to be key states on China’s land and
              maritime silk road initiative. Cultivating ties with Theravada Buddhist
              countries therefore makes sense in projecting a warmer and softer image of
              China, in addition to allowing China access to powerful members of the sangha
              that are not only venerated community leaders, but also in some instances
              policy advisors to high decision-makers.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              the general limits of Chinese Theravada Buddhism seriously undercut any soft
              power initiative overseas. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              begin with, Theravada is the smallest school of Buddhism in China. Compared to
              Mahayana and Tibetan Buddhism, which have millions of followers across large
              swaths of the country, Theravada Buddhism’s influence is confined to border
              regions near Myanmar and Laos.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Moreover,
              Theravada Buddhism suffered terribly after the arrival of communism. In the
              name of anti-feudalism, temples, pagodas, and Buddha statues were damaged or
              outright destroyed. Monks were defrocked and persecuted, while all Buddhist
              activities were banned. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              state-led oppression started in the late 1950s, these measures reached a climax
              during the Cultural Revolution. Precious palm-leaf manuscripts were burned to
              ashes. Everywhere in the Theravada country stood abandoned temples and ruined
              pagodas. The Xishuangbanna General Buddhist Temple, China’s largest Theravada
              temple founded in the 8th century, was totally destroyed. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Like
              all other faiths, Theravada Buddhism experienced a revival after the perilous
              Cultural Revolution years. But this revitalization came slowly. While the
              rebuilding of Buddhist temples was allowed again, local governments refused to
              return temple-owned lands confiscated during the Mao years. Although monks can
              study the scriptures again, they were placed under the close watch of local
              state religious affairs administrations, which control all activities within
              the monkhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              present, Theravada Buddhism in China is in a state of stagnation when compared
              to the flourishing developments in neighboring countries. For one, there is a
              severe shortage of monks. There is only one monk available for every two of
              Yunnan’s Theravada temples. Due to the shortage, many temples had to shut their
              gates to worshipers except during major Buddhist holidays. The phenomenon of
              “empty temples” is quite haunting. 18.8 percent of Xishuangbanna Prefecture’s
              temples stand empty. In Pu’er and Lincang it is about 40 percent. While in Dehong
              Prefecture, the number jumps to 90.1 percent, and in Mang City, 98.2 percent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Foreign
              monks from Myanmar and Laos are often invited to Yunnan temples in order to
              fulfill the shortage. However, the government views these outsiders with
              distrust because of their lack of political reliability. Trained outside China,
              foreign monks are not filtered through the rigid political indoctrination
              system that requires all monks to voice support for the supremacy of the
              Chinese Communist Party, commitment to the socialist path, national unity, and
              ethnic harmony. The party expects monks to serve as propagandists, while
              foreign monks have little to no conception regarding this matter. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Besides
              the political factors and the shortage of monks, the lack of official funding
              and quality Buddhist schools are also a problem. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Every
              year, the state allocates billions in renovating Tibetan Buddhist temples and
              educating Tibetan clerics. The same cannot be said for Theravada Buddhism.
              Unlike the rebellious Tibetans, ethnic followers of Theravada Buddhism are
              considered China’s “model minorities.” Despite cultural differences between,
              say, the Dai and the Han, the former never agitated for secession. Even with
              ethnic kinsmen across the border, the Dai never showed any intention to break
              away. While this creates fewer problems for the state, it brings in less money
              for Theravada temples, as opposed to official attempts to buy Tibetan support
              through patronizing Tibetan Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are only three schools in China that offer Theravada education. But they all
              suffer from funding issues. In addition, the quality of education is inferior
              compared to major Theravada institutions in Thailand, for example. In fact, it
              is the dream of many young novices to complete their higher education at one of
              Thailand’s world-class Buddhist universities, Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya
              University or Mahamakut Buddhist University. There have been talks of building
              China’s first advanced-level Pali-language school in Yunnan since 2012, but
              nothing has come about except the purchase of a plot of land. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Calibri",sans-serif;         '>In short, Chinese Theravada Buddhism is in no
              position to serve as a soft power agent given its underdevelopment. State
              policies show that government bureaucrats probably never even recognized the
              value of Theravada Buddhism in benefiting China’s relations with the outside
              world. Public diplomacy does not work in a system where monks must get official
              approval for everything, be it travelling overseas or hosting a simple
              religious event while abroad. Sadly, Chinese Theravada Buddhism has always been
              on the periphery of the Theravada world, and it looks like it will stay there
              for the foreseeable future</span></p>
