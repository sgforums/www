              need saying. It needs saying because it has been denied by so many people
              including many who are eminent and even some whose own roles, behavior, and
              faith contradict what they are saying. It needs saying clearly, that Buddhism
              is a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Further, this is the right time to say it. The bandwagon of
              secularization of Buddhism has gradually gathered momentum to the point where
              it now threatens the whole basis of what the Buddha bequeathed us. Buddhism is
              becoming popular, but it is doing so in a form that is a new creation. This new
              creation is not the traditional Buddhism of Asia and it is not the Buddhism of
              Shakyamuni Buddha, the founder, either. This new creation is an artifact of modernity
              and postmodernity using elements abstracted from Buddhism, tailored to gain
              popularity by satisfying contemporary prejudice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Having said that, we must add that there is nothing wrong with
              adaptation and creativity. Many of the new manifestations and applications of
              ideas and methods derived from Buddhism are intrinsically valuable and can
              stand on their own feet. Buddhism is like a copious spring, the water from
              which can be gathered and poured into many different shaped containers. What is
              problematic, however, is that the reductionist philosophy by which such
              artifacts are being generated threatens to poison the spring from which the
              water is flowing. It is a kind of asset stripping, or, we could say, it is like
              taking the fruit while killing the root.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The basic reductionist principle that informs this process is itself the
              opposite of dharma. It is precisely the kind of blindness that dharma teaching
              exists to awaken us from. This is why a warning bell needs to be sounded.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I have played a role in the propagation and popularization of Buddhist
              psychology so I have a personal part in this process. As somebody who could be
              seen to be one of the culprits I have, perhaps, a double onus to keep the
              record straight. Buddhism developed a sophisticated psychological approach two
              thousand years before the modern world discipline of psychology was invented.
              Psychological investigations have gone on throughout Buddhist history and the
              result is a gold mine of knowledge, experience, theory, and practice from which
              we contemporary people can learn a great deal, but although Buddhism has given
              rise to this treasure, Buddhism is not fundamentally or exclusively a
              psychology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>My contention is not that we should return to a past that is now
              irretrievable. It is that while accepting that Buddhism is changing at a
              cultural level and finding new forms of expression and organization, we should
              acknowledge that it is more than merely an expression of modernity using
              elements of Asian terminology. The most forceful way of doing this is to
              acknowledge that it is more than a way of life, more than a philosophy, more
              important and profound than a mere cultural artifactâ€”that it is a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhism is commonly said to be about relieving or abolishing suffering.
              This can be taken as a worthy humanitarian goal that could have little to do
              with religion. A methodology that overcomes suffering by training the mind is a
              psychotherapy. There is, thus, a case to be made that Buddhism is a
              psychotherapy, and if one were to take abolishing suffering, or achieving
              happiness, as the goal of Buddhism, then one could claim that Buddhism is
              primarily, or even nothing other than, such therapy. Such a line of rhetoric
              can then be used to integrate Buddhism within the frame of modern, secular hedonistic
              ideas. Doing so, however, involves discarding most of what Buddhism actually
              consists of and missing the point of the Founder's original teaching.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Just as it is possible to present Buddhism as a psychology, we can also
              look at other things that Buddhism has given rise to. Buddhism has generated
              great cultures that have played prominent parts in history together with their
              many constituent ways of life, roles, forms of organization, social structures,
              politics, economics, and sciences. Modern academic investigation finds in this
              history fascinating areas for study and research. Some modern people adopt
              aspects of some of these traditional cultures and find it satisfying to do so.
              They wear Buddhist style clothes, sit on the floor, and have houses full of
              Eastern artifacts. They study <em>thangka</em> painting, or create Zen gardens.
              Many people now have Buddha figures as garden or household ornaments. These
              things look fine and contribute to a more gentle tenor of life. Buddhism has
              given rise to treasures such as these. Buddhism, however, is not fundamentally
              a culture. It has bred many cultures of great diversity. Buddhism is not
              fundamentally a way of life. There are many ways of life that can be considered
              to be Buddhist. Buddhism is not, basically, a style. There are many Buddhist
              styles. Buddhism has its views of economics and society, but Buddhism is not
              fundamentally a mode of social welfare. These things are all expressions of
              something more fundamental. Buddhism is a religion. Only a religion could generate
              such a diversity of riches permeating every aspect of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha gave remarkable codes of ethics tailored to different groups
              of people, to monks and nuns, to lay people, and to those who would follow an
              altruistic <em>bodhisattva</em> path. To this day we can learn a great deal from
              this ethical science. However, Buddhism is not fundamentally a system of
              ethics. Buddhism is a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha was sometimes referred to as a doctor of the soul, and
              perhaps also of the body. It is likely his early disciples, wandering from
              place to place, not only taught the fundamentals of his doctrine, but also
              functioned in many cases as healers and medical practitioners. Many modern
              people are particularly concerned about health. They employ techniques drawn
              from Buddhism for stress relief, for an improved diet, for deep relaxation, for
              the treatment of depression, for massage, and so on. All this is wonderful.
              Buddhism has given rise to such treasures, but Buddhism is not fundamentally a
              health cure. Buddhism is a religion. The purpose of Buddhism is not stress
              relief. Buddha did not teach a method to help busy executives survive better in
              the rat race.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is because Buddhism is a religion that it has been able to generate
              such richness. From the perspective of secular, humanistic materialism it is
              possible to see a value in many of the things to which Buddhism has given rise,
              but it is not really possible to see how they have come about because such an
              approach does not value the processes that constitute the substance of religion
              and does not recognize the religious nature of the human being. In fact, it
              consciously, deliberately, and systematically excludes them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Modernity sees the fruits of Buddhism as its substance and then wonders
              how it can be so diverse. The substance of Buddhism, however, is what gives
              rise to all these fruits and this substance is not part of the materialistic
              scheme of things. In fact, it involves and is crucially dependent upon a
              renunciation of such materialism. It is this renunciation that modernity cannot
              admit, yet which is at the core of the Buddha's dispensation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In Buddhism, the spiritual is primary and the physical is a domain in
              which spirit acts. In modernity, the physical is primary and the spiritual, if
              it is acknowledged at all, is the epiphenomenon. For Buddhism to survive and
              continue to produce such wonderful fruit we must not cut off its root in this
              way. Although Buddhism is, in some respects, very different from the religions
              we were used to in the past, at core it is a spiritual matter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Many contemporary thinkers have asserted that Buddhism is not a religion
              in order to fit it into our culture. They want to create an American Buddhism
              or a European Buddhism, in which the encompassing frame is American culture or
              European philosophy. However, if you cut Buddhism down to fit into one of these
              frames you cut off the essence and root.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhism is not something with which to decorate our existing
              materialistic culture. Using Buddhist methods to help one be more efficient at
              work, or cope with the stress of a go-getting lifestyle, is decoration of this
              kind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhism has entered this materialist world sometimes disguised as a
              saleable commodity. In a world where money is the measure of all things, this
              is the disguise you need to gain entry. Another measure is popularity. One wins
              by getting more votes. Votes and prices, however, have no necessary
              relationship to quality or depth. Buddhism aims to deepen life, not trivialize
              it. Measures are abstract, useful for some purposes, but never touch the
              essence of anything. No measure can tell you how beautiful something is. None
              can tell you how pure a person's heart or soul may be. The science of
              measurement is valuable and utilitarian. The soul of religion is something
              else. It is a different domain of existence. It is the one that makes life
              worth living.</span></p>

This assertion would put
              Buddhism somehow within the frame of science, but Buddhism has much that would
              not fit into that frame.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We should not muddle up science and scientism. Scientism is a modern
              philosophy. Scientism is not Buddhistic because it is the attempt to make the
              restrictive rules of science into the dogmas by which the whole of life should
              be governed. Scientism is a different religion and a rather narrow one and it
              would be a tragedy if Buddhism in the West were reduced to it. Actually,
              scientism as one finds it in ordinary members of the public is largely based on
              a version of science that was superseded in the early decades of the 20th
              century. I have met people of this persuasion who say that "One should not
              believe anything that science has not proved." Fortunately or
              unfortunately, we have discovered that proving is not something that science
              does. Sometimes science disproves, but science always has an open frontier: it
              is always open to the new case that overturns what has been thought to be true
              up to now. Science demonstrates, but such demonstrations are never ultimate or
              final. We have seen so many revolutions in science in the past century that
              nobody should be in doubt of this. It does not make science redundant that its
              findings are so often overturned. It is in the nature of the situation. Science
              implies that there must be an incalculable amount that we do not know. In this
              respect science is Buddhistic.</span></p>

              things that are physically demonstrable. Most of the things that are important
              to most peopleâ€”love, loyalty, faith, goodness, meaning, purposeâ€”do not fall
              into such a category. As a philosophy, therefore, scientism is limited. It's
              popularity is based on a misreading of the prestige that currently attaches to
              technology. The proposition that one should believe nothing that is not
              empirically demonstrable is itself not empirically demonstrable.</span></p>

              become the way that many people currently approach Buddhism as though it were a
              collection of techniques. Certainly Buddhism has generated many techniques.
              This is another of its richnesses, but the tendency to see it as being merely
              technique, or merely practice, is a function of the modern world's worship of
              technology, not a true representation of Buddhism. It is just another case of
              picking the fruit while not seeing the root.</span></p>

              schools of Buddhism is a religious act called taking refuge. We take refuge in
              the three treasures: the buddha, dharma, and sangha. Buddha is the supreme
              source of teaching, love, compassion, and wisdom. Dharma indicates the
              fundamentals of life and being. Sangha, in this context, is the assembly of
              spiritually awakened beings. Taking refuge in these three has salvific power.
              The popular view is that the aim here is to join the sangha, learn the dharma,
              and thereby become a buddha. That, however, is not refuge. Refuge is not about
              taking these jewels in our hands, it is about ourselves being held by them.</span></p>

              they are incidental. The whole purpose is to transcend such considerations and
              open the possibility of being liberated from them.</span></p>

              Thus Buddhism finds salvation beyond self. It is not a collection of methods
              for greater self-development, self-assertion, self-cherishing, self-Â­esteem, or
              anything of the kind. Rather the opposite. Buddhism is not narcissism. The
              devotee is encouraged to be ever mindful of the objects of refuge, to bow to
              them, make offerings, revere and worship them. Being mindful of their supreme
              qualities one becomes more aware of one's own deficiency. Becoming more aware
              of the deficiency of self, one's need to take refuge increases in intensity.
              Finally one lets go of self entirely, takes refuge wholeheartedly and enters
              nirvana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Taking refuge is an act of faith. To think that taking refuge is just
              like joining a worldly organization is to miss the essence and to reduce the
              supreme mystery to a mundane procedure. Far from reducing mystery to mundanity,
              Buddhism is about infusing the mundane with the sacred.</span></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Buddhism's foundation is faith. This faith is based
              in real, close-to-the-bone, experience. We find that the body is not reliable;
              the mind is not reliable; thoughts are not reliable, emotions are not reliable,
              circumstances are not reliable, social status is not reliable; the present
              moment is not reliable. No technique or methodology will make them so. Direct
              awareness of the present and of the sequence of things occurring demonstrates
              to us the unreliability of all that the worldly mind considers as self.
              Awareness alone would leave us frightened and helpless. Therefore we need
              mindfulness and the other factors of enlightenment that flow from it. We need
              mindfulness of the treasure that is available to us. Initially we may think it
              is our own treasure, but this is just the conceit of the self reasserting
              itself. The treasure is universal and unconditional, but each of us encounters
              it in a unique way. Buddha speaks to each of us in our own language. Thus
              everybody has some spiritual treasure to rely upon if they will just heed it.
              Buddhism helps us to do so with ever-greater depth and confidence.</span></p>

              <p>If there is a "yin" altar, then most probably it is a Taoist temple that worships Buddhist deities. If there are a black flag and the five generals, then the temple has a medium.Â </p>
              <p>Tua Pek Kong is a resident protector deity, can be regarded as a worldly protector.</p>
              <p>Bigger Chinese Buddhist temples have the Four Heavenly Kings just within the entrance.</p>
              <p>Taoist temples (not all) have two outward facing protectors painted on the door.</p>

              <p>A few points:</p>
              <p>1. Need to make a disfference between taoism and buddhism. In society there exist a convolution of ideas and practice. Remember this does not change the idividual elements</p>
              <p>2. Faith does not just concern religion. Faith is just a dicipline when understanding has not been achieved. Seeking understanding is vital is everyday life.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your response.</p>
              <p>ever went to buddhist temple(s) that have alters for taoism tua
                                pek kong and the other one is for spirits. Â  Â it is a bit
                                confusing to see tua pek kong in buddhist temple.</p>
