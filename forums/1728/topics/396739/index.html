              <p>an essay on dependent origination written by Ajahn Brahm which i find very helpful.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/B%20-%20Theravada/Teachers/Ajahn%20Brahmavamso/Dependent%20Origination/PaticcaSamuppada_Dependent_Origination.pdf">http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/B%20-%20Theravada/Teachers/Ajahn%20Brahmavamso/Dependent%20Origination/PaticcaSamuppada_Dependent_Origination.pdf</a></p>
              <p>below is a quote from the essay:</p>
              <p>Jatipaccayå Dukkha5 – ‘Suffering is caused by birth’.<br><br>As shown above, birth is a sufficient cause for suffering, that is, birth must<br>give rise to dukkha. Every being that is born will get old, get sick and die, and<br>experience the inescapable dukkha associated with that process. Thus birth is the<br>problem.</p>
              <p>This first link of Paticca-samuppåda is rarely given the attention it deserves.<br>It has enormous implications. Before the great insight into Dependent Origination<br>under the Bodhi Tree, the Bodhisatta, like most people, had lived in hope that<br>somehow He could attain perfect happiness in this existence or some future existence.</p>
              <p>Now He saw that all existence (bhava) is inextricably involved with suffering. There<br>is no perfect happiness to be found in any form of existence. As The Buddha said in<br>the Anguttara collection:<br>“Just as a tiny bit of faeces has a bad smell, so I do not recommend even a tiny<br>bit of existence, not even for so long as a fingersnap”. (AN 1, 18)</p>
              <p>A simile might help. A person born in a harsh prison, raised in that prison,<br>who has spent all their time in the prison, can only know prison life. They don’t even<br>suspect that anything beyond their prison can exist. So they make the best of prison.<br>Those who think positively, because they have gone to prison seminars, begin to think<br>that the harsh prison is instead a wonderful place. They even compose songs like “All<br>jails bright and beautiful … the good Lord made them all”! Others get involved with<br>social service, compassionately decorating the prison cells of others. When someone<br>gets tortured or otherwise punished in jail, they think something has gone wrong and<br>look for someone to blame. If someone suggests that it is the very nature of jail to be<br>suffering, then they are dismissed as a pessimist and told to “Get a life!”. One full<br>moon night, a prisoner discovers a door leading out of the jail and goes through. Only<br>then does he realize that jail was inherently suffering and you can’t make it other<br>wise. He goes back to tell his fellow prisoners. Most don’t believe him. They can’t<br>even imagine anything other than their jail. When he says that the jail is suffering and<br>the cessation of imprisonment is happiness, he is accused by one and all of escapism.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people rebuke me saying “You monks are just trying to escape<br>from the real world!”.</p>
              <p>I reply “Well done! At last someone else has understood Buddhism!”<br><br>What’s wrong with escapism, especially when one realises that the real world<br>is the harsh prison</p>

              <p><em><br> Garab Dorje Rinpoche said that, "Even with 5
