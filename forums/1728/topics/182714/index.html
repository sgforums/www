You are contradicting a fellow Buddhist.</div></blockquote><strong>Â“God created everybody; god is responsible for everything; god will reward; god can forgive all our sins; and god is responsible for our lives after our death; god will send us to heaven or he will send us to hellÂ”. </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">These are the basic ingredients of all religions even today</span>. At the same time there were certain other religions also in India which taught that it was necessary for believers to torture their physical bodies, thinking that they could wash away all their sins during their lifetimes so they could go to heaven after death.<br><br>Another religious group encouraged religious rites and rituals and ceremonies and animal sacrifices to please their gods. This group believed that through these practices they could go to heaven. Some others again introduced prayer and worship and asked forgiveness for the sins committed. The Buddha did not recognise the efficacy of all these practices.<br><br>The Buddha did not promise heavenly bliss and rewards to those who called themselves his followers nor did he promise salvation to those who had faith in him. To him religion was not a bargain but a noble way of life to gain enlightenment and salvation.  The Buddha did not want followers with blind faith; he wanted human beings to think and understand. Buddhism is a noble path for living where humanism, equality, justice and peace reign supreme. Revengefulness, animosity, condemnation and resentment are alien to the Teaching.<br><br>The world is indebted to the Buddha for the rise of rationalism as protest against the superstitions of religion. It is he who emancipated man from the thraldom of the priests. It is he who first showed the way to free man from the coils of hypocrisy and religious dictatorship.<br><br>During the BuddhaÂ’s time no religious practice was considered higher than the rites, rituals and sacrifice of living beings to the gods; but to the Buddha no practice could be more humiliating or degrading to man. <strong>A sacrifice is nothing more than bribery; and salvation won by bribery and corruption is not a salvation which any self-respecting man would care to get</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

If you commit a bad deed and ask the Buddha to erase your bad karma, that is wishful thinking, as the law of karma applies to all. Not even the Buddha can erase or eradicate the bad deeds you committed. You have to shoulder the bad karma you committed. Like when you are hungry, or in pain, can you ask someone to eat on behalf of you to alleviate your hunger, or ask someone to take the place of you to alleviate your pain?<br><br>Buddha can only guide you on the path to salvation, but it is yourself that can obtain liberation through yourself, aka the Noble Eightfold Path.<br><br>I shudder when people sacrifise animals in the name of a god or ancestor. They do not understand how karma works, and one day in future, what goes around, comes around.<br><br>I remember a tale on sacrifising a goat. Long time ago, there was this priest was abt to slit the throat of the goat, suddenly the goat cries out in human words and the priest was taken aback. The goat explained to him it cried because it was happy and sad. Happy in the sense that it was its last rebirth as a goat to be slaughtered, as it was once a priest who sacrifised a goat too in the name of a god. The goat said it was feeling pity for the priest as he will be slaughtered, just like him for 500 goat lives to be killed to be sacrifised. He was relieved that this wil be the last time he will be reborn as a goat to be slaughtered.<br><br></div>
