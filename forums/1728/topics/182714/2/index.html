Each method that leads to enlightenment is called a dharma door. Chanting is one of the, meditation is one of them, etc.<br><br>The most important thing for you I feel is to get to know about the Buddhist teachings.</div>

It is needlessly downgrading oneÂ’s own potential to think, "I am a lay person. To listen to teachings, to chant and to mediate is the work of monks and nuns. It is not my job. I just go to the temple, bow, make offerings and pray for the welfare of my family." These activities are good, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but lay people are capable of a much richer spiritual life, in terms of both knowledge about Buddhism and integration of it into their daily life.<br><br></span> <strong>It is very important that lay buddhists attend Dharma talks and follow a series of teachings. By doing this, lay people will understand the real truth and beauty of the Dharma. Otherwise, they remain "joss stick Buddhists," and if someone asks them a question about Buddhism, they have difficulty in responding. That is a sad situation.</strong><br><br>After hearing teachings, one should put them into practice as much as possible. A daily practice of chanting or meditating is excellent. Sometimes lay students say, "My day is so busy with work, family and social obligation. There is no time to do a daily Dharma practice." This is a poor excuse, created by the lazy mind. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is always time to eat: we take care never to miss a meal. Just as we are so diligent and careful to nourish our body, and always find time to do so, so too should we be about nourishing our mind. </span>After all, it is our mind that continues on to future lives, carrying with it all the karmic imprints of our actions, not our body. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dharma practice is not done for the BuddhaÂ’s benefit, but for our own.</span> The Dharma describes how to create the cause for happiness, and since we all want happiness, all of us should practice as much as we can.<br><br>Also, it is very advantageous and beneficial for lay disciples to take the five lay precepts for the duration of their life or take the eight precepts on special days, such as new and full moon days. In this way, much positive potential is created.<br><br>The <strong>responsibility</strong> for the existence and spread of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings lies with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both monks and nuns and lay disciples</span>. If we see the value of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings and want them to continue to exist and to flourish, then <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have the responsibility to learn about them and to practice them ourselves according to our capabilities.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Guan Yin temple is not really a Buddhist temple, although Guan Yin is from Buddhism.<br><br>Temples are usually not Buddhist, Monasteries and dharma centres are Buddhist Monastery (shi yuan) implies that monks and nuns stay there, dharma centres means renounced/lay dharma teachers are teaching dharma.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Firstly I would like to respond in regards to Kuan Yin Temple. I have, in fact, answered casino_king the same thing in another topic.<br><br>btw, kuan im temple is not really a Buddhist temple, but a Chinese Folks practise temple.<br><br>He said: That is just your opinion. They told me themselves that they are Buddhists. There is also a thread to tell Buddhists to celebrate Kuam Im birthday tommorrow in this forum.<br><br>I replied: I tell what you what it means to be a Buddhist in the first place.<br><br>To be a Buddhist, you have to refuge in the Three Treasures, which is the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.<br><br>Kuan Im Temple was probably created by some folks practitioners, and I dont think they took refuge, and the temple doesnt offer people to take refuge either. I dont see monks and nuns staying in Kuan Im temple, so there is no Sangha there, and I dont think they offer dharma there.</span></div>
