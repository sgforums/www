              <p>'In the teachings that Khenpo Namdrol has been giving, Omniscient Longchenpa describes the qualities of enlightened mind with its twofold omniscience: the wisdom that knows the nature of all phenomena, and the wisdom that knows all phenomena as they appear. This twofold wisdom, the wisdom of enlightened mind, which is the wisdom of our own Buddhanature, is inconceivable. If we study the ngondro teachings, we will learn about the scope of samsara's sufferings. But we can free ourselves and others from all of these sufferings by following the Buddha's teachings. Those teachings reveal how we already possess this twofold omniscient wisdom. If we follow those teachings with all our hearts, we will not go wrong but will be of vast benefit to ourselves and others by coming to know that wisdom that we already possess. If we have some understanding of the workings of karma, of what is virtuous, if we some sense of the qualities of the Three Jewels, then receiving empowerment, transmission, and instruction from a qualified master will be meaningful. For myself, I went to many empowerments and received so many teachings and blessings but I don't even know what they are, much less their meaning! So don't be like me.</p>
              <p>Right now everyone has been coming together and working very well, and the center looks beautiful, a worthy setting for such an auspicious event. This is your kindness, the kindness of all the people who offered their time and money, their work and bodies. Also this is your merit, this is your purification and your accumulation. Everyone should be aware as they work or contribute of what they are contributing to, which is the benefit of all beings, and dedicate their merit with aspirational prayers that all be enlightened as one mandala and realize the qualities of Guru Rinpoche and Vimalamitra. Our lama, Yangthang Tulku, is an incarnation of Vimalamitra. You can read about his qualities and compassion. Therefore he is eminently suitable to give this transmission.</p>
              <p>You can look at the outline of the Rinchen Terdzod and learn about its different stages. You might think that there is too much! But actually all the different levels of dharma are rich or busy in this same way: the path of individual liberation, the path of the bodhisattvas, the path of Vajrayana, the unsurpassable path with its empowerment, transmission and instruction purifying obscurations and accumulating merit is not easy! You might get tired and think, "I'm so exhausted!" and so forth. But actually you are a little tired now, maybe, but it is meaningful for this whole life. We are here when the Terdzod being given, and we have the freedom to attend and clear minds to focus on its blessing. What inconceivable aspirations we must have made in the past to encounter such a circumstance! Don't waste this merit. '</p>
