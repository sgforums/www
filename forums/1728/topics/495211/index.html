              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhistdoor Buddhistdoor Global | 2018-01-22 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is never easy to
              provide an introductory overview of what we call Buddhism in China. Afterall,
              the term “Chinese Buddhism” does not have geographical boundaries and is not
              restricted to Sinophone communities. Chinese Buddhist communities also exist
              outside of the People’s Republic, complicating what it means to be a Chinese
              Buddhist.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nor does “Buddhism in
              China” capture specifically the Mahayana schools that came to shape the
              philosophy, culture, and interior being of the Chinese people (and not just the
              ethnic Han majority). There also are flourishing Vajrayana and Theravada
              communities across the country, but their story is for another day.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here we will focus on
              what would become the Chinese expression of Mahayana Buddhism­­: an expression
              that would irrevocably influence Mahayana Buddhism across East Asia. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Classical Age:
              Teachings Trickling East</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mahayana Buddhism as a spiritual movement cannot be divorced
              from its greater historical context. It was the expansionist reign of Emperor
              Wu (156–87 BCE) that pushed the borders of the Han empire into Central Asia,
              enabling contact with the Eurasian steppe cultures and peoples living between
              the civilizations of India, Persia, and China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The mystic magnetism of the “West” has fascinated Chinese
              rulers for millennia. It inspired King Mu of Zhou’s journey to see the
              mysterious Queen Mother of the West, before giving way to a hardheaded desire
              to seize the corridors of Central Asia. No longer were the borderlands of China
              a blurry barrier between the known world and the magical sphere of the Kunlun
              Mountains. Instead, through the Silk Road, the Chinese started interacting with
              people like the Sogdians, Indians, and Parthians. These cultures had, to some
              extent, contact with the dispensation of a chieftain’s son-turned-wanderer—the
              Buddha. This traceless man, through apparently a charismatic personality and
              compelling teacher, set a world religion into motion some 500 years before his
              teachings reached China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Kushans, in particular, were instrumental in transmitting
              the Buddhist teachings and memory into Luoyang, the capital of classical China.
              Their emissaries were camel-riding merchants and caravan traders accompanied by
              monks, such as Lokashema (b. 147 CE), An Shigao (fl. c. 148–80 CE), and many
              more. Our story therefore begins not with a booming revelation from above, but
              with a hesitant trickle of teachers and translators from China’s west. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism was known among the Chinese imperial court by the
              Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), but did not find a stable ideological foothold
              until the dynasty collapsed into three kingdoms—the states of Shu, Wu, and
              Wei—engaged in a cutthroat civil war—otherwise known as the Three Kingdoms
              period (184/220–280 CE). For the intellectual class, the state ideology of
              Confucianism had failed. Intellectuals, artists, and poets looked elsewhere for
              guidance on how to stabilize society and cultivate the individual, including
              the native alternative of Daoism and the foreign message of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One major appeal of Buddhism was that it had a detailed and
              comprehensive schema of salvation after death, as opposed to Confucianism’s
              intricate rules and guidelines for living a moral life. We know that Ze Rong
              (d. 195), a minor warlord who skirmished with the infamous but legendary Han
              chancellor and king of Wei, Cao Cao (155–220), claimed to be a follower of
              Buddhism. Therefore, we know that by this time Buddhism was known among
              statesmen and warlords.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Various schools of Buddhist thought, originating from the
              Pure Land on Mount Lu with early Pure Land propagator Huiyuan (334–416),
              started to take shape and take root in the empire, along with the originally
              Kharosthi Vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka sect. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya became the
              Buddhist law code accepted by all Chinese temples and monasteries, and, as a
              result, the Chinese bhikkhuni sangha did not suffer an institutional break like
              in the Theravada Vinaya in the 11th century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In hindsight, this gave Chinese Mahayana Buddhism in a
              significant advantage over the Theravada and Vajrayana vehicles when it came to
              ordaining women. While the movement to ordain women in the Theravada tradition
              began in the 20th century, Vinaya conservatives argued that the lineage had
              died out and that the best they could hope for was dual ordination under a
              Dharmaguptaka-aligned institution: very often, a Chinese or Korean temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If any social or spiritual force proved that China was open
              to foreign influence, it was Buddhism. The Northern Wei (386–535) even declared
              themselves to be the rightful monarchs of China, in 460, because they were
              representatives of the Buddha. Many historians credit the consolidation of
              Buddhist influence in the Chinese polity to them. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Medieval Monks and
              Monarchs: Consolidation and Sinicization</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Once it was introduced, Buddhism would never leave China, not
              even during periods when the Chinese writers and poets themselves feared that
              Buddhism was under fatal pressure. From the growth of Buddhist schools during
              the Tang dynasty (618–907) to periods of disunity or splintering such as during
              the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), we can see schools of Buddhist
              flourishing and experimenting with local culture—essentially, a slow but sure
              process of the Sinicization of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is true that Emperor Wuzong’s Great Anti-Buddhist
              Persecution in 845 marked a low point in Buddhist fortunes. Yet while some
              schools lost their institutional power, most notably and sadly the Huayan
              school, the common stereotype that all the schools lost their influence save
              the Chan and Pure Land factions is a misconception. Even the idea that Buddhism
              did not offer much intellectual vigor or philosophical innovation during the
              Song (960–1279), Yuan (1271–1368), and Ming (1368–1644) is a long-standing
              misapprehension. During each of these dynasties, Buddhist philosophy interacted
              with shifting social trends, other intellectual traditions like
              Neo-Confucianism, and foreign and native political forces to endure and
              flourish in the Chinese cultural, religious, and social landscape.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is these historical misconceptions (along with many more
              contemporary and philosophical stereotypes of Chinese Buddhism) that we will be
              questioning throughout this project. We will aim to propose thoughtful,
              inquisitive, but most of all interesting narratives that help us look at
              Buddhism in China with fresh eyes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From the early modern
              period to contemporary times: upheaval and adaptation</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are many problems with the idea that Buddhism was
              “asleep” during the Qing era (1644–1911). There was plenty of Buddhist activity
              during that time, both at the local level as well as in the imperial court.
              Still, it is fair to say that the issues that plagued the dynasty from the
              1840s onward­ reflected the growing sense of urgency for Buddhism to
              “modernize,” particularly in response to the growing number of Christian
              missionaries in the coastal treaty ports and growing cities of China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The goal of these reformers was not only to rejuvenate
              Buddhism, but also for Buddhism to play some part in invigorating the Chinese
              nation. The names of these reformists are now renowned among Chinese Buddhists,
              each representing an original way of approaching Buddhist thinking. With the
              onset of the printing press and modern, politically engaged journalism, Yang Wenhui
              (1837–1911) was one of the first householders (lay believers of Buddhism, jushi </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "MS Gothic"; ' lang="EN-US">å±…å£«</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">) to open Buddhist publishing houses (most famous
              among them the Jinling Sutra Publishing House) that circulated Buddhist sutras
              and reading materials to a wider audience. Sometimes called the father of the
              Buddhist “renaissance” in China, he imported more than 300 Buddhist texts lost
              to China with the help of Japanese priest Nanjo Bunyu (1849–1927). Among such
              texts were the writings of Master Shandao, the de facto founder of Pure Land
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Master Taixu (1890–1947), one of Yang Wenhui’s most important
              protégés, believed that ritualistic obsessions were corseting intellectual
              development and laid the foundations of Humanistic Buddhism, a movement that
              would prove immensely influential in the Sinophone world. Another student of
              Yang’s, the revolutionary Zhang Binglin (1868–1936), was immersed in the
              dialectic of Yogacara Buddhism, and saw history as an unconscious process of
              drives that reflected the store-consciousness (alaya-vijnana). Later Chinese
              academics drew on Zhang’s Yogacara dialectic to provide a theoretical framework
              for the failures of capitalism as well as Chinese philosophy itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Social and political reform turned to revolution with the
              establishment of the Republic of China, the Second Sino-Japanese War and World
              War II, and finally the Communist victory. Buddhist development was not totally
              halted but significantly hindered by the Cultural Revolution, which impacted
              all religious traditions adversely. From the wreckage emerged new generations
              of Buddhist thinkers as well as members of the old guard, like the jushi Zhao
              Puchu (1907–2000), who served as president of the Buddhist Association of China
              from 1980 until his death in 2000, and was one of the most successful advocates
              of Sino-Japanese friendship via Buddhist ties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Today, Buddhism faces new challenges and opportunities in a
              globalized world and a Chinese nation-state that has an unprecedented stake in
              the world as the second-largest economy. We’ve hastily stormed through two
              millennia of Buddhism’s history in this country, but it is not our intention to
              close the book on this rich and varied story so soon. Rather, we invite you to
              stay a while longer as we delve deeper into what are defining hallmarks of
              Chinese Buddhism.</span></p>
