              <h1>Lodro Rinpoche</h1>
              <p>Lodro Rinpoche was born in Gha county of Dhokham, Tibet. At a very young age, he had both great faith in, 
              and a clear vision of, Dharma.  It was as though the instincts of many earlier existences had possessed him with 
              equality consciousness as well as incomparable love and compassion for all sentient beings, irrespective of their 
              status, both great and small.</p>
              <p>Early in life, he respectfully bowed at the feet of many spiritually advanced Lamas and, in this way, was given the
              opportunity to grow quickly in his study of Buddha Dharma.  Through these holy Lamas he received initiation, deep spiritual
              transmission through reading and scriptural explanation, as well as the most quintessential of the teachings of the Buddha.
              He had abandoned worldly life at an early age.</p>
              <p>Lodroe Rinpoche undertook pilgrimages to numerous holy places and
              practiced intense meditation in places that, for ages, had been
              blessed by many great Tibetan saints. It was during this time that he
              discovered that the monastery of the great saints Marpa,
              Milarepa and Thakpo had fallen into ruin due to some unfortunate
              occurrences in Tibet. When he saw how the beautiful teachings of Marpa,
              Milarepa and Thakpo had deteriorated into mere vestiges in print, he
              felt broken-hearted.</p>
              <p>It was then that he made a strong personal
              commitment to restore, to their full glory, the teachings of this
              incomparable lineage. Highly motivated to see his vision succeed,
              Lodroe Rinpoche began contributing wholeheartedly to the restoration of
              Buddha's teaching in the area. The seed of Dharma, once again, was
              planted in the minds and hearts of the local people.</p>
              <p>Lodro Rinpoche then left Tibet and traveled into Nepal and India. He
              sat at the feet of many great Lamas and Khenpos from both old and new
              traditions alike.
              He fused some strong spiritual relationships with them and furthered,
              under them, his studies of the Great Philosophical Treatises. Filled
              with a natural enthusiasm,
              he also traveled to the home countries of many disciples from both East
              and West. He visited their wonderful Dharma Centers in order toteach
              and propagate Buddha Dharma.</p>
              <p>One of the mission of Lodroe Rinpoche today is to input entire Marpa
              Kagyud Buddhist text into CD-ROM format in order to both restore the
              text that has deteriorated in its
              original parchment format and to re-encode it digitally so that it
              cannot be lost. It will then be simple to print legible copies for all
              who wish to study. By dedicating his life to this form of Buddha
              Dharma, it is Lodroe Rinpoche's prayer that
              existence of these great scriptures will continue to benefit all
              sentient beings.</p>
