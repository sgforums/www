              <p>Event : Dharma Teaching On White Umbrella Goddess Sadhana and<br>the Eight Kinds of Buddhist Guardian Deity's Practice**<br>Date : 20 Feb 2011 (Sunday)<br>Time : 7.00pm - 9.30pm<br>**must have recieved White Umbrella Goddess Initiation<br> <br> White Umbrella Goddess<br> <br> Asuras and gods  reside in the region between the God and Demi-God realm (within samsara). There naturally grows a wish-fulfilling tree  whenever the gods run into any difficulty, they would pray to this tree and their wishes will be fulfilled. This has however,<br> incurred the wrath and jealously of the Asuras, and in a fit of hatred, raged<br> attack towards the god realm. Not wanting to suffer defeat, the King of the God<br> realm quickly approached Lord Buddha Shakyamuni to seek His blessings. At that<br> moment, there shone a bright white light from the crown of the Lord Buddha. And<br> it manifested into the intrepid and powerful White Umbrella Tara. With the pure<br> merits of Lord Buddha, the White Umbrella Tara emanates a thousand arms and a<br> thousand eyes, blessing and saving all the harm of the gods.<br> <br> The White Umbrella Goddess is an intrepid and fearless deity. Practicing the<br> White Umbrella Goddess is effective for purification of disturbances caused by<br> the evil spirits and the influence of any evil magic as well as the attack or<br> harassment of the formless. It also benefits us such as to increase fortune,<br> wisdom, health and longevity. The recitation and visualization on White Umbrella<br> Deity is to drive back all forms of negative aspect in life. The ultimate goal<br> of this prayer is to arrive at Pureland in a swift way.<br> <br> <br> Benefits derived from the practice of White Umbrella Goddess Sadhana are:<br> • To neutralize karma brought about by heavy sins of ancestor or parents<br> • To prevent or to heal serious sickness<br> • To control depressed people contemplating suicide<br> • Protection over witchcraft and malicious mischief<br> • Protection from court cases<br> • Protection from outside vicious negative forces<br> <br> The 1st Zuri Rinpoche was the root lama of Chöying Dorje, the 10th Karmapa. The<br> 1st Zuri Rinpoche was originally based in Tsurphu Monastery of the Tibet .<br> Located near Lhasa , it has been the main seat of the Karma Kagyu Lineage and<br> residence of the successive incarnations of the Gyalwang Karmapas. The 1st Zuri<br> Rinpoche later went to Qinghai in his lifetime. Following the Karmapa's wishes<br> and due to karmic connections, he settled there and stayed in Thrangu Monastery<br> until his seventh incarnation.<br> <br> In each of his past lives, Zuri Rinpoche was renowned for his practice of<br> Vajrakilaya. The 7th Zuri Rinpoche, for example, had attained enlightenment by<br> reciting the Vajrakilaya mantra 1,300 million times in his small retreat hut<br> overhanging the cliff of the Princess WenCheng Temple in Qinghai . This is still<br> recounted by his then disciples and the elderly monks there by this day. The 7th<br> Zuri Rinpoche passed away in Bhutan , thus created the origination of his next<br> incarnation in this Himalayan kingdom.<br> <br> The present Venerable 8th Zuri Rinpoche was born in Bhutan and was recognized by<br> H.H. 16th Karmapa at two months old. At two, H.E. presided over his enthronement<br> ceremony in Bhutan in the presence of the Karmapa's four heart sons and many<br> renowned Rinpoches. He was bestowed the Dharma name Karma Migyur Tenpel Gyalshen Jigme Gocha.<br> <br> At a young age, Rinpoche entered Rumtek Monastery, the Karmapa's seat in Sikkim<br> , India , to receive intensive traditional Buddhist education. He studied at the<br> Karma Shri Nalanda Institute and performed brilliantly under the guidance of the<br> Karmapa. He then proceeded to Nepal to further his studies in learning the three<br> yanas, the five major treatises and the four tantras in the Namo Buddha<br> Institute. Also, he studied extensively in India and Bhutan .<br> <br> He had also received empowerments and teachings of various lineages such as from<br> the Kagyu masters the Very Venerable 9th Thrangu Rinpoche, the 1st Kalu<br> Rinpoche, and the Nyingma master Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and among others.<br> Rinpoche started the spreading of dharma in 1993. He traveled to and from Bhutan<br> , India , Nepal , mainland China , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore , in setting<br> up Buddhist centers, giving teachings, conducting pujas, holding retreats and<br> animal protection activities.<br> <br> The present 8th Zuri Rinpoche is a qualified lineage teacher and a great<br> reincarnated master and is highly commended by H.H. the 17th Karmapa Ogyen<br> Trinley Dorje. The 8th Zuri Rinpoche has carried on the powerful tradition of<br> Vajrakilaya practice and Tsog offerings unceasingly for the benefit of sentient<br> beings.</p>
