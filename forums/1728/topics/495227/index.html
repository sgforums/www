              and Freud say about self-slavery</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">February 2, 2018 Mark Epstein Big Think</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ego is the one affliction we all have in common. Because
              of our understandable efforts to be bigger, better, smarter, stronger, richer,
              or more attractive, we are shadowed by a nagging sense of weariness and
              self-doubt. Our very efforts at self-improvement orient us in an unsustainable
              direction since we can never be certain whether we have achieved enough. We
              want our lives to be better but we are hamstrung in our approach.
              Disappointment is the inevitable consequence of endless ambition, and
              bitterness a common refrain when things do not work out. Dreams are a good
              window into this. They hurl us into situations in which we feel stuck, exposed,
              embarrassed, or humiliated, feelings we do our best to keep at bay during our
              waking hours. Our disturbing dreams are trying to tell us something, however. The
              ego is not an innocent bystander. While it claims to have our own best
              interests at heart, in its relentless pursuit of attention and power it
              undermines the very goals it sets out to achieve. The ego needs our help. If we
              want a more satisfying existence, we have to teach it to loosen its grip.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are many things in life we can do nothing about—the
              circumstances of our childhoods; natural events in the outer world; the chaos
              and catastrophe of illness, accident, loss, and abuse—but there is one thing we
              can change. How we interact with our own egos is up to us. We get very little
              help with this in life. No one really teaches us how to be with ourselves in a
              constructive way. There is a lot of encouragement in our culture for developing
              a stronger sense of self. Self-love, self-esteem, self-confidence, and the
              ability to aggressively get one’s needs met are all goals that most people
              subscribe to. As important as these accomplishments may be, however, they are
              not enough to guarantee well-being. People with a strong sense of self still
              suffer. They may look like they have it all together, but they cannot relax
              without drinking or taking drugs. They cannot unwind, give affection,
              improvise, create, or sympathize with others if they are steadfastly focused only
              on themselves. Simply building up the ego leaves a person stranded. The most
              important events in our lives, from falling in love to giving birth to facing
              death, all require the ego to let go.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This is not something the ego knows how to do. If it had a
              mind of its own, it would not see this as its mission. But there is no reason
              for the untutored ego to hold sway over our lives, no reason for a permanently
              selfish agenda to be our bottom line. The very ego whose fears and attachments
              drive us is also capable of a profound and far-reaching development. We have
              the capacity, as conscious and self-reflecting individuals, to talk back to the
              ego. Instead of focusing solely on success in the external world, we can
              direct ourselves to the internal one. There is much self-esteem to be
              gained from learning how and when to surrender.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While our culture does not generally support the conscious
              de-escalation of the ego, there are silent advocates for it in our midst.
              Buddhist psychology and Western psychotherapy both hold out hope for a more
              flexible ego, one that does not pit the individual against everyone else in a
              futile attempt to gain total surety. These two traditions developed in
              completely different times and places and, until relatively recently, had nothing
              to do with each other. But the originators of each tradition—Siddhartha
              Gautama, the South Asian prince who renounced his luxurious lifestyle to seek
              an escape from the indignities of old age, illness, and death; and Sigmund
              Freud, the Viennese doctor whose interpretation of his own dreams set him on a
              path to illuminate the dark undercurrents of the human psyche—both identified
              the untrammeled ego as the limiting factor in our well-being. As different as
              these two individuals were, they came to a virtually identical conclusion. When
              we let the ego have free rein, we suffer. But when it learns to let go, we are
              free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Neither Buddhism nor psychotherapy seeks to eradicate the
              ego. To do so would render us either helpless or psychotic. We need our egos to
              navigate the world, to regulate our instincts, to exercise our executive
              function, and to mediate the conflicting demands of self and other. The
              therapeutic practices of both Buddhism and psychotherapy are often used to
              build up the ego in just these ways. When someone is depressed or suffers from
              low self-esteem because he or she has been mistreated, for example, therapy
              must focus on repairing a battered ego. Similarly, many people have embraced
              the meditation practices of the East to help build up their self-confidence.
              Focus and concentration diminish stress and anxiety and help people adapt to
              challenging home and work environments. Meditation has found a place in
              hospitals, on Wall Street, in the armed forces, and in sports arenas, and much
              of its benefit lies in the ego strength it confers by giving people more
              control over their minds and bodies. The ego-enhancing aspects of both of these
              approaches are not to be minimized. But ego enhancement, by itself, can get us
              only so far.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Both Western psychotherapy and Buddhism seek to empower the
              observing “I” over the unbridled “me.” They aim to rebalance the ego,
              diminishing self-centeredness by encouraging self-reflection. They do this in
              different, although related, ways and with different, although related, visions.
              For Freud, free association and the analysis of dreams were the primary
              methods. By having his patients lie prone and stare into space while saying
              whatever came to mind, he shifted the usual equilibrium of the ego toward the
              subjective. Although few people lie on the couch anymore, this kind of
              self-reflection remains one of the most therapeutic aspects of psychotherapy.
              People learn to make room for themselves, to be with uncomfortable emotional
              experiences, in a more accepting way. They learn to make sense of their
              internal conflicts and unconscious motivations, to relax against the strain of
              the ego’s perfectionism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism counsels something similar. Although its central
              premise is that suffering is an inextricable aspect of life, it is actually a
              cheerful religion. Its meditations are designed to teach people to watch their
              own minds without necessarily believing everything they think. Mindfulness, the
              ability to be with whatever is happening in a moment-to-moment way, helps one
              not be victimized by one’s most selfish impulses. Meditators are trained to not
              push away the unpleasant nor cling to the pleasant but to make room for
              whatever arises. Impulsive reactions, in the form of likes and dislikes, are
              given the same kind of attention as everything else, so that people learn to
              dwell more consistently in their observing awareness, just as one does in
              classic modes of therapy. This observing awareness is an impersonal part of the
              ego, unconditioned by one’s usual needs and expectations. Mindfulness pulls one
              away from the immature ego’s insistent self-concern, and in the process it
              enhances one’s equilibrium in the face of incessant change. This turns out to
              be enormously helpful in dealing with the many indignities life throws at us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While the two approaches are very similar, the primary areas
              of concern turned out to be different. Freud became interested in the roiling
              instincts and passions that rise to the surface when the ego is put under
              observation. He saw himself as a conjuror of the unconscious, an illuminator of
              the dark undercurrents of human behavior. When not prompted, people reveal
              themselves, often to their own surprise, and what they discover, while not
              always pretty, gives them a deeper and richer appreciation of themselves. Out
              of the dark earth, after a night’s rain, flowers grow. Freud took delight in
              poking fun at the belief that we are masters in our own houses, comparing his
              discoveries to those of Copernicus, who insisted that the sun does not revolve
              around the earth, and Darwin, who claimed that man “bears in his bodily frame
              the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.” For Freud, the ego could evolve only
              by giving up its ambitions of mastery. The ego he encouraged was a humbled
              one, wider in scope but aware of its own limitations, not driven so much by
              instinctual cravings but able to use its energies creatively and for the
              benefit of others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While maintaining a similar reliance on self-observation,
              Buddhism has a different focus. It seeks to give people a taste of pure
              awareness. Its meditation practices, like those of therapy, are built on the
              split between subject and object. But rather than finding uncovered instincts
              to be the most illuminating, Buddhism finds inspiration in the phenomenon of
              consciousness itself. Mindfulness holds up a mirror to all the activity of mind
              and body. This image of the mirror is central to Buddhist thought. A mirror
              reflects things without distortion. Our consciousness is like that mirror. It
              reflects things just as they are. In most people’s lives, this is taken for
              granted; no special attention is given to this mysterious occurrence. But
              mindfulness takes this knowing consciousness as its most compelling object. The
              bell is ringing. I hear it and on top of that I know that “I” am hearing it and,
              when mindful, I might even know that I know that I am hearing it. But once in a
              while in deep meditation, this whole thing collapses and all that is left is
              one’s mirrorlike knowing. No “I,” no “me,” just pure subjective awareness. The
              bell, the sound, that’s it! It is very hard to talk about, but when it happens
              the freedom from one’s usual identity comes as a relief. The contrast with
              one’s habitual ego-driven state is overwhelming, and much of the Buddhist
              tradition is designed to help consolidate the perspective of this “Great
              Perfect Mirror Wisdom” with one’s day-to-day personality.</span></p>
