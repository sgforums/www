Over the past few days I felt a little depressed too because of workload and lacked sleep, all these are karmic propensities and habitual tendencies surfacing due to the conditions.. But they didn't last long because if you know the right way to practise, you will not keep being pulled into the subconscious momentum. Mindfulness can 'pull' you back.<br><br>Whether it is from past life or this life doesn't matter, but in Buddhism, we must be aware of this habitual tendency and karmic propensity and not give continuity to it. Sometimes chanting, listening to music, relaxing can help. Chanting is also a good practise to deal with these propensities... so is sitting meditation. When you feel depressed, sometimes it's good that you just pause for a while, maybe for 5 or 10 minutes, just pause, relax, and do some chanting or awareness of breathing meditation. It helps a lot.<br><br>When your mind has clarity, the dark and depressed feeling will dissipate, and your mind will feel bright, alive and joyful. Same as what I said in the other thread, you have to practise and see the results for yourself. If you never practise it is difficult to comprehend the dharma and how it can help you. If your mind has 'brightness' you will not feel the same.</div>

The habitual tendencies/momentum that is surfacing is subtle and easily missed.<br><br>You said there is no thoughts, but actually subtle thoughts are influencing you all the time, but ironically because you are so caught up in it, you can't see it... you're just unconsciously reacting with the flow of momentum.<br><br>Only when you calm down and be naked in awareness will you be able to observe how the momentum affects you.<br><br>Thusness just said this which reminded me:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When you go naked in awareness, you clearly know who is being symbol-less and non-conceptual. So much so that when you suddenly concepts and symbols appear, you 'see'. So clear and you are able to understand its mechanism. its like a big contrast.</span></div>
