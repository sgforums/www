              <p>"The practice of Vajrakilaya blazes at the heart of the ancient
              Vajrayana traditions of Tibet. The wrathful heruka Vajrakilaya is the
              yidam deity who embodies the enlightened activity of all the buddhas,
              manifesting in an intensely wrathful yet compassionate form in order to
              subjugate the delusion and negativity that can arise as obstacles to
              the practice of Dharma. In fact, the practice of Vajrakilaya is famous
              in the Tibetan Buddhist world as the most powerful for removing
              obstacles, destroying the forces hostile to compassion, and purifying
              the spiritual pollution so prevalent in this age."--Sogyal Rinpoche<br><br>The
              Dark Red Amulet presents the Vajrayana practice of Vajrakilaya
              according to the oral transmission lineage of the great
              seventeenth-century treasure-revealer Tsasum Lingpa. Vajrakilaya
              embodies the enlightened activity of all the buddhas that subjugates
              delusion and negativity in order to clear obstacles to spiritual
              practice. The essential purpose of Vajrakilaya practice is to "discover
              the absolute vajra nature that will transform every duality hindrance
              into clear wisdom and compassion."<br><br>In this text, the renowned
              scholars and meditation masters Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and
              KhenpoTsewang Dongyal Rinpoche present the history of this lineage and
              the miraculous story of how Tsasum Lingpa revealed this terma teaching.
              Their line-by-line commentary on the short and condensed sadhanas
              provides an invaluable guide for practitioners to combine the skillful
              means of compassion and wisdom that are the foundation of Tibetan
              Buddhism.<br><br>Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Ven. Khenpo
              Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche are co-founders and co-directors of
              Padmasambhava Center, based at Padma Samye Ling in upstate New York<br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.padmasambhava.org/">http://www.padmasambhava.org/</a><br><br>When
              he was nearly eighteen, Tsasum Lingpa dreamt that Guru Padmasambhava
              and Yeshe Tsogyal told him that he would have begun to reveal terma
              teachings at around age fifteen, or even thirteen, but due to many
              obstacles and hindrances he was prevented from revealing them. They
              said, "Now you are approaching age eighteen, and if you are unable to
              reveal terma teachings within three years, all your missions of this
              life and future lifetimes could be jeopardized! Therefore, you have to
              be prepared and determined to carry on and change your life."<br><br>Guru
              Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal gave him many empowerments and
              teachings in this dream. They took him by the hand and pointed to a
              large storehouse filled with countless jewels and precious objects and
              said, "There are many treasures inside, choose one!" A lady appeared
              (who was actually a dakini), and they told him, "She will be your
              companion. You and she will undertake many beneficial activities. Today
              you must select the terma keys you would like to take from among these
              treasures." He asked, "How can I choose?" and the lady told him,
              "Choose the keys!" Tsasum Lingpa and the lady in the dream went into
              the storehouse, and he took a blue key made of sapphire. She told him
              to take another one, and he took a red key made of ruby. The lady took
              a white key made of silver.<br><br>When they returned, Yeshe Tsogyal
              smiled and looked at Guru Padma sambhava and said, "Our son chose the
              right keys!" Then Tsasum Lingpa asked, "What are these keys? What is
              their purpose?" They said, "The sapphire key is the key of all the
              oceanlike tantra teachings, the ruby key is the key of the voice of the
              Buddha's teaching, and the silver key is the key related to the
              skillful means of visualization, the creation-stage practice. These
              three keys symbolize the three kayas of the ultimate nature. If you had
              chosen the yellow key, you would have become very wealthy and powerful
              as a universal king, but you would have had many obstacles and
              distractions. If you had chosen the green key, it would have benefited
              yourself, but not others. <br><br>Therefore, the keys you have chosen
              are good. Please keep them well protected." Then Guru Padmasambhava and
              Yeshe Tsogyal gave Tsasum Lingpa three small rolls of paper in red,
              white, and blue colors, telling him, "Keep these symbols of the three
              kayas close to you."<br><br>Guru Padmasambhava handed a dorje and
              drilbu (bell) to Tsasum Lingpa and said,"Keep these with you as well,"
              and so he kept them with a lot of respect and prayed. He had been
              wearing multicolored thread on his ring finger, and he untied the
              thread and wrapped it around the three rolled papers that he received
              so that he could wear the three rolled papers on his ring finger. Then
              Guru Padmasambhava said, "Son, near the right side of the glacier
              mountain of Jowo Zegyal there is a mountain called Ahmye Mutri, where
              you will see a rock that looks as though it is jumping up in the sky.
              In that rocky place, you will find special instructions about that ruby
              key that you took, which you must reveal before the fifteenth day of
              this month. You must go there very quicklyâ€”if you delay, you could miss
              that opportunity. Soon, after one year, I will send you another message
              with another invitation, but in the meantime, after you reveal this,
              you must travel far and wide, don't stay in one place." Tsasum Lingpa
              then bowed with great respect to Guru Rinpoche.<br><br>At that moment
              wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal changed into an ordinary lady's form. She
              gave him other instructions and teachings, and then other ladies, some
              wrathful, some peaceful and beautiful, gave him numerous instructions
              and took him to wondrous places in this dream.<br><br>And at the end
              Yeshe Tsogyal said, "Now you go back and we will return to Udiyana, and
              soon we will meet again." In his dream Tsasum Lingpa asked,"If you
              don't accompany me, then who will accompany me?" Yeshe Tsogyal told
              him, "Don't worry, you will have soon an assistant. There is a place
              called Tashu, and there is an emanation of the wisdom dakini from Tashu
              who has all the characteristics of the Ratna family. This dakini will
              await your arrival at the place where you are going due to your
              aspirationsâ€”your bodhichitta commitment. Later we will also come and
              help you." She and another dakini then flew up in the sky, and then
              Tsasum Lingpa woke up. He looked around and saw that the sun was
              already on the mountain's peak.</p>
