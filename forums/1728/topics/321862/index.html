              <p>Probably to you it's afraid to let go. But you cannot assume that for many other people.</p>
              <p>So come on, is it a must for one to be ordained to be considered as serious in one's spiritual cultivation? I don't know where is your friend becoming a nun in; but a few monks and nuns that I personally know, and observed, seems to be that, ordained lives are busier.</p>
              <p>There's a nun I know who's always organising environmental awareness activities; another into buddhist education, both of them did tell me sometime they feel that becoming ordained ended up have more things to do!</p>
              <p>So to think that becoming part of sangha gives you more time and space to cultivate (if you're refering cultivate on a personal level), it isn't necessary so. Sometimes, (a good) sangha ended up has to take up the role of cousellors, programmes (be it social welfare or dhamma-related) co-ordinated and even as disciples of their own teachers, it's not easy.</p>
              <p>Sangha during the Buddha's time was really quite different from the sangha nowadays.</p>
              <p>To me, in Buddhism, both ordained and lay disciples are <strong>equally</strong> important to sustain the Buddha-sassana. It's just a matter of choice what kind of lifestyle one choose to live a buddhist life.</p>

              <p>hi rick555</p>
              <p>Everyone always get 24 hour a day regardless of what he do. But seriously after becoming a nun, she will have more time to focus on practice instead of fighting in a rat race life. Since she has try the monastic life for 6 months, rest assure that her intelligence has helped the decision.<br>Since she is nun already, treat her as a nun instead of a normal ordinary girl.</p>

              <p>My friend has made the decision to join the order.  She has almost everything in life, looks, intelligence ... but she has also suffered much.</p>
              <p>I can't help but feel sad, although I know I shouldn't be.  It is for her future good because she can find peace there.</p>
              <p>But it is so difficult not to be bothered, it is as though a kin has left me. </p>
              <p>And so I remembered, conditions arise, conditions cease ... fate comes, fate goes ...</p>

              <p><br>Samsara is endless suffering. Wordly comforts and pleasures do not last. Life is Dukkha. Ponder on the four noble truth. Your friend is getting out of samsara while she can. Not many people have the golden opportunity to join the Sangha Order. Furthermore, It isn't easy to be a human, to receive dharma teachings and meet good dharma teachers in this dharma-degeneration era.</p>
