              <div>Dear all,</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A
                      friend had sent me an email asking what's my take on the violence
                      and how it came about. As it was on the tv news that China president
                      Wen Jia Bao stated that the violence is organised and planned by the
                      "Dalai group".</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Initially I didn't want to
                      send out mass emails as I am not really interested in politics.
                      However, after some consideration, I decided that I should play a part
                      in raising some awareness of what little I know of the Tibetan
                      community and especially the Dalai Lama and his govt-in-exile (having
                      stayed in India and lived among the Tibetan community for a while).
                      Just as I think the media (esp Chinese media) is quite biased in their
                      reporting, I too, am unable to provide a complete picture. However, I
                      believe it is only fair to provide different perspectives so that
                      people are better informed, and are able to reach your own conclusion
                      about this matter.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>No matter what our
                      stances are regarding the historical dispute of Tibetan land ownership,
                      I think most of us are joined in our common wish for the Tibet issue to
                      be resolved peacefully, with minimum harm inflicted upon both Chinese
                      and Tibetans alike.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My main message is
                      that, the Dalai Lama is NOT requesting for Tibetan Independence. He is
                      NOT asking for Free Tibet. He is FOR an autonomous Tibet under Chinese
                      rule and has always been requesting for peaceful dialogues with the
                      China authorities, but had not received any positive response. <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/news.42.htm">http://www.dalailama.com/news.42.htm</a> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>This recent outbreak of violence in Tibet is NOT instigated by the Dalai Lama</strong>. Given
                      his status in the Tibetan community, he had plenty of other chances
                      to do that in the past, but he had never done so. He always encouraged
                      Tibetans to be kind and patient towards the Chinese. In fact, due to
                      his insistence on seeking autonomy via the peaceful approach, he has
                      been losing support from his very own people. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/tibet.independence/">http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/tibet.independence/</a> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My main aim is not to stir up feelings of negativity towards any party, but rather hoping that more people would understand and <strong>support the call for China to engage in a dialogue with Dalai Lama</strong>. China needs to understand that <strong>Dalai Lama can help them deal with the Tibet issue, that Dalai Lama is not against them.</strong> <br></div>
              <div>So
                      for people who are interested to find out a bit more, please read my
                      reply to my friend below. If you're not interested, please just ignore
                      what I wrote. What I am writing here is also entirely based on my
                      personal subjective point of view, so do take everything with an open
                      mind, as well as with a pinch of salt. If after your own research, you
                      also arrive at the same conclusion as I do - that peaceful dialogue and
                      non-violent approach is necessary - then you may wish to, in your own
                      little ways, help raise awareness among people and urge their support
                      for a peaceful resolution.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My prayer of encouragement for the Dalai Lama, quoted from &lt;The 37 Practices of Heroic Beings&gt;:</div>
              <div><em>"Although someone broadcasts throughout a billion worlds </em></div>
              <div><em>A legion of libel about you,</em></div>
              <div><em>In return, with a mind full of love,<br>To tell of their good qualities is the practice of bodhisattvas (heroic beings)." </em></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I also pray for all - friends, relatives, enemies and strangers - to:</div>
              <div>(1) have happiness and its causes;</div>
              <div>(2) be free from suffering and its causes;</div>
              <div>(3) be
                       never separated from sorrowless bliss;</div>
              <div>(4) abide in equanimity, free of bias, attachment and anger.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>With love,</div>
               
              <div> </div>
              <div>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>
              <div>My reply to a friend's question on my take on the Tibet unrest:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I am
                      very sure dalai lama isn't involved in the violence, because he has
                      always been very clear that it wouldn't help at all. His stance has
                      been going for autonomy, not independence. And because of this, he has
                      been risking the loss of support from Tibetans themselves, as there's a
                      large group of Tibetans who emotionally want their own free and
                      independent country and not an autonomous region of China.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When
                      I was in Dharamsala in India (where dalai Lama's govt in exile
                      operates), I could see that some of the Tibetans were struggling with
                      the conflict of giving dalai lama very high respect and thus trying to
                      practice restraint, yet also bursting with much anger and anguish
                      towards the China govt and their plight of not being able to have a
                      land and identity they cal their own for half a century. A few more
                      vocal ones expressed their disappointment with Dalai Lama's decision to
                      go for autonomy and support for the Olympics, whereas most Tibetans
                      kept their sadness and disagreement within. Earlier on during the
                      nomination stages, Dalai Lama already supported China hosting Olympics.
                      Even now after the Tibet unrest, Dalai Lama still says that China
                      deserves to host Olympics. All these have costed Dalai Lama support
                      among his own people. Yet it is such an irony that China govt still
                      insists that he is a separatist and his main aim is to split China. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Before
                      this episode, sensing the anguish among the Tibetan community, I
                      already thought that if China still doesn't engage the Dalai Lama,
                      something will happen one day. Because the only reason why Tibetans
                      have been showing restraint for past 49 years is out of their respect
                      for the Dalai Lama. He is probably the only figure who can help China
                      work out a peaceful way of integrating the Tibetans into China, because
                      he still enjoys a very privileged position of being very widely revered
                      and adored by the Tibetans. If China continues to wait for him to pass
                      away (which is what they've been doing) or wait till he no longer has
                      that kind of influence over the Tibetan community, then it would be
                      very difficult to unite Tibetans. Anyway, China doesn't really need to
                      care, they have the patience and capability to wait until the last
                      Tibetan of this generation dies.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There
                      are many other things that have been happening in Tibet, China itself
                      in recent years and months that probably led to the escalation of the
                      conflict too. They have been systematically doing quite a lot of things
                      that increased the Tibetans' fear of losing their culture and
                      traditions. Although I'm sure the China govt also did some good things
                      like economic progress, but at the same time they've also done things
                      that really added a strong sense of threat and insecurity to the
                      Tibetan community. In the past, they only made the Tibetans read
                      anti-Dalai Lama verses once in half a year; now they increased the
                      frequency to two months once -it's really a direct hit at the heart of
                      the Tibetans who really really really love dalai lama dearly ("really"
                      many times, coz I saw it when I was in India). They stopped the system
                      of young boys becoming lamas and said they can only do it after the age
                      of 18, which has very great impact on the entire Buddhist education
                      system in Tibet. They checked and scrutinized large monasteries and
                      sent spies to India to check on monks who visit Dalai Lama or Karmapa
                      in India and threaten to close down their monasteries. This is not
                      hearsay, it's through personal contact I know of these things
                      happening. The monastery in question is not at all interested in
                      politics, they went to see Karmapa because he's the spiritual head of
                      their school and they need his advice on their spiritual practice. The
                      govt doesn't believe in reincarnation but elects the reincarnated
                      Panchen lama. They also want the lamas to apply through the govt to be
                      reincarnated in their next lives. All these are simply ridiculous and
                      unnecessary.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In
                      India we watched the Tibetan (China) channel and we could see that
                      Dalai Lama has frequently been portrayed as the evil person in the
                      channel. Even in the news, something as trivial as the grassroots
                      leaders teaching the Tibetan locals how to use a fire extinguisher,
                      they must add a comment that, "now the locals know how to protect
                      themselves, in case the Dalai group sets fire on them". Now if I were a
                      Tibetan, I would either be brainwashed into thinking that Dalai Lama is
                      really an evil person, or I would feel really oppressed and unjust.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The
                      other main thing is China brought an influx of Chinese into Tibet,
                      successfully making Tibetans a minority in their own area. Statistics
                      in 2007 stated that there are 6 million Tibetans and an estimated 7.5
                      million Chinese, most of whom are in Kham &amp; Amdo (taken from <em>Tibetan Voice</em>,
                      an Australian Tibetan magazine in English). In a government agency in
                      Tibet, with 100 job openings, only 2 Tibetans got the job, while
                      Chinese immigrants got 98 of the jobs. How then would the Tibetans feel
                      happy under Chinese rule, when they've been treated as second class in
                      their own area? The large extent of unemployment coupled with loss of
                      own cultural identity breeds much discontent and unhappiness among the
                      Tibetans, especially the Tibetan youths, who are also the main people
                      pushing the Tibetan movement this time round. These are also the young
                      people, who no longer feel as strongly towards the Dalai Lama as their
                      fathers do. These young people are now the ones who are now asking
                      Dalai Lama to give up on his "middle way approach" towards seeking
                      autonomy and demanding for free tibet.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I
                      don't want to come across as blaming the China govt either. There are
                      many circumstances that lead to Tibet's plight today. But one must also
                      understand why there is such resentment towards the China govt among
                      the community, even though China supposedly brought more wealth and
                      progress to selected parts of the region. If China has brought about so
                      much development and freedom, why are so many Tibetans now still
                      risking their lives to flee to India to become a refugee and live in
                      poverty? Who would want to live as a refugee?? Ruling by military and
                      iron fist just won't win you the hearts of the people. As the Chinese
                      aphorism goes, a leader needs to "yi3 de2 fu2 ren2" - win the hearts of
                      people through your virtues.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I personally believe Dalai Lama is the
                      key and that China should not be afraid of him but actively engage him
                      in dialogue, because then he can help China. Now China is rejecting
                      dalai lama's help and just blankly stating that he's behind the
                      violence- it's not going to help at all.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A number of Tibetans monks whom I know of had stated that while emotionally they feel they're Tibetan, they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">able to accept</span> that the nation-state is impermanent and they're not so concerned about
                      Tibetan independence. Some say that now they think it's a good idea to
                      be part of China. But they're really more concerned about the
                      preservation of the Buddhist teaching and the system of the Buddhist
                      education. As Tibet is probably one of the last living Buddhist
                      traditions that still preserves an almost complete system of Buddhist
                      philosophy and path. Once it gets interrupted, it's a loss to the whole
                      buddhist community, and in my opinion, to the whole world too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I
                      hope China is able to show the evidence of Dalai Lama's involvement
                      though, because it's just so unfair to Dalai Lama and proponents of the
                      peaceful Middle way approach.</div>

              <div>Why
                      I fwded the Avaaz letter to some of you is also because I think their
                      approach is correct - urging for peaceful dialogue with the dalai lama.
                      I'm not sure if it'll help, but I reckoned the least I can do is to
                      lend some support to these activitsts and also to try to raise some
                      awareness of what I know about the situation, and hopefully lend some
                      perspectives which has not been really reported by the chinese media.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>While
                      initially I was upset and worried for the Dalai Lama, later I felt more
                      settled, as I am sure that Dalai Lama, having practiced Buddhism for
                      such a long time, would have the wisdom and patience to be able to
                      live under such accusations. After all, it takes an adversity to show
                      the strength of one's character. The power of peace is a long and
                      arduous path and not without its challenges. But I believe, in the long
                      run, his insistence on adopting a peaceful approach will bear fruit and
                      people will appreciate the wisdom of remaining unmoved by agression.</div>

                      just signed an urgent petition calling on the Chinese government to
                      respect human rights in Tibet and engage in meaningful dialogue with
                      the Dalai Lama. This is really important, and I thought you might want
                      to take action:<br><br><a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/98.php/?cl_tf_sign=1">http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/98.php/?cl_tf_sign=1</a> <br><br>After
                      nearly 50 years of Chinese rule, the Tibetans are sending out a global
                      cry for change. But violence is spreading across Tibet and neighbouring
                      regions, and the Chinese regime is right now considering a choice
                      between increasing brutality or dialogue, that could determine the
                      future of Tibet and China. <br><br>We
                      can affect this historic choice. China does care about its
                      international reputation. Its economy is totally dependent on "Made in
                      China" exports that we all buy, and it is keen to make the Olympics in
                      Beijing this summer a celebration of a new China that is a respected
                      world power. <br><br>President Hu needs to hear that 'Brand China' and
                      the Olympics can succeed only if he makes the right choice. But it will
                      take an avalanche of global people power to get his attention. Click
                      below to join me and sign a petition to President Hu calling for
                      restraint in Tibet and dialogue with the Dalai Lama -- and tell
                      absolutely everyone you can right away. The petition is organized by
                      Avaaz, and they are urgently aiming to reach 1 million signatures to
                      deliver directly to Chinese officials:<br><br><a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/98.php/?cl_tf_sign=1">http://www.avaaz.org/en/tibet_end_the_violence/98.php/?cl_tf_sign=1</a> <br><br>Thank you so much for your help!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You are receiving this email because someone sent it to you via the "tell-a-friend" tool at <a href="http://avaaz.org/">Avaaz.org</a>.

              <p>Just my thoughts...</p>
              <p>it is sad what can be seen in the media that the monks and the tibetans are destroying everything in their paths. You can see that the monks were destroying bus stop sign and also shops gates...and Buddhism taught us to be tolerance and I also wonder what will their karma towards these damages...</p>
              <p>I am not supporting China or Tibet, but China being a communist country has, in a way, let the people practise their religions freely.</p>
              <p>Religions and politics should not mixed. Religions should be borderless...</p>

              <p>I have mixed views on this issue. On one hand, I sympathize Tibet and wholly support the Dalai Lama in his vow of non-voilence, but I am utterly dissappointed in the behavour of the Tibetans. They have a reputation of being spiritually elevated as compared to the rest of the world, but now they are behaving like a bunch of common thugs. I am even more appalled by the behavour of the Tibetan monks. As members of the Sangha, they should be the embodiment of Buddha's teaching. They should not go around smashing, destroying and looting. On the other hand, I also understand the hard stance adopted by the Chinese government. They cannot afford to allow Tibet independence, for if they do so, XinJiang, Taiwan etc. will follow suit. I just hope and pray that this entire episode will be resolved peacefully.</p>

Because it is a mark of entry into the Buddha's Dharma [a sutra] is known thereby as Buddhadharma. This is as [ordained] at the time of the Buddha's Parinirvana. He was in the state of Ku"sinigara, lying down between a pair of saala trees with his head to the North and was about to enter nirvana.<br><br>At that time because Ananda had not yet transcended [the realm of] desire, he had not yet gotten rid of the affection felt for one's relatives. His mind was immersed in a sea of grief and he was powerless to pull himself out. Then the "senior and elder" Aniruddha said to Ananda, "You are the one responsible for guarding the treasury of the Buddha's Dharma. You should not be immersed in a sea of grief like an ordinary person. All composite dharmas are characterized by impermanence. Don't be sorrowful.<br><br>Furthermore, the Buddha, with his own hand, has entrusted the Dharma to you. By now being so overcome with grief you are neglecting the responsibility you have undertaken. You should ask the Buddha, "After the Buddha's Parinirvana, how shall we cultivate the Way? Who shall serve as our teacher? How shall we dwell together with the foul- mouthed Chandaka? What phrases shall be placed at the beginning of the Buddha's scriptures? You should inquire of the Buddha on all manner of topics such as these which deal with the future."<br><br>When Ananda heard about these matters, his troubled mind revived somewhat, he regained the power of being mindful of the Way, and assisted alongside the Buddha's final resting place. He asked the Buddha about these matters and the Buddha told Ananda, "Whether right here and now or whether after I am gone, one should take refuge in oneself and take refuge in the Dharma and should not take refuge in anything else. How should a bhikshu take refuge in himself, take refuge in the Dharma and not take refuge in anything else? In this regard, a bhikshu should undertake the contemplation of his own body. He should constantly employ single-mindedness, wisdom, diligent cultivation and vigor in getting rid of the woe of worldly desire.<br><br>The contemplation of other's bodies and then of both his own and other's bodies should be taken up in like manner. The stations of mindfulness with regard to feelings, with regard to thoughts, and with regard to dharmas should each be taken up in this manner as well. This is what is meant by, `a bhikshu should take refuge in himself, take refuge in the Dharma, and should not take refuge in anything else.'"<br><br>"From this very day, The Scripture on the Liberating Precepts is your great Master. In one's physical actions and verbal actions, one should conduct oneself in accord with the declarations of The Scripture on the Liberating Precepts.<br><br><strong>"As for the bhikshu Chandaka, after my nirvana, treat him according to the brahman (silent treatment) method. If his mind becomes pliant and submissive, he should be taught the Sa.mthakaatyaayana Sutra. Then he may be able to attain the Way.</strong><br><br>"As for the treasury of Dharma jewels which I have accumulated throughout the course of three asa.mkhyeya kalpas, one should place this phrase at the beginning of [the scriptures in] this treasury: `Thus I have heard, at one time the Buddha was at such-and-such a country in such-and-such a direction, in the forest at such-and-such a location...' Why? This phrase has been spoken at the beginning of the scriptures of all of the Buddhas of the past. This phrase shall also be spoken at the beginning of the scriptures of all of the buddhas of the future. All of the Buddhas of the present, at the very end, at the time of their Parinirvana,-- they too instruct that this phrase should be spoken. Now, after my Parinirvana, at the beginning of the scriptures, one should also declare, 'Thus I have heard at one time...'"<br></em><a href="http://purifymind.com/Life.htm"><span style="color: #810081;">http://purifymind.com/Life.htm</span></a><br><br>/\ </div>

              <p>The dalai lama in my eyes will never do such acts. He is a strong supporter for peace in the world and practices peace, how will he do such things? Do not let propagenda of media and words get into your brain. People are just trying to brainwash thousands that dalai lama is bad. I can merely say if the dalai lama is considered bad, the rest of the people are all devils and upmost sinners. People never really find out and discover what is actually good or bad in a sense.</p>
              <p>The dalai lama is the incarnation of the bodhisattva. Even his actions will show you. What right does the china government has to say?</p>

              <p> Dalai Lama is NOT requesting for Tibetan Independence. He is NOT asking for Free Tibet. He is FOR an autonomous Tibet under Chinese rule and has always been requesting for peaceful dialogues with the China authorities, but had not received any positive response.</p>

              <p>The problem is Tibetan "autonomy" is only by name, there is no true autonomy in Tibet. That is why HHDL is pushing for true autonomy and also fairness for Tibetans -- not to be treated as second class citizens.</p>
              <p>I have no ideas of what HHDL thinks say 30, 40 years ago, but HHDL has never pushed nor supported independence nor separatist movements in recent times.</p>
