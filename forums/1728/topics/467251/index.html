              <div><span class="userContent"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Jackson Peterson:<br><br>Its interesting how 
                  different traditions package the notion of realization and the practices leading 
                  to it. For some they consider there is a "potential" mind of enlightenment that 
                  arises when various misconceptions and obscurations are removed or purified. 
                  <br><br>For some others the idea is one of there being an "untouched" 
                  enlightened self-nature that lies behind our current mind as ego-consciousness, 
                  that this current ego-mind dissolves into.<br><br>Again for some the enlightened 
                  mind is considered to be our current awareness as a witness to all experience 
                  yet remaining just as it always is. <br><br>All of these ideas are descriptions 
                  as to how reality is seen from various limited perspectives. But each one, even 
                  though relatively "workable" to a point, miss the opportunity to really hit the 
                  mark, so to speak.<br><br>We don't have "two minds", one enlightened and the 
                  other ignorant and impure. Rather we have only one mind. When we recognize the 
                  "empty nature" of our current state of mind, no matter how seemingly burdened 
                  and obscured it may be, we discover this mind is itself the "enlightened mind". 
                  When the empty nature of the mind is recognized, all the various "impurities" 
                  and "obscurations" instantly lose their ground as there is no longer a substance 
                  for their roots to cling to.<br><br>This is why it is said the we are all 
                  "Buddhas". Our mind when recognizing its true nature as emptiness is realized to 
                  be the Buddha Mind. The nature of our mind is essentially a knowing emptiness 
                  whose appearances are its luminosity. When the luminosity aspect becomes too 
                  intense the "emptiness" aspect is not noticed. It can render consciousness a bit 
                  bewildered. The elaborations that evolve from that overwhelming, vivid 
                  luminosity are our sense of self, self-stories, fixations and all the causes of 
                  suffering. These all evolve because the mind in its bewildered condition 
                  conceptually grasps for some ground and solidity where there is none to be 
                  found. When that same mind recognizes the empty nature of that vivid luminosity 
                  itself, it self-releases. This is like re-claiming the throne of Buddhahood that 
                  was always yours while remaining in the exact same place that you have always 
                  been.<br><br>How do we recognize the empty nature of our mind? What does the 
                  "empty nature of our mind" even mean?<br><br>If we simply examine one thought 
                  thoroughly, we will discover that it dissolves as fast as it appears. Its like a 
                  transparent hologram that appears in space and then disappears. You can't find 
                  any graspable substance no matter how much you try. In this way we conclude that 
                  our thought was empty of any actual enduring substance. But what remains when 
                  the thought vanishes? Not just a complete nihilistic absence, but rather a vivid 
                  and knowing awareness remains. This vivid, knowing, empty awareness is the true 
                  nature of thought, of every thought. All of our personal stories are made up of 
                  these empty thoughts. <br><br>Ours sense of self is made of these thoughts, 
                  empty thoughts. Outside of our empty thoughts there are no other causes of our 
                  suffering and anxiety. All of our negative emotions and passions are the same, 
                  empty of substance when examined. We can notice and recognize the empty nature 
                  of our suffering because of the empty nature of our thoughts. When we recognize 
                  the empty nature of our suffering authentically and directly, our suffering 
                  releases. <br><br>When we recognize the empty nature of our thoughts we 
                  immediately realize that our thoughts are themselves "awareness" as a vivid 
                  knowing. Thoughts have themselves revealed their nature to be empty awareness. 
                  When we recognize the empty nature of our negative emotions, we immediately 
                  realize that our negative emotions are themselves " knowing awareness". The 
                  luminous aspect now appears as radiant and vivid aware knowing. When we 
                  recognize the empty nature of our mind, we immediately realize that our mind, 
                  just as it appears, is itself the vivid awareness and knowing of a Buddha. When 
                  this is fully recognized and not just intellectually understood, a profound 
                  wisdom will arise that is the wisdom of a Buddha in full recognition of itself. 
                  <br><br>We then continue by simply resting in that realization. If we lose our 
                  clarity, we simply examine our condition again in order to recognize the 
                  inherent nature of its emptiness.<br><br></span></span><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment634953429865210_635040943189792}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment634953429865210_635040943189792}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0" class="UFICommentBody"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment634953429865210_635040943189792}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[0]"><span id=".reactRoot[1].[1][2][1]{comment634953429865210_635040943189792}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[0].[0]">This

              <p>I think many meals or not depend on the person's health, it does not depend on one's enlightenment. For example, Ven Hui Lu does not eat only one meal before noon, he used to do that but now his frail health does not permit it. But there is no doubt he is deeply enlightened.<br><br>Dalai Lama eats meat because of health issues... Many Tibetan lamas and Theravada monks who are enlightened are still eating five clean meat.</p>
