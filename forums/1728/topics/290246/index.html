It signaled his commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's unique culture based on Buddhist spiritual values. Like many moral goals, it is somewhat easier to state than to define. Nonetheless, it serves as a unifying vision for the Five Year planning process and all the derived planning documents that guide the economic and development plans of the country.<br><br>While conventional development models stress economic growth as the ultimate objective, the concept of GNH claims to be based on the premise that true development of human society takes place when material and spiritual development occur side by side to complement and reinforce each other. The four pillars of GNH are the promotion of equitable and sustainable socio-economic development, preservation and promotion of cultural values, conservation of the natural environment, and establishment of good governance.</span><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness</a><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

This one refused to give up!<br>At the end of the race, all had given up climbing the tower except for the one tiny frog who, after a big effort, was the only one who reached the top!<br>All of the other tiny frogs wanted to know how this one frog managed to do it.

              <p>For those who're interested, the stall is at one of the streets in Chinatown... I think Pagoda Street, but I'm not too sure. It's right at the end of the road to South Bridge Road and it's a stall selling DVDs and CDs.</p>
