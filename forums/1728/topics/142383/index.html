            <div class='col-md body'>Amituofo,<br>Conventionally speaking Amitabha and Shakyamuni Buddha are 2 different Buddhas. Shakyamuni Buddha attain Buddhahood about 2500-3000 years back. While Amitabha Buddha attain buddhahood about 10 mahakalpas ago,  a lot longer than Shakyamuni.<br><br>In the Buddha speak Brahma Net Sutra :  Shakyamuni Buddha said that, that was His 8000 times coming back in Saha World.<br><br><blockquote>"I have come to this world eight thousand times. Based in this Saha World, seated upon the Jeweled Diamond Seat in Bodhgaya and all the way up to the palace of the Brahma King, I have spoken in general about the Mind-Ground Dharma Door for the benefit of the great multitude. "</blockquote>You must meant Parinirvana than MahaParinirvana. Both Amitabha and Shakyamuni Buddha had not MahaParinirvana yet. Shakyamuni Buddha only will MahaParinirvana in around 5.67billions from now, when Maitreya Buddha come to take over as the next Buddha. Before then, they Parinirvana all the time when they go and display as Buddha in other World Systems.<br>Amitabha Buddha will MahaParinirvana in around measureless, limitless asamkhyeyas of kalpas from now when Kuan Shi Yin Bodhisattva take over to become Lord of Sukhavati (Western Land of Ultimate Bliss )<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, Shariputra, the lifespan of that Buddha and that of his people extends for  measureless, limitless asamkhyeyas of kalpas. For this reason he is called Amitayus. And, Shariputra, since Amitabha became a Buddha, ten kalpas have passed. -- Amitabha Sutra </blockquote>Measureless, limitless, asamkhyeyas are few of the last 10 namings of Buddhism number naming.<br>asamkhyeyas = abt 1 &amp; 59 zeros.<br>Measureless = asamkhyeyas x asamkhyeyas<br>limitless = Measureless x Measureless<br>This is excluding kalpas!<br><br>/\<br>Amituofo!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, Sinweiy for that informative post.<br><br>Maggot, yes, "lama" is a Tibetan word, a term for a (dharma) Teacher.<br>Tibetan Buddhism has a very special tradition different from the other forms of Buddhism, which is that the Lama/Rinpoche would give indications, prophecy, on where to find the next incarnation to take over his job after he dies. In addition, there are other lamas/yogis who would have visions of the new incarnation. After that they would go on a search, find the person, and do a test and if the person answers the tests perfectly, and, after consulting the Spiritual Oracle (not the Matrix one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) he can be considered the right incarnation.<br><br>I am personally not from Tibetan Buddhism, but one of the moderators, Origami, is. Perhaps he can share more insight on Tibetan things, if you have any questions.<br><br>In Buddhism there are three major traditions of Buddhism, but ultimately the teachings lead to the same goal. The three traditions are Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana. In additions there are different sects which focus on different practices, dharma doors. In Buddhism there are 84000 dharma doors, which explains why there are different practises. Each dharma door is like a medicine, if it works for you, then it is the best medicine.</div>
