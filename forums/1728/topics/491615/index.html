              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Caregiving from a
              Buddhist perspective is a recognition that this person’s suffering is also my
              suffering. When I see this, whether I’m the person in the bed or the person
              making the bed, I have to confront this precariousness. Buddhist practice can
              help us enormously in continuing to give our attention to what’s actually
              appearing, as opposed to being swept away by the drama of the process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>What are the basic
              attitudes that might be helpful in being with someone who is dying? One of
              those that comes to mind is to be completely ourselves. That means to bring our
              strength and vulnerability to the bedside. And to recognize that people who are
              dying continue to need very intimate and natural and honest relationships. We
              can’t serve from a distance, this is intimate work and we have to be part of
              the equation so it is absolutely essential that we bring our entire selves to
              the experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It’s important that
              we bring to the bedside the quality of empathy. This is maybe the greatest gift
              we can give another human being—our undivided attention. To listen without
              judgment or agendas. The great psychologist Carl Rogers once described empathy
              as “looking with fresh and unfrightened eyes.” I think that’s a wonderful way
              of thinking about how to be with someone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Also, simple human
              kindness. When people are sick, details matter. The manner in which we care for
              someone, the way in which we come forward to offer service, is incredibly
              important. How can we assist with the simple details? Holding the hand of a
              frightened patient, doing the laundry, helping someone fill out the insurance
              forms. Simple everyday activities offered with loving attention that convey
              acceptance, build trust, and enhance self-esteem. I would add “non-doing” to
              this list of helpful attitudes. To really have the confidence in our human
              presence. To slow down, and leave a lot of room for silence, to reduce
              distractions. Don’t miss this moment waiting for some future event, even the
              moment of dying.<br> <br> Part of my task is to try to take Buddhist practice and make it useful and
              accessible to people who are not experienced with it; to use language that
              doesn’t create more barriers. There’s a lot of talk out there about conscious
              dying. But we don’t speak so much about conscious caregiving. In dying,
              spiritual support is every bit as important as good pain control. But we rarely
              extend that kind of support in a meaningful way. And as a result, too many
              people are dying in distress and in fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So what is it to
              provide this support? I would say first and foremost, it’s about bearing
              witness. And that means not turning away when the going gets rough, staying
              present in the territory of mystery and unanswerable questions. Sometimes,
              depending on the person’s tradition, it means calling a priest to give last
              rites, or getting a prayer shawl, or helping to write letters of
              reconciliation. Rarely is it a matter of conducting existential discussions. Or
              even introducing formal practices. It’s helping people to face directly what’s
              occurring, to work with the paradoxes that they’re confronted with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Probably most
              important, is to become aware of our own bodies and minds. Let’s not
              underestimate this. It’s the most essential of all practices—one’s commitment
              to maintain awareness of one’s own mind, body, and heart in the middle of this.
              In doing this we help to create a calm and receptive environment for the person
              who is dying. If there is one person in the room who is calm—just one person—it
              eases the entire experience for everybody.</span></p>
