Last life of 'cause', this life of 'effect'.  The 'faith' for the existence is present in this life.<br><br>Many understand 'Cause &amp; Effect'.  But we should consider the 'Cause + Faith = effect'.<br><br>Cause is the seedings of action. Faith is sunlight and water. Effect is the result or outcome.  This outcome can be positive or negative to some, that depend on the faith. Meaning was water clean or was the sun light too strong etc.<br><br>Thus, when we 'SEE' someone in discomfort, try to help them, not only those in pain or illness.  Can help, we help.  Cannot help, wish them happy and well.<br><br>'My' wish is simple, "People happy, 'I' happy' - Just live life simple, and 'qi-cai' can liao.<br><br>Come to gain but go without any, only 'my' robe'.  Any thing we 'own' this life dun belongs to us.  We cannot have 'ownship' of house and car that we buy or relative that we have.  It is just that, we can use it temporary this life, in short dun be too attachment, stubbon or ego about what you achieve. We cannot bring ego to death.  Try showing ego infornt of 'Di Zang wang Pu Sa'.<br><br>End of the day, when we go, no attachment.  we can leave calmly.<br><br>Metta, Amitahba lord Buddha.</div>

'Self' can be used in a conventional sense. Like for example, an Arhant does 'concentrate on themselves'/focus on self-liberation and not saving other beings, yet they have fully realised No-Self. Buddha and Bodhisattvas have great compassion, although they realise No-Self, they go on to help all the sentient beings.<br><br>I also agree with you on collective selfishness. Collective karma leads to collective catastrophe/disaster. So how? By not taking part in that collective karma. By not being selfish in any way in the first place! Even though individual greed may not cause 'collective wars', it definitely can cause 'individual wars' with others. And being individually selfish doesn't equate to focusing on 'himself'. Actually if you practise the path of Arhant/Hinayana (small vehicle), you only focus on liberating yourself. But even so there is no place for selfishness if you wish to attain liberation. So you can focus on yourself, go retreat into the caves and mountains, meditate all day without ever meeting a single person and attain your own liberation... the highest stage is only Arhantship and not Buddhahood. But if you are selfish (implying you have personal desires for yourSELF, etc etc...) you will not attain liberation because you cannot transcend the illusion of a self, you cannot be freed from Greed, Hatred, Ignorance.<br><br>From what I feel about Satanism, there is a sort of 'egotism', self-centeredness (attachment to Self), tainted with the 3 poisons (Greed, Hatred, Ignorance). The problem is not whether you are focusing on yourself or not, but whether it teaches in accordance to Buddhadharma (also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=158048" rel="nofollow">The Four (dharma) Seals</a>)<br><br>But I will always ask people to walk the Bodhisattva way since I am a Mahayana Buddhist. It is through Bodhisattva path that one achieves full Enlightenment: Buddhahood.</div>

It is something that people in church say to vow to their beliefs about who is Jesus n God. It is about the "Trinity" the God, Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost thing...<br><br>Anyway...This "Nicene Creed" came about in the Roman Catholic church during something called "The Council of Nicea"...<br><br>This is where they took out the books about re-incarnation (and a few other things), because they were still in the midst of "shaping" the religion, and they felt it would contradict the other books...<br><br>That council is one of the reasons I am not to hip about modern xtianity...</div></blockquote>Oh I see... very interesting.. Yea, I believe Christianity after Roman Catholic reforms has changed quite a lot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. Back to topic. 'Any Christian-turned-Buddhist converts', as I have mentioned briefly in the first few posts, my master, my dharma teacher, and many people in my dharma centre were ex-Christians.<br><br>My Master for instance used to be an ex-Christian Pastor himself. I may have mentioned this several times in different posts, whether briefly or more in details, but I will elaborate on that now.<br><br>My Buddhist Master (Shi Fu) first went into spirituality after an incident when he was 12 years old. He was returning from school and along the way on the mountain (in China), a blizzard struck and he sought to take cover in a cave. It was so cold that he was going to freeze to death. At that time, he witnessed a divine sign. Huge words in red appeared in the sky, telling him "Humanity's bliss awaits you to be found". From that point he had the strength and survived and thought it was a miracle from God.<br><br>So this is how he became a Christian pastor. He was quite an active pastor in preaching and also wrote Christian books (he passed one of his Christian books with his author name to some of the Christians in U.S who visited him before just to show that he really was a pastor). Then at times, he was aggressive in evangelising and went on to insult Buddhism and degrade Buddhism as a superstitious and demonic religion. That was during his university days if I'm not wrong. His university lecturer heard about his aggressive evangelism and spoke with him about it. The lecturer asked him why is he doing this? My master replied "because the other pastors did so, if I didn't do it, the other pastors will say that I do not know how to preach"... thus he followed them. His university lecturer then told him that it was not the right way - people disliked it, and it will even bring down the university name. He asked my master to study the Buddhist teachings, and from that, write a critique based on his understandings.<br><br>So this is the turning point... my master researched into all the Buddhist teachings and could not find anything to write in his critique. On contrary, he agreed on all of the teachings! This is the teachings that will truly bring bliss into humanity. (He always say that Buddhism is the Culture of Bliss.. my dharma centre website is <a href="http://www.humanbliss.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.humanbliss.com.sg</a>) That is when he begin to truly regret and repent his earlier actions to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.... he turned into a Buddhist monk as a result. He often says "even blapshemy can become a 'yuan' for one to encounter Dharma". Sometimes inconceivable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dharma teacher also had inconceivable and 'divine intervention' stories that led her to turn into Buddhism just on that day she was going to be baptized! (her friends who brought her to baptize in the past are now in my dharma centre) From these we can see that the Tathagathas will really help to awaken past life practitioners to their bodhisattva vows <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But enough stories for now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
