Many people claim to worship gods but yet claim that they are Buddhists. This is not true. To be a Buddhist you must at least take refuge in the Three Treasures: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.</div>

Buddhists do not consider Buddha as a god, or an incarnation of a god or God - although right before his birth on planet Earth, he was the teacher of the gods in Tushita heaven.

Because gods do not necessarily mean they are liberated from Samsara... or are enlightened. Meaning... after millions/billions of years, they will still have to undergo rebirth. There are Brahmas who think otherwise that they enjoy eternal life, but such Brahmas are disillusioned after speaking to the Buddha.

And even the Brahmas/Devas take refuge in the Three Treasures seeking for enlightenment. He had been incarnated as a Maha Brahma before, also as a Celestial teacher in T U S H I T A (avoiding filter) Heaven before he came down to Earth to attain Buddhahood and be our teacher.

I converted because I spoke to the Creator when I was down and I believe He may have healed me. But my beliefs and moral values are strangely inclined towards Buddhism. Even now, when I attend church, cell group and bible class, I can't seem to take it all in. Used to attend CHC but can't take the atmosphere there - music makes it feel like a rock concert instead of a holy event and ppl praying as if in a trance and speaking gibberish (like in a cult). That's why I avoid going to cell group now, even though I still attend church and bible class.

Because I like what I see in Buddhism and in Buddhists. There's this unmasked, genuine kindness, humility and compassion in Buddhists.

Does it make logical sense for a good person to be condemn by God just because he did not believe in Jesus? I tell you, a person who has love and spend his time doing good deeds is better of than a person who sins and prays to jesus continuously for forgiveness.<br><br>What is expected from everybody by all religions is Love. Its is that simple. Do good and be Good. This is what is expected from christianity.... NOT going around preaching that Non believers will be condemn to hell....You think Jesus is happy with the christians who do that?<br><br></div></blockquote>concur,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not<br>be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again</span>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>this also is similar with "TRUE" Buddhism. but we seldom use 'love' (ai) we use pei (compassion). As love is conditional while compassion is unconditional. We also try not to mix with puppy love, gf, bf love. these kind of love can end up in sadness. Buddhism is careful on this.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Nirvana is not heaven, because even heaven is impermanent... eventually a deva/brahma has to undergo the impermanence of life, and be reborned... possibly even to the lower realms. On the other hand, Nirvana transcends time and space and is not to be mistaken as a physical realm, it is the state of eternal and highest bliss.<br><br>All religions teaches to be good... but Buddhism also emphasize, apart from being virtuous and avoiding evil deeds, the purification of our mind and liberation from samsara... as I have mentioned before.</div>
