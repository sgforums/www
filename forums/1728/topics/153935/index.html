            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, many Buddhists I know used to be Christian although I am not one of them... whether they are from my dharma centre, from the IRC chatroom, etc. Many highly enlightened people I know are used to be my Christians, among them my master (who used to be an active Christian pastor), my current dharma teacher.<br><br>Many chatters and operators from my IRC channel also used to be Christians like Thusness (who is also highly enlightened), Sanarth, naruto, myogyom, etc who posted in this forum. I guess I can say in most cases, it's probably because of the teachings (they agree with Buddhist teachings) that made them convert. Except my dharma teacher's case in which a spiritual revelation on the day she was to be baptised made her seek for Shakyamuni Buddha. (in ghimpheng's definition, my dharma teacher was never a Christian but it was close. she had agreed with the teachings mostly, and even discussed with the pastors days before. her friends who brought her to Christianity are now Buddhists who frequent my dharma centre)<br><br>BTW, surfbabe, you're Buddhist or Christian or free-thinker?

That is a Taoist/Chinese folks practise.<br><br>Anyway... Monkey God, as far as I know, is a fictional character. The Journey to the West book is a work of fiction written around the 16th century. It is NOT the real account of the journey to India to get the scriptures by Tang Shan Zhang.<br><br>Goddess of Mercy is actually Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva... In Mahayana Buddhism, the Maha Bodhisattvas are also important role models for us to learn from. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva represents Great Compassion.<br><br>Guan Yu is a worldly dharma protector. He used to be a very well known warlord Liu Bei who died in war... basically he became a spirit and met a Buddhist venerable and later he vowed to protect Buddhadharma for 3000 years. There is a story about this.... but I can't remember the details now. Does Sinweiy know? We do not worship Guan Yu, but we pay reverence/respect because of the noble work of this dharma protector.<br><br>I'm not sure about Songgo though...<br><br>True Buddhist teachings also teach people to change from bad to good - and not only that, purification of the mind. This is something that most religions do not focus on. The ultimate practise of Buddhism is in the liberation and purification of the Mind.. because the mind is the source of so many things. Good/evil, is all got to do with mind too. Miseries, afflictions, are also in our mind. Enlightenment is only possible with Pure Mind.</div>

He kept wanting his own life/body back... but the Buddhist venerable told him, "How many lives have you taken away, how can you expect to get your life back?"

Buddhists do not consider Buddha as a god, or an incarnation of a god or God - although right before his birth on planet Earth, he was the teacher of the gods in Tushita heaven. (Maitreya Bodhisattva took over his 'seat' after Shakyamuni Buddha came down to attain Buddhahood)<br><br>Why is this so? Because gods do not necessarily mean they are liberated from Samsara... or are enlightened. Meaning... after millions/billions of years, they will still have to undergo rebirth. There are Brahmas who think otherwise that they enjoy eternal life, but such Brahmas are disillusioned after speaking to the Buddha. One of them is the Maha Brahma (there are many other Brahmas with illusion of being the highest/eternal): <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185</a></div>

The other statues are the sages or the other celestial beings. In christianity, the other celestial beings are the angels and the archangels. Each different religion has so many celestial beings and sages.<br><br>So dont condemn other religion.</div>
