Like cell in our body, if more cells are spoiled, the whole body get sick.<br><br>another point that why eventually, individualism wouldn't work is for example, a group living together in a place. each don't care. you don't care, thinking, i'm happy, why care. then all think like that. then the enviroment become dirty, u live in that place, see you still happy or not. All must help to clean/protect the place wat.<br><br>oso in terms of Law and order. you are free to do anything? there's this boundary or obstructions that individualism/freewill is block by socialism.

            <div class='col-md body'>another interesting info just heard:<br><a href="http://www.amtb-aus.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amtb-aus.org/</a><br>Hua Yen, 1441b, 19min.<br><br><blockquote>Bodhisattva transfer their merits to all beings, and by doing so itself got benefit. We say gan3 ying4. And why beings gan3(beseech) Buddha/bodhisattva, and they got ying4(reactions). Because Buddha/bodhisattva have huai xiang xing(transfering mind), hence a reaction. Transfering mind is the inherit of Xing De(Original nature?). Everyday we must do transfer so as to cultivate Xiu De(cultivation virtue) to bring out our Xing De.<br>In the experiment, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">water shouldn't have 'mind/heart', and hence have no attachment, dualism, wandering thoughts. </span>but why we generate a good thoughts to them, they also have a good reaction. As we have a gan3, they have ying4. And that ying4 is due to Transfering mind.<br>This applies to people, when we treat people good, they also smile, when we treat people badly, they get angry. Even the people we don't know. This is but Natural reaction. <strong>There's no wandering thoughts</strong>. </blockquote>found the key liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>/\<br></div>
