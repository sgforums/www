Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha at Vulture Peak mountain, together with a great gathering of the sangha of monks and a great gathering of the sangha of bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered the samadhi that expresses the dharma called "profound illumination," and at the same time noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, while practicing the profound prajnaparamita, saw in this way: he saw the five skandhas to be empty of nature.<br><br>Then, through the power of the Buddha, venerable Shariputra said to noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, "How should a son or daughter of noble family train, who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita?"<br><br>Addressed in this way, noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, said to venerable Shariputra, "O Shariputra, a son or daughter of noble family who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita should see in this way: seeing the five skandhas to be empty of nature. <strong>Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness.</strong> In the same way, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are emptiness. Thus, Shariputra, all dharmas are emptiness. There are no characteristics. There is no birth and no cessation. There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no dharmas, no eye dhatu up to no mind dhatu, no dhatu of dharmas, no mind consciousness dhatu; no ignorance, no end of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no origin of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment. Therefore, Shariputra, since the bodhisattvas have no attainment, they abide by means of prajnaparamita.<br><br>Since there is no obscuration of mind, there is no fear. They transcend falsity and attain complete nirvana. All the buddhas of the three times, by means of prajnaparamita, fully awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment. Therefore, the great mantra of prajnaparamita, the mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the unequaled mantra, the mantra that calms all suffering, should be known as truth, since there is no deception. The prajnaparamita mantra is said in this way:<br><br>OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA<br><br>Thus, Shariputra, the bodhisattva mahasattva should train in the profound prajnaparamita.<br><br>Then the Blessed One arose from that samadhi and praised noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, saying, "Good, good, O son of noble family; thus it is, O son of noble family, thus it is. One should practice the profound prajnaparamita just as you have taught and all the tathagatas will rejoice."<br><br>When the Blessed One had said this, venerable Shariputra and noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, that whole assembly and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</blockquote>Chant or listen to heart sutra often... and meditate often.</div>

At all times, you should return<br>the light and reflect within. Don't be too tense, and don't be too slack. It's said,<br><br>Too tight, and it'll break. Too slack, and it'll be loose. Neither tight nor slack, and it will turn out right.<br><br>But neither tense nor slack is the Middle Way. Walking, standing, sitting and lying down, don't be apart from this. Once you<br>leave this, you have missed it. What is this? It's the ultimate meaning of the Middle Way.<br><br>In investigating Chan, you must be impartial, not leaning to one side. Don't go too far, and don't fail to go far enough. If you<br>go too far, or not far enough, it's not the Middle Way. <strong>If you don't fall into the two extremes of emptiness and existence, then<br>that's the Middle Way.</strong> It's said, `The Middle Way is neither emptiness nor existence.' It is True Emptiness and Wonderful<br>Existence. Do not be attached to true emptiness, and do not be obstructed by wonderful existence, for true emptiness and<br>wonderful existence cannot be grasped or renounced. You cannot take hold of them or let go of them. That's the true<br>emptiness and wonderful existence.<br><br>When you are applying effort, you should finish what you start; only then will you accomplish anything. As it's said, "Carry it<br>through from beginning to end." You shouldn't "put it in the sun for one day and freeze it for ten," retreat in the face of<br>difficulty, or give up halfway - that's the behavior of people without backbone. The ancients said,<br><br>In cultivation, don't be afraid to go slowly. Just be afraid of standing still.<br><br>In your daily investigation of Chan, be mindful of your own meditation topic, and slash through all your idle thoughts with<br>your Vajra-jewelled sword of wisdom. When idle thinking is severed, wisdom will arise. With the light of wisdom, you can<br>smash through the gloom of ignorance. Once ignorance is smashed, you can transcend the Three Realms, escape birth and<br>death, and crash your way out of the wheel of life (i.e. the twelve links of conditioned co- production).<br><br>Those who apply effort in cultivating the Way must have patience. No matter how hard it is, you must patiently bear it. With<br>patience you can reach the other shore. So in joining this Chan Session, you all should not be afraid of hardship. It's said,<br>"When bitterness ends, sweetness comes." If you don't start at the very bottom, you can't reach the top. Remember that a ten<br>thousand foot skyscraper is built from the ground up. It isn't built in mid-air. Therefore, Chan cultivators must start with the<br>basics, which are to get rid of idle thinking. If you can stop your idle thoughts, then at that point,<br><br>The moon appears in the waters of a pure heart; There are no clouds in the sky of a calm mind.<br><br>When the heart is at peace, all problems go away. When the mind is still, the myriad things are in harmony. As it is said:<br><br>True wealth is stopping the mind and cutting off thought: True fields of blessings are devoid of all selfish desires.<br><br>One investigates Chan just to get rid of the false and keep the true. It is also to pan for gold, to look for gold dust in the sand,<br>which is a difficult task. But if you want to find gold, you have to look in the sand, and be patient. Do you want to understand<br>your inherent Buddha-nature? Do you want to understand your mind and see your nature? Then you must patiently cultivate,<br>study and investigate, and when enough time has passed, you will suddenly penetrate and enlighten to the fact that it is<br>originally this way!<br><br>------------------------<br><br>True emptiness does not contradict wonderful existence.<br><br>However when you hold on one view as absolute, then it is wrong.</div>

[/b]</blockquote>I agree very much with your posting. I would like to add on my understandings currently... as I have mentioned before a few years back I had a sudden understanding of Heart Sutra (just a 'ah-hah' but not enlightenment)... not by thinking or contemplating - but it just came to me after a very peaceful meditation session and coming across a heart sutra line "emptiness is form, form is emptiness".<br><br>The reason why we think of things as seperate is because we are attached to the mental image/concepts/mental constructs of a thing. This is due to GRASPING. Mental constructs are only appearances, it is not reality.<br><br>It goes like this... "X" is your mental construct, therefore there is<br><br>1. Existence of X<br>2. Non-existence of X<br>3. Both existence and non-existence of X<br>4. Neither existence nor non-existence of X<br><br>but in the end you are still attached to 'X'. In reality just IS. There is no 'experiencer', no 'thing' experienced. Just awareness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The gateway into Buddhism is really about coming to a realisation about the complete relationship between our true self with everything in the Universe.<br><br>I stand to believe that Buddhism is one of the most peaceful religion in the world. In fact, Buddhism, at foundation level, describes about the natural phenomenal or universal law in a very convincing manner for me.<br><br>Everyone can choose whether to believe it or not, it is really own's individual decision. I really like this phrase in Chinese (often hear it in the Buddhist community)  "Lai Zhe Bu Ju, Qu Zhe Bu Liu". Everyone are welcome into Buddhism and anyone can leave at free will.<br><br>Amitabha.<br><br>Peace.</div>
