            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">I tend to think Nirvarna as a state of enlightenment rather than a plcae itself. But to say acheiving Nirvarna is much higher than the heaven itself might be a bit wrong. Gautama Bhuddha who acheived the highest level of Enlightenment is not a God. He probably can only reach up to the stage where he does not need to undergo rebirth anymore. The Gods are in heaven (celestial world) are different. Some of them are of a higher rank than Bhuddha even though they did not undergo Nirvarna...</div></blockquote>Some people may have already replied you... but I haven't got time to finish reading all their posts.<br><br>Indeed the Buddha is not a God. However, the Buddha is the <strong>teacher of gods and men</strong>. He has perfected wisdom and compassion (methods) and is able to help himself and others to attain Nirvana - a state of Enlightenment that is beyond the <strong>pain of dualism</strong>.<br><br>What is dualism? It is the fixated concepts of good/bad, high/low; it is fixation, rigidity, grasping, attachment.<br><br>"Heaven is good/desirable and hell is bad/scary." These are dualistic notions, which the Buddha has seen their nature as impermanent, dissatisfactory and painful. Whether one is born in heaven, hell or any other realm, one's existence ensures that one will experience the dukkha of birth, old age, sickness, death and so forth.<br><br>Gods are not of higher rank than the Buddha and cannot be, for Gods, like us, are tied by the ignorance of dualism. They are still happy about existence, about getting what they want, and scared about death, angry/unhappy when they don't get what they want. They are swayed by changing conditions and hence are not free. [P/S: Look at how the Christian God describes himself to be a Jealous God; and the stories of how local Chinese deities get angry over their devotees...]<br><br>The Buddha, on the other hand, is beyond dualism, beyond birth and death, beyond the 6 realms of rebirth, beyond happiness/sadness, beyond good/bad. Thus, attaining Buddhahood is the ultimate liberation and is beyond comparison.</div>

Everything put Self as most important.<br><br>In Buddhism, we don't follow this understanding. Self is only an illusion. We are not self centered but we are compassionate. This phrase is something I love to use:<br><br>"A human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. The true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive. (Albert Einstein, 1954)"<br><br>Perhaps the topic on 'Cease your False Self and your True Self lives' should be an interesting read.<br><br>Buddhism believes that only by realising No-self, the Buddha Nature will manifest. That is enlightenment, that is the path to end sufferings. That is the main difference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is very possible to attain realisation in this life if you practise well. Although you cannot attain Buddhahood, at least you will start on the Bodhisattva path as a 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva after realising Buddha Nature. There are actually quite a lot of people that I know who are quite enlightened now.<br><br>Doing good things is one matter. But doing virtuous deeds with a wrong mindset results in very very little virtue - it is like a Seed planted on bad grounds/infertile soil (ground = mind) and will not bear much fruits (blessings), only very little. That is also not merits. If you do a good deed out of self-benefit as grounds, attached to self, then no matter how great a thing you did it also cannot be considered as true Merits. Accumulating merits is another matter. Merits can only be accumulated when there is Non Arising (Gong) and Non-cessation (De). This kind of merits is vast &amp; boundless!<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no4e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no4e.htm</a><br><br><strong>4. Is there any merit in giving?<br><br>During the time when the Patriarch Bodhidharma was in China, the Emperor Liang Wu-Ti paid him a visit and asked, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated?"<br><br>Without any expression in his face, the Patriarch Bodhidharma replied, "No merits."<br><br>How could it be that after having done so much, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti had not accumulated any merit?<br><br>In Buddhism, merits refer to the non-arising and non-cessation of the mind. Therefore, when we are doing good deeds such as giving, we can only say that there are blessings associated with such deeds, but not merits. When a person who truly understands the Buddha-dharma gives without attaching to the notion of giving, he certainly does not expect other people to thank him. The Diamond Sutra states that if the magnanimity of a giver is as vast as the space, in future the reward of his blessings will be just as vast.<br><br>I remember when we were building the Manjusri Hall; a person contributed a certain sum of money. Two years later, this person visited the Manjusri Hall and went around searching for where his name might be inscribed. I explained to him that many people had contributed financially, materials and other efforts to the building. Since nobody had requested for his or her names to be inscribed, it would be awkward to inscribe just his name. He didn't understand and instead became slanderous. Somebody even remarked that he might be better off giving to those temples where deities are worshipped as they will inscribe his name in the temples. These were temples of superstitious beliefs. He really did so and was no longer interested in learning and practising Buddhism. He no longer seeks to unfold his wisdom. This person was so attached to his act of giving and had unwittingly ended his wisdom life. It is such a pity that he chose to believe in superstition rather than be an authentic practitioner of Buddhism.</strong><br><br><blockquote>From: Sutra of Hui-Neng<br><br>------------------------------------------<br>Chapter III. Questions and Answers<br><br>One day Prefect Wei entertained the Patriarch and asked him to preach to a big gathering. At the end of the feast, Prefect Wei asked him to mount the pulpit (to which the Patriarch consented). After bowing twice reverently, in company with other officials, scholars, and commoners, Prefect Wei said, "I have heard what Your Holiness preached. It is really so deep that it is beyond our mind and speech, and I have certain doubts which I hope you will clear up for me." "If you have any doubts," replied the Patriarch, "please ask, and I will explain."<br>"What you preach are the fundamental principles taught by Bodhidharma, are they not?" "Yes," replied the Patriarch. "I was told," said Prefect Wei, "that at Bodhidharma's first interview with Emperor Wu of Liang he was asked what merits the Emperor would get for the work of his life in building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained (royal consent was necessary at that time), giving alms and entertaining the Order; and his reply was that these would bring no merits ar all. Now, I cannot understand why he gave such an answer. Will you please explain."<br><br>"These would bring no merits," replied the Patriarch. "Don't doubt the words of the Sage. Emperor Wu's mind was under an erroneous impression, and he did not know the orthodox teaching. Such deeds as building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained, giving alms and entertaining the Order will bring you only felicities, which should not be taken for merits. Merits are to be found within the Dharmakaya, and they have nothing to do with practices for attaining felicities."<br><br>The Patriarch went on, "Realization of the Essence of Mind is Gong (good deserts), and equality is De (good quality). When our mental activity works without any impediment, so that we are in a position to know constantly the true state and the mysterious functioning of our own mind, we are said to have acquired Gong De (merits). Within, to keep the mind in a humble mood is Gong; and without, to behave oneself according to propriety is De. That all things are the manifestation of the Essence of Mind is Gong, and that the quintessence of mind is free from idle thoughts is De. Not to go astray from the Essence of Mind is , and not to pollute the mind in using it is De. If you seek for merits within the Dharmakaya, and do what I have just said, what you acquire will be real merits. He who works for merits does not slight others; and on all occasions he treats everybody with respect. <strong>He who is in the habit of looking down upon others has not got rid of the erroneous idea of a self, which indicates his lack of Gong. Because of his egotism and his habitual contempt for all others, he knows not the real Essence of Mind; and this shows his lack of De.</strong> Learned Audience, when our mental activity works without interruption, then it is Gong; and when our mind functions in a straightforward manner, then it is De. To train our own mind is Gong, and to train our own body is De. Learned Audience, merits should be sought within the Essence of Mind and they cannot be acquired by almsgiving, entertaining the monks, etc. We should therefore distinguish between felicities and merits. There is nothing wrong in what our Patriarch said. It is Emperor Wu himself who did not know the true way."</blockquote></div>

But it also does not mean we should be overly self-conscious in any way... Follow the model of 'Dao De'.<br><br>Anyway loyal to country is a good virtue. In Buddhism there are 4 kindness we need to repay, one of them is the 'Country's Kindness'.<br><br>4 Kindness:<br><br>1) Country's kindness<br>2) Parents' kindness<br>3) Teachers' &amp; Seniors' kindness<br>4) Triple Gems' kindness<br><br>Of course, it doesn't mean if you had the choice we should blindly follow a dictatorial system, or go to war with another country with aggressive intentions like the Nazis. However Singapore is not such a country and our NS is for defence and not aggression, therefore it is a good way to repay our country's kindness.</div>
