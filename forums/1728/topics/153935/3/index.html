If you know Tibetan Buddhism you would be familiar with the term 'luminosity'. Nirvana is not annihilism as it is both empty, yet luminous. The point in me saying this is because some people may be 'scared off' because they think that Nirvana means that they will be annihilated, but there is nothing scary about Nirvana at all if you understand it well.<br><br>Also if you are familiar with Nagarjuna's teachings, one of his good works is <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/nargarjuna's_sixty_verses_of_arguments.htm" rel="nofollow">Nagarjuna's Sixty Verses of Arguments</a>. It is mentioned many times in one way or another... <span style="font-style: italic;">Nirvana is not about eliminating something. Nothing really exist, so nothing can really be annihilated. The causes of our suffering do not really exist, so how could they be real eliminated. It is just a matter of directly seeing their real nature.</span></div>

I would like to relate to a brief introduction to the birth of Shakyamuni Buddha, especially the part starting from "The birth of the Prince":<br><br><strong>Life Of Buddha, The Invitation of the Gods</strong><br><br>Our Bodhisatta (1) was born in Tusita Heaven (2) as a Deva (3) by the name of Svetaketu. The Devas in Tusita Heaven were happy. The time had come for the Bodhisatta to be born in the world for the last time. The Devas invited the Bodhisatta to be born on earth.<br><br>The Bodhisatta looked down at the world to make sure that the five requirements necessary for His final birth in the world were met. These five requirements are as follows:<br><br>1. The right time - The life span of human beings at a time a Buddha is born is between 100 and 100,000 years. If the life span is very short, human beings want to enjoy their short life to the fullest and tend to be very fond of material things. If the life span is very long, they tend to forget the impermanence of life. At this time the Bodhisatta found that the life span was one hundred and twenty years.<br><br>2. The right continent - All Buddhas are born in India (known as Jumbudipa at the time of the Buddha). This is because the people of India are spiritually more advanced than people in other countries, and so are more ready for a Buddha.<br><br>3. The right area - The city of Kapilavatthu was chosen as the city of the future Buddha, as there was a just and good king and many righteous people living there.<br><br>4. The right caste - A Buddha is always born in a high caste - Either a royal caste or a priestly caste. This is necessary, as often persons born in a low caste are not accepted by society.<br><br>5. The right mother - The mother of a Buddha has to be very pure. She is a person who has resolved to be a mother of a Buddha and observed the five precepts for many countless past lives. The chosen mother was Queen Mahaa Maayaa, wife of King Suddhodana of Kapilavatthu.<br><br>The Bodhisatta saw that the five requirements were met.<br><br>(1). Bodhisatta - One on his way to perfection. This is the name given to a person who is trying to be a Buddha.<br><br>(2). Tusita Heaven - One of the seven happy planes of life. The Devas in the Tusita Heaven have a life span of 576,000,000 human years. All Bodhisattas who have completed the ten perfections await the right time for their last birth in Tusita Heaven. The next Buddha, the Maithreya Buddha, is at present a Deva by the name of Natha in the Tusita Heaven.<br><br>(3). Devas - Heavenly beings known in English as gods or divine beings.<br><br>Queen Mahaa Maayaa's dream<br>One night Queen Mahaa Maayaa had a dream. She dreamt that the Devas from the four directions of the earth took her to Lake Anotatta on top of the Himalayan mountain. She was bathed in the lake and dressed in heavenly clothes and ornaments. A white baby elephant carrying a white lotus flower in its trunk trumpeted, and after circling around her three times, entered her body.<br><br>The next morning she told King Suddhodana of her dream. He consulted some wise men who, on hearing the dream said, "The Queen will have a wise and noble baby boy." The king and queen were very happy for they had no children and were longing for a child.<br><br><strong>The birth of a Prince</strong><br>According to the custom of that time, Queen Mahaa Maayaa decided to visit her mother so that she could be with her at the time of the birth of her baby.<br><br>On the way she stopped at the Lumbini Pleasure Garden to rest. Under a sweet-scented Sal tree, on a full moon day in the month of May, in the year 623 B.C., the Prince was born miraculously from her right hips, and Queen Mahaa Maayaa suffered no pain in the process.<br><br>The baby Prince took seven steps, and a lotus flower burst through the ground to receive His feet. He made the following announcement:<br><br><strong>"Aggo hamasmi lokassa - "I am the Chief in the world<br>Jettho hamasmi lokassa - There is no equal to me<br>Settho hamasmi lokassa - I am Supreme<br>Ayamanthima jathi - This is my last birth<br>Natthi dani punabbhavo. - " No rebirth for me."</strong><br><br>It is said in the Anagata Vamsa that the next Buddha, Maithreya, will make a similar announcement at His birth.<br><br>The ministers took the Queen and the baby back to Kapilavatthu and King Suddhodana. Many wise men came to see the baby. They said that one day the Prince would either be a King of the world or a Supreme Buddha. The baby Prince was named Siddhaartha Gotama. Siddhaartha means "wish fulfilled" and Gotama was His family name.<br><br>Seven days after the birth of the Prince, Queen Mahaa Maayaa died. She was born as a Deva by the name of Matu-deva putta in the Tusita Heaven. Her sister, Mahaa Prajaapathi Gotami, took care of the Prince.</div>

So you are saying Nirvana transcends the heavens and the other Gods and Celestial Beings?</div></blockquote>Amtf shade343,<br><br>In a way samsara is a 'places/realms' when people/sentient beings still "pretends" to be "Acting" in a dramas. In one act, one pretends to be Creator, then in another scene, one pretend to be a God, then in another scene, one pretend to be a human...etcs. Samsara is like a dream. When one thinks that the Dream is real, and attached to it they suffer. But Buddha is said to be Awaken from all these pretending and false dream/illusions.  You watch Matrix? It's like that, Neo also woke up from a pretending enviroment. How? By ending attachment itself.<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ordinally bliss when ended, suffering occur there after.<br>Know that suffering is real, and bliss is false. As suffering don't become bliss, but bliss can become suffering. Unchanging is real, while changing is false.<br>Example, when eating good food. Eating my favourite food is bliss. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">But, if were to continue to eat bowl after bowl of the same food, it becomes a suffering. This is how bliss become suffering. Bliss if continuous become suffering. But suffering if continuous will not be bliss.<br>Example, when hungry, i am experiencing suffering. If continue to stay hungry for 7 days, i will experience more suffering, not bliss. So suffering is real, and bliss is false.<br><br>Now neither suffering nor bliss is a good experience/realm. But one cannot sustain this state as time waits for no man.<br>Example when we are born, we are already walking towards the deathbed. Who can stop moving? None.<br>But it's said that in the Land of Ulitmate Bliss(aka Nirvana), there's no all above three forms of sufferings.<br>In this samsara world there's duality in one. Suffering and bliss is Prejudiced view for one side or the other. If Land of Ulitmate Bliss has no suffering, then Bliss is also gone. As both are on the same side. One gone, the other will too have to go with it. It's when both suffering and bliss is ended/sever that bring forth the Land of Ulitmate Bliss. Thus called True bliss/happiness. If there happiness, then happiness is suffering and false. Land of Ulitmate Bliss is indeed inconcievable! Inconcievable mean cannot be said, nor cannot be think nor cannot be percieve.<br><br>The Infinity Life and Amitabha sutra describes Land of Ulitmate Bliss , but it is the Avatamsaka Sutra that is most detail.<br><br>/\amtf</div>

But it is not to be mistaken as a state of utter Annihilism/Nihilism.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Theravada Buddhism maintains that Nibbana is not non-existence, but it is a transcendental entity, independently existent. It is an external, unchangeable state which exists by itself. Buddhaghosa of Srilanka rejects the view that Nibbana is non-existent. According to him, a mere fact that Nibbana is not apprehended by an ordinary man does not prove that Nibbana does not exist. Nibbana can be seen by the right means (the way of morality, concentration and wisdom) (Vism. XVI. 50<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Nibbana is not non-existence; rather it is positive, permanent reality. To substantiate his view, Buddhaghosa quotes the Buddha's words:<br><br><strong>Monks, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unconditioned. If that unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned were not, an escape from what is born, become, made, conditioned would not be apparent. But, since, monks, there is an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, therefore, the escape from what is born, become, made, conditioned is apparent. (Ud. 80-81).</strong><br><br>Thus, Nibbana as conceived in early Buddhism is not non-existence or utter annihilation. It is the realm of being, which transcends the phenomenal world (Mererk, 1988, p. 162).</span><br><br><a href="http://www.mcu.ac.th/article/html/dissertation_47/11dissertation47.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcu.ac.th/article/html/dissertation_47/11dissertation47.html</a></div>
