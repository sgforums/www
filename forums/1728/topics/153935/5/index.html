In Buddhism there are 4 kindness we need to repay, one of them is the 'Country's Kindness'.<br><br>4 Kindness:<br><br>1) Country's kindness<br>2) Parents' kindness<br>3) Teachers' &amp; Seniors' kindness<br>4) Triple Gems' kindness<br><br>Of course, it doesn't mean if you had the choice we should blindly follow a dictatorial system, or go to war with another country with aggressive intentions like the Nazis. However Singapore is not such a country and our NS is for defence and not aggression, therefore it is a good way to repay our country's kindness.</div></blockquote>what about countries which are less clear cut like USA? The way they have committed attrocities in the name of 'justice'? Nazi Germany was very clear cut evil, but USA is a less clear equation. Also, Singapore I believe is less clear as well. U have to question is it actually repaying "country's kindness" or repaying "PAP's 'kindness' " Personally I dun think my country was very kind to me, or for that matter, to most of the countries' youths. Our country's educational system produces people as cogs for the social machine, it does not encourage the pursuit of your own dreams. Maybe u will say that these are selfish thoughts, but there has to be a balance between devotion towards society and self. Is it right for society to treat individal human lives as disposable tools for its own 'benefit' when in reality that concerns a painful existance and ruined dreams?</div>

William Calley and his 120 men of charlie company are considered heros while Officer Hugh Thompson Jr and his crew, who were prepared to open fire on their fellow comrades are considered villians then?<br><br>Lt. William Calley and his men, in case u don't know were responsible for the now infamous Mai Lai Village Massacre in Vietnam. Less well known, is Officer Hugh Thompson Jr, who was the pilot of a huey chopper belonging to the Aerial Scout Unit, and his crew Crew Chief Glenn Andreotta and Spc Lawrence Colburn, who tried to stop the massacre.<br><br>It is this notion that one must be loyal to one's country which caused Officer Hugh Thompson Jr to be villified in his own country. Is this fair? In the view of absolute good and bad, of honour and infamy, I feel that he has certainly done something very honourable. Risking court-martial (for ordering his crew to open fire on fellow americans if necessary) and for saving Vietnamese lives at a time when USA was at war with vietnam. Sometimes, u have to adhere to your own principles even if it means going against your country. And upholding your own principles against all odds is, to me, a kind of putting self foremost. For me, self is not just self interest, but also self principles and beliefs. And that is what led Officer Hugh Thompson Jr to do the honourable that day.<br><br>extract from www.usanews.com:<br><br>Skimming over the Vietnamese village of My Lai in a helicopter with a bubble-shaped windshield, 24-year-old Hugh Thompson had a superb view of the ground below. But what the Army pilot saw didn't make any sense: piles of Vietnamese bodies and dead water buffalo. He and his two younger crew mates, Lawrence Colburn and Glenn Andreotta, were flying low over the hamlet on March 16, 1968, trying to draw fire so that two gunships flying above could locate and destroy the enemy. On this morning, no one was shooting at them. And yet they saw bodies everywhere, and the wounded civilians they had earlier marked for medical aid were now all dead.<br><br>As the helicopter hovered a few feet over a paddy field, the team watched a group of Americans approach a wounded young woman lying on the ground. A captain nudged her with his foot, then shot her. The men in the helicopter recoiled in horror, shouting, "You son of a Bitch!"<br><br>Thompson couldn't believe it. His suspicions and fear began to grow as they flew over the eastern side of the village and saw dozens of bodies piled in an irrigation ditch. Soldiers were standing nearby, taking a cigarette break. Thompson racked his brains for an explanation. Maybe the civilians had fled to the ditch for cover? Maybe they'd been accidentally killed and the soldiers had made a mass grave? The Army warrant officer just couldn't wrap his mind around the truth of My Lai.<br><br>On that historic morning, Thompson set his helicopter down near the irrigation ditch full of bodies. He asked a sergeant if the soldiers could help the civilians, some of whom were still moving. The sergeant suggested putting them out of their misery. Stunned, Thompson turned to Lieutenant Calley, who told him to mind his own business. Thompson reluctantly got back in his helicopter and began to lift off. Just then Andreotta yelled, "My God, they're firing into the ditch!"<br><br>Thompson finally faced the truth. He and his crew flew around for a few minutes, outraged, wondering what to do. Then they saw several elderly adults and children running for a shelter, chased by Americans. "We thought they had about 30 seconds before they'd die," recalls Colburn. Thompson landed his chopper between the troops and the shelter, then jumped out and confronted the lieutenant in charge of the chase. He asked for assistance in escorting the civilians out of the bunker; the lieutenant said he'd get them out with a hand grenade. Furious, Thompson announced he was taking the civilians out. He went back to Colburn and Andreotta and told them if the Americans fired, to shoot them. "Glenn and I were staring at each other, dumbfounded," says Colburn. He says he never pointed his gun at an American soldier, but he might have fired if they had first. The ground soldiers waited and watched.<br><br>Thompson coaxed the Vietnamese out of the shelter with hand gestures. They followed, wary. Thompson looked at his three-man helicopter and realized he had nowhere to put them. "There was no thinking about it," he says now. "It was just something that had to be done, and it had to be done fast." He got on the radio and begged the gunships to land and fly the four adults and five children to safety, which they did within minutes.<br><br>Before returning to base, the helicopter crew saw something moving in the irrigation ditchÂ–a child, about 4 years old. Andreotta waded through bloody cadavers to pull him out. Thompson, who had a son, was overcome by emotion. He immediately flew the child to a nearby hospital.<br><br>Thompson wasted no time telling his superiors what had happened. "They said I was screaming quite loud. I was mad. I threatened never to fly again," Thompson remembers. "I didn't want to be a part of that. It wasn't war." An investigation followed, but it was cursory at best.<br><br>A month later, Andreotta died in combat. Thompson was shot down and returned home to teach helicopter piloting. Colburn served his tour of duty and left the military. The two figured those involved in the killing had been court-martialed. In fact, nothing had happened. But rumors of the massacre persisted. One soldier who heard of the atrocities, Ron Ridenhour, vowed to make them public. In the spring of 1969, he sent letters to government officials, which led to a real investigation and sickening revelations: murdered babies and old men, raped and mutilated women, in a village where U.S. soldiers mistakenly expected to find lots of Viet Cong.<br><br>The Pentagon's investigation eventually suggested that nearly 80 soldiers had participated in the killing and coverup, although only Calley (who now works at a jewelry store in Columbus, Ga.) was convicted. The eyewitness testimony of Thompson and Colburn proved crucial. But instead of thanking them, America vilified them. Many saw Calley as a scapegoat for regrettable but inevitable civilian casualties. "Rallies for Calley" were held all over the country. Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, urged citizens to leave car headlights on to show support for Calley. Thompson, who got nasty letters and death threats, remembers thinking: "Has everyone gone mad?" He feared a court-martial for his command to fire, if necessary, on U.S. soldiers.<br><br>Gradually the furor died down. Colburn and Thompson lived in relative anonymity until a 1989 television documentary on My Lai reclaimed them as forgotten heroes. David Egan, a Clemson University professor who had served in a French village where Nazis killed scores of innocents in World War II, was amazed by the story. He campaigned to have Thompson and his team awarded the coveted Soldier's Medal. It wasn't until March 6, 1998, after internal debate among Pentagon officials (who feared an award would reopen old wounds) and outside pressure from reporters, that Thompson and Colburn finally received medals in a ceremony at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.<br><br>But both say a far more gratifying reward was a trip back to My Lai this March to dedicate a school and a "peace park." It was then they finally met a young man named Do Hoa, who they believe was the boy they rescued from that death-filled ditch. "Being reunited with the boy was just...I can't even describe it," says Colburn. And Thompson, also overwhelmed, doesn't even try.</div>

All these have to require wisdom. Buddha never ask anyone to blindly follow their rulers, repaying kindness is just something we ought to do because of what the nation has provided us.<br><br>Similarly for example, repaying kindness to parents. In Chinese we call it 'Filial Piety', or 'Xiao Shun'. In Buddhism however, we advocate 'Xiao4', but not necessarily 'Shun4'. 'Xiao' means doing your part as a child, giving moral support to ur parents, economical support/etc etc when they are old, all these kind of things are what we as children have to do whether or not our parents have treated us well when we are young or whether we like them. They have given birth to our body, and without our body how can we have any other things in the world? Then how about 'Shun'? We don't need to 'Shun' everything our parents say. If parents tell you to rob, then you should be wise enough not to 'Shun'. If parents smoke, you shouldnt be influenced.<br><br>But anyway I don't think PAP is really that bad. My master even praised LKY being like a bodhisattva for his great job in transforming our nation during his Singapore dharma talk to the masses in 1989 (many thousands of people attended). Anyway, lets not change this topic into a PAP bashing conversation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Qin Shi Huang I dare say, is one of them.<br><br>and your analogy, it does benefit the whole, but u're talking about body parts without the capability of sentinent thoughts, body parts who do not have an individual soul benefitting a human with a soul n sentinent thought, as opposed to human beings with sentinent thoughts and souls benefitting society which, itself is not a living being with sentinent thought and a soul.</div>

All these have to require wisdom. Buddha never ask anyone to blindly follow their rulers, repaying kindness is just something we ought to do because of what the nation has provided us.<br><br>Similarly for example, repaying kindness to parents. In Chinese we call it 'Filial Piety', or 'Xiao Shun'. In Buddhism however, we advocate 'Xiao4', but not necessarily 'Shun4'. 'Xiao' means doing your part as a child, giving moral support to ur parents, economical support/etc etc while they are old, all these kind of this are what we as children have to do whether or not our parents have treated us well when we are young or whether we like them. They have given birth to our body, and without our body how can we have any other things in the world? Then how about 'Shun'? We don't need to 'Shun' everything our parents say. If parents tell you to rob, then you should be wise enough not to 'Shun'. If parents smoke, you shouldnt be influenced.<br><br>But anyway I don't think PAP is really that bad.
