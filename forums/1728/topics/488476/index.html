              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Here, atop the Kudumbigala Rock, experience the ascetic’s
              tranquil way of life firsthand. Wrapped in an atmosphere of calm, Buddhist
              monks, who have renounced even the austere comforts of the village temple, lead
              an isolated existence, absorbed in mediation, seeking the all elusive inner
              peace. They follow in the steps of their religious brethren, who continuously
              made this rocky habitat their forest hermitage for 2,000 years. 
              Cloistered from external distractions, ensconced amidst rocks and trees and balmed
              by a soothing breeze, they strive to attain Nirvana, which Buddhists hold as
              the spiritual kingdom where freedom of the mind reigns  supreme.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Leave behind your emotional
              baggage, conditioned thoughts, prejudices and perceived notions at the foot of
              this rock, steeped in history. And begin to take the first step on a pilgrim’s
              progress to explore the serenity of an entirely different world.  The long
              and winding path to the top of the rock is placidly beautiful with each step
              inviting you to take the next, which inexorably you do. The soil on the ground
              is sandy white, clean and pure.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Tall trees and even taller
              boulders flank the enchanting path as it twists and turns leading toward the
              summit where the ambience provides one with the opportunity to discover the
              joys of losing one’s ego. At one point in the trek, you find the path taking
              you through two giant boulders, a rocky canyon. Rocks rise on either side and
              some slope away.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>On the way, you might happen to
              chance upon a solitary monk on the path cleaning the ground with a broom. He
              meets you with a smile and for a moment stops his cleaning activity to greet
              you. You inquire from him a few details of the place you are in and he smiles
              and tells you to make those inquiries from the monk at the top of the summit
              who might find the time to explain such matters. He explains-again with a few
              words and a smile, not in any apologetic or condescending way but in a matter
              of fact manner-he has to clean his path in the time he himself has allotted to
              that task, for time is of the essence. Thus you begin to understand that here
              on this isolated rock the sense and degree of discipline exerted by its
              inhabitants towards time management is ever present.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>A band of monkeys flitting from
              tree to tree, from rock to rock, having all the time to spare, follow your
              movement and keep close guard and watch as you make your progress up the rock,
              wondering perhaps who it is who dares invade the celestial citadel of
              tranquility of which they appear to be the self appointed custodians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Further up you come across a
              few ‘kutis’, the private meditating and living chambers of the resident monks,
              quaintly secluded under protruding boulders. Away from the path and deeper in
              the surrounding forest inhabited by wandering elephants and honey seeking
              bears, are over 200 archeologically listed rock caves which some monks use as
              their ‘kutis’.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Soon, after a journey that has
              taken you half an hour, you take the final step and ascend the plateau.
              Throughout the climb, apart from the solitary monk doing his cleaning chores,
              you have not come across any one. But you are not alone and neither are you the
              first. More than 2,300 years ago this rock was the chosen seat of an ancient
              monastery of meditating monks, and has been so ever since except for a few hundred
              years when western colonialists occupied Sri Lanka. The monastic complex was
              originally established in 246 BC, during the reign of King Devanampiyatissa,
              the king who first made Buddhism the religion of the land. As further evidence
              of this is a small brick built ancient stupa stands at the right end of the
              tableland. It was built by King Kavan Tissa (205-161BC) the father of King
              Dutugamunu.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>After years of remaining
              uninhabited during the period when Sri Lanka was under foreign domination, the
              lost rock of Kudumbigala was discovered in 1942 by Upasaka Maithree, who had
              been a catholic from the town of Negombo and an employee of the Ceylon
              Railways. He was also an amateur explorer and one day whilst he was sojourning
              in the East Coast and foraying into the surrounding jungles he stumbled upon
              the hidden history of the rock. He was so allured by the spiritualistic air
              that pervaded the placid atmosphere, he experienced a mystic conversion and
              10years later, returned to the still uninhabited rock to take up abode as
              Upasaka Maithree. He lived and mediated on this rock and then invited an
              ordained monk to take up residence with other monks, invitations which were
              duly accepted. He passed away on this rock in 1971 after expressing a wish that
              his remains should be kept on display in a rock cave. His wish was honored and
              his skeleton remained on display behind a glass frame until 1994 when it was
              vandalized and his bones thrown into the jungle.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Kudumbigala, along with its
              sister rock Balumgala, is part of the Kudumbigala Tapas Vanaya, a 640 acre area
              under the Chief Monk Ven Palawatte Buddhawansa Thera. Today there are about 15
              monks who have chosen out of their own free-will to dwell in this wilderness in
              pursuit of that eternal goal. They live a solitary existence and have their own
              individualistic way of attaining it. No rudimentary or regimented codes exist
              to govern their routine or their conduct. No external authority is imposed upon
              their lifestyle, no big brother watches to monitor their progress. Here, the
              individual is totally responsible for himself and has the unbridled freedom to
              forge his own future.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>A small hall next to the stupa
              serves as a dining area and as a place where Dhamma sermons are preached to the
              laity when the occasion so demands. But this, too, is limited for there is a
              general reluctance on the part of these taciturn monks to preach, on the basis
              that one must first attain higher states of wisdom before one can teach
              anything meaningful.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>This hall is the only meeting place for the monks, but even here
              in this dining hall many don’t eat but serve themselves from the pots on
              display and retire to their kutis to partake their food. They will consume any
              food that is available in the pots which are offered by the villagers and other
              donors and do not discriminate between the food offered; their purpose is
              solely to nourish the body that contains the mind, not to gain satiation from
              sense-based gratifications. The mystic lure of Kudumbigala’s ascetic way of
              life will hold one in a seductive spell; and draw one back to hark the call of
              meditation rock.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Kudumbigala Monastery lies 11 miles from Panama and 17 miles away from the
              Kumana Village.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>Kudumbigala monastic complex was built in 246 BC, during the
              time of King Devanampiyatissa. It was first established as a refuge for the
              Buddhist monks, who wanted to get away from the busy cities. Archeologists had
              recovered 200 rock caves belonging to this forgotten monastery.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>The inscriptions in Brahmi
              script and other evidence in the recently discovered cave, Maha Sudharshana
              Lena, shows that Kudumbigala was established as an Aranya Senansanaya in the
              pre-Christian era. A stone inscription has it that the Maha Sudharshana Lena
              was built and gifted to the Arahats by the Giant Warrior Nandimitra, one of King
              Dutugemunu’s “Dasa Maha Yodayas”, the ten giant warriors.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 24.3pt;">The importance of the
              Kudumbigala monastery cannot be expressed in words. The Only Cylindrical Dagaba
              to survive in Sri Lanka today, is in this monastery.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 24.3pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.3pt; box-sizing: border-box; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'> LTTE terrorists have thrown tar on the head of the Buddha statue.
