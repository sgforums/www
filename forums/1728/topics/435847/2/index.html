              <p>I see. I believe you will get to enjoy life when your children become working adults. Anyway, many people are leading the kind of working life you are leading. Recite Amituofo and Guan Shi Yin Pusa. You will see your life will improve. Good luck to you.</p>

              live within your means .  Something can't be bought by money alone. Like taking a long slow stroll at the beach. It's as good as a meditation session.
              
              Many things are free.  The fresh air in the morning, the ability to see, hear, sense and enjoy nature's beauty.  This doesn't cost you any money. Just some efforts and time to consciously add it to your life quality.

              <p>May sound somewhat cruel (paiseh and sorry, k?), but it's dangerous to think along the lines that you wish to be re-united with your family members after all leave this world.  If your family members also share this view, this attachment could keep all of you stuck in <em>samsara</em>.  In recent years - but I don't know how I will think/feel about it when it comes to the crunch - I have managed to get to the point where I accept that their "destinies" are theirs and mine is mine.  If they attain liberation or gain rebirth in Pureland, that would be great; but if not, that's that also. </p>
              <p>Eventually, all will have to trod that path towards liberation.  We are family members in this lifetime, but we've also had family members in other lifetimes.  Need to loosen the attachment.</p>

              <p>This question is one which everyone need to ask every single moment when faced with demands of this life. </p>
              <p>In realizing that all along there is no 'doer' does not mean that one shuts out from the roles and responsibilities in this life, nor does it mean that one has to give up possesions, and to be able to come to this realization we must first be honest with ourselves.</p>
              <p>This radical honesty is  required in the first place, which will force us to look at our life as it is without the taints of our opinions of how it should be. Whichever adversities we have to go through, meditation will not remove them from this life immediately, instead it will expose the deeper pains and patience is required to work with these pains. Bit by bit we realize the workings of the mind, and the ways in which we are bound by the mental states. Then as one releases these trappings, the realization of no-self will unfold naturally in time.</p>
              <p>While we practice in this way, the ongoing demands of daily life requires one to take on positions which allows proper functioning in the various roles one undertakes. It certainly doesn't mean that one should live in a prescribed way when one is practicing, this is just another mental concept. Instead, with right view established there's a freedom to live this life to the fullest with honesty. Work hard, strive to be the best in our careers and relationships, and provide for the needy. Material and physical endeavours need not be different, what is different is the attitude and view towards them. </p>

              Accordance to statistic, 90% of our worries don't come true. There is no point worrying about what will happen when it may not happen? Though we can try to build a safety net to pre-empt but worrying does not solve the problem and instead, draining one's energy away. You should focus on how and what you improve. Start by baby steps if you can't make a drastic change first.. and slowly improving. 
                                          
              "Enjoy life" is such a broad term. So i don't know what you infer by there or how. A little enjoyment and having joy in life is healthy. :) Life is not suffering. What Buddha meant is that, in life there is suffering. Then he points out a way to cease suffering. Pointing to Four Noble Truth and Noble Eightfold path. It is also good to seek refuge in the triple gems when we feel troubled.
                                          
              We have only one short life here. Go ahead make the best out of it by meditating, doing good deeds and fufill our worldly responsiblities. We can live our daily life, moment to moment meaningfully and deedly by practising mindfulness. Mindfulness has so much benefit in life.
                                       
              I kudos you for thinking for your parents. It is very merituous deed to take care of one's parents. A teacher once said that she notice that most of the people who take care well of their parents have a more smooth sailing and successful life.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>It once
              occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right time
              to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen
              to, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what was
              the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he
              might undertake. And this thought having occurred to him, he had it
              proclaimed throughout his kingdom that he would give a great reward
              to anyone who would teach him what was the right time for every
              action, and who were the most necessary people, and how he might
              know what was the most important thing to do. And learned men came
              to the King, but they all answered his questions
              differently.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>In reply
              to the first question, some said that to know the right time for
              every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months
              and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said
              they, could everything be done at its proper time. Others declared
              that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time for
              every action; but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle
              pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, and
              then do what was most needful. Others, again, said that however
              attentive the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible
              for one man to decide correctly the right time for every action,
              but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help him
              to fix the proper time for everything. But then again others said
              there were some things which could not wait to be laid before a
              Council, but about which one had at once to decide whether to
              undertake them or not. But in order to decide that, one must know
              beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know
              that; and, therefore, in order to know the right time for every
              action, one must consult magicians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>Equally
              various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the
              people the King most needed were his counselors; others, the
              priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the
              most necessary.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>To the
              third question, as to what was the most important occupation: some
              replied that the most important thing in the world was science.
              Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was
              religious worship.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>All the
              answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and
              gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right
              answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely
              renowned for his wisdom.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>The hermit
              lived in a wood which he never left, and he received none but
              common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching
              the hermit's cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his
              body-guard behind, went on alone.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>When the
              King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of his
              hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The
              hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into
              the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed heavily. The King
              went up to him and said: "I have come to you, wise hermit, to ask
              you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right
              thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need, and to
              whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest? And,
              what affairs are the most important, and need my first attention?"
              The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat
              on his hand and recommenced digging.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>"You are
              tired," said the King, "let me take the spade and work awhile for
              you." "Thanks!" said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King,
              he sat down on the ground. When he had dug two beds, the King
              stopped and repeated his questions. The hermit again gave no
              answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for the spade, and said:
              "Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit." But the King did not give
              him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour passed, and another.
              The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the King at last stuck
              the spade into the ground, and said: "I came to you, wise man, for
              an answer to my questions. If you can give me none, tell me so, and
              I will return home."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>"Here
              comes someone running," said the hermit, "let us see who it is."
              The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of
              the wood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and
              blood was flowing from under them. When he reached the King, he
              fell fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit
              unfastened the man's clothing. There was a large wound in his
              stomach. The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged it with
              his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had. But the blood
              would not stop flowing and the King again and again removed the
              bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and re-bandaged the
              wound.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>When at
              last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked for
              something to drink. The King brought fresh water and gave it to
              him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool. So the
              King, with the hermit's help, carried the wounded man into the hut
              and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes
              and was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the
              work he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also
              fell asleep--so soundly that he slept all through the short summer
              night.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>When he
              awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where he
              was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing
              intently at him with shining eyes. "Forgive me!" said the bearded
              man in a weak voice, when he saw that the King was awake and was
              looking at him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>"I do not
              know you and have nothing to forgive you for." said the King. "You
              do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore
              to revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and
              seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit,
              and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the day passed and
              you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I
              came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me, and wounded me. I
              escaped from them, but should have bled to death had you not
              dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved my life.
              Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most
              faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive
              me!"</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>The King
              was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and to
              have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said
              he would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and
              promised to restore his property.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>Having
              taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch
              and looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once
              more to beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was
              outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug
              the day before. The King approached him, and said: "For the last
              time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man." "You have
              already been answered!" said the hermit, still crouching on his
              thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.
              "Answered how? What do you mean?" asked the King.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span>"Do you
              not see," replied the hermit. "If you had not pitied my weakness
              yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your
              way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have repented
              of not having stayed with me. So the most important time was when
              you were digging the beds; and I was the most important man; and to
              do me good was your most important business. Afterwards when that
              man ran to us, the most important time was when you were attending
              to him, for if you had not bound up his wounds he would have died
              without having made peace with you. So he was the most important
              man, and what you did for him was your most important business.
              Remember then: there is only one time that is important--Now! It is
              the most important time because it is the only time when we have
              any power. The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no
              man knows whether he will ever have dealings with anyone else: and
              the most important affair is to do him good, because for that
              purpose alone was man sent into this life!"</span></p>

                                  <p>Accordance to statistic, 90% of our worries donâ€™t come true.
                  There is no point worrying about what will happen when it may not
                  happen? Though we can try to build a safety net to pre-empt but
                  worrying does not solve the problem and instead, draining oneâ€™s
                  energy away. You should focus on how and what you improve. Start by
                  baby steps if you canâ€™t make a drastic change first.. and slowly
                  improving.</p>
                  <p>â€œEnjoy lifeâ€� is such a broad term. So i donâ€™t know what you
                  infer by there or how. A little enjoyment and having joy in life is
                  healthy. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"> Life is
                  not suffering. What Buddha meant is that, in life there is
                  suffering. Then he points out a way to cease suffering. Pointing to
                  Four Noble Truth and Noble Eightfold path. It is also good to seek
                  refuge in the triple gems when we feel troubled.</p>
                  <p>We have only one short life here. Go ahead make the best out of
                  it by meditating, doing good deeds and fufill our worldly
                  responsiblities. We can live our daily life, moment to moment
                  meaningfully and deedly by practising mindfulness. Mindfulness has
                  so much benefit in life.</p>
                  <p>I kudos you for thinking for your parents. It is very merituous
                  deed to take care of oneâ€™s parents. A teacher once said that she
                  notice that most of the people who take care well of their parents
                  have a more smooth sailing and successful life.</p>

                  Yes, alot are unfounded worries. I used to worry about being late for appointment. Even if you are late, nothing disastrous will happen. Unless the appointment is very important one.

              <p>hi likeyou</p>
              <p>everyone has its share of suffering. Confucius suffer from 
              rejection as a great moral teacher and death of his favourite disciple 
              during his earthly life. Buddha suffer from the false accusation, death 
              of his disciple, betrayer of Devadatta and etc.Jesus suffer from 
              betrayer of Judas and people of Jersusalem. When one moment exalt him as
               their King and next crying for his death. These great men survive its all.</p>
              <p>If saint also has it own share of sorrow, what's more for the common mortal like us. my teacher, Nichiren once said, <em><strong>"Suffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard 
              both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting ........ no matter what happens."</strong></em></p>
              <p>Perhaps
               only when one has experienced the hardship then one can truly 
              appreciate and enjoy the happy moments of life.</p>
              <p>Viktor Frankl, a Nazi survivor who lose everything in the war once said <strong>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human 
              freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, 
              to choose one's own way."</strong></p>
              <p>I hope u too will carry that right attitude in the journey of life.</p>

              <p>how can you live in the present moment when there is no 'you'? and how can the present moment not live itself? It is simply a manifestation of causes and conditions. so how does it have anything to do with a 'you'?</p>

              <p>I guess I get you now. There is no"I", so the one living is not me, so the past, the present and the future are simply a manifestation of causes and conditions. Logical to me as there are many times when we can't control what is happening around us.</p>

              <p>May sound somewhat cruel (paiseh and sorry, k?), but it's dangerous to think along the lines that you wish to be re-united with your family members after all leave this world.  If your family members also share this view, this attachment could keep all of you stuck in <em>samsara</em>.  In recent years - but I don't know how I will think/feel about it when it comes to the crunch - I have managed to get to the point where I accept that their "destinies" are theirs and mine is mine.  If they attain liberation or gain rebirth in Pureland, that would be great; but if not, that's that also. </p>
              <p>Eventually, all will have to trod that path towards liberation.  We are family members in this lifetime, but we've also had family members in other lifetimes.  Need to loosen the attachment.</p>
