              <p>Well, I believe it is partly due to our past karma. Buddhism is teaching us how to change our destiny. So, not everything is pre-determined by karma, it can be changed by practicing according to Buddha's dharma. I notice many Buddhists don't chant in the temple. It is good to participate in their chanting event. There are many chanting which is to lighten our "sins". You will see changes in your life if you constantly practice æ‹œå¿� (repentance).</p>

              <p>a part of it is due to past karma, i agree. yet i actually on the contrary also think that it's the working of Buddha/bodhisattvas trying to lossen our attachment to samsara; trying to let us "clear away" our past retribution; trying to let as see through the suffering of samsara so that one can practice toward Pureland. even heard of an abusive husband, where the wife practice Pureland. and also not forgetting the queen in Contemplation Sutra.</p>
              <p>we have to pull through like the 'aunties' bodhisattva in realization's story. they are really showing a great example for us.</p>

              <p>This is a big question and there can be no one-size-fits-all solution. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/bigsmile.png" alt="bigsmile.png"></p>
              <p>By violence, do you mean toddler A hitting toddler B?  And so the adult goes up to toddler A, gives a benign slap on his bottom so that the kid may learn that it's painful to be hit?</p>
              <p>Or do you mean, country A bombing country B?  ... with country C coming in and deciding that only by means of attacking country A, and killing its innocent civilians can all atrocities come to an end.</p>
              <p>Or, perhaps you mean... your neighbours are quarrelling and soon you can hear that the husband is being bashed by the wife with a frying pan (or vice versa).  You agonise over ignoring the situation, versus calling the police in to mediate.  However, you also worry that by the time the police come, one spouse would already be heavily injured.</p>
              <p>The cop-out answer would be to say that we should act according to what the situation requires; but really, that's also probably the only way there is for such matters.  We can only hope that we make the right decision on the spot and that we remain cool-headed throughout it all.</p>

              <div>I'm Kelvin, 29. </div>
              <div>Ever since I entered the "real world", I don't feel as calm or
              as happy compared to life being a student.  There seems to be
              more burdens and responsibilities. More worries, doubts and
              fears. <br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I realized that much of my worries revolved around the theme,
              "What If something bad happened, Will I be able to survive? Will I
              be able to support my parents?". For me, that means to have enough
              financially. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>As an elder son, in a Chinese family, i feel the heavy
              responsibility on my shoulder.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It's part of the reason why I started practising Meditation
              (Mindfulness). I hope that it will help me stay focus, calm my
              thoughts, and keep me sane. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I have been thinking about Impermanence. Ultimately, nothing
              is permanent. Three Hundred years from today, I, my parents, will
              turn into dust and ash. Whether by sickness, accident, or natural
              cause.. we are all going to die. Things we owned, things we say or
              did will be long forgotten. If things are so temporal, should I be
              so caught up by Whether I have enough? Since having much, or having
              little changes little about the fact that we are all going to be
              gone, then why does it matter? Should I just enjoy what I have,
              live from moment to moment? Don't worry about WHAT IFs? Isn't that
              careless??</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MY struggle now is, is that the right perspective to
              life? </div>
              <div>What should be my right attitude? I don't want to feel so
              worried and stressed.. i don't wanna be tied up by
              money. </div>
              <div><br></div>

              <p>May I also suggest that you start learning chanting. Chanting booklets (such as Great Compassion Dharana, Heart Sutra, Guanyin Pumenping)  are easily available in most Chinese buddhist temples.</p>
              <p>Besides meditation, daily practices of chanting not only helps one to learn the dharma, but also has an important effect of calming one's mind; thirdly you gain lots of good merits from chanting and you can dedicate this merits to your family, all sentient beings. It has an important effect on relieving your own sufferings or people around you. Chanting allows you to be protected by Buddha, Bodhisattva and prevents you from being harmed by the evil. Most devoted buddhist practises "chanting homework" in the morning and night at home. However, as a general rule, avoid chanting "out" in the bedroom and toilet. That is to say, if you're in the bedroom and toilet, you can chant only in your mind (don't say it out). The best way to chant is to chant in front of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Chanting (esp. in Chinese Buddism) can come in the following form:</p>
              <p><strong>Chanting Buddha/Bodhisattva's Name</strong>: E.g. å�—ç„¡é˜¿å½Œé™€ä½› (Namo Amituofo), å�—ç„¡æ•‘è‹¦æ•‘é›£è§€ä¸–éŸ³è�©è–© (Namo Jiuku Jiunan Guanshiyin Pusa)</p>
              <p><strong>Chanting Mantra </strong>: E.g. Om Mani Padme Hom (6 syllabus Mantra) ,</p>
              <p><strong>Chanting Sutra</strong>:  They are usually longer. E.g. Amitabha Sutra (ä½›èªªé˜¿å½Œé™€ä½›ç¶“ï¼‰, Heart Sutra (å¿ƒç¶“ï¼‰ï¼ŒDiamond Sutra (é‡‘å‰›ç¶“ï¼‰ï¼Œ Ksitigarbha Sutra (åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è–©æœ¬é¡˜ç¶“ï¼‰</p>
              <p><strong>Dedication of Merits to Sentient Beings</strong> ï¼ˆå›žå�‘çµ¦æ³•ç•Œè¡†ç”Ÿï¼‰:</p>
              <p>It is important to dedicate merits of chanting to all sentient beings after you chant.</p>
