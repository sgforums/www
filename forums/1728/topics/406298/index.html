              <p>This era is called an age of degeneration on a global scale, sickness, famine, war and conflict continue to intensify, while individually our well-being and contentment diminish. In a well-known prayer of supplication, Padmasambhava is called the "Precious, supreme protector in these degenerate times." Through the strength of his loving kindness, paintings, statues and other images of this "supreme protector" are a source of calm and harmony wherever they are placed. By participating in their construction, individuals directly bring global benefit as well as making a personal connection to these blessings.</p>
              <p>Khenpo Namdrol Rinpoche's address at the opening of the temple of Zandog Palri in Mysore, India<br><a href="http://www.padmaworldpeace.org/resources-knr-on-guru-rinpoche-04-mysore.html">http://www.padmaworldpeace.org/resources-knr-on-guru-rinpoche-04-mysore.html</a></p>
              <p>To directly counter the prevailing negativity in the current age, in 2002 the Venerable Khenpo Namdrol Rinpoche, head of the Palyul Retreat Center in Nepal, initiated a project to create numerous statues of Padmasambhava. Her Majesty the Queen Mother of Bhutan, Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck, helped Khenpo Rinpoche plant the first seed by assisting in the process of building a master copy of a Padmasambhava statue in the traditional likeness of the "Lotus Born." The model was first made with clay, which proved to be too brittle and had to be reworked in brass for durability. When the model was finally completed and a mold was taken from it, however, casts from this mold produced identical, richly detailed, thirteen-foot tall brass statues weighing 1,100 kilograms apiece.</p>

              <p>Seven of these exquisite statues have been finished: one has been sent to Nepal; one to California, America; four to India: Sikkim, Bodhgaya, Manali and Namdroling Monastery in Mysore each received one; and the most recent was given to one of the eight locations or LINGS established by Longchenpa in Bhutan which was in ruins, and under reconstruction at present. Through Ven. Khenpo Namdrol's Padmasambhava Global Project for World Peace, statues are constantly being cast from the original mold and are intended for further distribution in Europe, Asia and around the globe.</p>
              <p><br>In 2004, His Holiness the Dalai Lama determined to build 100,000 Padmasambhava statues of all sizes to be spread around the world as a blessing.The Global Project for World Peace has made a similar determination to continuously create duplicates from this great mold, with the goal of placing 25 statues throughout the world specifically to deter negativity and spread blessings of compassion and wisdom.</p>

              <p>Khenpo Namdrol's aspiration to dispel negativity is being realized by the placement of the powerful Guru Rinpoche statues throughout the world. Through Khenpo's kindness and with his blessings of the Padmasambhava Global Project for World Peace, statues are constantly being cast from the original mold and are intended for further distribution around the globe.</p>

              <p>Khenpo Namdrol, founder of the Padmasambhava Global Project for World Peace, was born in 1953 at Dege to Tsedrung and Choetso. At the age of seven, in 1959, he fled Tibet and reached Bylakuppe, South India. In 1968, he did Bum-Nga (the five hundred thousand accumulations of the preliminary practice). From Nyoshul Khenpo, a great Dzogchen Master, he received the teachings of the Thirty-Seven Practices of Bodhisattvas), Vishestava (Praise in Distinction to Buddha), and Mipham RinpocheÕs Tong Thun Sengei Ngaro (Notes on Tathagarbha entitled Roar of the Lion).</p>
              <p>Khenpo Khedrub taught him the Mipham's Commentary to Abhidharmakosha, Commentary to Madyamakalankara, Condensed Tenet Concepts from the Treasury of Wish Fulfilling Gem, and Mipham Rinpoche's Notes on Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara.</p>
              <p>He also received the teachings on Mipham Rinpoche's Notes on Nagarjuna's Mulaprajna and other Madhyamika treatises. Later, he went to Sikkim for five years, where he received various teachings on Prajnaparamita, Madhyamika, Pramana and other sutra teachings from Khenpo Tsondrue. He also received Tantra teachings including Longchenpa's Trilogy of Self-Liberation and Key to the Treasure - a general commentary to Guhyagarbha Tantra.</p>
              <p> At 25, according to the wishes of His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, along with Khenpo Tsondrue, he returned to Namdroling Monastery. In 1978, since the establishment of Ngagyur Nyingma Institute, he has been a key person in administering and teaching at the institute. In 1983, His Holiness Penor Rinpoche conferred the degree of a Khenpo on him.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.padmaworldpeace.org/namdrol.html">http://www.padmaworldpeace.org/namdrol.html</a><br> <br>The results of Guru Padmasambhava's activities include the attainment of liberation by his 25 disciples and 80 other disciples who attained rainbow body. In addition, three million disciples achieved stability in tantric generation stage practice, one hundred thousand disciples showed signs of accomplishment, ninety thousand disciples achieved the uncontaminated Illusory Body, and eighty million disciples had some attainment. Having accomplished these great activities, knowing his personal beings to be tamed on Earth were exhausted, he departed for the Southwestern universe of the magical cannibals, to help the beings there and to protect Earth from their harm.</p>
