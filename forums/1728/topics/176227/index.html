But i think anyone can be buddha once you attain nirvana.<br><br>Answer 2 is when you reach pt.1 when you fully understood the meaning of life.<br><br>3. Buddha actually by hierarchy is above all levels of godship. (i.e. shen). He nie-pan, not die. When you reach nirvana, you can get out of liu-tao, when you get released from world.<br><br>4. I believe the sutras are actually written by buddha's disciples etc. You can get the book copies from good temple which have libraries. Mostly attainable from old temples in china, indian and maybe taiwan and singapore. I mean those books not the same as those distributable books you get from everywhere for reciting of the chants, but more high level ones.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

When you are being chased by a tiger and you woken up from the fright ?where are your dreams ? If dreams is false ,why is the tiger in the dream so REAL?<br><br>3.Buddha is a not a God .He did not die ,He passed into the suchness of undescribable state , not here or there ,that is Nirvana .If you practise well , you can still see Him .<br><br>4.There are so many Buddhist sutra which was compiled during the ancient times ,and to trace the historic development takes many many posting<br>but basically they teaches (from Buddha ) the merit of doing good things and the universal nature of Impermanence, All pheonomenon are suffering ,All pheonomenon are without an "I"<br><br>Everyone can be Buddha,Buddha Sakyamuni treat everyone as Buddha ,not as slave ,so you can be one , If you practise hard ......<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

First of all, by taking refuge in the Three Treasures - Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, learn about the dharma teachings and practise it. Everyone can become Buddha, and will become Buddha, because our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete. We just need to realise it, practise the Bodhisattva ways, and eventually we will attain Buddhahood for sure.<br><br>2. It is not that everything is illusions, such a view may be a little extreme. But rather, everything is LIKE an illusion. There's a difference. Why? Because the Self is an illusion (see <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333</a>), Permanence is an illusion (no two moments are the same!). All existence is conditioned - they do not have inherent existence and therefore they are empty. Time is also an illusion, the past has gone ['past' is PRESENT MEMORIES], the future has yet to come [just a PRESENT expectation], and the present is ungraspable - the moment you try to grasp on it, it's gone. When we conceptualise and make mental constructs of 'things' and treat it as real, we lost the essence. So it is not that the world is an illusion - it is US that are illusioned.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All conditioned dharmas [phenomena]<br>are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows,<br>like dew drops and a lightning flash:<br>contemplate them thus.<br><br>- Diamond Sutra</span><br><br>3. Buddha is not a god, although while he was still in Samsara (the world of sufferings; the six realms of existences), he has been reborned as gods for uncountable times. Just right before he was borned in India, he was a teacher of the celestial beings in Tushita heaven. When he was borned on Earth, Maitreya Bodhisattva took over his place in Tushita heaven. Maitreya Buddha will be the next Buddha to appear on Earth. In Buddhism rebirth in Heaven is not ultimate because even celestial beings will have to pass away - and possibly be reborned in lower realms according to their karma. Only Nirvana is permanent - and to attain Nirvana a person must become Liberated from Samsara. He was here on Earth because he saw that the conditions for him to teach the sentient beings on Earth was ripe, and many people will attain enlightenment under his guide. Another reason is because the Earth realm is the best place to practise - it's even better than the celestial realms because the celestial realms are too joyful and therefore the celestial beings are not concerned with sufferings or have any wish to be liberated from Samsara. Enjoyment has served as a distraction from spiritual development and liberation. Shakyamuni Buddha after passing away is still teaching within the 'three thousand world systems' in our universe until Maitreya Buddha takes over in the future.<br><br>4. I don't know how many sutras, but there are really a lot. Someone posted in the past and made a point that the length of all sutras is 11 times the Christian bible. This is because Buddha spent 49 years after his Enlightenment expounding the dharma throughout India. All Sutras are spoken words of the Buddha, and recited by 500 of his enlightened disciples after Buddha's passing. Most of the sutras were remembered by Ananda, who was blessed with photographic memory. You can in fact find many sutras in English online. You can also find them in dharma centres and monasteries <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Every person in this world has a plan in place. If the planning of being a buddha is appropriate, you would become one.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Definitely. Each and every sentient being is a Buddha. Just that we have not actually realise about it. Follow the lawful ways of all Buddhas and their teachings, we will be like them - AWAKENED.<br><br>2. Nothing is actually real because nothing is static, even for our physical body. When our mind is at work (out thoughts), everything else vibrate with  frequencies. We are actually what we think about, because our thoughts vibrate into the interspaces of the universe, attracting energies of the same frequency - The law of attraction. Simply, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. We make our world. We are in a dream, because the world is manifested from our thoughts and they are not real.<br><br>3. Buddha is not GOD. He did not die. He is not in a specific place because he is in a state where there is<br>1. NO Here and There - No notion of a existence of a place or distance<br>2. NO big and small - No notion of a size<br>3. NO past, now and future - No notion of time<br>We are living a world where both opposite plolarity strike together (Xiang-Dui). But in a nirvana state it is null or empty, so there is not a place or boundary. Unlike God, he still has a boundary location, which is heaven.<br><br>The only reason for Buddhas to be here because all Buddhas had vowed to help sentinent beings to be liberated from cycle of sufferings. There are immeasurable worlds and galaxies. Buddha can only help those with affinity.<br><br>4. Buddha's 500 great students (with Ananda perfect memory) recorded what Buddha have said during His 49 years of teaching. These 500 students were already enlightened.<br><br>Hope this help.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SocialOutcast:</div><div class="quote_body">Few questions to answer:<br><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, without our sense organs, we will not be able to 'feel' the world. Actually the nature of our experiences are as such:<br><br>It is made up of the 18 Dhatus, consisting of the Six Roots (Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind), Six Dust (Sight, Sound, Odour, Taste, Touch, Mental Object), Six Consciousness (eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness). (see also: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333</a>)<br><br>In Buddhism, through practise these 18 dhatus are experienced just-as-it-is, with no 7th consciousness (ego/self). Without labeling, without thoughts, the six consciousness is experienced in its nakedness without mental formation. This is also known as 'liu4-gen1-qing1-jing4'.<br><br>It is the 'I' and the resulting conceptuality, mental formation, grasping, that is illusional.</div>

Actually it is ok to read many sutras, but having too much knowledge but your practise is not up to that level of understanding will not be good. Therefore my master recommends 'xing2 jie3 xiang1 ying4'. But if your practise is Pure Land, then of course you should focus on the Pure Land sutras. Depending on your practise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> My Master himself's personal reading focus is on the Prajnaparamita sutras as it was recommended to him by his Master Dong Chu.</div>
