There is no decrease and no increase. .......no end of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no origin of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment.  </blockquote>it is not because there's no everything, but because, there's no dual entities. 2 polar co-exists. understood this, all are put down, content and free from suffering of attachment.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

If there is really one, I am happy. If there isn't really one, I am happy too.<br><br>Personally, I find analysing and discovering of the teachings of Buddha spectacular, very much well articulated and blends well with science. Even Einstein said something really marvelous about Buddhism. The beautiful thing, or maybe the essence in Buddhism is really about it's wisdom. Wu2 Xing2 but real enough to convince me.<br><br>Buddhism has been in existence for 2500 years (unofficial record claimed 3000 years). If there is anything wrong with it's teaching, I do not think it can sustain and grow till today. Hinduism which has a history of 5000 years. Both these traditions believe in Karma, although not completely the same (I think). Karma is an integral part of Eastern values and in the chinese language. Example "Shi Ye" - Career. Shi - task, Ye - Karma(actions).<br><br>Buddhism is never a forceful spiritual tradition. If someone wants to embrace it, we rejoice. If someone do not believe it, it is perfectly ok.<br><br>Because the answer we are all seeking is actually inside us, not from the outside.<br><br>Amituofo.<br><br></div>

He taught the Impermanence nature of all <strong>conditioned</strong> phenomena. He taught everyone to let go of attachments because of the impermanent and ungraspable nature. Impermanence is one of the 3 Dharma Seals. There is nothing abstract about the truths that the Buddha taught. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Buddha has three bodies. Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya. When Buddha appears in Nirmanakaya (his physical form with 32 major marks and 80 minor marks) it is appeared to us as a temporary form. But the Dharmakaya is unconditional and eternal. We all have the same unconditional Buddha Nature although we have not realised it and are therefore still illusional.<br><br>Nirvana is Unconditional - therefore beyond anything that can be defined in time and space. In order to 'enter' Nirvana all attachments and illusions on the Conditional must be let go of. 'Desire to be enlightened' is also a desire, but a necessary first step. Gradually as one practises he will also let go of such thoughts <strong>and simply remain in Naturalness - what you already are from the very 'beginning'.</strong> It is not forming a new perception, because all perceptions are still rooted in ignorance. Enlightenment is simply direct seeing without the layer of illusions that most of us still have... not learning something 'new'.<br><br>Also, what did the Buddha not answer? He actually already described the formation and cessation of the world system <strong>without a creator</strong>. He just did not explain in terms of Creator, that doesn't mean he kept quiet.</div>

There are also some forummers who recalled their past lives. My ex forum moderator Namelessness have recalled many past lives - being king of India once, or even in animal realms. Longchen was a European in previous lifetime and participated in world war. Even in this life he had phobia of war/violence and had to do some 'healing'. Two lifetimes ago he was a Tibetan monk in Tibet. And memories of past lives are not vague - in fact with the same clarity or even more than we normally have. Just like you wouldn't think 'I think my trip to China yesterday was a dream, probably not real', when you recalled your past life it would be beyond doubt. My dharma teachers and buddhist master were all from Kyoto, Japan in previous life. The Japanese monks of the monastery (who were already very old) visited them in Taiwan - and even invited him back to Japan to teach.. which my dharma teacher refused. They also brought one of the photos of him and it looked a like. There are some others close to me and have remembered past lives that I have not mentioned here. But ordinary people do not have enough Samadhi... the mind keeps wandering and therefore is unable to have any powers to recall.</div>

The emphasize is on the practise. The teachings of Buddha are all practical in life, therefore we must cultivate the dharma... and our lives will be blissful.<br><br>There is no need to believe in all of its teachings - but things will become clearer to you eventually. A few days back I was chatting with Thusness (who is a highly enlightened person) - all his 'faith' is through his experiences, which maggot has said previously, Yin4 Zhen4 fo fa... (buddhadharma) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> When practise reaps results, as your insights deepen, doubts will clear, there will be confidence. Then it will no longer be a matter of 'faith' anymore because you will realise the 'more real than real'. There will be no doubts about that.<br><br>But first of all one must keep an open mind, listen to the teachings of Buddha, and cultivate. Cultivation is for everyone.<br><br>But for a beginner, faith in the Triple Gems is still necessary... if one does not have faith in Triple Gems to lead one to enlightenment, then he couldn't even have a start.</div>
