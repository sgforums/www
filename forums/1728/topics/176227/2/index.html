No need to worship anyone. Most important thing is that you live your life blissfully, liberated, and attain wisdom - by practising the dharma in your life.<br><br>As you can see above, there are three fields of Heaven - the Sensual field, the Form field, and the Formless field. Nobody in the world up to the 4th Jhana heaven, including gods, or even the Maha Brahma ("God") is not physically bounded. And even the 5th Jhana to 8th Jhana heaven, although the Brahmas have surpassed the realm of 'form', into 'formlessness', the Brahmas will have to suffer impermanence. Even after lets say.. billions of years, according to which plane he is residing in, he will eventually be reborn although he is not aware of it. But the Buddha is fully aware - fully omniscient. He was even aware and stated the lifespan of each celestial realm - ranging up to many many billions of years.<br><br>And there does 'God' reside? Actually, it was the Maha Brahma residing in the 1st Jhana plane, who propogated the view that he was the Creator. He was deluded into thinking that he created the world, and lives eternally. Neither was he aware that there were higher celestial planes above him. Even the celestial beings worship him as the al-mighty Creator. Please see the article <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185" rel="nofollow">How the Brahma believed He was God?</a>. It was only after the Buddha talked to him did the Maha Brahma realised his mistakes.<br><br>Only when you attain NIRVANA - will you be freed from samsara (where the six realms of transmigration exists), from impermanence, from sufferings, forever. Nirvana is the highest bliss of clarity. It is beyond time and space. Nothing that the mind can ever perceive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Then why did Buddha appeared on Earth? Just for the sake of saving sentient beings like us out of great compassion. I believe this has been elaborated in previous posts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by _wanderer_:<br><br>Some people may have already replied you... but I haven't got time to finish reading all their posts.<br><br>Indeed the Buddha is not a God. However, the Buddha is the <strong>teacher of gods and men</strong>. He has perfected wisdom and compassion (methods) and is able to help himself and others to attain Nirvana - a state of Enlightenment that is beyond the <strong>pain of dualism</strong>.<br><br>What is dualism? It is the fixated concepts of good/bad, high/low; it is fixation, rigidity, grasping, attachment.<br><br>"Heaven is good/desirable and hell is bad/scary." These are dualistic notions, which the Buddha has seen their nature as impermanent, dissatisfactory and painful. Whether one is born in heaven, hell or any other realm, one's existence ensures that one will experience the dukkha of birth, old age, sickness, death and so forth.<br><br>Gods are not of higher rank than the Buddha and cannot be, for Gods, like us, are tied by the ignorance of dualism. They are still happy about existence, about getting what they want, and scared about death, angry/unhappy when they don't get what they want. They are swayed by changing conditions and hence are not free. [P/S: Look at how the Christian God describes himself to be a Jealous God; and the stories of how local Chinese deities get angry over their devotees...]<br><br>The Buddha, on the other hand, is beyond dualism, beyond birth and death, beyond the 6 realms of rebirth, beyond happiness/sadness, beyond good/bad. Thus, attaining Buddhahood is the ultimate liberation and is beyond comparison. </blockquote></div>

Meditation comes handy in a way that when you are in ding4 state, you can chant 1 thousand or even 10 thousands times in a second, this will greatly improve the effectiveness of your chanting.<br><br>There are really many sutras you can find.

The Buddha and us are teacher-to-student relationship. There is no need at all to worship any gods... or 'God'.<br><br>And perhaps, I have not made it clear or you have mistaken what I meant, Buddhism does not believe in a Creator. There is no such thing as an almighty 'God' that created the entire universe, and such speculations are also of no use in our spiritual development. It is the Maha Brahma who propogated the view that he was the al-mighty creator due to his delusion. And yes, he was not omniscient even though he claimed to be. Only the Buddha had attained omniscience. I will post more on the Maha Brahma in the next post.<br><br>As for 'Teacher of men and gods', it means that the Buddha is the teacher of both humanity and the celestial realms.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><br>In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of All".<br><br>In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha did not suscribed to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has took refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborned. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were to be reborned.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: " I am BrahmÃ , the Great BrahmÃ , the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so ? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.</span><br><br>from <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br>When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><a href="http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahindarama.com/e-library/whybuddhism2.html</a><br><br>"To those who talked about the first cause of this world, the Buddha responded by saying that it is impossible to find a first cause since everything is changing, interdependent and conditioned by other things. Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency."<br><br>However, Buddhism is largely Agnostic rather than Atheist. We believe that speculations on creation does not help in our spiritual practise, enlightenment, and liberation from samsara.<br><br>"Malunkhyaputta Sutta stresses that whether the universe was created or uncreated, finite or infinite, is irrelevant to our main spiritual concerns: the cause and cessation of suffering:<br><br>"Therefore Malunkhyaputta, bear the undeclared as undeclared. Malunkhyaputta, what are the not declared? The world is eternal, is not declared by me. The world is not eternal, is not declared by me. They are not essential for the principles of the holy life, they do not lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, what are the declared by me? This, is unpleasant, is declared. This, is its arising, is delcared. This, is its cessation is declared. This is the path to its cessation, is declared. Malunkhyaputta, why are these declared by me?

It has been said that one cannot find living beings at the becoming of the universe for the essential reason that causes have no beginning. If there were a beginning to the universe, there would also have to be a beginning to consciousness. If we accepted a beginning to consciousness, we would also have to accept that its cause has a beginning, a sudden cause which would have instantly produced consciousness; this would lead to a great many other questions. If consciousness had arisen without cause, or from a permanent cause, that cause would have to exist on. a permanent basis, always, or not exist at all, ever. The fact that a phenomenon exists intermittently proves that it depends on causes and conditions. When all the conditions are met, the phenomenon is produced. When those conditions are absent or incomplete, the phenomenon does not appear. As causes have no beginning and stretch back to infinity, the same thing must apply for living beings. Creation is therefore not possible.</span> (continued in the webpage)</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha's refutation of the God-concept was formulated some 2500 years ago, perhaps at the very time that the idea of a single supreme God was mooted in India and in the Middle East. With the rise of modern science, and the discovery of natural causes for phenomena, which were formerly ascribed to the action of God, some philosophers have restated the basic fallacies of the God-hypothesis using modern science and logic (and not the Buddha's Dhamma) as their point of departure. Yet many people in the world formally subscribe to the notion of God. What is the Buddhist explanation for this phenomenon?<br><br>There are many causes for the persistence of the God-idea. Some of these are induced by social and other factors. These include the institutionalization of theistic religion, the use of vast economic resources to propagate it including the mass media, and the legal right given to parents to impose their religions on their children. There is also the attractiveness of vicarious salvation, or salvation through prayer or forgiveness which permits the committing of many moral crimes for which the doer does not "pay". We shall not consider these here. From the Buddhist point of view the root causes are ignorance and fear, with fear itself ultimately the product of ignorance. Atheistic materialism has failed to dislodge the God-idea not because of any deficiency of its arguments when compared to those put forward by the theists, but because it too has not been able to eliminate ignorance.<br><br>The ignorance (avijjÃ¢) that is meant here cannot be eliminated by formal education and the propagation of scientific knowledge. After all some leading scientists are themselves completely deluded by theistic suppositions. The progress of science has resulted only in a minor diminution in the power of theistic religion, and in any case theologians have become adept at "reinterpreting" dogma while the general followers continue to do what they have always done.<br><br>The Buddha himself grasped the over-pervading nature of ignorance because of his titanic struggle to liberate himself. He even initially displayed some reluctance to propagate his knowledge because of the formidable nature of the task. Nonetheless he proclaimed his knowledge out of compassion for the world because he felt that at least a few "with little dust in their eyes" would be able to benefit fully from his ideas. From the Buddhist point of view the persistence of theism, with all its evil consequences seen in history, is a necessary consequence of the persistence of ignorance.<br><br>While intellectual and scientific knowledge is not the sole (or even essential) constituent of wisdom it could in the modern world with high levels of educational attainment be a good basis for it. But what is really required is the cultivation of the mind (bhÃ¢vanÃ¢, samÃ¢dhi). This is usually referred to as "meditation" even though this term is quite inadequate to convey the full implications of what is meant. Many modern-day "meditation teachers" do not give instruction in Buddhist mental culture, and even some of those who claim to do so may take a literal view of a few classic Buddhist texts on the subject. The Buddhist path requires a correct balance between three components: wisdom, morality and mental culture. Progress in all these three areas must be made simultaneously, and exclusive concentration on any one these, especially "meditation" of a highly stylized form, is not the balanced path. The Buddha has asked all his disciples to go to the Dhamma as their guide rather than to specific teachers. The Buddha's final instruction to his followers was to "work out your own salvation with diligence" with the Buddha's teaching (the Dhamma) as the only guide.<br><br>The path of the Buddha cannot be followed if a person is deluded by the notion of God. This is why a correct understanding of all the ramifications of the God-idea is essential for anyone seeking to progress along the Buddhist path to total liberation.<br><br>In Buddhism, there is not, as in most other religions, an Almighty God to be<br>obeyed and feared. The Buddha does not believe in a cosmic potentate,<br>omniscient and omni-present. In Buddhism there are no divine revelations or<br>divine messengers. A Buddhist is, therefore, not subservient to any higher<br>supernatural power which controls his destinies and which arbitrarily<br>rewards and punishes. Since Buddhists do not believe in revelations of a<br>divine being, Buddhism does not claim the monopoly of truth and does not<br>condemn any other religion. But Buddhism recognises the infinite latent<br>possibilities of man and teaches that man can gain deliverance from<br>suffering by his own efforts independent of divine help or mediating priests.<br><br>Buddhism cannot, therefore, strictly be called a religion because it is<br>neither a system of faith and worship, nor "the outward act or form by which<br>men indicate their recognition of the existence of a God or gods having<br>power over their own destiny to whom obedience, service, and honour are due."</div>

This is what the HHDL is trying to point out.. which I agree. In Buddhism, speculations about whether the world is Created, or there was a Creator, is not necessary or important in our spiritual development towards our inner enlightenment.<br><br>Buddha has himself enlightened to the truth of liberation - not liberation as in being reborn in somewhere very enjoyable in the next life, like the heavens, but liberated from all vexations, afflictions, sufferings, illusion, right here in this world. Right here we can experience the Highest Bliss. Once enlightened there is without a single doubt left because he has seen the nature of reality. This is what the Buddha taught. Liberation of Samsara/Dukkha is the aim, not necessarily seeking something far away - only to be temporarily sheltered from sufferings but is not a worthy source of refuge because it is not beyond Conditioned Phenomena and Impermanence.<br><br>No other religions teach liberation and the purification of the mind. Remember the mind is source of all these troubles and if we want to treat the problems - if we want to get rid of the impurities in the world, the only way is to purify the human's mind. When the mind is purified, the entire world will be purified, thus a Pure Land on this very Earth will be found.<br><br>BTW neutral_onliner, have I talked to you before? Are you from IRC?
