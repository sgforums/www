                  sentient life. Human beings, while not blessed with divine authority over other
                  living creatures, are uniquely equipped to attain enlightenment and achieve the
                  fullest sense of happiness and freedom for themselves and others. Yet there
                  exist crimes of such gross magnitude that they seem to call our very sense of
                  decency into question. We are forced to confront how deeds of “inhumanity” are
                  often all too human, things that only human beings are capable of. We seek
                  justice as a natural response to these crimes. But these events, dark as they
                  are, challenge us to reflect on how we can apply right intention to the
                  application of justice itself.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Take the case of a recently smashed pedophile ring,
                  whose seven convicted members hid their criminality behind respectable careers
                  and families across Britain. The details of the crimes are too vile and
                  repugnant to share here. Suffice to say that Graham Gardner, deputy director of
                  investigations at the National Crime Agency, told the press: “This is serious
                  organized crime at its worst. . . . The depravity of these men . . . is without
                  doubt as vile as we have seen.” In a similar vein, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh
                  wrote a poem called </span><em style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Please Call Me by My True Names</em><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;"> in response to the
                  letter of a 12-year-old girl who was raped at sea by a pirate and subsequently
                  drowned herself. He famously commented how although we would immediately
                  sympathize with the girl, we would naturally despise the pirate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Pedophiles and rapists are surely people that have at
                  some point elicited our deep, primal urge for retributive justice. In many
                  countries, crimes of such severity, alongside murder, could warrant the
                  ultimate manifestation of retributive justice: the taking of the criminal’s life.
                  There are immensely complex socio-political and cultural reasons why many
                  countries, some of them dominated by the Buddhist religion, retain the death
                  penalty. It is also true that a single ideology, theory, or philosophy cannot
                  resolve the diverse conditions that sustain the death penalty as the law of the
                  land in many regions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">But the content of Buddhism is not simply a
                  philosophy, a body of theories, or even a complex psychological and ethical
                  system. It is the transmitted embodiment of the Buddha’s message and of the
                  Buddha himself. There are no secular systems, even those of the mighty state,
                  that can compromise, co-opt, or invert the message of interconnectedness,
                  wisdom, and compassion that the Buddha revealed in his sacred texts (of all
                  traditions—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana). These insights allow his
                  disciples some understanding as to why Buddhism would oppose the death penalty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Buddhist exegetes, activists, and philosophers have
                  come a long way in addressing modern concerns like human rights, social and
                  economic justice, and theories driving international debate about human
                  societies. Indonesia’s execution of eight of the “Bali Nine” (a troupe of
                  outbound heroin smugglers arrested in 2005) on 29 April and the furious debate
                  about rehabilitation, drugs, and leniency that is taking place in Australia
                  provide further reasons to urgently reflect on Buddhist theories of criminal
                  justice. When we consider the “dichotomy” between retributive and restorative
                  justice, we find why the Buddhadharma is, at least doctrinally, uncomfortable
                  with a retributive vision of justice when it comes to the death penalty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Retributive justice sees crime as “a violation of the
                  state and is defined by law breaking and guilt” (Zehr 1990, 181). According to
                  this concept, the justice system must determine blame and mete out suffering in
                  a contest between the offender and the state based on a system of rules. It
                  aims to balance the harm done to the victim by inflicting punitive harm on the
                  wrongdoer. This is an “adversarial” concept of relations between perceived
                  entities, such as the individual versus the state or the offender versus the
                  victim. In the most serious of offences, the state cannot suffer the individual
                  to exist and therefore passes on the death sentence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">At the basic doctrinal level, the death penalty
                  creates horrific karma for the unenlightened person administering the lethal
                  injection or operating the electric chair. Only an advanced bodhisattva with
                  clairvoyance can claim to end someone’s life with pure and compassionate
                  intention. Foretelling a would-be murderer’s rampage and slaying him was how
                  the Buddha, in a former life as a ship captain, prevented the deaths of his
                  ship’s crew and prevented that would-be killer’s eons-long torment in hell. Yet
                  this scenario effectively does not exist as we know of few advanced
                  bodhisattvas in the world. The act of killing also deprives the offender of the
                  chance the Buddha once gave the mass-murderer Angulimala: to make the most of
                  his remaining life as a repentant disciple of peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Retributive justice emphasizes individual
                  responsibility. Buddhism certainly agrees that moral determinism is false and
                  fatal. However, retributive justice does not take into account the innumerable
                  karmic conditions, often from distant past lives that have played a part in
                  conditioning a person’s unskillful and destructive actions in their present
                  life. In </span><em style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">Please Call Me by My True Names</em><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">, Thich Nhat Hanh explored how a
                  crime cannot be isolated from its wider context of alienation, hardship,
                  violence, and unskillful thoughts. Samsara is a state of suffering. Thus wrote
                  the Zen master: “I am the mayfly metamorphosing on the surface of the river,
                  and I am the bird which, when spring comes, arrives in time to eat the
                  mayfly. . . . Please call me by my true names, so I can hear all my cries
                  and laughs at once, so I can see that my joy and pain are one.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">In the relatively new concept of restorative justice,
                  crime is framed as a violation of people and relationships. It “creates
                  obligations to make things right. Justice involves the victim, the offender,
                  and the community in a search for solutions which promote repair, reconciliation,
                  and reassurance” (Zehr 1990, 181).Restorative justice focuses not just on the
                  harm done to the offended party, but also on how the offender can transform and
                  be freed from both inner and outer negative influences. It is mindful of how
                  wrongdoers themselves were wounded by childhood abuse, poverty, racism, and
                  other ills, and seeks to “balance the healing of the wounds in the wrongdoer
                  with insistence upon accountability, which is a necessary element in that
                  healing” (King 2005, 238). The offender is not excused from penance. Restorative
                  justice prioritizes healing the harm to the victim, and that means compensation
                  and repentance on the part of the offender. Restorative justice is therefore
                  closely enmeshed with the principles and strategies of victims’ rights
                  movements (King 2005, 239).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.95pt; line-height: 18pt;">This vision of justice ameliorates the prominence of
                  both the self and the adversarial state of the various relationships seen in
                  retributive justice. It is perhaps more in line with the Buddhist teachings of
                  interconnectedness and interrelationship. If Buddhist visions of justice do
                  indeed lean toward restorative preferences, then it becomes clear how the death
                  penalty seems doubly unproductive and immoral.</span></p>

                  Buddhists of all stripes, from Thich Nhat Hanh to Maha Ghosananda, have proved
                  that criminal justice and the death penalty need a comprehensive framework of
                  hermeneutics and exegesis so that a more sophisticated level of thought can be
                  applied to the problem of retribution versus restoration. </span></p>
