              <p>You don’t have to look very far for examples of people holding on to 
              their beliefs in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 
              Thousands still hold to the idea that vaccines cause autism, that all 
              life was created a few thousand years ago, and even that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/15/miracle-mineral-solutions-mms-bleach">drinking industrial bleach is a good idea</a>.
               Look at comment threads across the internet and you’ll inevitably find 
              legions of people who boldly support for these ideas in the face of any 
              rational argument.</p>
              <p>That might be depressing, but it’s not unexpected. In a new study, <a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/gal_david.aspx">David Gal</a> and <a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rucker_derek_d.aspx">Derek Rucker</a> from Northwestern University have found that when people’s confidence in their beliefs is shaken, they become <em>stronger </em>advocates
               for those beliefs. The duo carried out three experiments involving 
              issues such as animal testing, dietary preferences, and loyalty towards 
              Macs over PCs. In each one, they subtly manipulated their subjects’ 
              confidence and found the same thing: when faced with doubt, people shout
               even louder.</p>
              <p>Gal and Rucker were inspired by a classic psychological book called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails">When Prophecy Fails</a></em>.
               In it, Leon Festinger and colleagues infiltrated an American cult whose
               leader, Dorothy Martin, convinced her followers that flying saucers 
              would rescue them from an apocalyptic flood. Many believed her, giving 
              up their livelihoods, possessions and loved ones in anticipation of 
              their alien saviours. When the fated moment came and nothing happened, 
              the group decided that their dedication had spared the Earth from 
              destruction. In a reversal of their earlier distaste for publicity, they
               started to actively proselytise for their beliefs. Far from shattering 
              their faith, the absent UFOs had turned them into zealous evangelists.</p>
              <p>The case study inspired Festinger’s theory of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>”,
               which describes the discomfort that people feel when they try to cope 
              with conflicting ideas. Festinger reasoned that people will go to great 
              lengths to reduce this conflict. Altering one’s beliefs in the face of 
              new evidence is one solution but for Martin’s followers, this was too 
              difficult. Their alternative was to try and muster social support for 
              their ideas. If other people also believed, their internal conflicts 
              would lessen.</p>
              <p>Festinger predicted that when someone’s beliefs are challenged, they 
              would try to raise support for those beliefs with paradoxical 
              enthusiasm. Amazingly enough, during the intervening half-century, this 
              prediction has never been tested in an experiment – that is, until now.</p>
              <p>In their first experiment, Gal and Rucker asked 88 students to write 
              about their views on animal testing for consumer goods, but only half of
               them were allowed to use their preferred hand. This may seem random, 
              but previous studies have shown that people have less confidence in what
               they write with the hand they’re less comfortable with. Indeed, that’s 
              what Gal and Rucker found in their study. When asked later, the 
              volunteers who didn’t use their dominant hand were less confident in 
              their views.</p>
              <p>However, they were also <em>more </em>likely to try and persuade 
              others of those same views. When they were asked to write something to 
              persuade someone else about their opinions, those who felt less 
              confident wrote significantly longer missives. With a sliver of doubt in
               their minds, they spent more effort in their attempts at persuasion.</p>
              <p>Gal and Rucker also found that this extra effort vanished if the 
              volunteers had a chance to affirm their own identity beforehand. If they
               were asked to identify their favourite items (books, cities, songs and 
              so on) before writing about animal testing, the choice of hand had no 
              effect on their advocacy attempts. If they were asked to say what their 
              parents’ favourite things were, the hand effect reappeared.</p>
              <p>In their second experiment with 151 fresh volunteers, Gal and Rucker 
              found the same effect. This time, they influenced the recruits’ degree 
              of confidence by asking half of them to relate memories where they were 
              brimming with certainty, and the other half to describe relate memories 
              where they were plagued with doubt Afterwards, the volunteers said 
              whether they were vegans, vegetarians or meat-eaters, how confident they
               were in their opinions, and how important their choice was to them.</p>
              <p>As expected, those who remembered times of uncertainty were less 
              confident that their food choices were the right ones. And as before, 
              those same doubtful volunteers advocated their beliefs more strongly. 
              When asked to imagine convincing someone else about their diet, the 
              uncertain group wrote significantly longer messages and spent longer 
              composing those messages.</p>
              <p>This experiment – with a different method of manipulating confidence,
               a different issue at stake, and a different measure of evangelical 
              effort – adds weight to the results of the first one. However, the 
              effect only held true among those who felt that their dietary 
              preferences were important to them. This showed (perhaps, more 
              expectedly) that the ties between doubt and advocacy are stronger for 
              beliefs that are people hold more dearly.</p>
              <p>The third experiment found similar results, using a far more trivial issue (well, <em>supposedly </em>more
               trivial). Gal and Rucker worked with 106 students who all thought that 
              Macs were superiors to PCs. Again, the duo successfully manipulated the 
              students’ confidence by asking them to remember a previous incident of 
              certain resolve or uncertain doubt.</p>
              <p>The students had to imagine convincing a PC-user about the merits of 
              an Apple product but this time, half were told that they were talking to
               a Windows-diehard, and the others were faced with a more open-minded 
              partner. As before, the students put more effort into persuading their 
              imaginary partner if their own confidence was weakened, but only if 
              their partner was receptive.</p>
              <p>In all three cases, Gal and Zucker found that doubt turns people into
               stronger advocates. More subtly, their study shows that this effect is 
              stronger if someone’s identity is threatened, if the belief is important
               to them, and if they think that others will listen. It all fits with a 
              pattern of behaviour where people evangelise to strengthen their own 
              faltering beliefs.</p>
              <p>Their study also casts the acts of advocates in a different light. 
              They might be outwardly trying to change the minds of other people but 
              their actions could be equally about bolstering their own beliefs. As 
              Gal and Zucker write:</p>
              <p>“The present research also offers a warning to anyone on the 
              receiving end of an advocacy attempt. Although it is natural to assume 
              that a persistent and enthusiastic advocate of a belief is brimming with
               confidence, the advocacy might in fact signal that the individual is 
              boiling over with doubt.”</p>

              <p>In general, when people are challenged with something that's beyond their comfort zone, they will choose to evade.  And sometimes, you'll be surprised at what our minds can come up with to validate evasion. </p>
              <p>If we're disciplined enough, regular meditation will help us realize how we came to own the personas we project, how we came to "own" our current set of neuroses, and what lies behind our reactions to events.</p>
