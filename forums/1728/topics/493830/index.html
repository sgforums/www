              Her Experience of 12 Years Spent in Mountain Retreat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tara
              Choying Lhamo, an Austrian Buddhist who has been living in retreat for more
              than 20 years—12 of which were spend in Milarepa’s caves in Lapchi, Nepal—is
              now sharing her unique experience and insights with audiences in Australia and
              New Zealand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Otago Daily Times reports that Lhamo is now in New Zealand, following a 10-day
              tour of Australia. Last year, Lahmo shared her meditation experiences for the
              first time with an audience in London. Those who heard her story, were deelply
              moved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lahmo
              is a student of His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche and Garchen Rinpoche—both
              masters of the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Having grown up in a
              Christian family, she abandoned her life, friends, and photography job to
              devote herself to meditation after hearing a Buddhist master explain: “[F]or the
              benefit of all beings, we want to attain enlightenment.” (Medianet)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              first eight years, she spent in a monastic community with her teacher in Nepal,
              after which she went on retreat in the high mountain caves of Nepal. These
              caves are so remote that it takes a six-day journey to reach civilization. She
              mentioned that</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">retreats are not
              considered a selfish pursuit in the Buddhist tradition. Instead it is a pursuit
              of a deeply “spiritual practice to get deeper into your consciousness,” which
              is “beautiful.” (Otago Daily Times)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Spending
              all those years in retreat might seem like a terrifying prospect to some,
              however Lahmo explained that it was manageable by viewing her negative thoughts
              as something to contemplate and not as something bad, following the principles
              of mindfulness. During the retreat she was able to “slowly dismantle feelings
              of jealousy, ego-clinging, attachment, and pride as the ‘habitual patterns’ and
              pressure of life disappeared.” (Otago Daily Times)</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Charles
              Potter, director of The Contemplary, a non-profit organization that promotes
              the practice of meditation and will host one of Lahmo’s talks in Australia,
              described her experience as a remarkable opportunity to understand the
              operation of the mind and its habitual patterns, in addition to showing us how
              to cultivate its deepest potential.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“It
              is rare to find someone who has left society for such an extended period to
              really explore contemplative practices that transform the mind,” Potter added.
              “The return of a contemplative from the wilderness is an important opportunity
              to refresh our understanding about how to live, what is truly important, and
              how we might unlock the mind to enhance our society.” (Medianet)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Most
              of the problems faced by modern humanity stem from our drive to pursue
              happiness purely through material fulfilment, and a failure to cultivate inner
              qualities that are a source of lasting contentment and well-being. However, we
              are seeing a new science of virtue arising as researchers in new fields
              rediscover the links between generosity, patience, gratitude and kindness with
              happiness and better ways of engaging in the world. . . .</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Not all of them involve sitting in a cave for
              12 years.” (Medianet)</span></p>
