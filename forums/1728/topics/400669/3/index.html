              <p>More good quotes by Ken:</p>
              <p><strong>I began my previous Beliefnet column with the line, "Throughout history, religion has been the single greatest source of human-caused wars, suffering, and misery. In the name of God, more suffering has been inflicted than by any other manmade cause." I was, of course, using the word "religion" in its sociological meaning, as any belief invested with "ultimate concern," in which case not only Islam, Christianity, and Shintoism are religions, but Marxism, Nazism, and Eco-terrorism are all versions of religions or religiously held beliefs. Seen as such, the opening sentence is obviously true.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>..........</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If humanity is ever to cease its swarming hostilities and be united in one family, without squashing the significant and important differences among us, then something like an integral approach seems the only way.</strong></p>

They should be studied and practiced with all seriousness and fervor, like someone digging a well that perseveres until they actually find water.

That experience is always fresh, and it is ceaselessly renewed. It also brings along with it no shortage of obstacles and happenings of all sorts. It is not at all a matter of using ready-made formulae but of experiencing the teachings in the present moment, knowing how to use life’s good and bad circumstances, dealing with all the thoughts of all kinds that arise in the mind, and understanding for oneself the chain reactions they cause and how to set oneself free from the process. True spiritual discovery is to know how to use every instant in life for the goal one’s set oneself.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For relationships with others not to be mainly motivated by selfishness, which only creates friction and disagreement, each person has to give meaning to their life and attain a degree of inner development. Every instant of the process of spiritual transformation has to be accompanied by the idea that the qualities one’s trying to develop will help meet others’ needs better.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Perhaps it is along this way that we may present the wisdoms of personal successes and failures absent favor. Perhaps it is along this way that we may offer such experiences to others, not as Buddhists or Christians or Muslims, but as one human being to another. Perhaps it is along this way where we may find that we are one yet not the same, for within the limitless possibilities of perception countless living things have as many different worlds in which they exist. Perhaps it is along this way, where it may be best not to look upon oneself as the wise or good or as the purveyor of truth, but rather to always seek to understand wisdom, goodness and truth so that one may learn to recognize and honor them everywhere, within everyone and everything.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>Spiritual practice is based on experiential exploration and discovery that has to be pushed just as far into the inner world as science pushes its explorations into the outer world. That experience is always fresh, and it is ceaselessly renewed. It also brings along with it no shortage of obstacles and happenings of all sorts. It is not at all a matter of using ready-made formulae but of experiencing the teachings in the present moment, knowing how to use life’s good and bad circumstances, dealing with all the thoughts of all kinds that arise in the mind, and understanding for oneself the chain reactions they cause and how to set oneself free from the process. True spiritual discovery is to know how to use every instant in life for the goal one’s set oneself.</span></span></p>

Every instant of the process of spiritual transformation has to be accompanied by the idea that the qualities one’s trying to develop will help meet others’ needs better.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Perhaps it is along this way that we may present the wisdoms of personal successes and failures absent favor. Perhaps it is along this way that we may offer such experiences to others, not as Buddhists or Christians or Muslims, but as one human being to another. Perhaps it is along this way where we may find that we are one yet not the same, for within the limitless possibilities of perception countless living things have as many different worlds in which they exist. Perhaps it is along this way, where it may be best not to look upon oneself as the wise or good or as the purveyor of truth, but rather to always seek to understand wisdom, goodness and truth so that one may learn to recognize and honor them everywhere, within everyone and everything.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>my friend, you have too much anger in you, resulting in your views being too biased against another religion and fellow human beings who are innocent and kind in nature. Open your heart, grow forgiveness in your heart, forget the past, and go your own path which you feel is best for you that will improve your life, and you'll be a much happier and fulfilled person.</p>

              qualifying and quantifying, garnering and discarding their own
              discoveries, in their own way, in their own time. All such
              affinities along all such spiritual paths should be undertaken
              freely, absent deliberate repudiation. They should be studied and
              practiced with all seriousness and fervor, like someone digging a
              well that perseveres until they actually find water. While keeping
              a tolerant, open and compassionate mind, it is important that
              people dedicate themselves to the path they have chosen, as it
              would be pointless for someone to half-finish a dozen wells without

              practice is based on experiential exploration and discovery that
              has to be pushed just as far into the inner world as science pushes
              its explorations into the outer world. That experience is always
              fresh, and it is ceaselessly renewed. It also brings along with it
              no shortage of obstacles and happenings of all sorts. It is not at
              all a matter of using ready-made formulae but of experiencing the
              teachings in the present moment, knowing how to use life’s good and
              bad circumstances, dealing with all the thoughts of all kinds that
              arise in the mind, and understanding for oneself the chain
              reactions they cause and how to set oneself free from the process.
              True spiritual discovery is to know how to use every instant in
              life for the goal one’s set oneself.</span></span></p>

              disagreement, each person has to give meaning to their life and
              attain a degree of inner development. Every instant of the process
              of spiritual transformation has to be accompanied by the idea that

              but as one human being to another. Perhaps it is along this way
              where we may find that we are one yet not the same, for within the
              limitless possibilities of perception countless living things have
              as many different worlds in which they exist. Perhaps it is along
              this way, where it may be best not to look upon oneself as the wise
              or good or as the purveyor of truth, but rather to always seek to
              understand wisdom, goodness and truth so that one may learn to
              recognize and honor them everywhere, within everyone and
              everything.</span></span></p>

              <p>Hi Cck</p>
              <p>I empathy with your experience. However, I think it will be good that you share the experience without naming the CHURCH. As this is not a church bashing forum <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>As an ex Christian, I also went through some the similar cicrumstances as you do. However, I do not  blame the church rather I am thankful to them for leading me to Buddhist path. Beside I have better understanding about the bible, and the church practice .</p>
              <p>We need to respect Jesus just like the way we respect Buddha. After all, isn't him  a Bodhisattva.</p>

              <p>Actually there is a place to criticize churches or any religious place that are teaching something that ought to be examined.</p>
              <p>For example, I am glad that spotlight has gone to Pastor Rony and the stuff he taught has been revealed to the public. Without it he would have continued with his old ways and giving misleading information about what Buddhism is about.</p>
              <p>I think it should not be limited to Pastor Rony - as Cck689461 have already criticized a certain church based on his/her own experience to bring such issues to light.</p>
              <p>I think this is a good step - it is a good use of the internet/information age, whatever taught should be revealed to public and open to scrutiny. In the same way that books in Amazon.com have a section to allow readers to post their reviews, comments, and ratings. I hope the same can be done to Spirituality and Religion so that people can read carefully and decide for themselves.</p>
              <p>Not just Christians, but any religions, even Buddhist. If a Buddhist monastery taught something that is not agreeable, it should also be open to scrutiny. And if you find something good about that monastery/church/temple/etc, you can also post good reviews about it to inform others about their merits. Just like Amazon.com.</p>
              <p>If a cult teaches people to commit suicide, or do evil things - that should also be open to scrutiny, and the authority should investigate into that matter (this is a more extreme example).</p>
              <p>However I think it is best to post this in a Christian forum, or at least not in a Buddhist forum since it is not related to Buddhism. Like if this is a review of a Christian church based on your experience - it is more appropriate to post it in a Christian forum. If this is a review of a Buddhist monastery or dharma center, then no problem in posting it here since it is the right venue. We should not just shut off these people from speaking the truth. Provided that we are all speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>It is important not to follow everything blindly - even if it is taught in your church, temple, or whatever - the Buddha clearly taught us to examine the teachings, and not just follow by authority.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Now I got a full picture of why the christian community or bishop did not come out to condemn Rony Tan. it was in the bible that only god can judge, not you or anyone. they feel that whatever wrong he has done, god will deal with him when he die. that explains partly why the bishop kept quiet. The other is that they still held the beliefs that other faiths were false and satanic. I dun think Rony is truly repentent. he is sorry that his condemnation of the other faiths were blown out of proportion in the media and outcry in public, but he is not sorry for the views he still hold. This is just one facet of their beliefs system. Religious dogma are really dangerous.</p></div>
