              <p>using wrong tools? well didnt god give u a brain for you to think and analyse? ya using faith when one is sick, but one doesnt see a doctor for treatment, but prayed to god that god will be able to cure one's sickness. brilliant isnt it. there were such people in this world, who relied on faith healing when they were sick. science tell us the so called faith healing is a placebo effect, not some miracle healing after all.</p>

To investigate, verify, and personal experiencing of awareness of.Added benefit  is a certain groundedness,  higher EQ, less unhappy, some faster, some slower. </p>
              <p>Back to the bible, the basis of belief cannot be verified, therefore constitute hearsay. Certain facts herein are just what they are,certain facts, They cannot construed to be the  whole truth, or wisdom. </p>
              <p>One issue I have with monotheism, is that it should be all inclusive, but it is not. The problem is; because is the belief in god is true,there good and right. Not believing in god is there false, bad and wrong.</p>
              <p>In the name of the christian god alone, how many people are victimised in the inquisiton, Harlem witchhunts. Forcible conversion and colonizesation of indigenious peoples of Africa, Americas and Asia. In the name of god justifies anything.  </p>
              <p>If you do not believe or obey god's words, you will destroyed. Destruction mentioned is the bible is usually wholesale obliteration of cities and tribes, done in anger. Now, if god is just a patron deity of a certain tribes or people, it is understandable .</p>
              <p>But god is love, father of all, and just you because you do not believe and obey, you will receive your father wrath and punishment. There may be fathers who would do that with their children, but do you believe is right? Man behaving is flawed, but what about GOD, who is LOVE ? </p>
              <p>Another question, what constitute death? When  you die, the entity known or labelled you no longer exist. There was story of woman asking Buddha to revive her son, in which the Buddha requested the woman to get him a cup of mustard seeds for a family which experience no death. When you die, that's it. So either you die or you do not die. One may recover from a coma, but no one comes back from death. </p>

              <p>after dinner i thought my post might be misunderstood. im directing this question to fellow practitioners, not to challenge any Christian beliefs.</p>
              <p>what is meant is could all that has been written be interpreted wrongly because of the limitations of language and the conceptual mind? if it is possible, then is it even worth thinking about since its back to concepts again.</p>
              <p>add to that, could 2 seemingly different descriptions be just a result of error in translations, limited by languages' capacity to describe the absolute aptly, but in reality are the same in actual experience?</p>
              <p>i have utmost faith in the Buddha's teachings, while at the same time have this feeling that some other religions may also point towards the same direction, though expressed in different ways. Jack Kornfield seems to suggest this in his book After the Ecstacy, the Laundry, where he cited many personal experiences of practitioners of Christianity and other Faiths.</p>
              <p>any comments are welcomed :)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of these things, like compassion, will not be logical to a mind enclosed by ego. It needs to be experienced. The egoic mind can never understand anything beyond its own boundaries, it can never understand or have awareness of the suffering of others. Karma, likewise. But before you experience karma, it is important to have faith in it in Buddhism. Karma and rebirth are two things that must be taken by faith first if one is a Buddhist - even though they can also be experienced by our own practice and many did including those in this forum..</p>

              <p>While we are on the topic...</p>
              <p>I guess many of you will have noticed by now, the depiction of God in the Old Testament and the depiction of God in the New Testament are very different.</p>
              <p>Why? Because the philosophies and religions come from different era, and the human development of consciousness are at different levels. Their understanding of God is likewise different. The Old Testament God is more like a personal God who intervenes with human affairs - and someone you can meet up, have coffee, and discuss matters with. It is also a God with all the human emotions like anger, jealousy, etc. The Old Testament belongs to an era where the 'mythic' level of consciousness is the predominant mode of consciousness.</p>
              <p>Based on the different levels of consciousness... how people interprete and experience God differs.</p>
              <p>A Christian mystic will likewise have a totally different interpretation and experience of God. He will talk about God based on his experience of mystical union. They also talk about transcending self - see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/bernadette-roberts-interview.html">Bernadette Roberts</a>.</p>
              <p>As Ken Wilber puts it:</p>
              <p><strong><em>     Human beings are born and begin their evolution through the 
                  great spiral of consciousness, moving from archaic to magic to mythic to
                   rational to... perhaps integral, and perhaps from there into genuinely 
                  transpersonal domains. </em></strong></p>

              <div class="thumb tright">
              <div class="thumbinner" style="width: 146px;"><a class="image" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/File:Hoag%27s_object.jpg"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Hoag%27s_object.jpg/144px-Hoag%27s_object.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="141"></a>

              </div>
              <ul>
              <li>Human beings undergo psychological development. At each level or stage of development, they will see the world in a different way. Hence, each level of development has, as it were, a different religious belief or worldview. This does not make God or Spirit the result of human development; it does, however, make the ways in which humans conceive of God or Spirit the result of development. And this is where it gets really interesting.  The lower stages are more fundamental and the higher stages are more significant, but leave out any one of them and you're in trouble...      <br></li>
              <li>Put bluntly, there is an archaic God, a magic God, a mythic God, a mental God, and an integral God. Which God do you believe in?       An archaic God sees divinity in any strong instinctual force. A magic God locates divine power in the human ego and its magical capacity to change the animistic world with rituals and spells. A mythic God is located not on this earth but in a heavenly paradise not of this world, entrance to which is gained by living according to the covenants and rules given by this God to his peoples. A mental God is a rational God, a demythologized Ground of Being that underlies all forms of existence. And an integral God is one that embraces all of the above.       Which of those Gods is the most important? According to an integral view, all of them, because each "higher" stage actually builds upon and includes the lower, so the lower stages are more fundamental and the higher stages are more significant, but leave out any one of them and you're in trouble. You are, that is, less than integral, less than comprehensive, less than inclusive in your understanding of God.</li>

              <p>More good quotes by Ken:</p>
              <p><strong>I began my previous Beliefnet column with the line, "Throughout 
              history, religion has been the single greatest source of human-caused 
              wars, suffering, and misery. In the name of God, more suffering has been
               inflicted than by any other manmade cause." I was, of course, using the
               word "religion" in its sociological meaning, as any belief invested 
              with "ultimate concern," in which case not only Islam, Christianity, and
               Shintoism are religions, but Marxism, Nazism, and Eco-terrorism are all
               versions of religions or religiously held beliefs. Seen as such, the 
              opening sentence is obviously true.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>..........</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If humanity is ever to cease its swarming hostilities and be united in 
              one family, without squashing the significant and important differences 
              among us, then something like an integral approach seems the only way.</strong></p>
