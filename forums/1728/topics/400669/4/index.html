              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Actually there is a place to criticize churches or any religious place that are teaching something that ought to be examined.</p>
              <p>For example, I am glad that spotlight has gone to Pastor Rony and the stuff he taught has been revealed to the public. Without it he would have continued with his old ways and giving misleading information about what Buddhism is about.</p>
              <p>I think it should not be limited to Pastor Rony - as Cck689461 have already criticized a certain church based on his/her own experience to bring such issues to light.</p>
              <p>I think this is a good step - it is a good use of the internet/information age, whatever taught should be revealed to public and open to scrutiny. In the same way that books in Amazon.com have a section to allow readers to post their reviews, comments, and ratings. I hope the same can be done to Spirituality and Religion so that people can read carefully and decide for themselves.</p>
              <p>Not just Christians, but any religions, even Buddhist. If a Buddhist monastery taught something that is not agreeable, it should also be open to scrutiny. And if you find something good about that monastery/church/temple/etc, you can also post good reviews about it to inform others about their merits. Just like Amazon.com.</p>
              <p>If a cult teaches people to commit suicide, or do evil things - that should also be open to scrutiny, and the authority should investigate into that matter (this is a more extreme example).</p>
              <p>However I think it is best to post this in a Christian forum, or at least not in a Buddhist forum since it is not related to Buddhism. Like if this is a review of a Christian church based on your experience - it is more appropriate to post it in a Christian forum. If this is a review of a Buddhist monastery or dharma center, then no problem in posting it here since it is the right venue. We should not just shut off these people from speaking the truth. Provided that we are all speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>It is important not to follow everything blindly - even if it is taught in your church, temple, or whatever - the Buddha clearly taught us to examine the teachings, and not just follow by authority.</p>

              <p>Hi, I fully agree with your post.</p>
              <p>However I might add, what I am talking about is constructive criticism.</p>
              <p>Constructive criticism can become a cause for improvement. It can also bring awareness of these issues to others.</p>
              <p>For example, ck posted his/her negative experience with a particular church after going there for a period of time.</p>
              <p>If he/she did not make this known, then others will 'fall victim' or rather go through the same unpleasant experiences.</p>
              <p>Therefore I suggest that people should write reviews, whether they are criticism or commendations of that church/temple/monastery so that people who are interested to go there can be made aware of the choices they have.</p>
              <p>Also, if something they teach is not right or not agreeable it should be open to scrutiny.</p>
              <p>An example is Pastor Rony in Singapore, he was putting down other religions like Buddhism and making false statements about Buddhism. This caused an uproar in the internet and got the attention of the Internal Security Department of Singapore, and after a meeting with him he formally apologised for his misbehavior.</p>
              <p>This is good because otherwise, he will continue to spread false information about Buddhism and create bad karma (from a Buddhist perspective), not to mention sowing discord in our multi racial and religious society.</p>
              <p>Nowadays people use Amazon.com to buy books, electronics, or whatever... there is a comments section and a ratings section which is very useful for potential customers to choose and select their products.</p>
              <p>I don't see why we shouldn't and couldn't do this for institutions of Religion as well.</p>
              <p>Of course, it should be noted that any particular institution does not represent the whole of the religion, and we should not use an institution as an example to denigrate the entire religion.</p>
              <p>In fact I have written in the Christan forum just recently, saying that I see no point in trying to argue against other people's faith. If people already chose their path and their faith, they have already put faith ahead of logic, and therefore no amount of logic will likely move their faith. They may be offended, or they may try to defend their faith, but it is unlikely that any amount of logic is going to change anything. Therefore those non-Christians criticizing Christianity are actually criticizing it to the wrong audience, much like
               the Chinese idiom of playing the lute to a cow. The cow cannot appreciate anything, to the cow it is just more noise.</p>
              <p>If people have not yet chosen their path, or are willing to find out the truth for themselves, they will do so regardless of whether his faith is being criticized.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it is not like the other religions are not improving and transforming the lives of their followers in a positive way, as many find positive changes in their lives through following their religions, so there is no reason to try to convert them</p>
              <p>Since Buddhists don't consider non-believers as 'destined for hell', the compulsion to convert others deep into their own belief isn't strong: instead time is better spent if we focus our efforts to bring 'potential people' to Buddhism, potential as in those who have the interest and conditions to explore and seek to find out the Dharma.</p>
              <p>If the dharma is being made more accessible and well known, people can make a better decision for themselves by comparing the different religions and seeing what is more suitable or agreeable for themselves. This, I believe, is much more constructive than criticising the faith of others.</p>

              <p>If you diligently practice the Noble Eightfold Path, you will eventually attain the First Stage of Enlightenment in the Hinayana path, which is Sotapanna or Stream Entry. Followed by Sakadagami, or Once Returner. Followed by Anagami, or Non Returner. Followed by Arhatship, which is the Fruition of the Hinayana path, the fourth and final stage of Enlightenment in the Hinayana path.</p>
              <p>Means, you have finished your path. Ended is your suffering and future births. No more rebirth. It is like graduation - you have already achieved your Bachelor from the University.</p>
              <p>Mahayana Buddhism considers there is a higher goal: Buddhahood, and that is by practicing the Mahayana/Bodhisattva path. However that is even higher level: sort of like Ph.D in comparison to University level. A Buddha is not only liberated, he is also concerned and highly capable of liberating a lot of others unlike any other enlightened beings, and he perfected all virtues (paramitas) and other qualities like omniscience, etc.</p>
              <p>If you achieve Arhatship, you already achieved the 'Fruition', the goal of the path of Sravakas, you already 'graduated' from your path. Finished.</p>
              <p>If you have not attained enlightenment yet, you cannot claim to be Arhat. Arhatship is a fruition, not the path.</p>
              <p>There are people today (and I personally know some of them) who continue to achieves Arhatship, or Bodhisattvahood. It is totally achievable even for lay persons like us (since I have personally know some of them) to attain Enlightenment. You just need the right teaching, the right teacher, the right practice. You need to have a good grasp what Buddhism is about and how to practice it in your lives.</p>

              <p>If you diligently practice the Noble Eightfold Path, you will eventually attain the First Stage of Enlightenment in the Hinayana path, which is Sotapanna or Stream Entry. Followed by Sakadagami, or Once Returner. Followed by Anagami, or Non Returner. Followed by Arhatship, which is the Fruition of the Hinayana path, the fourth and final stage of Enlightenment in the Hinayana path.</p>
              <p>Means, you have finished your path. Ended is your suffering and future births. No more rebirth. It is like graduation - you have already achieved your Bachelor from the University.</p>
              <p>Mahayana Buddhism considers there is a higher goal: Buddhahood, and that is by practicing the Mahayana/Bodhisattva path. However that is even higher level: sort of like Ph.D in comparison to University level. A Buddha is not only liberated, he is also concerned and highly capable of liberating a lot of others unlike any other enlightened beings, and he perfected all virtues (paramitas) and other qualities like omniscience, etc.</p>
              <p>If you achieve Arhatship, you already achieved the 'Fruition', the goal of the path of Sravakas, you already 'graduated' from your path. Finished.</p>
              <p>If you have not attained enlightenment yet, you cannot claim to be Arhat. Arhatship is a fruition, not the path.</p>
              <p>There are people today (and I personally know some of them) who continue to achieves Arhatship, or Bodhisattvahood. It is totally achievable even for lay persons like us (since I have personally know some of them) to attain Enlightenment. You just need the right teaching, the right teacher, the right practice. You need to have a good grasp what Buddhism is about and how to practice it in your lives.</p>

              <p>You're right. One of those enlightened that I have talked to have told us (those meeting him) that the bliss he is experiencing is not something we can ever understand (unless we experience it of course).</p>
              <p>Arahats have finally untangled the knot of perception, dissolved the 
                  sense of the center point actually being the center point, no longer 
                  fundamentally make a separate Self out of the patterns of sensations 
                  that they used to, even though those same patterns of sensations 
                  continue. This is a different understanding from those of Third Path (Anagami) in 
                  some subtle way, and makes this path about something that is beyond the 
                  paths. This is also poetically called the opening of the Wisdom Eye (in contrast to the Dharma Eye that a Stream Winner has obtained).</p>
              <p>Taking precepts will ensure that you can follow Noble Eightfold Path. If you break the precepts, then how can it be said that you are following Right Action and Right Speech? Although I never formally took precepts, I try to follow follow the precepts as much as possible.</p>

              <p>The Buddha recognized that gambling is a venue that leads to ruin, and warned his lay followers against gambling.</p>
              <p>From this we can see that gambling is an unwholesome act and leads to ruin and downfall, and hence it is best to avoid gambling or having a livelihood related to gambling since it brings harms to oneself and others.</p>

              <p>Buddhists don't believe that a supernatural being brings you to heaven.</p>
              <p>Buddhists believe that we are reborn according to our own karma, which is a natural law. It is not someone up there judging us.</p>
              <p>Also, Buddhists do not believe that non-believers will go to hell. Again as I said, people are reborn according to karma, and this applies whether to believers or non-believers.</p>
              <p>The six potential realm of rebirth are (lower realms) Hell, ghosts, animals, and (higher realm) human, asura, heaven</p>
              <p>Buddhists however aim for liberation from rebirth and suffering, through enlightenment, liberation, Nirvana.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, I fully agree with your post.</p>
              <p>However I might add, what I am talking about is constructive criticism.</p>
              <p>Constructive criticism can become a cause for improvement. It can also bring awareness of these issues to others.</p>
              <p>For example, ck posted his/her negative experience with a particular church after going there for a period of time.</p>
              <p>If he/she did not make this known, then others will 'fall victim' or rather go through the same unpleasant experiences.</p>
              <p>Therefore I suggest that people should write reviews, whether they are criticism or commendations of that church/temple/monastery so that people who are interested to go there can be made aware of the choices they have.</p>
              <p>Also, if something they teach is not right or not agreeable it should be open to scrutiny.</p>
              <p>An example is Pastor Rony in Singapore, he was putting down other religions like Buddhism and making false statements about Buddhism. This caused an uproar in the internet and got the attention of the Internal Security Department of Singapore, and after a meeting with him he formally apologised for his misbehavior.</p>
              <p>This is good because otherwise, he will continue to spread false information about Buddhism and create bad karma (from a Buddhist perspective), not to mention sowing discord in our multi racial and religious society.</p>
              <p>Nowadays people use Amazon.com to buy books, electronics, or whatever... there is a comments section and a ratings section which is very useful for potential customers to choose and select their products.</p>
              <p>I don't see why we shouldn't and couldn't do this for institutions of Religion as well.</p>
              <p>Of course, it should be noted that any particular institution does not represent the whole of the religion, and we should not use an institution as an example to denigrate the entire religion.</p>
              <p>In fact I have written in the Christan forum just recently, saying that I see no point in trying to argue against other people's faith. If people already chose their path and their faith, they have already put faith ahead of logic, and therefore no amount of logic will likely move their faith. They may be offended, or they may try to defend their faith, but it is unlikely that any amount of logic is going to change anything. Therefore those non-Christians criticizing Christianity are actually criticizing it to the wrong audience, much like the Chinese idiom of playing the lute to a cow. The cow cannot appreciate anything, to the cow it is just more noise.</p>
              <p>If people have not yet chosen their path, or are willing to find out the truth for themselves, they will do so regardless of whether his faith is being criticized.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it is not like the other religions are not improving and transforming the lives of their followers in a positive way, as many find positive changes in their lives through following their religions, so there is no reason to try to convert them</p>
              <p>Since Buddhists don't consider non-believers as 'destined for hell', the compulsion to convert others deep into their own belief isn't strong: instead time is better spent if we focus our efforts to bring 'potential people' to Buddhism, potential as in those who have the interest and conditions to explore and seek to find out the Dharma.</p>
              <p>If the dharma is being made more accessible and well known, people can make a better decision for themselves by comparing the different religions and seeing what is more suitable or agreeable for themselves. This, I believe, is much more constructive than criticising the faith of others.</p>

              <p>Please read the links below "The Lost years of Jesus Christ" which claim that there are evidence showing Jesus went to Tibet and India to learn Buddhism. The scholars claim that  is why the 10 commandments of Christianity are similar to the precepts of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Anyway, Sun Wu Kong and the gang is only a  Chinese classical novel written by a famous writer. It is not a true story. The only truth is  monk Xuan Zang who traveled alone to the west (India) to get the scriptures.</p>

              If you find the bible more contemptible, that's fine. That's your own prerogative.
