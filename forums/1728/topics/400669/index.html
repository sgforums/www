              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>I would like to share on my thoughts on christianity and the buddhist philosophy.</p>
              <p>The christians have always believed that their God is the one true God and all other religions are false.</p>
              <p>But I have been contemplating on the bible. What the bible suggests may actually strenghtened the buddhist philosophy of karma.</p>
              <p>the christians believe that jesus was reborn as man to die for the sins of humanity</p>
              <p>however, if God/ Jesus/ Yahweh/jehovah is so powerful, why did he send his son to die? This shows that there is a higher power than God which I believe to be the law of karma</p>
              <p>Buddha taught that karma affects all the 6 realms of existence, including God.</p>
              <p>God was bloodthirsty when he slaughtered all the first born of the Egyptians for the sake of the Jews. perhaps as a karmaic retribution, God has to suffer by letting his firstborn die at the hands of the Jews.</p>
              <p>It all makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
              <p>God is just another sentient being that has to suffer when he does wrong as well</p>
              <p>this shows that buddha is correct all this time</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes Buddha has refuted the concept of god in his  teachings. He even went up to meet the brahma himself, who thinks that he is the creator of the universe and basically everything. you may want to read the excerpts of the Buddha and Brahma.</p>
              <p>AEN do you have that excerpt of the dialogue between the Buddha and Brahma?</p>

              <p>Many people believe in Christianity because it is easier compare with Buddhism. If Christianity is the truth, I will also choose it because I prefer to sit down and pray comfortably than kneeling down. However, to me Christianity is not the truth.</p>
              <p>I always wondered why people said Jesus was not human because he rose to heaven , in the 1st place, why not God send Jesus down from heaven instead of being born as human.</p>
              <p>God sending floods thingy etc. also puts me off. Too many threats which put me off.</p>

              <p>Dear friend,</p>
              <p>thanks for the information. I just had a similar discussion with my friends this morning. I think there is no end if we were to discuss this topic. Its abit sensitive also for an online discussion haha. We should just give a mutual respect to Christianity and hopefully, we received theirs too. Everyone believe in their own religion. Thats a good sign because that is the faith and confidence we have in our own religion. As long the religion makes a person morally upright and it benefit the believer and the people around him.. why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, finding out this kind of 'truth' or trying to convince we are the 'right' or 'better' religion does not reduce our dissatisfactions at all. As long you recognize the 4 noble truth, the 3 universal characteristics and try to practice the noble eightfold path, you will generally be happier. </p>
              <p>May everyone here be well and happy. Happy vesak day. </p>

              <p>abit to add on, a bigger practice is to even be compassionate towards those who act in misguided ways.</p>
              <p>the apparent differences between faiths are all a result of conditional interpretations of the mind.</p>
              <p>while we use the Buddha's teachings to realize liberation, it is also important to integrate through our actions to make our environment a better place.</p>
              <p>one of the skill we call upon to do this is the ability to see beyond differences, be it in culture or religious belief, and encourage everyone to share the goodness. to start off, we have to learn to share the goodness of the Buddha's teachings to people of other faiths without the need to change their religious beliefs. i sometimes use stories but change some details, or not mentioning that the source is Buddhist teachings. in this way, there can be harmony and sharing of goodness.</p>
              <p>Happy Vesak Day!</p>
              <p>May all Beings be well and happy!</p>

              <p>Many people believe in Christianity because it is easier compare with Buddhism. If Christianity is the truth, I will also choose it because I prefer to sit down and pray comfortably than kneeling down. However, to me Christianity is not the truth.</p>
              <p>I always wondered why people said Jesus was not human because he rose to heaven , in the 1st place, why not God send Jesus down from heaven instead of being born as human.</p>
              <p>God sending floods thingy etc. also puts me off. Too many threats which put me off.</p>
