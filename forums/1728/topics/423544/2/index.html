              <p>I picked up a book recently, on Buddhism for Beginners published by PKS monastery. Not bad, quite informative though haven't gone thru it thoroughly.</p>
              <p>I have a book that is quite good. Called "Happiness and Suffering" by Rinchen  Dorjee Rinpoche. It addresses many modern people problems. If you printing for free, i think the author may be willing to allow...  (i have in Chinese Traditional characters as well as English but Chinese is more accurate. English needs more editting...)</p>

              <p>Thanks.I think I  have a book which you mentioned "Buddhism for Beginners". I took one home, thinking of giving it to a friend who is a free thinker but did not do so. Before I can give it to her, she told me she does not like to read books which are very thick. If you and I are talking about the same book, it is quite a thick one, isn't it ?</p>
              <p>The second book seems needs to get approval, kind of troublesome.</p>
              <p>I think VCD is still the best in this modern world. Non Buddhists especially free thinkers are very afraid of boring religious books and talks. The only VCD they are willing to watch is æ…§å¾‹æ³•å¸ˆ.</p>

              <p><br>I've replied you. Kindly check. Just for your information. We have kindly turned down the big sponsor this round, we told him we will call him the next round. Reason being we have collected enough money and if we collect too much and print too many, we are unable to distribute all the books.</p>
              <p>So, this round we decide. We decided to continue to print cause and effect, CD and Guan Shi Yin Pusa stickers for MRT cards or whatever cards. We find it is easier to distribute cause and effect. Hope there will be more people like "Zero Thought" and I who started on Buddhist path with "cause and effect."</p>
              <p>Guys, I will take your suggestions for printing of books the next round.  </p>

              <p>Yeah, me too. The 1st Buddhist book I read was the cause and effect sutra. The sutra had answered many of my questions like why some people are born poor and some are born rich. Why there are inequalities among people.</p>
              <p>The last time I distributed this book. I saw a few of them were so interested ( I assume it was their first time reading the cause and effect sutra), they found a place to sit down and finish reading the whole book on the spot. Very encouraging.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>it's good if you can call him. He is always doing some charity here and there. He has to take so many calls while also working at the same time. If you meet up with him at least once, i am sure you both can work out something.  Not necessary must take all the beads at one go, he can source out for you who need it .</p>
              <p>He has a wider network than me in the buddhist circle.</p>

              <p>for general information, there is a bookshop on the third floor of the Fortune Building/centre at middle road, next to the famous hindu temple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This bookshop is owned by a publication company who has printed so many buddhist books for customers for free distribution that they are overloaded, so what they did is to open a shop and put all these free books in front for anyone to take.</p>
              <p>It's hidden in one corner but you can literally find many sutras, buddhist books in stacks there. The most popular for printing are "cause and effect" karma book,</p>
              <p> sutra of the treasure earth bodhisattva (kitisargarbhva) , amitufo sutra , liang huang treasure  (liang emperor)  repentance sutra.</p>
              <p>They welcome anyone to take these free distribution books from the shop.They are helping customers to clear them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> This shop is either on the third or fourth floor. Beside the shop is a TCM clinic and opposite a vegetarian grocery shop.  Fortune Centre at middle road (beside the hindu temple).</p>
