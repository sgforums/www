              <p>"Monks, these eight causes, these eight requisite conditions lead to 
              the acquiring of the as-yet-unacquired discernment that is basic to the 
              holy life, and to the increase, plenitude, development, &amp; 
              culmination of that which has already been acquired. Which eight?</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a monk lives in apprenticeship to the 
              Teacher or to a respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has 
              established a strong sense of conscience, fear of blame, love, &amp; 
              respect. This, monks, is the first cause, the first requisite condition 
              that leads to the acquiring of the as-yet-unacquired discernment that is
               basic to the holy life, and to the increase, plenitude, development, 
              &amp; culmination of that which has already been acquired.</p>
              <p>"As he lives in apprenticeship under the Teacher or under a 
              respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has established a strong
               sense of conscience, fear of blame, love, &amp; respect, he approaches 
              him at the appropriate times to ask &amp; question him: 'What, venerable
               sir, is the meaning of this statement?' He<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.002.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> reveals what is hidden, makes plain what is obscure, and dispels 
              perplexity in many kinds of perplexing things. This is the second cause,
               the second requisite condition...</p>
              <p>"Having heard the Dhamma, he<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.002.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> achieves a twofold seclusion: seclusion in body &amp; seclusion in 
              mind. This is the third cause, the third requisite condition...</p>
              <p>"He is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the 
              Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior &amp; sphere of activity. He 
              trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in 
              the slightest faults. This is the fourth cause, the fourth requisite 
              condition...</p>
              <p>"He has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what 
              he has heard. Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, 
              admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that — in their meaning 
              &amp; expression — proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete 
              &amp; pure: those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, 
              accumulated, examined with his mind, &amp; well-penetrated in terms of 
              his views. This is the fifth cause, the fifth requisite condition...</p>
              <p>"He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental 
              qualities and for taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, 
              solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful 
              mental qualities. This is the sixth cause, the sixth requisite 
              condition...</p>
              <p>"When he is in the midst of the Sangha he doesn't talk on &amp; on 
              about a variety of things. Either he speaks Dhamma himself or he invites
               another to do so, and he feels no disdain for <a id="silence" name="silence">noble silence</a>.<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag" name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.002.than.html#fn-3">[3]</a> This is the seventh cause, the seventh requisite condition...</p>
              <p>"He remains focused on arising &amp; passing away with regard to the 
              five aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its 
              disappearance. Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are 
              fabrications... Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its 
              disappearance.' This, monks, is the eighth cause, the eighth requisite 
              condition that leads to the acquiring of the as-yet-unacquired 
              discernment that is basic to the holy life, and to the increase, 
              plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of that which has already been
               acquired.</p>
              <p>"When this is the case, his comrades in the holy life hold him in 
              esteem: 'This venerable one lives in apprenticeship to the Teacher or to
               a respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has established a 
              strong sense of conscience, fear of blame, love, &amp; respect. Surely, 
              knowing, he knows; seeing, he sees.' This is a factor leading to 
              endearment, to respect, to development, to consonance, to unification.<a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag" name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.002.than.html#fn-4">[4]</a></p>
              <p>"[They say:] 'As he lives in apprenticeship under the Teacher or 
              under a respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has established a
               strong sense of conscience, fear of blame, love, &amp; respect, he 
              approaches him at the appropriate times to ask &amp; question him: 
              'What, venerable sir, is the meaning of this statement?' He reveals what
               is hidden, makes plain what is obscure, and dispels perplexity in all 
              kinds of perplexing things. Surely, knowing, he knows; seeing, he sees.'
               This is a factor leading to endearment, to respect, to development, to 
              consonance, to unification.</p>
              <p>"[They say:] 'Having heard the Dhamma, he achieves a twofold

              on &amp; on about a variety of things. Either he speaks Dhamma himself 
              or he invites another to do so, and he feels no disdain for noble 
              silence [the second jhana]. Surely, knowing, he knows; seeing, he sees.'
               This, too, is a factor leading to endearment, to respect, to 
              development, to consonance, to unification.</p>

              <p>"These, monks, are the eight causes, the eight requisite conditions

              basic to the holy life, and to the increase, plenitude, development,
