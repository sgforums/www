              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">According to the Buddhist</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> monastic
              code, monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in
              barter or trade with laypeople. They live entirely in an economy of gifts. Lay
              supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics, while the
              monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teaching. Ideally—and
              to a great extent in actual practice—this is an exchange that comes from the
              heart, something totally voluntary. There are many stories in the texts
              emphasizing the point that the returns in this economy depend not on the
              material value of the object given, but on the purity of heart of the donor and
              recipient. You give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means, when
              and wherever your heart feels inspired. For the monastics, this means that you
              teach, out of compassion, what should be taught, regardless of whether it will
              sell. For the laity, this means that you give what you have to spare and feel
              inclined to share. There is no price for the teachings, nor even a “suggested
              donation.” You give because giving is good for the heart and because the
              survival of the dharma as a living principle depends on daily acts of
              generosity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowl. If you are a
              monastic, it represents your dependence on others, your need to accept
              generosity no matter what form it takes. You may not get what you want in the
              bowl, but you realize that you always get enough. Once a student of mine went
              to practice in the mountains in northern Thailand. His hillside shack was an
              ideal place to meditate, but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for
              alms, and the diet was mostly plain rice, occasionally accompanied by some
              boiled vegetables. After two months on this diet, he was in conflict over
              whether or not to stay. One rainy morning, as he was on his alms round, a woman
              called out from a shack asking him to wait while she got some rice from the
              pot. As he waited, he couldn’t help grumbling inwardly about the fact that
              there would be nothing to go with the rice. It so happened that the woman’s
              infant son was sitting near the kitchen fire, crying from hunger. So as she
              scooped some rice out of the pot, she stuck a small lump in his mouth.
              Immediately, the boy stopped crying and began to grin. “Here you are,
              complaining about what these people are giving you for free,” my student told
              himself. “You’re no match for this little kid.” That lesson gave him the
              strength to stay in the mountains for another three years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For a monastic, the bowl also represents the opportunity one gives
              others to practice the dharma. In Thailand, this is reflected in one of the
              idioms used to describe going for alms: <em>proad sat</em>, doing a favor for
              living beings. There were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when, as I
              walked past a tiny grass shack, someone would come running out to put rice in
              my bowl. Years earlier, as layperson, I would have wished to give them some
              material help. Now I was offering them the dignity that comes with being a
              donor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For the donors, the monk’s bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have
              done. On several occasions in Thailand people told me they had dreamed of a
              monk standing before them, opening the lid to his bowl. The details differed as
              to what the dreamer saw in the bowl, but in each case the interpretation of the
              dream was the same: the dreamer’s merit was about to bear fruit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The alms round itself is a gift that goes both ways. Daily contact with
              lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual
              matter. They are indebted to others for the opportunity to practice, and should
              do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debt.
              Furthermore, walking through a village early in the morning, passing by the
              houses of the rich and poor, the happy and unhappy, gives plenty of
              opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out
              of the grinding cycle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For the donors, the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy
              is not the only way to happiness. It helps keep a society sane when there are
              monastics infiltrating the towns every morning, embodying an ethos very
              different from the dominant monetary economy. The gently subversive quality of
              this custom helps people to keep their values straight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Above all, the economy of gifts allows for specialization, a division of
              labor from which both sides benefit. Those who are willing can give up many of
              the privileges of home life in return for the opportunity to devote themselves
              fully to dharma practice. Those who stay at home can benefit from having full-time
              dharma practitioners around on a daily basis. The Buddha began the monastic
              order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that
              come with specialization. Without it, the practice tends to become diluted,
              negotiated into the demands of the monetary economy. The dharma becomes limited
              to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the
              requirements of family and job. In this sort of situation, everyone ends up
              poorer in things of the heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The fact
              that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the
              exchange is open to all sorts of abuses. This is why there are so many rules in
              the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the
              generosity of lay donors. There are rules against asking for donations in
              inappropriate circumstances, against making claims as to one’s spiritual
              attainments, even against covering up any exceptional morsels in one’s bowl
              with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something
              more substantial. Most of the rules, in fact, were instituted at the request of
              lay supporters or in response to their complaints. They had made their
              investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their
              investment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">On their first contact with the sangha, most Westerners tend to see
              little reason for the disciplinary rules; they regard them as quaint holdovers
              from ancient Indian prejudices. When, however, they come to see these rules in
              the context of the economy of gifts, they too become advocates of the rules.
              The arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways, but it
              means that the lay supporters take an active interest in how the monastic
              lives—a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talk. This
              ensures that the practice remains a communal concern. As the Buddha said,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Monks, householders are very helpful to you, as they provide you with
              the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicine. And you, monks, are
              very helpful to householders, as you teach them the dharma admirable in the
              beginning, admirable in the middle, and admirable in the end, as you expound
              the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely complete,
              surpassingly pure. In this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence, for
              the purpose of crossing over the flood, for making a right end to suffering and
              stress.</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">By
              its very nature,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> the economy of gifts is
              something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive
              discernment of its benefits. I find it amazing that such an economy has lasted
              for more than 2,600 years. It will never be more than an alternative to the
              dominant monetary economy, largely because its rewards are so intangible and
              require so much patience, trust, and discipline in order to appreciate them.
              But then, there is no way that the dharma can survive as a living principle
              unless it can be offered and received as a gift, in an atmosphere where mutual
              compassion and concern are the medium of exchange, and purity of heart is the
              bottom line.<br> <br> <strong>Thanissaro Bhikkhu</strong> is the Abbot of Metta Forest Monastery in Valley
