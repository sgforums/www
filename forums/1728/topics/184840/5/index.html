Even though we may be living in dharma ending age, such a stage whereby all sutras disappear has not even come yet. Since the sutras expounded by Shakyamuni Buddha still exists, for example, Lotus Sutra, it is IMPOSSIBLE for maitreya become Buddha now.<br><br>We cannot just 'anyhow anyhow' assume someone we think to be great as Maitreya.

It was he who has set you on the path to deliverance, but before you could finally win it you have had to wait for my teaching. It is because you have worshipped Shakyamuni with parasols, banners, flags, perfumes, garlands, and unguents that you have arrived here to hear my teaching. It is because you have offered to the shrines of Shakyamuni unguents of sandalwood, or powdered saffron, that you have arrived here to hear my teaching. It is because you have always gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, that you have arrived here to hear my teaching. It is because, in Shakyamuni's dispensation, you have undertaken to observe the moral precepts, and have actually done so, that you have arrived here to hear my teaching. It is because you have given gifts to the monks -- robes, drink, food, and many kinds of medicines -- that you have arrived here to hear my teaching. It is because you have always observed the sabbath days that you have arrived here to hear my teaching.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Update: A Buddha must have 32 major marks and 80 minor marks. So far, none other than Shakyamuni Buddha possesses that. So obviously, no Buddhas has appeared since Shakyamuni.<br><br>If you look into the prophecy of Maitreya by Shakyamuni, it is totally unlike now or the period Nichiren lived in.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sariputra, the great general of the doctrine, most wise and resplendent, from compassion for the world asked the Lord: 'Some time ago you have spoken to us of the future Buddha, who will lead the world at a future period, and who will bear the name of Maitreya. I would now wish to hear more about his powers and miraculous gifts. Tell me, O best of men, about them!'<br><br>The Lord replied: <strong>'At that time, the ocean will lose much of its water, and there will be much less of it than now. In consequence a world-ruler will have no difficulties in passing across it. India, this island of Jambu, will be quite flat everywhere, it will measure ten thousand leagues, and all men will have the privilege of living on it. It will have innumerable inhabitants, who will commit no crimes or evil deeds, but will take pleasure in doing good. The soil will then be free from thorns, even, and covered with a fresh green growth of grass; when one jumps on it, it gives way, and becomes soft like the leaves of the cotton tree. It has a delicious scent, and tasty rice grows on it, without any work. Rich silken, and other fabrics of various colours shoot forth from the trees. The trees will bear<br>leaves, flowers and fruits simultaneously; they are as high as the voice can reach and they last for eight myriads of years. Human beings are then without any blemishes, moral offences are unknown among them, and they are full of zest and joy. Their bodies are very large and their skin has a fine hue. Their strength is quite extraordinary. Three kinds of illness only are known -- people must relieve their bowels, they must eat, they must get old. Only when five hundred years old do the women marry.</strong><br><br>The city of Ketumati will at that time be the capital. In it will reside the world-ruler, Shankha by name, who will rule over the earth up to the confines of the ocean; and he will make the Dharma prevail. He will be a great hero, raised to his station by the force of hundreds of meritorious deeds. His spiritual advisor will be a Brahmin, Subrahmana by name, a very learned man, well versed in the four Vedas, and steeped in all the lore of the Brahmins. And that Brahmin will have a wife, called Brahmavati, beautiful, attractive, handsome, and renowned. </span></div>

In a stricter sense, sangha can mean the assembly of all beings possessing some degree of enlightenment. Technically meaning all the priests under Nikko Shonin (including himself)or Priests for the reformation of Nicheren Shonshu and the lay believers. Since when do Sangha reflect only a single entity. ie Nikko?<br><br>Second, both Nicheren Shoshu and Soka Gakkai recite their dharma from the Hoben and Jigakei chapters of the Lotus Sutra as well as Nam Myho Rengo Kyo. Daisaku Ikeda's writings are for those who need a good example how to live their lives according to SGI. Technically, Daisaku Ikeda better learn how to live his life under more unidealistic conditions. As for Nam Myho Rengo Kyo, Nicheren once described it as Nippon represents the whole geography of Japan, so shall Nam Myoho Renge Kyo represent the whole Lotus Sutra which in any common sense or scientific sense represent crap.<br><br>By the way, has anyone seen Soka Gakkai members worshipping any of the books written by Ikeda or chanting the texts from such books? Then how the hell do you consider the books as dharma? Lastly, Supa-Naga, watch what you post for it reflects not only on your beliefs but your character as a person.</div>

This is recognised in all authentic sects of Nichiren Buddhism. I can bring you to see a priest from Nichiren Shu if you want to meet her to get first hand account. I do not know where did you get the idea of Nichiren Shonin proclaiming to be the Matrieya Bodhisattva himself.<br><br>The problem with the soka follower is that they have little understanding of the general Buddhism. Ask any of the knowledgeable buddhists here, they will be able to tell you that Matrieya Bodhisattva will only appear when the Dhamma is near-extinction, so as to revive the Path leading to Liberation. Looking at the robust buddhistic activities around the world, I doubt this is the time, in fact, one of the sutras also mentioned about the coming of Matrieya and it's definitely not now.<br><br>Lotus Sutra practitioners will acknowledge that Lord Sakyamuni is the Eternal and Original Buddha, still, it's buddhists all around the world understands that all Buddhas possessed the same quality, including Wisdom, Compassion, etc. So it won't be correct to say Matrieya will supercede Sakyamuni.<br><br>Some of the goshos of Nichiren may be impractical, but some may be Faith-inspiring, which is important, as Faith will motivate one in his cultivation which further leads to understanding, practicing and eventually verifying and experience the benefit of Dhamma for onself.<br><br>It is true that chapter 2 and 16 are important, but it doesn't mean that one can forgo the understanding and practice of the remaining 26 chapters of the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>The undermentioned may provide you with some idea how does a nichrien buddhist should be practicing<br><br>http://www.nichiren-shu.org/practice.html<br><br>For your info, from what I understand, Supa_naga took the article from the undermentioned url, but I just tried to visit there but seems to be down at the monent. Anyway the one who wrote that seems to be from the soka practice and convert to nichrien shu and eventually ordained to become a nichiren priest. So he wrote what he'd experienced and observed.<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-01.html<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-02.html<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-03.html<br><br>Hope you have a nice day =)</div>

This is recognised in all authentic sects of Nichiren Buddhism. I can bring you to see a priest from Nichiren Shu if you want to meet her to get first hand account. I do not know where did you get the idea of Nichiren Shonin proclaiming to be the Matrieya Bodhisattva himself.<br><br>The problem with the soka follower is that they have little understanding of the general Buddhism. Ask any of the knowledgeable buddhists here, they will be able to tell you that Matrieya Bodhisattva will only appear when the Dhamma is near-extinction, so as to revive the Path leading to Liberation. Looking at the robust buddhistic activities around the world, I doubt this is the time, in fact, one of the sutras also mentioned about the coming of Matrieya and it's definitely not now.<br><br>Lotus Sutra practitioners will acknowledge that Lord Sakyamuni is the Eternal and Original Buddha, still, it's buddhists all around the world understands that all Buddhas possessed the same quality, including Wisdom, Compassion, etc. So it won't be correct to say Matrieya will supercede Sakyamuni.<br><br>Some of the goshos of Nichiren may be impractical, but some may be Faith-inspiring, which is important, as Faith will motivate one in his cultivation which further leads to understanding, practicing and eventually verifying and experience the benefit of Dhamma for onself.<br><br>It is true that chapter 2 and 16 are important, but it doesn't mean that one can forgo the understanding and practice of the remaining 26 chapters of the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>The undermentioned may provide you with some idea how does a nichrien buddhist should be practicing<br><br>http://www.nichiren-shu.org/practice.html<br><br>For your info, from what I understand, Supa_naga took the article from the undermentioned url, but I just tried to visit there but seems to be down at the monent. Anyway the one who wrote that seems to be from the soka practice and convert to nichrien shu and eventually ordained to become a nichiren priest. So he wrote what he'd experienced and observed.<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-01.html<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-02.html<br><br>http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-03.html<br><br>Hope you have a nice day =)</div></blockquote>Don't bug me with offers to go to whichever denomination or sects, as I am not a buddhist in any way. According the Soka members, they believe the propagation of the Dharma is at end as there are many denominations around and yet no one attains enlightenment. For me, I prefer people not to misrepresent others' thoughts and ideas even though it may not be right.</div>

But if I name them you probably wouldn't even believe, because your mind is probably fixed on the belief that there is no more enlightened people around, just because you have not met any.</div>
