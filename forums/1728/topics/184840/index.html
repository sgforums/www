            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>This is a topic about Nichiren Buddhism.<br><br>i understand that Nichiren Buddhism is banned in this forum. But I must say 1 thing. There are many centers bearing the Nichiren lineage and I do see ppl from the nichiren lineage converting to mainstream buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is not exclusive to Soka Gakkai. There are many peaceful Nichiren based centers.<br><br>There is also a gradual opening and transformation of the nichiren centers to adopt mainstream Buddhist beliefs. Hopefully we can see something good out of this transformation.<br><br>If you have always wondered what is within the Japanese Buddhist shrine, which is usually contained within a cupboard like tablet here is a picture of the Gohonzon. Nichiren Buddhist typically chant Namo Myo Ho renkekyo with the Gohonzon<br><br>[Gohonzon removed at request of forummer - AEN]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>Nichiren Buddhism has been in the mainstream Buddhist circle as seen in the website of Japan Buddhist Federation (<a href="http://www.jbf.ne.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jbf.ne.jp/</a>) where Nichiren Buddhist schools are members with exception to Nichiren Shoshu &amp; Soka Gakkai.<br><br>Probably what needs to be banned from this forum is actually "Nichirenism". Well, I'll make a summary explanation of this.<br><br>In Japan, Buddhism is almost exclusively of the Northern tradition (Mahayana). The lineages are mainly from Tiendai (Tien-tai), Shingon, Jodo (Pure Land), Zen, Nichiren &amp; Nara schools. Due to the sectarian nature of Japanese Buddhism, each lineage consists of subsects together with the main sect.<br><br>For Nichiren Buddhism, the main sect will be Nichiren Shu with subsects such as Kempon Hokke Shu, Honmon Butsuryu Shu, Honmon Hokke Shu &amp; 3 offshoots of Hokke Shu. There are 2 sects that advocates "Nichirenism" instead &amp; they are Honmon Shoshu, Nichiren Shoshu &amp; its one-time lay organisation Soka Gakkai.<br><br>Here's the brief difference between Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu &amp; Soka Gakkai:<br><br>3 Treasures of Buddhism<br>- Buddha<br>- Dhamma<br>- Sangha<br><br>1) Nichiren Shu<br>- Buddha : Eternal Sakyamuni Buddha<br>- Dhamma : Mahayana Tripitaka with the Lotus Sutra as base, Namu Myoho Renge Kyo<br>- Sangha : Nichiren Shonin (with the monastics &amp; lay community)<br><br>2) Nichiren Shoshu<br>- Buddha : Nichiren Daishonin<br>- Dhamma : The Lotus Sutra, Nam Myoho Rengo Kyo (with emphasize on the Goshos)<br>- Sangha : Nikko Shonin &amp; successive High Priests<br><br>3) Soka Gakkai [2 types]<br>{A} Official<br>- Buddha : Nichiren Daishonin<br>- Dhamma : The Lotus Sutra, Nam Myoho Rengo Kyo (with emphasize on the Goshos)<br>- Sangha : Nikko Shonin<br>{B} In Reality<br>- Buddha : President Daisaku Ikeda<br>- Dhamma : Writings &amp; Teachings of the President &amp; Soka Gakkai<br>- Sangha : Soka Gakkai organisation &amp; members<br><br>Reason for stating the above 3 organisations is that they are more known thru out the world &amp; are ones with branches in Singapore.<br><br>For more info about Nichiren Shu, check out <a href="http://nichiren-shu.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nichiren-shu.org/</a> , Malaysia branch (<a href="http://www.nshumy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nshumy.org/</a>) &amp; Indonesia branch (<a href="http://www.nishi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nishi.org/</a>)<br><br>Homage to the Original Teacher Lord Sakyamuni Buddha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Buddha's Grace,<br>Supa Naga<br><br></div>

Much needed to be done to diversely incultilate the mainstream back into SSA, and very much so that we are already changing much of our teachings.<br><br>When priest Nichiren brought back the whole set of Lotus Sutra scriptures from China back to Japan, much of the scriptures were lost in the sea due to rough sea conditions and he barely made it back. Based on what was remained in his case, he translated the remaining of the Lotus Sutra into Gohonzon (which we chant from today), but on the cover of our scripture, it os stated that it's only part of the whole Lotus Sutra and his ordeal was recorded in the Grand Shrine in Japan.</div>
