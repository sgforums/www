The bloody past of Japan's religion ought to be look upon as a lesson to avoid future mistakes.<br><br>I like to point out that Tibet used to be a roughed country and the country frequently invaded neighbouring states, incld China.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by supa_naga:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I am not against nor hate Soka for in regards to their manner in observance of Buddhist practice, although I personally do not always agree with their particular methods or style of propagation, I must say that it is wonderful that they teach people to chant the Lotus Sutra and Odaimoku of Namu Myoho Renge Kyo. What is important to remember is that you have met the Lotus Sutra and that you are embracing faith right now. It is because of your relationship with the Buddha (called "en" in Buddhist terminology) in the past that you have been able to encounter the Lotus Sutra today. For this you should be grateful to whoever introduced you to the Lotus Sutra and the testimonial teachings of Nichiren Shonin.<br><br>Btw, I need get the facts straight : SSA is NOT recognised in the mainstream Buddhist community for way back in 2003 their application to S'pore Buddhist Federation (SBF) was NOT approved as they couldn't fulfil 3 SBF conditions of Recognising Sakyamuni Buddha as the Founder &amp; Original Teacher, Fly the Buddhist Flag &amp; Celebrate Vesak Day in May. Plus, their mother org in Japan are not part of Japan Buddhist Federation (JBF) [<a href="http://www.jbf.ne.jp/m_membersList.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jbf.ne.jp/m_membersList.html</a>] nor are a member of the Federation of New Religions in Japan [<a href="http://www.shinshuren.or.jp/kyoudan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shinshuren.or.jp/kyoudan.html</a>] .<br><br>Whether it is Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu or SGI, all chant the Lotus Sutra (<span style="font-style: italic;">not Script</span>) in Sino-Jap. For materialism, SGI seems to hold on to this concept alot as Josei Toda (2nd President) had quoted before that the Gohonzon is like a "happiness-making machine" where one can pray happiness, including material happiness, to it. E.g. to pray for a car, a house, good grades, chant odaimoku [See <a href="http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-02.html" rel="nofollow">http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/SokaGakkai-02.html</a>] .<br><br>Actually, both Shoshu &amp; Soka have in fact deviated from the mainstream; whereas Nichiren Shu is in the mainstream &amp; also one of the member organisation for Nichiren school in the Japan Buddhist Federation.<br><br>What I meant is that the President of SGI, Ikeda, who has virtually become its spiritual leader &amp; the members read his works like Guidance Today &amp; study Lotus Sutra thru Words of Wisdom written by him instead of the Lotus Sutra itself.<br><br>Btw, the term "Nikken sect" seems to be invented by SGI in their conflict with Nichiren Shoshu which still continues (though Nikken has stepped down) due to Soka not recognising new "High Priest" also. Anyway, this is just a political conflict between 2 pesudo-Buddhist cults that spreads "Nichirenism". Unfortunately, Nichiren Shu has been dragged into it even though they are not involved due to misunderstandings caused by similarities in their names.<br><br>Thus, I sincerely hope that SSA members &amp; sympathisers such as AE86tofu,<br>Spirit of Fire, chunyong &amp; dork3d (with his dad) could give yourselves a chance to open up your minds &amp; see for yourselves what Nichiren Buddhism really is by visiting Nichiren Shu temple in Singapore (Lotus Sutra Buddhist Association) on Fri evenings &amp; Sun mornings for their activities.<br>Address : 9 Lor 29 Geylang #07-01<br><br>Namu Myoho Renge Kyo.<br>Praise the Lord.

That's what I'm talking about on the Lotus Sutra guide book. Actually there are 2 sets:<br>- The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 1 to 5<br>- Ongi Kuden or The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings.<br><br>Though SSA had allowed members to read the Lotus Sutra, but you have to read it with the above guides.<br><br>On the whole, you got to have Right View &amp; Right Understanding; i.e. the Buddha gem is the Eternal Sakyamuni Buddha, NOT Nichiren Daishonin. In fact, Nichiren Shonin had declared that he is just a disciple of Sakyamuni Buddha all his life &amp; asked for the stature of Sakyamuni Buddha to be brought to him before he passed away.<br><br>So, AE86tofu. I sincerely hope that you can give yourself a chance to open up &amp; see for yourself what Nichiren Buddhism really is, rather shutting yourself to just SSA study dept materials.<br><br>Gassho,<br>Supa Naga</div>

Quit trying to present false information, bohiruci. If the Lotus Sutra is widely known to be the sutra that Soka Gakkai rely on, then how can Soka Gakkai not recognise Buddha Shakyamuni?

Why? Because according to the sutras it will be 5.67 billion years before Maitreya Buddha comes. Before that, it will still be the era of Shakyamuni Buddha. Look into Shakyamuni Buddha's prophecy of Maitreya Buddha, he gave a very clear and precise description of how the people will be living then, and it is totally unlike now.<br><br>Maitreya will only come after a long period whereby the dharma <strong>completely</strong> died out on Earth, that is to say, not a single sutra expounded by Shakyamuni Buddha survived, the Sangha totally dissolves, and nobody even knows the name 'Buddhism'. Even though we may be living in dharma ending age, such a stage whereby all sutras disappear has not even come yet. Since the sutras expounded by Shakyamuni Buddha still exists, for example, Lotus Sutra, it is IMPOSSIBLE for maitreya become Buddha now.<br><br>We cannot just 'anyhow anyhow' assume someone we think to be great as Maitreya. I believe Nichiren DID NOT claim to be Maitreya. He did not claim to be Buddha, did he? Did Nichiren have the 32 Major Marks and 80 Minor Marks of a Buddha? I don't think so.</div>
