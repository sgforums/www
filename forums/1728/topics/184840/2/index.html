Actually SSA is a recognised member of the Buddhism community in Singapore.<br><br>As for Nichiren Shoshu, there are a few offspringed sects that practised otherwise different from what me practised. We chant the Lotus Script in Japanese whereas they don't. They also practised more towards Materialism which in Buddhism we are taught in forgiveness and non-materialism.<br><br>You may find some members outright disgusting from Nichiren and me as member we are ashamed by what they do. Diversely we were from the same root and practise the same fundamental of Buddha teachings, just that they strayed away from the mainstream.<br><br>As for our President of SSA, he's not our spiritual leader and as a matter of fact, he's more like a coordinator and regulator of the Association throughout the SEA region. Our belief is very much still the basic understandings and lessons to be learned from Buddhism.</div></blockquote>Well, I am not against nor hate Soka for in regards to their manner in observance of Buddhist practice, although I personally do not always agree with their particular methods or style of propagation, I must say that it is wonderful that they teach people to chant the Lotus Sutra and Odaimoku of Namu Myoho Renge Kyo. What is important to remember is that you have met the Lotus Sutra and that you are embracing faith right now. It is because of your relationship with the Buddha (called "en" in Buddhist terminology) in the past that you have been able to encounter the Lotus Sutra today. For this you should be grateful to whoever introduced you to the Lotus Sutra and the testimonial teachings of Nichiren Shonin.<br><br>Btw, I need get the facts straight : SSA is not recognised in the mainstream Buddhist community for way back in 2003 their application to S'pore Buddhist Federation (SBF) was NOT approved as they couldn't fulfil 3 SBF conditions of Recognising Sakyamuni Buddha as the Founder &amp; Original Teacher, Fly the Buddhist Flag &amp; Celebrate Vesak Day in May. Plus, their mother org in Japan are not part of Japan Buddhist Federation (JBF) nor are a member of the Federation of New Religions in Japan.<br><br>Whether it is Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu or SGI, all chant the Lotus Sutra (not Script) in Sino-Jap. For materialism, SGI seems to hold on to this alot as Josei Toda (2nd President) quoted before the Gohonzon is like a "happiness-making machine" where one can pray happiness, including material happiness, to it. E.g. to pray for a car, a house, good grades, chant odaimoku.<br><br>Actually, both Shoshu &amp; Soka are deviated from mainstream.; whereas Nichiren Shu is in the mainstream. I meant the President of SGI, Ikeda, who has become its spiritual leader &amp; the members read his works like Guidance Today &amp; study Lotus Sutra thru Words of Wisdom written by him instead of the Lotus Sutra itself.</div>

Much needed to be done to diversely incultilate the mainstream back into SSA, and very much so that we are already changing much of our teachings.<br><br>When priest Nichiren brought back the whole set of Lotus Sutra scriptures from China back to Japan, much of the scriptures were lost in the sea due to rough sea conditions and he barely made it back. Based on what was remained in his case, he translated the remaining of the Lotus Sutra into Gohonzon (which we chant from today), but on the cover of our scripture, it os stated that it's only part of the whole Lotus Sutra and his ordeal was recorded in the Grand Shrine in Japan.</div></blockquote>Well, I think you open yourself for more info &amp; research other than solely on the Soka study dept for materials.

But I do have my respect to Nichiren Shonin for his missionary zeal to propagate the original &amp; true teachings of Lord Sakyamuni Buddha in 13th century Japan when the Buddhism then was very messy &amp; people virtually forgotten whom Sakyamuni Buddha is.<br><br>Anyway, other than attending morning service &amp; sermon session on Sun's @ Nichiren Shu, I also attend Dhamma class @ Mahaprajna Buddhist Society on Tues evenings &amp; go to Buddha Dhamma Mandala Society (BDMS) for their Scripture Study &amp; Discussion with Ven.
