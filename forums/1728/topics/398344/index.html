              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #660000;">O</span></strong>NE OF THE MOST
               PUZZLING 
                    ASPECTS OF the Buddha's teachings is the idea of no self. If 
              there's no 
                    self, who gets angry, who falls in love, who makes effort, who has
               
                    memories or gets reborn? What does it mean to say there is no 
              self? 
                    Sometimes people are afraid of this idea, imagining themselves 
              suddenly 
                    disappearing in a cloud of smoke, like a magician's trick.<br> <br> We can understand no-self in several ways. The Buddha described 
              what we 
                    call "self" as a collection of aggregates—elements of mind and 
              body—that 
                    function interdependently, creating the appearance of woman or 
              man. We 
                    then identify with that image or appearance, taking it to be "I" 
              or 
                    "mine," imagining it to have some inherent self-existence. For 
              example, we 
                    get up in the morning, look in the mirror, recognize the 
              reflection, and 
                    think, "Yes, that's me again." We then add all kinds of concepts 
              to this 
                    sense of self: I'm a woman or man, I'm a certain age, I'm a happy 
              or 
                    unhappy person—the list goes on and on.<br> <br> When we examine our experience, though, we see that there is not 
              some core 
                    being to whom experience refers; rather it is simply "empty 
              phenomena 
                    rolling on." Experience is "empty" in the sense that there is no 
              one 
                    behind the arising and changing phenomena to whom they happen. A 
              rainbow 
                    is a good example of this. We go outside after a rainstorm and 
              feel that 
                    moment of delight if a rainbow appears in the sky. Mostly, we 
              simply enjoy 
                    the sight without investigating the real nature of what is 
              happening. But 
                    when we look more deeply, it becomes clear that there is no 
              "thing" called 
                    "rainbow" apart from the particular conditions of air and moisture
               and 
                    light.<br> <br> Each one of us is like that rainbow—an appearance, a magical 
              display, 
                    arising out of the various elements of mind and body. So when 
              anger 
                    arises, or sorrow or love or joy, it is just anger angering, 
              sorrow 
                    sorrowing, love loving, joy joying. Different feelings arise and 
              pass, 
                    each simply expressing its own nature. The problem arises when we 
              identify 
                    with these feelings, or thoughts, or sensations as being self or 
              as 
                    belonging to "me": "I'm angry, I'm sad." By collapsing into the 
                    identification with these experiences, we contract energetically 
              into a 
                    prison of self and separation.<br> <br> As an experiment in awareness, the next time you feel identified 
              with a 
                    strong emotion or reaction or judgment, leave the story line and 
              trace the 
                    physical sensation back to the energetic contraction, often felt 
              at the 
                    heart center. It might be a sensation of tightness or pressure in 
              the 
                    center of the chest. Then relax the heart, simply allowing the 
              feelings 
                    and sensations to be there. Open to the space in which everything 
              is 
                    happening. In that moment, the sense of separation disappears, and
               the 
                    union of lovingkindness and emptiness becomes clear. We see that 
              there is 
                    no one there to be apart. As the Chinese poet Li Po wrote: "We sit
               
                    together the mountain and me/ Until only the mountain remains."</p>
