              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Once upon a time, there was an artist. He loved to paint. He would spend hours painting beautiful pictures. He was happy, for he was engaged creatively.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then, one day, he met with a motorbike accident. It was an accident which was near fatal, yet he survived, however, he had to amputate his right arm, the arm that he painted with.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The artist was thrown into depression. He could no longer produce works of art. His livelihood had disappeared! His source of happiness was gone! He wept bitterly for days. The artist began to lose his will to live. Eventually, he decided that he could not take it any longer. Death was the only way out of his suffering, he thought. So the artist climbed to the tallest building in Perth and prepared to leap off the roof.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There on the rooftop, the artist stood. He gingerly lifted his foot over the edge. At that very moment, he looked down at the level below him. He was about to make the jump when out of the corner of his eyes, he saw something that made him stop.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The artist drew in his breath.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em>He found it unbelievable!</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For right in the middle of the street was a man dancing. What caught the artist’s attention was that the man had no arms. And this man appeared to be dancing in great joy!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Instantly, the artist knew. He felt that he had no right to be depressed, for there was another man who was less fortunate but yet still so happy. He decided to change his mind about taking his own life.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The artist ran down the stairs of the building, wild with excitement over a renewed sense of hope. He wanted to thank the dancing man on the street.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He hastily made a beeline for him.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The artist stopped before the man, huffing and puffing away, exhausted by his run. He said to the man, Thank you so much! You have just saved my life! I was about to jump off a building when I saw you. I could not help but be inspired. You have no arms and yet you were dancing away! Can you explain what it is that is making you so happy?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The man was taken aback. He paused for a moment.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“With due respect, Sir, I was not dancing. I was only trying to scratch my bum. It was itchy.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ajahn Brahm had told the above story in answer to the question of what his thought were, in relation to the headline story on October 7 about a financial manager in Los Angeles who committed suicide. Karthik Rajaram, a 45-year-old financial manager, not only killed himself but his wife, mother-in-law and 3 sons. He had fallen into hard times with the recent financial crisis. He once made more than $1.2 million in a London-based venture fund but he had lost his job and lots of money.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">See the Big Picture</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Karthik Rajaram obviously could not see beyond the pain of losing his job and the money. Believing that it was best that he brought his family along, Karthik took things to the extreme.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ajahn Brahm pointed out that it is often that we fail to see the big picture when we have fallen into hard times. The big picture is about two things- what our most valuable assets is and the impermanence of bad times.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The most valuable asset is our family and the community around us. Such is life, there are up times and there are down times. While we may lose all our money, what cannot be taken away is the human spirit, the togetherness. The love and support from the closest people around us. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Additionally, we all know that hard times do not last, just as good times do not as well. Karthik clearly had lost touch with reality. He showed that he did not have the patience to ride out the storm.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But seriously, don’t take life too seriously</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ajahn Brahm suggests that in uncertain financial times like now. It is a good idea to take life less seriously. Worry less and relax more. So if there is any advice that you need to take seriously, it is this: inject humor! Have some fun! Laugh!</span></span></p>

              <p>The artist story is indeed meaningful with a tinge of humor, just like Ajahn Brahm himself whom I have only come to know of his existence when I attented one of his talks last year. I also could not agree more with rokkie's comments. People tend to read all these News tabloid with sympathy and will almost certainly (at least , temporarily) harbour the thought subconsciously to live life more meaningfully, but will also instantly forgot about life is precious and treasure what we have currently. Some of the stories that are in my mind's eyes are the recent young lawyer that has been shot by the terrorist in Mumbai; the actress (Mei Yen Fang) who has died of cancer ; Princess Diana's fairy-tale wedding but ended her tragic life in a car accident.</p>
              <p>I would like to think that during life's unfortunate moments, the sincere suppport from people  that are closest to you is important which acts as a morale booster. Perhaps people should stop comparing with others on what they don't have. They should start to begin thinking of what they have and treasure life. Life is mystical and we shall always strive to create good positive cosmic karma. Of course, not to mention again that it's always easier said than done.</p>
