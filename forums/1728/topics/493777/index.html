              Chinese hang red paper on tombs?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">APRIL 4, 2017 Star2.com MAJORIE
              CHIEW</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Do
              you know why there are pieces of red-streaked paper fluttering from tombs and
              gravestones in Chinese graveyards today?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s
              because today is Qing Ming, the day when Chinese people visit the graves of
              departed loved ones to pay their respects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But why the red-streaked paper?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Traditionally,
              the red came from chicken blood (a rooster’s, preferably); the Hakkas hang
              these “chicken blood paper” (“kwa huet zi” in Cantonese) on graves to create a
              barrier against negative energies or unwanted souls, explains local feng shui
              master Jessie Lee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">She
              adds that, “The paper acts like a talisman, protecting the living and stopping
              angry spirits from disturbing the ancestral worship”. Now-adays, a printed
              version of this paper is used instead.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is why Qing Ming, or “Sweeping the Tomb” day, is also called “Hanging Paper”
              day, or “kwa zi” in Cantonese, says Lee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some
              people, she says, hang five coloured papers to represent the five elements
              (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) in five directions (north, south, east,
              west, and centre).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Whatever
              the details of the rituals, generally, all Chinese take the time to remember
              the dead by visiting grave sites or columbaria to say prayers and make
              offerings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              Qing Ming generally falls on April 4 or 5, traditionally, a longer time frame
              is set aside for such worship. It can be between 15 days (a week before and
              after the actual day) and 21 days (10 days before and after the actual day).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">According
              to the Chinese solar calendar, the Qing Ming solar season is from April 4 to
              April 19. This is because each solar season lasts 14 days, inclusive of the
              first day of the season.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              prayer ritual, Lee says, usually starts and ends with the throwing of “paper
              money” all over the grave. This is to symbolise that the tomb has been
              inspected for damage and that family members have visited to pay their
              respects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tombs
              without the hanging papers or paper money are said to be “lonely tombs”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Scattering paper</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Legend
              has it that the ritual of strewing the tomb with paper started during China’s
              Han Dynasty (roughly 206BCE to 220CE). Liu Bang, the dynasty’s first emperor,
              returned after a war to find that he can no longer find his parents’ tombs –
              graveyards are covered in weeds and most tombstones are broken after years of
              conflict.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              despair, Lee says, the emperor resorted to throwing bits of paper into the air
              and imploring the heavens to guide him by letting the paper fall on his
              parents’ tomb. Sure enough, he found the ancestral resting place. After the
              story got about, the population began to follow suit by placing paper at their
              ancestral graves to indicate that they have been visited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Married daughters</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Traditionally,
              a married daughter is not allowed to visit her late parents’ or ancestral
              tombs. The superstition is that the married daughter will take away the good qi
              (energy) to benefit her husband’s family.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              the old days, tradition favoured the sons in the family; they were the ones
              that drew whatever luck or wealth and good qi was around. This was why families
              would allow only male descendants to mark Qing Ming.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              in the much smaller families of today, what if the married daughter is the only
              child? Lee raises this thought-provoking question and goes on to say that it is
              good that people are becoming more open-minded nowadays and see these
              traditions merely as a means of expressing filial piety.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The newly departed</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Families
              do not observe Qing Ming if their loved ones die close to the day itself;
              however, Lee explains that people might not realise that prayers can still be
              performed at new graves in the first two years, just on different days.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“A
              different type of paper money is used – shops selling Chinese prayer
              paraphernalia can advise families on what to buy,” she says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Within
              the first year of the death, the new grave should be “swept” (that is, Qing
              Ming should be observed) after Feb 4 – which is lap chun, or the beginning of
              spring – but before April 4. In the second year after the death, a date after
              March 20 but before April 4 should be chosen. And from the third year onwards,
              normal practice resumes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Legend of Jie Zhitui</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Feng
              shui master Yap Boh Chu offers another origin story for Qing Ming, this time
              involving the legend of Jie Zhitui.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jie
              Zhitui becomes famous for being a particularly loyal defender of the noble
              family he serves; but he is a modest man and, wanting to shun fame, he retires
              with his elderly mother to nearby Mianshan Mountain (aka Jie Shan, or Jie
              Mountain) in Shanxi Province.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Duke
              Wen (697BCE–628BCE) becomes impatient with Jie Zhitui hiding in the mountain so
              he orders it set alight to drive the defender and his mother out into the open –
              tragically, the loyal man and his mother perish in a cave under a willow tree.
              After burying the pair, an anguished Wen orders his people to eat cold food on
              that day and avoid lighting a fire as a way of remembering Jie Zhitui.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              following year, when Wen hikes up the mountain to commemorate the death, he
              sees that the burned willow tree has revived and flourished. As he remembers
              Jie Zhitui’s noble character, Wen is so moved that he sweeps the tomb clear of
              fallen leaves and declares the festival of Qing Ming.</span></p>
