              <p>Sorry for sutta-spamming... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>i was surprised when i read that this question was asked during Buddha's time</p>
              <p>thought it would be interesting to post and share with forummers who may like it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <div class="chapter">
              <p>Once the Blessed One was staying among the <a id="bhagga" name="bhagga">Bhaggas</a> in the Deer Park at <a id="bhesakala" name="bhesakala">Bhesakala</a> Grove, near <a id="croc-haunt" name="croc-haunt">Crocodile Haunt</a>.
               Then early in the morning the Blessed One put on his robes and, 
              carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to the home of the householder, <a id="nakula" name="nakula">Nakula</a>'s
               father. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Then Nakula's 
              father &amp; Nakula's mother went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, 
              having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, 
              Nakula's father said to the Blessed One: "Lord, ever since Nakula's 
              mother as a young girl was brought to me [to be my wife] when I was just
               a young boy, I am not conscious of being unfaithful to her even in 
              mind, much less in body. We want to see one another not only in the 
              present life but also in the life to come."</p>
              <p>And Nakula's mother said to the Blessed One: "Lord, ever since I as a
               young girl was brought to Nakula's father [to be his wife] when he was 
              just a young boy, I am not conscious of being unfaithful to him even in 
              mind, much less in body. We want to see one another not only in the 
              present life but also in the life to come."</p>
              <p>[The Blessed One said:] "If both husband &amp; wife want to see one 
              another not only in the present life but also in the life to come, they 
              should be in tune [with each other] in conviction, in tune in virtue, in
               tune in generosity, and in tune in discernment. Then they will see one 
              another not only in the present life but also in the life to come."</p>
              <div class="freeverse">Husband &amp; wife, both of them
              	having conviction,
              	being responsive,
              	being restrained,
              	living by the Dhamma,
              	addressing each other
              	with loving words:
              they benefit in manifold ways.
              	To them comes bliss.
              Their enemies are dejected
              	when both are in tune in virtue.
              Having followed the Dhamma here in this world,
              	both in tune in precepts &amp; practices,
              they delight in the world of the devas,
              enjoying the pleasures they desire.</div>

              <p>there's a recently article about "married people live longer than single".</p>
              <p>i think it depends on the "spiritual happiness" of a person. Spiritually (not materialism)Happy people live longer than unhappy people..</p>
              <p>both married and single can be miserable. Singles nowaday can be lonesome and depressed, hence better off getting married. As Too much freedom also not a good advantage, as a person will become indulgence. Got some commitment in life is a form of restriction, discipline, precept to me. I agree with Buddha.</p>
