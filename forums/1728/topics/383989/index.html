              <p><strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> Ananda, all living beings can live if they eat what is sweet, and they 
              will die if they take poison. Beings who seek samadhi should refrain 
              from eating five pungent plants of this world.<br> <br> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span></strong><br> <br> This passage discusses the first gradual stage, getting rid of the 
              aiding causes. The five pungent plants aid in the creation of 
              unwholesome karma, and so the first step is to eliminate them from one's
               diet. Ananda, all living beings can live if they eat what is sweet, and
               they will die if they take poison. "All living beings" refers to the 
              twelve categories. "Sweet" here really means "edible"; the food is sweet
               in the sense that it is not poisonous, but is nourishing and palatable.
               "Poisonous" here does not necessarily mean lethal poison, but refers to
               such things as the five pungent plants, which in this context are 
              considered poisonous. It refers to any food which has an unwholesome 
              effect on beings, and contributes to an earlier death. It doesn't just 
              mean eating something which is instantaneously fatal. Beings who seek 
              samadhi should refrain from eating five pungent plants of this world. 
              The first step is to get rid of contributing causes. The five pungent 
              plants have been described already. They are onions, garlic, leeks, 
              scallions, and shallots.<br> <br> <span class="style63">N2 Explains in depth the ill-effects of eating
               pungent plants.</span><br> <strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire; if 
              they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger.<br> <br> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span></strong><br> <br> If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire. Meat 
              has the same effect. That is one reason why people who cultivate the Way
               do not eat meat. The five pungent plants also increase desire, but not 
              wholesome desire; rather, they are especially potent in increasing 
              sexual desire, to the point that it is unbearable and one goes crazy 
              with lust. If they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger. They make 
              one more stupid. People with wisdom do not lose their tempers. Those who
               do lose their tempers, for the most part are people who cannot clearly 
              distinguish either the principles or the specifics. Something happens 
              and they can't see beyond it. It becomes an obstruction for them, and 
              they do not know how to resolve it except by getting angry. But losing 
              their temper doesn't actually help the situation one bit. Meat also 
              increases one's afflictions and the propensity to get angry. And the 
              more of these five pungent plants one eats, the bigger one's temper 
              grows.<br> <strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> Therefore, even if people in this world who eat pungent plants can 
              expound the twelve divisions of the sutra canon, the gods and immortals 
              of the ten directions will stay far away from them because they smell so
               bad. However, after they eat these things the hungry ghosts will hover 
              around and kiss their lips. Being always in the presence of ghosts, 
              their blessings and virtue dissolve as the days go by, and they 
              experience no lasting benefit.<br> <br> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span></strong><br> <br> Therefore, even if people in this world who eat pungent plants can 
              expound the twelve divisions of the sutra canon, the gods and immortals 
              of the ten directions will stay far away from them because they smell so
               bad. This refers to people who eat the five pungent plants or drink 
              wine or eat meat. On the other hand, the gods and immortals will protect
               someone who does not ingest these things. Body odors come largely from 
              what one eats. People who enjoy eating beef, onions, and garlic have 
              strong body odors. Their armpits often stink so badly that they can be 
              smelled a long way off, and no one wants to get near them.<br> <br> There are a number of people who are able to expound on the canon with 
              all its twelve divisions:<br> <br> <span class="style55">R</span>epeating verses and predictions,<br> Interjections and what was spoken without request;<br> Past events, analogies, causes and conditions,<br> This life, expansions, and what never before existed;<br> With discussion, that is twelve all together,<br> As in Great Wisdom Shastra's thirty-third chapter.<br> Memorize the verse and you know the twelve divisions of the canon.<br> <br> But if one's eating is not pure, one's sole listeners will be hungry 
              ghosts. The gods and immortals will not listen. The hungry ghosts are 
              creatures that don't have anything to eat. But after people who don't 
              hold to pure eating eat these things, meaning the five pungent plants 
              and the like, the hungry ghosts will hover around and kiss their lips. 
              After people eat these strong-smelling foods, the odor lingers around 
              them and attracts ghosts. The ghosts boldly go up and kiss those who 
              partake of the five pungent plants, in an attempt to taste what they've 
              eaten. Ghosts eat by contact, as we have learned, so those who eat these
               impure things are literally in the hands of ghosts who hang around and 
              keep touching them. You may not be one who can see them, but they are 
              really there doing just that. Being always in the presence of ghosts, 
              their blessings and virtue dissolve as the days go by, and they 
              experience no lasting benefit. Plain and simple, this passage says that 
              people who eat the five pungent plants end up in the company of ghosts. 
              Ghosts are their constant companions, even though the people themselves 
              may be oblivious to the fact. Their blessings and virtue thereby 
              decrease, and they end up with no advantages at all.<br> <strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> People who eat pungent plants and also cultivate samadhi will not be 
              protected by the Bodhisattvas, gods, immortals, or good spirits of the 
              ten directions; therefore, the tremendously powerful demon kings, able 
              to do as they please, will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak 
              dharma for them, denouncing the prohibitive precepts and praising lust, 
              rage, and delusion.<br> <br> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span></strong><br> <br> People who eat pungent plants and also cultivate samadhi will not be 
              protected by the Bodhisattvas, gods, immortals, or good spirits of the 
              ten directions. Who is referred to here? Whoever eats the five pungent 
              plants. If you eat them, it's referring to you. If I eat them, it's 
              referring to me. The text leaves the matter open. Why don't dharma 
              protectors and good spirits guard such people? Because they smell too 
              bad. Preferring purity, the protectors avoid the stench and do not come 
              around to guard such people. However, protectors are essential in 
              cultivation, for where the proper resides, the deviant does not, but 
              where the proper is lacking, the deviant will win the advantage. The 
              "proper" refers to the dharma protectors and good spirits who guard and 
              aid cultivators of the Way. But in this case, where they do not come 
              around, the tremendously powerful demon kings, able to do as they 
              please, will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak dharma for them. 
              Seeing an unprotected cultivator, the powerful demonic kings come on the
               scene and gather him into their retinue. They will enter when they 
              catch you off guard. How great is their power? They can turn into 
              Buddhas! I've advised you that if in the future you obtain the Buddha 
              eye, you may see Buddhas come or Bodhisattvas come or gods and immortals
               come or spirits come. But if they are for real, they will have a light 
              about them that is pure and cool, and when it shines on you, you will 
              experience extreme comfort, such as you have never known. That, then, is
               a true Sage. If it's a demon, it puts out heat. However, it requires a 
              lot of wisdom to make this distinction. If you lack sufficient wisdom, 
              you will not notice the power of his heat. Of course, the heat is not 
              hot like a fire, but it is the case that the light of a demon carries 
              heat, while the light of a Buddha does not.<br> <br> Another way you can tell the difference between a demon appearing as a 
              Buddha and an actual Buddha appearing is to look at the dharma they 
              propound. Demon kings will go about denouncing the prohibitive precepts 
              and praising lust, rage, and delusion. They will say, "Don't hold the 
              precepts, that's a small vehicle practice. Those of the great vehicle 
              kill, but it's not killing; steal, but it's not stealing; engage in 
              lust, but it's not lust. So it's no problem. If you kill, you haven't 
              broken any precept. The same goes for stealing and lust. Don't cling to 
              such a small state. Don't hold to such fine distinctions in your 
              conduct. Violations don't matter."<br> <br> What you do before you receive the precepts does not count as a 
              violation of them. But once you have taken a precept, for example, the 
              precept against killing, it is then a violation of the precept if you 
              commit the act of killing. Why? Because you clearly knew it was wrong 
              but intentionally violated the prohibition. If you receive the precept 
              against stealing and you go out and steal, you have violated that 
              precept. You may have indulged in sexual misconduct before receiving the
               precept against it, but that doesn't count as an offense, because it's 
              over and done. But if you conduct yourself in this way after taking the 
              precept, then you violate it. Before you take the precept against lying,
               you are not in violation of the precept no matter what you say, but 
              once you receive the precept you can't be irresponsible in what you say.
               Whatever it is, if you know, you know, and if you don't know, you don't
               know. You can't say you don't know when you really do; or say you know 
              when you really don't. You can't beat around the bush when you speak. 
              The straight mind is the Bodhimanda.<br> <br> Someone may think; well, then, if I don't take them, I won't commit any 
              violations, right? But now you know that it is better to take them, and 
              if you don't you are missing the opportunity. If you do not receive the 
              precepts, you will not be able to make any progress, either in your 
              personal life or with regard to the Buddhadharma.<br> <br> You certainly should continue to make progress. Since we know it is a 
              good thing to do, we should receive the precepts and then carefully 
              uphold them.<br> <br> But the demon kings do nothing but slander and tear down the precepts 
              and encourage you not to receive them. They praise sexual desire. "It's 
              great," they say. "The more sexual desire you have, the loftier the 
              level of Bodhisattvahood you will realize. Just take Ucchushma, who had 
              to have two to three hundred women a day, but then later cultivated and 
              became Fire-head Vajra. So what's the problem?" And so they go on. 
              Actually, as soon as he begins praising sexual desire, you should know 
              immediately that he is not a genuine Buddha. As to rage, he says, 
              "Having a temper doesn't matter. The bigger your temper, the bigger your
               Bodhi. After all, affliction is just Bodhi, so it follows that the more
               affliction you have, the more Bodhi you'll get. It doesn't matter. Lose
               your temper whenever you feel like it." The demon king praises rage in 
              this way. "Delusion" just means being stupid and doing things that are 
              upside down. We discussed it earlier:<br> <br> Through a continual process of dullness and slowness, the upside-down 
              state of stupidity occurs in this world. It unites with obstinacy to 
              become eighty-four thousand kinds of random thoughts that are dry and 
              attenuated.<br> <br> And the beings without thought turn into earth, wood, metal, or stone. 
              Of course, this doesn't happen to every stupid being. It does happen 
              occasionally, however. But here the demon king praises delusion; he 
              tells you that the stupider you are, the better it is, because if you 
              are stupid it will be easier for him to get you to obey his 
              instructions. You'll fall right in with him. You'll become one of the 
              retinue of the demon kings.<br> <br> Recently a book came out of India that specializes in praising the 
              tantric practice of men and women cultivating together. This is a book 
              written by demons. Demons praise sexual desire and do not instruct 
              people to put a stop to it. They say that without cutting off sexual 
              desire one can become a Buddha. But Buddhas are pure, whereas the 
              filthiest thing, the most turbid emotion, is sexual desire. In Chinese 
              the word for marriage (hun) contains a character which is a combination 
              of the word for "woman" (nu) and the word for "confusion" (hun), or 
              "dark delusion." So the very word marriage itself says that as soon as 
              one gets married, one loses wisdom. One's life is spent as if in 
              perpetual night, in darkness and impurity. It is as if one were sleeping
               the days away, and when one is asleep, one is totally oblivious to 
              everything. Just that is stupidity. Chinese characters often shed 
              insight on the meanings they represent.<br> <br> On the other hand, what I just said about marriage is not always the 
              case. You have to be flexible when you view things. You can't be too 
              rigid in your opinions. Although I said that marriage is confusion, you 
              can try to gain understanding within that confusion. You can enter that 
              confusion but not get muddled. Shakyamuni Buddha married, and yet he was
               the wisest of people.<br> <br> When you just heard that people who eat the five pungent plants are 
              kissed by ghosts, did it alarm you? If you weren't frightened, then you 
              must see it as no problem. If it alarmed you, then stop eating the five 
              pungent plants. If you don't eat them, the gods and immortals will 
              protect you and the ghosts will leave you alone. If you can marry and 
              stay alert, stay awake, then you won't sink into that confusion. If you 
              enter into the situation, you must not be turned by it. Don't mistake 
              what I said as meaning that I'm opposed to anyone getting married. I'm 
              just exploring a principle.<br> <strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> When their lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon kings.

              <p class="style62 style73"><strong> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span><br> </strong><br> When their lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon 
              kings. This refers to people who eat the five pungent plants. Because 
              they eat such things, the gods, immortals, Bodhisattvas, and good 
              spirits do not protect them. Therefore, the demon kings who possess 
              great power can have their way with them. The demon king appears as a 
              Buddha and speaks demonic dharma to them, praising sexual desire, anger,
               and stupidity. Having been confused by the demons, these people lose 
              their proper knowledge and proper views and any real wisdom. Instead, 
              they harbor deviant knowledge and deviant views. The demon king says 
              sexual desire is good, and they believe it. "The Buddha told me so! He 
              said it's no problem." That's called mistaking a thief for one's own 
              son. One mistakes the demon king for the Buddha. Therefore, "When their 
              lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon kings." When 
              their worldly blessings are used up, they die and obediently go over to 
              the retinue of the demon king. When they use up their blessings as 
              demons, they will fall into the Relentless Hell. Demons also have their 
              own kind of blessings.<br> <br> Once there was a cultivator who recited the name of Amitabha Buddha. 
              However, he was particularly greedy, especially for silver and gold. He 
              did recite the Buddha's name, but that's because he had heard that the 
              Land of Ultimate Bliss had ground made of gold, and he figured he could 
              amass a pile of it when he got there. Then one day he saw Amitabha 
              Buddha come. The Buddha said to him, "Today you should be reborn in the 
              Happy Land, and you can take your gold and silver with you." So he put 
              his four or five hundred ounces of gold on the lotus flower that 
              Amitabha Buddha was holding. But before he had a chance to hop on the 
              flower himself, it disappeared, as did the Buddha holding it. "Oh," 
              thought the man, "Amitabha Buddha likes money, too. He's run off with 
              all my gold!" At just about that time, in the household of the donor 
              where he was living, a new-born donkey died. They noticed that the belly
               of the young donkey was hard and heavy, and when they cut it open, lo 
              and behold, the old cultivator's gold and silver were tucked away 
              inside! At that point the old cultivator realized how heavy his greed 
              was, and he rejoiced that he had not gone off with "Amitabha Buddha," 
              for had he gone, he would have become that small donkey. And he knew 
              that the "Amitabha Buddha" who had come was not a genuine state.<br> <br> Someone wonders, is there really an Amitabha Buddha? Of course there 
              is. But because people have deviant knowledge and deviant views, there 
              are also demons who can appear in the likeness of Amitabha Buddha. 
              Clearly, we should aim to be straight and proper. But how do you do 
              that? Be extremely careful not to be greedy. Anybody who has the idea he
               can go to the Land of Ultimate Bliss and mine for gold had better wake 
              up fast. Although the Pure Land may be paved with gold, you can't harbor
               thoughts of self-benefit and make plans to use it as you please. In 
              cultivation, being off by just one thought can bring about demonic 
              karma. The text says that because people who eat the pungent plants have
               deviant knowledge and deviant views, they first become demons 
              themselves, and after that they fall into the hells. When will they get 
              out? Nobody knows.<br> <br> <span class="style64">N3 Concludes by calling this practice the 
              foremost increase in vigor.</span><br> <strong><br> <span class="style51">Sutra:</span><br> <br> Ananda, those who cultivate for Bodhi should never eat the five 
              pungent plants. This is the first of the gradual stages of cultivation.<br> <br> <span class="style51">Commentary:</span><br> </strong><br> Ananda, have you been listening? Those who cultivate for Bodhi, 
              anybody on the path to Bodhi, should never eat the five pungent plants. 
              You definitely must stop eating onions, garlic, leeks, scallions, and 
              chives. If you eat these things, you can end up in the company of the 
              demon kings. If you don't eat these things, you can join the Buddha's 
              retinue. This is the first of the gradual stages of cultivation. This is
               the first step of progress for a cultivator of the Way. In cultivation,
               one must get rid of the causes which aid in the creation of bad karma. 
              The five pungent plants are one cause which aids the demon kings. You 
              should not regard them as unimportant. The five pungent plants make you 
              turbid and confused. They make you impure, and your impurity puts you 
              together with the retinue of demon kings, for the more impure one is, 
              the better they like it.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Q. Why are onion, garlic and related "pungent" plants excluded from a Chinese "pure" vegetarian diet? </span></strong></p>
              <p>A. The scriptures followed by Chinese Buddhists warn against them.</p>
              <p>The Shurangama Sutra, Volume 7, Part One, discusses the process of overcoming the basic cause of random thoughts that fill the mind and eliminate attentiveness.</p>
              <p><em>"...Beings who seek samadhi should refrain from eating five pungent plants of this world. </em></p>
              <p>"If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire; if they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger.</p>
              <p>[Note: The scriptures do not warn against <em>all</em> pungent plants, only those in the garlic/onion family. There is no advice against ginger, for example.]</p>
              <p>If this simple, straightforward rationale fails to sway the samadhi-seeker the sutra, like many other religious texts, makes its point with no lack of imagery:</p>
              <p><em>"Therefore, even if people in this world who eat pungent plants can expound the twelve divisions of the Sutra canon, the gods and immortals of the ten directions will stay far away from them because they smell so bad. However, after they eat these things the hungry ghosts will hover around and kiss their lips. Being always in the presence of ghosts, their blessings and virtue will dissolve as the days go by, and they will experience no lasting benefit. </em><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#sutra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>"People who eat pungent plants and also cultivate samadhi will not be protected by the Bodhisattvas, gods, immortals, or good spirits of the ten directions; therefore, the tremendously powerful demon kings, able to do as they please, will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak Dharma for them, denouncing the precepts and praising lust, rage, and delusion.</p>
              <p>"When their lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon kings. When they use up their blessings as demons, they will fall into the unintermittent hell.</p>
              <p>"Ananda, those who cultivate for Bodhi should never eat the five pungent plants.</p>
              <p>So, to summarize, the scriptures warn that pungent plants are to be avoided because obstacles to the spiritual path increase when they are eaten.</p>
              <p>It's interesting to note that the next verse in the sutra ends with another piece of advice (without explanation), that certainly has not received the same degree of attention among Buddhists:</p>
              <p><em>"...sever thoughts of lust, not partake of wine or meat, and eat cooked rather than raw foods. </em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Other views</strong> </span></p>
              <p>The scriptures' assessment of the pungent plants has parallels in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the book <em>Chinese System of Food Cures</em> <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#lu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[2]</span></span></a>:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Pungent foods induce perspiration and promote energy circulation. </li>
              <li>Chive seed is an important herb in Chinese herbal remedies, normally used as a "yang" tonic: a tonic used to treat impotence and sexual weakness, among other things, by increasing the energetic capacity of the testes. </li>
              <li>Garlic helps to eliminate the strong smells of meat or fish. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Yoga master Sri Swami Sivananda, while advising spiritual aspirants to maintain a yogic diet, claimed:</p>
              <p><em>"Rajasic food distracts the mind. It excites passion...Onions and garlic are worse than meat." </em><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#yogic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[4]</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The website Islam Online <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#islam"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[5]</span></span></a> reports that the Prophet Mohammad once informed his followers:</p>
              <p><em>"Whoever has eaten [garlic] should not approach the mosque" </em>(Sahih Bukhari 7:65 #362)</p>
              <p>It's also interesting to note that early Christians also posited a link between"evil" and garlic. Books on herbs state that early Christians believed that garlic sprang up wherever the devil's right foot stepped in his exit from Eden. The familiar folk wisdom around the world is that garlic's powerful smell provides protection against evil, sorcery, or vampires. But for that purpose it is usually to be hung up or worn - not eaten (Ulysses' defense against Circes was exceptional).</p>
              <p>Note that although there are some strong similarities to the Jain "pure" vegetarian diet, the sutra's rationale is (at least superficially) different from the advice against eating <em>any</em> root vegetable, given in Jain religious books. According to information I received from Jain mailing lists <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#jain"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[3]</span></span></a>, the Jain advice is based on the principle of minimizing violence to living beings: root vegetables are classified as possessing multiple plant souls.</p>
              <p>Finally, it should be noted that the authenticity of the Shurangama sutra is currently a subject of academic debate. Some scholars assert that the work was not brought from India, but fabricated by Chinese. <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/#fake"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[6]</span></span></a></p>
