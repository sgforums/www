              <p>Yes AEN,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite all controversies surrounding FWBO, I think this is a good article.  There are just a few points I want to make.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the article is about the 'spontaneous arising', it is not possible for effortlessness to arise when we treat Awareness to be mirror-like reflecting.  This will become clear only at the later phase of our practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even when insight of anatta arises and no-self is experienced, the 'who' may be gone, but still the 'tendency to remain as a center' remains and is taking 'forms' in a very subtle way.  It manifests as the sensation of the 'hereness', 'nowness' and 'this Presence'.  Quickly the 'here and now and presence' becomes the 'goal' of practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In truth 'here-ness' and 'now-ness' is as inherent as 'selfness' that is equally empty of inherent existence and must be correctly experienced as equally empty (non-inherent) in nature.  Practitioners will have to replace this core with 'dependent orginination' but this need must arise as an insight.  This is the essence of stage 6.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The article is also full of dualistic expressions despite his non-dual experiences.  As I have told you before, not to underestimate the impact of the constant chattering in a dualistic manner. If we continuously repeat “phenomenon arises in awareness” and not “as Awareness”, even though there never was a separation, consciousness will see as if there is a separation. Although it may seem to be a casual expression for communication sake, the impact is subtle. In time to come, the slow and subtle impact will make separation appears amazingly real. This is true even for those that have experienced non-duality; they are not spared from it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly never underestimate the strength of the 'bond'.  It is the very reason why we are lost.  The grasping of 'here-ness and now-ness' is also the result of it.  So give equal importance on the aspect that consciousness incessantly creates imprints upon itself and once formed is difficult to break.  Many Advaita as well as Buddhist practitioners that emerge as masters after certain glimpses of our Awareness and its non-dual luminosity often neglect this point.  They got overwhelmed and skewed towards luminosity.  This 'tendency of creating imprints' is as beginless as our non-dual nature, we must see Consciousness as it is. Do take this seriously and there will be no problem understanding why we are lost despite our luminous nature. :)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Try not to talk too much about spontaneous arising; before the thorough experience of anatta and the replacement of the core, the center with Dependent Origination, there will be no true understanding of spontaneous arising and effortlessness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Practice hard so that you may come to know that whatever said is only relevant conventionally. Ultimately, everything is alright.</p>
