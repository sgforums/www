              <h2><span style="font-size: small;">From "<strong>Great Perfection in the Palm of Your Hand</strong>" 
                  by the late Dudjom Rinpoche.</span></h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Direct instructions on practice explained in a manner easy to understand 
                  called <em>Extracting the Very Essence of Accomplishment</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>I go for refuge and bow with devotion at the feet of my incomparably 
                  kind, glorious sublime lama. </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Grant your blessings to my followers and me that the profound path’s 
                  flawless realization arises swiftly in our mindstreams, and that we may then

              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>In this text I present essential advice for solitary meditation practice 
                  in an easily accessible way. My words will place direct instructions for the 
                  practice of the innermost secret Great Perfection in the palm of the hands 
                  of fortunate individuals. Their previous lifetimes’ positive aspirations and 
                  pure karmic propensity have led them to feel heartfelt trust in the teaching 
                  of the profound, secret Great Perfection, and in the lama who reveals it; 
                  and they wish to take their practice to completion. For them, this text will 
                  provide an open gate to the path of Great Perfection.</p>
              <p>This can be understood through three general topics:</p>
              <p>1. Preparation<br> How to purify your mindstream: direct your mind toward the teachings after 
                  having severed all ties of attachment.</p>
              <p>2. Main Practice<br> How to directly cultivate the experience of Great Perfection: resolve any 
                  misconceptions regarding the view, meditation and conduct.</p>
              <p>3. Post-meditation<br> How to keep your vows and samayas, and how to include all activities of this 
                  life within the dharma.</p>
              <h2><span style="font-size: small;">First, the Preparation</span></h2>
              <p>Now I will say a little about the first topic. That which is called 
                  mind—this so very vivid awareness—appears from the very beginning at the 
                  same time as Buddha Always Noble, (<em>Kuntu Zangpo</em>).</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Buddha Always Noble knew this awareness as his own. Alas! 
                  Sentient beings endlessly wander in samsara because they do not recognize 
                  this, taking rebirth in countless forms of the six types of beings. 
                  Everything they have done has been meaningless.</p>
              <p>Now, one time out of hundreds you have obtained a human form. If you do 
                  not do what you can now to avoid rebirth in the lower realms, your place of 
                  rebirth might be unknown, but wherever it might be among the six classes of 
                  beings, suffering will be its only sure feature.</p>
              <p>It is not enough to have just obtained this human form. You must at once 
                  practice the authentic Buddhist path since the time of your death is 
                  unpredictable. Furthermore, at death you should have no regrets and should 
                  not be ashamed of yourself, like Jetsun Milarepa.</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>In my, Milarepa’s religious tradition,</em></p><em>
              <p>We live so as not to be ashamed with ourselves.</p>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>When entering the Buddhist path, it is not sufficient to be a person who 
                  only adopts the outer appearance of a person on the path. Cut all 
                  entanglements to desirable things and to this life’s affairs. When you enter 
                  the gate to Buddhist practice without having cut these ties, you will lack 
                  determination, but not attachment to homeland, wealth, possessions, lovers, 
                  spouses, friends, relatives and so forth. Your attitude of attachment 
                  becomes an underlying cause; the objects of your attachment, catalysts. When 
                  these meet, negative forces<sup>[i]</sup> will create obstacles. You will 
                  once again become an ordinary worldly person, and will turn away from 
                  creating positive karma. ...</p>
              <h3><span style="font-size: small;">The Actual Purification of One’s Mindstream</span></h3>
              <p>The common practices are the four thoughts that turn the mind away from 
                  samsara. The uncommon practices are taking refuge, generating bodhichitta, 
                  purifying obscurations and gathering the accumulations of merit and wisdom. 
                  Exert yourself according to each of their commentaries until experiences 
                  arise. Especially, embrace guru yoga as the vital essence of practice, and 
                  practice diligently. If you do not, your meditation will grow slowly, and 
                  even if it grows a little, obstacles will arise and genuine realization will 
                  not manifest in your mindstream. Therefore, forcefully pray with uncontrived 
                  devotion. At some time the realization of wisdom mind will be transmitted to 
                  your mindstream, and an extraordinary realization that can not be expressed 
                  by words will definitely arise from within yourself.</p>
              <p>As it has been said by Lama Shang Rinpoche:</p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>To nurture stillness,<br> To nurture spiritual experiences,<br> To nurture samadhi and other spiritual states—<br> These are common.<br> But by the strength of your devotion,<br> For realization to arise from within<br> Due to the lama’s blessings—<br> This is rare.<br>  </em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>Therefore, for the ultimate truth of the Great Perfection to appear 
                  in your mind is dependent upon the preliminary practices. This is what 
                  Drigungpa meant when he said:</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Other spiritual teachings regard the main practice as being profound.<br> We regard the preliminary practice as being profound.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>It is just as he said.</p>
              <h2><span style="font-size: small;">Second, The Main Practice</span></h2>
              <p>The main practice is to cut through misconceptions regarding the view, 
                  meditation and conduct, and how to put our practice to the test.</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>The View</em></p><em>
              <p>To begin, the view is recognition of ultimate reality as it is.</p>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>As for this view, your mind’s nature is the ultimate nature of reality. 
                  Once you have concluded this with certainty in awareness free from all 
                  characteristics of intellectual mind’s fabrications and contrivance, 
                  awareness nakedly manifests as self-originating primordial wisdom. Words 
                  cannot express it. Metaphors cannot illustrate it. It does not get worse in 
                  samsara, nor better in enlightenment. It has not been born, nor will it come 
                  to an end. It has not been liberated, nor deluded. It does not exist, nor 
                  not exist. Awareness is unlimited and impartial.</p>
              <p>In short, from the very beginning, awareness has never been established 
                  as being material and having characteristics that can be conceptualized, 
                  because its essence is primordially pure, sublime, all-pervasive emptiness. 
                  The ocean of realms of phenomena of existence and enlightenment naturally 
                  manifest as the display of unobstructed emptiness, like the sun and its 
                  rays. Therefore awareness is neither partial nor a completely empty void, 
                  because its nature is the supreme spontaneous presence of primordial wisdom 
                  and noble qualities.</p>
              <p>Thus, awareness, the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness, epitome 
                  of the three kayas, is the primordial nature of reality. Precise recognition 
                  of awareness, ultimate reality as it is, is what is called the Great 
                  Perfection’s view beyond the intellect.</p>
              <p>Our sublime master Guru Rinpoche said:</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>The dharmakaya, beyond the intellect, is ultimate reality.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>We actually hold in our hands the wisdom mind of Buddha Always Noble 
                  (Kuntu Zangpo). How wonderful! This is the very essence of the six million, 
                  four hundred thousand Great Perfection tantras, themselves the consummation 
                  of all eighty-four thousand divisions of the Victorious One’s collection of 
                  teachings. There is nothing beyond this. You should resolve all phenomena in 
                  this awareness. Definitively conclude that all phenomena are contained with 
                  this awareness.</p>
              <h3><span style="font-size: small;">Meditation</span></h3>
              <p>Now, once you have resolved all your inner doubts and misconceptions 
                  regarding this view, to sustain its continuity is called meditation.</p>
              <p>All other meditations with reference points are conceptual meditations 
                  fabricated by the mind. This is not how we meditate. Do not lose hold of 
                  this view previously described, and in that state release all 
                  consciousnesses of the five senses within the natural state, and rest at 
                  ease.</p>
              <p>Do not meditate to arrive at a conclusion, "That’s it!" If you meditate 
                  in that way, it becomes intellectual activity. Here, there is no object of 
                  meditation whatsoever, nor even an instant of distraction. Distraction from 
                  resting in awareness is true delusion. Don’t be distracted!</p>
              <p>Whatever thoughts arise, let them arise. Do not follow after them and do 
                  not suppress them. If you ask "In that case, what should I do?," whatever 
                  objective phenomena arise, whatever appears, do not grasp phenomena’s 
                  appearing aspect as you rest in a fresh state, like a small child looking 
                  inside a temple. When all phenomena are left as they are, their appearance 
                  is not modified, their color does not change, and their brilliance does not 
                  diminish. If you do not spoil phenomena with clinging and grasping thoughts, 
                  appearances and awareness will nakedly manifest as empty and luminous 
                  primordial wisdom.</p>
              <p>However, many teachings considered very deep or extremely vast have left 
                  individuals of lesser intelligence mystified. If I put my finger on the 
                  concise essential meaning, it is this: in the gap between the last thought’s 
                  cessation and the next’s arising, isn’t there a fresh, present knowing, that 
                  has not been modified even in the slightest—luminous, naked awareness? That 
                  itself is awareness’ abiding state!</p>
              <p>But one does not permanently abide within the nature of reality. Doesn’t 
                  a thought suddenly arise? That is the natural display of awareness. However, 
                  if you do not recognize thoughts as soon as they arise, they will naturally 
                  spread. This is called "the chain of delusion," the root of samsara. Mere 
                  recognition of thoughts as they arise breaks their flow. Release thoughts 
                  within that recognition. When you remain in that state, arising thoughts 
                  will all be liberated equally within awareness, the expanse of dharmakaya. 
                  This is the main practice in which the view and meditation of Cutting 
                  Through Solidity, <em>Trekchö</em>, are cultivated as one.</p>
              <p>Garab Dorje has said:</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>From within the nature of originally pure stainless space, <br> Awareness suddenly manifests. That moment of mindfulness<br> Is like finding a jewel at the bottom of the ocean.<br> This is dharmakaya, not fabricated nor created by anyone.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>Persevere in this way. You must meditate without distraction day and 
                  night—do not leave emptiness in the domain of mere understanding. Bring 
                  everything back to awareness itself.</p>
              <h3><span style="font-size: small;">Conduct</span></h3>
              <p>Now I will describe how conduct can enhance meditation and how to put our 
                  practice to the test.</p>
              <p>The main point, as I previously explained, is to never part for an 
                  instant from the perception of your spiritual master as a true buddha; make 
                  heartfelt, intensely focused prayers to your spiritual master. This is known 
                  as "devotion that is the sole sufficient cure," superior to any other method 
                  to remove obstacles and enhance your practice. You will forcefully and 
                  decisively travel all paths to enlightenment.</p>
              <h3><span style="font-size: small;">Faults in Meditation</span></h3>
              <p>If you experience dullness and drowsiness, arouse awareness. If you 
                  experience excitement and agitation, relax your mind. Always, the mediator's 
                  vivid mindful awareness should not impose a disciplined mindfulness. 
                  Mindfulness is simple recollection of the recognition of your own nature.</p>
              <p>Continuously sustain vivid mindful awareness at all times as you go about 
                  your daily activities, whether eating, sleeping, moving or sitting, whether 
                  during meditation or post-meditation. Never harbor hope or fear toward 
                  whatever thoughts arise, such as those of happiness or suffering, or of the 
                  passions; do not accept or reject them; and do not destroy them using 
                  antidotes, and so forth. Instead, whatever feelings of happiness and 
                  suffering are there, settle in their naked, vivid, lucidly present essence. 
                  This single vital point, and none other, applies to everything. Do not 
                  confuse yourself with a lot of thinking.</p>
              <p>A separate meditation upon emptiness as an antidote to what must be 
                  relinquished—thoughts and passions—is unnecessary. Awareness of what must be 
                  relinquished liberates it naturally with that recognition, like a snake’s 
                  knot uncoiling.</p>
              <p>Most people know how to say the words "the ultimate concealed meaning of 
                  the Clear Light Vajra Essence," like a parrot’s chatter, but don’t know how 
                  to practice it. We are all so incredibly fortunate! Carefully consider this 
                  once again—there’s something to be understood. During our beginningless 
                  series of lives until now, our mortal enemy, dualistic clinging, binds us to 
                  the wheel of life. Now, thanks to our spiritual master’s kindness, his 
                  introduction to naturally abiding dharmakaya releases both poles of 
                  grasping, like a feather consumed in fire, with nothing following and 
                  without a trace. Isn’t that really satisfying?</p>
              <p>If you do not practice once you’ve obtained the swift path’s profound 
                  instructions such as these, it is as if a wish-fulfilling jewel were placed 
                  in a corpse’s mouth. What a waste! Practice without being discouraged!</p>
              <p>Furthermore, beginners will lose their mindfulness in distraction due to 
                  unwholesome thoughts that get out of control; these thoughts coalesce in the 
                  form of underlying mental activity. At some point, a piercing mindfulness 
                  returns, and the thought of regret arises, "Oh, I’m distracted!" 
                  Nevertheless, do not do anything whatsoever at that moment, such as stopping 
                  the flow of previous thoughts or regretting having been distracted. When 
                  this vivid mindfulness returns, it is sufficient just to sustain naturally 
                  resting in precisely that mindfulness.</p>
              <p>A famous saying advises, "Do not reject thoughts; see them as 
                  dharmakaya." However, until you perfect higher insight’s subtle power, you 
                  might dwell upon the thought, "This is probably dharmakaya!" and remain in a 
                  blank state of peaceful abiding. You thus risk getting trapped in a 
                  spaced-out, indifferent, unreflective state. Therefore, in the beginning 
                  look directly at whatever thoughts arise; do not examine, analyze or reflect 
                  upon them at all. Rest upon the recognizer of thoughts, without making it a 
                  big deal, disinterested in what arises, like an old man watching children at 
                  play.</p>
              <p>Once you’ve placed your mind as I described, the deepening of the 
                  experience of stillness in a non-conceptual natural state will be suddenly, 
                  abruptly destroyed. At that instant, primordial wisdom beyond mind will 
                  nakedly and clearly manifest.</p>
              <p>While you tread the path, this experience of primordial wisdom will not 
                  come untainted with one or another of three meditative experiences—bliss, 
                  clarity or conceptionlessness. Nevertheless, placing your mind without the 
                  slightest bit of hope, fear, attachment or conceit, due to holding such 
                  experiences as supreme, prevents errors. It is very important to constantly 
                  give up distraction and to meditate with one-pointed vigilant mindfulness. 
                  When you lapse into sporadic practice and mere intellectual understanding, 
                  arrogance will arise out of just a little peaceful abiding. If you do not 
                  carefully observe your spiritual experiences, you will merely be skilled in 
                  pretense and knowledgeable of the right words, which is not beneficial.</p>
              <p>As the Great Perfection tantras state:</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Intellectual understanding is like a patch,<br> It will fall off.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>And,</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Spiritual experiences are like mist,<br> They will evaporate.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>As this says, even some slight positive and negative objective event has 
                  deceived great meditators, and many lose their bearings in the midst of 
                  circumstances. Even when meditation is planted within your stream of being, 
                  the profound instructions will be left on your book’s pages if you do not 
                  meditate consistently—your mind will become insensitive: you will become 
                  insensitive to the teachings, you will become insensitive to practice, and 
                  genuine meditation will never arise. Even old great meditators are in danger 
                  of dying completely lost, in the state of a newcomer to practice. Therefore, 
                  be very careful.</p>
              <p>When you continually familiarize yourself with this over a long period of 
                  time, devotion or some other suitable catalyst will at some point cause 
                  these spiritual experiences to overflow into realization, and you will 
                  vividly see naked awareness, as if a veil were instantly lifted from your 
                  head. You will become utterly free and spacious. This is called "the supreme 
                  seeing that does not see anything." Thereafter, thoughts arise as 
                  meditation; mental stillness and movement are simultaneously liberated. 
                  Moreover, at first, recognition of thoughts liberates them, like meeting 
                  someone familiar. In the middle period, thoughts are liberated by 
                  themselves, like a snake’s knot uncoiling. Finally, thoughts are liberated 
                  without benefit or harm, like a thief entering an empty house. These three 
                  ways of liberation will occur gradually. A deep, decisive trust manifests 
                  within you that all phenomena are the magical display of your awareness 
                  alone—waves of realization of emptiness and compassion will surge. Choosing 
                  between either cyclic existence or enlightenment ends. You realize that 
                  buddhas are not "good" and sentient beings are not "bad." Whatever you have 
                  done, you will be carefree beyond words without knowing how to move from the 
                  sole nature of phenomena, and therefore you will uninterruptedly abide in 
                  this infinite space, day and night.</p>
              <p>As it is said in the Great Perfection tantras:</p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Like the sky, realization is changeless.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>This kind of Great Perfection practitioner appears to have an ordinary 
                  human form, but his or her mind is dharmakaya. He or she abides in wisdom 
                  mind free from effort and activity and, without doing anything, traverses 
                  all paths and stages. Finally, ordinary mind and phenomena exhausted, like 
                  the space of a broken vase, the body vanishes into atoms, and the mind 
                  vanishes into the nature of phenomena. This is called attaining the youthful 
                  vase body, which is the inner clarity of the original ground, stainless 
                  space. This will come about. Since this is the ultimate consummation of 
                  view, meditation and conduct, it is called "the fully manifest unattainable 
                  result." The stages of spiritual experiences and realization arise either in 
                  a progressive order, without a progressive order, or all at once. This 
                  occurs according to the particular faculties of people, but there is no 
                  difference when the result is achieved.</p>

              <p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>How the teachings encompass keeping vows and tantric commitments, and 
                  applying them in your daily life.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p>Although you applied yourself in the practice of the view, meditation and 
                  conduct as described above, if you were unskillful in post-meditation’s 
                  conduct, and your vows and tantric commitments were damaged, impediments and 
                  obstacles will hinder your progress on the paths and spiritual stages in the 
                  short term, and ultimately you will certainly fall to the lowest hell called 
                  Incessant Pain. Therefore, it is extremely important to never be separate 
                  from vigilant mindfulness, not making any mistakes regarding the kind of 
                  conduct to accept and which to reject. ...</p>

              <p><sup>[i]</sup>. In this context I have translated as "negative forces" the 
                  Tibetan word <em>Dü</em> (<em>bdud</em>), which is a translation of the Sanskrit
                  <em>mara</em>. In general, <em>mara</em> represents clinging to a self, and 
                  one’s attachment and involvement with the eight worldly concerns. Often <em> mara</em> is discussed in the context of the four <em>maras</em>, negative 
                  forces or demons (<em>bdud bzhi</em>). According to the Sutrayana tradition, 
                  the four demons are: the demon of the aggregates; of the passions; of death; 
                  and of the child of the gods. According to the Vajrayana tradition, the four 
                  demons are: the material demon; immaterial demon; demon of exaltation; and 
                  the demon of pride. The material demons refer to external phenomena, whether 
                  things or other beings who do us harm. The immaterial demons refer to the 
                  three poisons—anger, desire, and ignorance. The demon of exaltation refers 
                  to attachment to such things as inner spiritual experiences. The demon of 
                  pride—the root of all demons—is clinging to a self. For an excellent and 
                  detailed account of <em>mara</em>, see</p>
