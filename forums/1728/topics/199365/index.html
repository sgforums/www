            <div class='col-md body'>Kamma is a Pali word meaning action. It is<br>called Karma in Sanskrit. In its general sense<br>Kamma means all good and bad actions. It<br>covers all kinds of intentional actions whether<br>mental, verbal or physical thoughts, words and<br>deeds. In its ultimate sense Kamma means all<br>moral and immoral volitions.<br><br>The Buddha says:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Mental volition, O Bhikkhus, is what I call<br>action (Kamma). Having volition, one acts by<br>body, speech and thought.Â”</span><br>Â—Anguttara Nikaya, Vol. III, Pg 415</span><br><br>Kamma is <strong>neither fatalism nor a doctrine of<br>predetermination.</strong> The past influences the<br>present but <strong>does not dominate it</strong>, for Kamma<br>is past as well as present. The past and<br>present influence the future. The past is<br>a background against which life goes on<br>from moment to moment. <strong>The future is<br>yet to be</strong>. Only present moment exists<br>and the responsibility of using the present<br>moment for good or for ill lies with each<br>individual.</div>

No, it is the nature<br>of fire to burn, to give out heat. If we use it<br>properly it gives us light, cooks our food for us<br>or burns anything we wish to get rid of, but if<br>we use it wrongly it burns us and our property.<br>Its work is to burn and our job is to use it in<br>the right way.<strong>We are foolish if we<br>grow angry and blame it when it burns<br>us because we have made a mistake.</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is much the same way that Kamma operates<br>in the broad stream of general life.

If this were not so, what possibility<br>would there ever be of a manÂ’s getting<br>free from all Kamma for ever. It would be perpetually<br>self-continuing energy that could never<br>come to an end.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Man</strong></span> has, therefore, a certain amount of free<br>will and there is almost every possibility to<br>mould his life or to modify his actions.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The more we understand the law of Kamma<br>the more we see how careful we must be of our<br>acts, words and thoughts, and how responsible<br>we are to our fellow beings</strong>. Living in the light<br>of this knowledge, we learn certain lessons from<br>the doctrine of Kamma.<br><br><strong>1. PATIENCE</strong><br><br><strong>Knowing that the Law is our great helper if we<br>live by it, and that no harm can come to us if<br>we work with it</strong>, knowing also it blesses us just<br>at the right time, we learn the grand lesson of<br>patience, not to get excited, and that impatience<br>is a check to progress. In suffering, we<br>know that we are paying a debt, and we learn,<br>if we are wise, not to create more suffering for<br>the future. In rejoicing, we are thankful for its<br>sweetness, and learn, if we are wise, to be still<br>better. <strong>Patience brings forth peace, success,<br>happiness and security.</strong><br><br><strong>2. CONFIDENCE</strong><br><br><strong>The law being just, perfect, it is not possible for<br>an understanding person to be uneasy about it.<br>If we are uneasy and have no confidence, it<br>shows clearly that we have not grasped the<br>reality of the law.</strong> We are really quite safe beneath<br>its wings, and there is nothing to fear in<br>all the wide universe except our own misdeeds.<br>The Law makes man stand on his own feet and<br>rouses his self-confidence.<br><strong>Confidence strengthens, or rather, deepens<br>our peace and happiness and make us comfortable,<br>courageous; wherever we go the Law is<br>our protector.</strong><br><br><strong>3. SELF-RELIANCE</strong><br><br><strong>As we in the past have caused ourselves to be<br>what we now are, so by what we do now will<br>our future be determined</strong>. A knowledge of this<br>fact and that the glory of the future is limitless,<br>gives us great self-reliance, and takes away<br>that tendency to appeal for external help, which<br>is really no help at all. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Purity and impurity<br>belong to oneself, no one can purify anotherÂ”</span></span> says<br>the <strong>Buddha.</strong><br><br><strong>4. RESTRAINT</strong><br><br><strong>Naturally, if we realise that the evil we do will<br>return to strike us, we shall be very careful lest<br>we do or say or think something that is not<br>good, pure and true</strong>. Knowledge of Kamma will<br>restrain us from wrongdoing for othersÂ’ sakes<br>as well as for our own.<br><br><strong>5. POWER</strong><br><br><strong>The more we make the doctrine of Kamma a<br>part of our lives, the more power we gain, not<br>only to direct our future, but to help our fellow<br>beings more effectively.</strong> The practice of<br>good Kamma, when fully developed, will enable<br>us to overcome evil and limitations, and<br>destroy all the fetters that keep us from our<br>goal, Nibbana.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To sum it up...<br><br>There is no one that decides the <strong>"rewards and punishments"</strong> for what we do. <strong>We create the causes of our actions, and we experience their results. </strong><strong>We are responsible for our own experience</strong>. The Buddha discovered the law of Karma - He did not create it. (No one created it.) By teaching us the law of Karma, <strong>the Buddha shows us how to work within the functioning of cause and effect in order to attain True Happiness and avoid pain.</strong><br><br><strong>Karma is not inflexibly fixed </strong>- it <strong>does not mean fate or predetermination. </strong>Intentional actions at some time or other produce their effects when favoring conditions exist. Though people in their present lives are experiencing the effects of their past actions (Karma), <strong>it is possible to change, reduce or increase the effects of these past actions through present actions, which can affect the immediate future and future lives.</strong> Understanding the law of Karma <strong>helps one realize that we are whatever we make ourselves to be.</strong> <strong>We are entirely responsible for our destiny</strong>.<br><br><strong>The Buddha pointed out that no God or priest nor any other kind of being has the power to interfere in the working out of someone else's Kamma.</strong> Buddhism, therefore, <strong>teaches the individual to take full responsibility for themselves.</strong> For example, if you want to be wealthy then be trustworthy, diligent and frugal,.There is no God to ask favours from, or to put it another way, <span class="large"><strong>there is no corruption possible in the workings of Kamma. </strong></span><br><br>Thnks for reading  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>To understand the law of kamma is to realize that we ourselves are responsible for our own happiness and our own misery</strong>. We are the <span style="color: olive;">architects</span> of our kamma. Buddhism explains that man has every possibility to mould his own kamma and thereby influence the direction of his life. On the other hand, a man is not a complete prisoner for his own actions; he is not a slave of his kamma. Nor is man mere machine that automatically releases instinctive forces that enslave him. Nor is man mere a product of nature.<br><br><strong>Man has within himself the strength and the ability to change his kamma</strong>. <span style="color: olive;">His mind is mightier than his kamma and so the law of kamma can be made to serve him.</span> Man does not have to give up his hope and effort in order to surrender himself to his own kammic force. To off-set the reaction of his bad kamma that he has accumulated previously, he has to do more meritorious deeds and to purify his mind rather than by praying, worshipping, performing rites or torturing his physical body in order to overcome his karmic effects.<br><br>Therefore, man can overcome the effect of his evil deeds if he acts wisely by leading a noble life. Man must use the material with which he is endowed to promote his ideal. <span style="color: olive;">The cards in the game of life are within us.</span> We do not select them. They are traced to our past kamma; but we can call as we please, do what suits us and as we play, we either gain or lose.<strong> Kamma is equated to the action of men</strong>. This action also creates some karmic results.<br><br><img src="http://sg.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9FJqh4iPLNErjkBUggu4gt./SIG=120vahe7t/EXP=1152683426/**http%3a//www.markings.bc.ca/spirit/buddha1.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large">'There is no place to hide in order to escape from kammic results.Â’ </span></span></span><br><br><strong>-Buddha<br>Dhammapada 127</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Each and every action carried out without any purposeful intention, cannot become a <strong>Kusala-Kamma (skillful action) or Akusala-Kamma (unskillful action)</strong>. That is why the Buddha interprets kamma as volitional activites. That means, whatever good and bad deeds we commit ourselves without any purposeful intention, are not strong enough to be carried forward to our next life. However, ignorance of the nature of the good and bad effect of the kamma is not an excuse to justify or avoid the karmic results if they were committed intentionally.<br><br>A small child or an ignorant man may commit many evil deeds. Since they commit such deeds with intention to harm or injure, it is difficult to say that they are free form the karmic results. If that child touches a burning iron-rod the heat element does not spare the child without burning his fingers. The karmic energy also works exactly in the same manner. <strong>Karmic energy is unbiased; it is like energy of gravity.</strong> The radical transformations in the characters of Angulimala and Asoka illustrate manÂ’s potential to gain control over his kammic force.<br><br>Although Buddhism says that man can eventually control his kammic force, it does not state that everything is due to kamma. <strong>Buddhism does not ignore the role played by other forces of nature</strong>. According to Buddhism there are five orders or processes of natural laws (niyama) which operate in the physical and mental worlds:<br><br><strong>1. Seasonal laws (utu niyama) physical inorganic order e.g., seasonal phenomena of winds and rains, etc.<br><br>2. The biological law (bija niyama) relating to seasonal changes etc.,<br><br>3. The kammic law (kamma niyama) relating to moral causation or the order of act and result,<br><br>4. Natural phenomena (Dhamma niyama) relating to electrical forces, movement of tides etc., and<br><br>5. Psychological laws (citta niyama) which govern the processes of consciousness.Thus kamma is considered only as one of the five natural laws that account for the diversity in this world.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi neutral_onliner,<br><br>Good reads that you'd posted but I find that the topic is a little misleading. There's no fate to speak of in Buddhism in the first place but rather conditioned will.<br><br>The below is quoted from "All About Buddhism" by Ven S Dhammika<br><br>28  At this point it is important to understand the difference between determining factors and conditioning factors. If we say that our past actions determine our present and that our present actions determine our future, this would mean that our whole life was fixed and predestined, and we would not be free to initiate or change anything. Kamm does not determine us. Our past actions condition our present, which in turn conditions our future, that is to say, our actions have an influence to a greater or lesser degree, and thus there is room to exercise will and initiate change. The Kammic Law therefore is about tendencies rather than inevitable and unchangeable consequences. Thus we can say that Buddhism teachers neither determinism (<strong>niyativada</strong>) nor absolute free-will (<strong>attakiriyavada</strong>), but rather, conditioned will.<br><br>The Law of Kamma conditions three things - whether or not we will be reborn, which of the realms of existence we will be reborn into, and what kind of experience we will have. We will examine each of these three things.</div>

Part of the 5 Skhandas... which are all conditioned phenomena which makes up what one conventionally perceives as an individual self. Volition plants karmic seeds in the 8th consciousness, also known as the storehouse consciousness.</div>
