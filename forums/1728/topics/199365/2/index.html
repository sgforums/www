            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Impartial Energy</strong>:Those who do not believe that there is an energy known as kamma should understand that this <strong>karmic energy is not a byproduct of any particular religion.</strong>.<br><br><strong>This is an existing universal law which has no religious label</strong>. All those who violate this law, have to face the consequences irrespective of their religious beliefs, and those who live in accordance with this law experience peace and happiness in their life. <strong>Therefore, this karmic law is unbiased to each and every person, whether they believe it or not; whether, they have a religion or not. It is like any other existing universal law. </strong><br><br>Please remember that kamma is not the exclusive property of Buddhism. If we understand kamma as a force or a form of energy, then we can discern no beginning. <strong>To ask where is the beginning of kamma is like asking where is the beginning of electricity. Kamma like electricity does not begin. It comes into being under certain conditions</strong>.<br><br>Conventionally we say that the origin of kamma is volition but this is as much conventional as saying that the origin of a river is a mountain top. Like the waves of the ocean that flow into one another, one unit of consciousness into another and this merging of one thought consciousness into another is called the working of kamma. <strong>In short, every living being, according to Buddhism, is an electric current of life that operates on the automatic switch of kamma. </strong><br><br>Kamma being a form a of energy is not found anywhere in this fleeting consciousness or body. Just as mangoes are not stored anywhere in the mango tree but, dependent on certain conditions, they spring into being, so does kamma. <strong>Kamma is like wind or fire. It is not stored up anywhere in the Universe but comes into being under certain conditions. </strong><br></div>

If you fall down from a tree and break your leg, it is not a matter of justice or punishment, but simply the operation of the law of gravity, a natural law which we all are subject to. Likewise, if you eat good food and remain healthy, your health is only natural, not a reward given to you by some supreme being. Whether a supreme being exists or not, you will remain healthy and strong if you treat yourself properly in accordance with the law of nature. Of course, we may refer to the broken leg as a punishment and good health as a reward, but that is just a way of talking. The law of kamma operates in much the same manner, the difference being that it functions within the framework of morality, based on the principle of cause and effect.<br><br></div>

The idea behind, is that since nothing is going to stay in a particular forever, we shouldn't hold attachment, as it will only causes suffering.  Even our own body, we are getting older everyday, our physical appearance will change, there will come to a time where our organs will deteriorate, if we hold attachment to our existing body, we are going to suffer.<br><br>We came to this human realm because of previous life's karma, and we are now creating our karma for our next life.  Of course, some karma will ripen sooner, probably this life.  If it does happen, count yourself really lucky.<br><br>There's a chinese saying that's loosely translate into, you are what you are because of your past life's karma, you will be what you will be because of this life's karma (i'm not good at translation):<br><br><img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/2641/pastlifekarmachinesetextja6.jpg"><br><br>That's my 2 cents worth of thoughts.<br><br>P.S:  I wonder why the norm is always cents and not dollars..</div>
