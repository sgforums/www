              <p>I fully agree with what the text says below concerning what it means to agree to disagree:</p>
              <p>1. We are open to listening to others’ views because we are clear of our own beliefs.</p>
              <p>2. We respect others’ opinions while standing firm with our own values and principles.</p>
              <p>3. We can engage others in dialogue and exchange perspectives without insisting that others accept our point of view.</p>
              <p>4. If others try to influence us to adopt their religion, it is perfectly fine to stand our ground and turn them down.</p>

              <p>Did you guys know that in ancient India, Buddhist scholars had to face stiff competition from Hindu mystics and scholars. Their weapon of proselytizing was dialectical debates. Hindus and Buddhist often debated on the tenets of their faiths. One party would be sitting on the floor upon piles of cushions while the opponent stood to attack in a fiery debate.</p>

              Hello Steveyboy.
                 
              Well, I simply mean God is not bias and the Source is not bias....human being is bias...there is no compulsion in religion....there is no such thing as one true religion for the world.

              <p>huh... were buddhists forced to debate during that time...?? Is there a judge to decide who wins the debate? Seems very subjective... it's the battle of egos anyway</p>
