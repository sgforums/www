                      distinctive and revolutionary about his teachings. Peacocke, who does not shy
                      away from controversy, argues that in some very important ways, later Buddhist
                      schools depart from early core teachings.</span></p>

                      Theravada Buddhism has flourished for centuries. Returning to lay life and his
                      native England, Peacocke went on to receive his Ph.D. in Buddhist studies at the

                      visited with Peacocke near Bristol University in April to discuss what the
                      language of the early Pali and Sanskrit texts tells us about Buddhism today.<strong><br> <br> To what sort of world was the Buddha introducing his teachings? </strong>Fifth-century
                      BCE India witnessed a philosophically rich period, and a time of social,
                      political, and cultural upheaval. It is during this period that we see the
                      transition from tribal republics (<em>ganasanghas</em>) to a centralized power
                      structure presided over by a monarch. The Buddha’s teaching—for example, in the
                      <em>Mahaparanibbana Sutta</em>—is situated within just such a context. At the
                      opening of the sutta we see an emissary of King Ajatasattu, the king of
                      Magadha, attempting to obtain information from the Buddha in order to vanquish
                      the Vajjian federation. Even the Sakyas (the Buddha’s tribe) were not immune
                      from such territorial aggrandizement; they were defeated by the son of King
                      Pasenadi during the Buddha’s own lifetime. There were also many competing
                      religious traditions at the time, and in the early Pali canon, in the Long
                      Discourses of the Buddha (<em>Brahmajala Sutta</em>), we find descriptions of
                      sixty-two types of philosophies. These are considered by the Buddha to be
                      sixty-two instances of wrong view. That’s the world of ideas the Buddha is
                      responding to.<strong><br> <br> What were the dominant beliefs of the time? </strong>The Buddha was responding to
                      two primary strands of thought. You have to bear in mind, though, that there
                      was no such thing as Hinduism as we know it today. Rather, you had the dominant
                      Brahmanical culture—Brahmanism—which was primarily a sacrificial religion,
                      along with the breakaway Upanishadic culture that arose out of it and was
                      eventually reincorporated into the Brahmanical worldview, and you had ascetic
                      Jainism. <br> <strong><br> Can you say something first about Brahmanism? </strong>Brahmanism dealt primarily
                      with propitiating the gods, who were believed to maintain the cosmic order.
                      Everything was believed to be ordered and regulated and it was through
                      sacrifices to the gods that this order was maintained. Through meticulously
                      executed ritual, the Brahmans induced the gods to do everything from ensuring
                      predictable planetary orbits and regular seasons to sustaining the strictly
                      hierarchical social order characteristic of the time. The three classes of Veda
                      (<em>Rig, Sama,</em> and <em>Yajur</em>), which served as the Brahmanical culture’s
                      literary base, are essentially instructions for properly performing rituals
                      that will perpetuate what was thought to be the natural order of things. The
                      defining concept of the Vedas is the notion of cosmic order, <em>rita.</em> So
                      Buddhist thought is in part a reaction to a purely sacrificial and highly
                      ritualistic culture. In the early canon you often find critical mention of
                      ritual. <br> <br> <strong>Can you give an example? </strong>A number of examples are scattered throughout
                      the Pali Canon. In the <em>Kutadanta Sutta,</em> the Buddha subverts the notion
                      of literal animal sacrifice by claiming that true sacrifice is the performance
                      of generosity, taking refuge or adhering to the five precepts. In another
                      instance, in the <em>Sigalaka Sutta,</em> the Buddha comes across a young Brahmin
                      named Sigalaka ritualistically paying homage to the six directions as a way of
                      expressing honor, sacredness, and reverence. During the discourse the Buddha,
                      as in the previous example, gets the Brahmin to see that the true way to
                      express these things is through adherence to the precepts and generally
                      behaving in an ethical manner. The Buddha in both cases reveals his practical
                      bias. He does not concern himself with what he considers empty and pointless ritual.
                      And he demonstrates his rhetorical brilliance by using the very customs and
                      language of the dominant culture he critiques to subvert it.<br> <br> <strong>Can you give an example of how he does that?</strong> There’s hardly a term the
                      Buddha uses that’s not actually derived from a pre-Buddhist context. The Buddha
                      literally takes the religious language of the Brahmins and the Jains and
                      deconstructs and redefines it for his own purposes. Basically, he’s hijacking
                      the language and customs of the dominant religions—whether that of the ascetic
                      Jains, the ritualistic Brahmins, or the philosophers and mystics of the
                      Upanishads—to introduce an entirely new body of ideas. Take, for instance, the
                      three ritual household fires of the Indian home. In Buddhism, they are no
                      longer the sacred fires one must keep continuously lit in order to maintain
                      cosmic and social order; rather, they become the fires of anger, greed, and
                      delusion—the “three poisons” we are enjoined to extinguish. <em>Upadana,</em> or
                      the “fuel” used to keep the fires burning, becomes in Buddhism the stuff that
                      fuels <em>samsara,</em> the world of suffering, that is, “attachment” or
                      “clinging.” <br> <strong><br> So his method was to critique the existing culture of the time by turning the
                      language of that culture on itself?</strong> That’s exactly right. He very cleverly
                      hijacks virtually all of their language —and not just that of the Brahmanical
                      culture but also that of the Jains. For example, take a term like <em>asava.</em> For the Jains the term means “influx” and refers to that which weighs down the
                      soul and keeps it bound to the cycle of rebirth. However, for the Buddha the
                      term has the connotation of something that flows out of us, namely, ignorance,
                      sensual desire, and craving for continued existence. It is these things, from
                      the Buddha’s point of view, that keep the individual bound to samsara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>According to the British scholar Richard Gombrich, the
                      Buddhist Middle Way is in fact the middle way between highly materialistic
                      Brahmanism and excessively ascetic Jainism. It’s not just asceticism in general
                      that the Buddha is reacting to, it’s the extreme asceticism primarily
                      associated with the Jains; and likewise, the household life and the strict and
                      materialistic rituals of the Brahmins. Somewhere in between the two lies the
                      Middle Way of the Buddha’s teachings. <br> <br> <strong>What Brahmanism and the Upanishads had in common with Jainism was a belief
                      in an eternal soul, while the Buddha’s universal tenets of anatta and
                      anicca—“not-self” and “impermanence”—are a radical rejection of this belief.
                      Can you say something about this? </strong>All three of those Indian traditions
                      speak of an unchanging self or soul. The Buddha’s teaching is highly radical in
                      its break with essentialist thinking, which usually conceives of the “real” as
                      that which does not change. The Buddha’s view was that absolutely <em>everything</em> was changing and therefore the self was not exempt. As a result, Buddhist
                      thinking conceives of the self as process rather than as a fixed an immutable
                      essence. <br> <strong><br> How, then, would you look at the Brahmanical goal or the Upanishadic goal of
                      religious activity versus the Buddhist goal? </strong>The goal of Buddhist practice
                      can be seen as radically different from that of Brahmanical or Upanishadic
                      thought. Brahmanical thought had an excessive emphasis on ritualism and
                      hierarchy focused on the maintenance of order both human and divine. And the
                      Upanishads concentrated on the realization of the lack of differentiation
                      between <em>brahman</em> and <em>atman</em>—the essence of all things and the
                      individual self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The Buddha is not looking outside of ourselves for
                      anything, for any supports. In the <em>Mahaparinibbana Sutta</em> he instructs us
                      to be lamps unto ourselves and insists that everything we need to know can be
                      found within “this fathom-long carcass.” This latter suggestion is the Buddha
                      once again alluding to Brahmanical beliefs, one in which the entire cosmos, and
                      everything contained within it, is represented in the form of the male body. In
                      fact, this could be seen as a direct reference to the <em>Brihadaranyaka
                      Upanishad,</em> where it is claimed that in the beginning the whole world was the
                      self in the shape of a person. However, the Buddha is really not looking to
                      external elements, whether metaphysical or sacrificial, as a way of life. His
                      primary focus is on our internal experience and ethical activity. This is a
                      real break from Brahmanical culture. <br> <strong><br> Brahmanical culture did not have an ethical focus? </strong>The focus for
                      Brahmanical culture was duty, and again, the proper performance of ritual. The
                      Buddha’s focus was volition, intentional motivation. Everything hangs on
                      motivation and understanding as clearly as possible the individual’s own
                      motivation underlying all action. For the Brahmin, karma was created by how one
                      performed one’s duties and executed ritual; for the Buddha, intention drove
                      karma. The Brahmins never take the step into ethics that the Buddha did. <br> <br> <strong>While Brahmanical culture exhibited a literalist bent—ritual had to be
                      executed just to fuel nature’s processes both above and below—in the thought of
                      the Upanishads we find a philosophy that is as sophisticated as any. What would
                      be a fundamental distinction between it and the Buddha’s method of inquiry at
                      the time?</strong> I distinguish the two traditions by the way they ask a question.
                      One way is metaphysical, which is precisely what the Buddha rejects: It is to
                      ask what something is. Running throughout the Upanishads is the question, <em>What
                      is the self? And what is the true nature of that self?</em> And you basically
                      end up with an essentialist answer to that question: Atman is the universally
                      abiding and unchanging self that underlies and sustains all things; <em>atman </em>is
                      the <em>real self.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 18.7pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>It’s like
                      asking if there a God or not. It leads you into the same essentialist trap. </span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>It does.
                      By asking what is the nature of anything, you’re going to end up an
                      essentialist if you answer the question. I make a comparison to Socrates in
                      ancient Greek society. Socrates asks, “What is the good?” or “What is justice?”
                      You might answer with an example, and Socrates will reply, “You’ve just given me
                      an example. You haven’t told me what it <em>is,</em> what makes this example of
                      the good or of justice <em>good </em>or <em>just.</em>” <br> <strong><br> So Socrates, too, in the same way, is asking for essence. </strong>Yes, and because
                      he is ethically inclined, he asks, what is the good? Plato then takes it
                      further, to the metaphysical: The essence of the good exists in the realm of
                      the ideal, the realm of forms. The rest, the world of phenomena, is simply an
                      imitation of the real thing, the essential thing that abides in an unchanging
                      metaphysical reality. </span></p>

                      is deterministic and eternalistic, and the other, nihilistic. So the Buddha is
                      asking not so much <em>what</em> as <em>how.</em></span></p>

                      should add that I feel “not-self”—anatta—is actually a much-misunderstood
                      teaching. The Buddha is not saying that there is no self, which is an idea that
                      I think in a Western context can be extremely dangerous. <br> <br> <strong>Why? </strong>Because it’s nihilistic. The Buddha himself says it’s better to
                      teach self than to teach annihilationism; given the choice, it’s better to
                      teach that there is something because this leads at least to some kind of
                      ethical responsibility. I think in our Western culture sometimes people have a
                      very fragile notion of what the self is anyway, so to come along and tell them
                      there’s no self could very destructive. <br> <br> <strong>So from a phenomenological point of view, an early Buddhist point of view,
                      how would “not self”—the term you prefer—be distinguished from “no-self”? </strong>It’s
                      basically a question of the phenomenon that we are labeling “self.” What we can
                      ask is: How does it operate? How does it work? The most primary analysis anyone
                      gives in Buddhism is to describe the self in terms of the five <em>khandhas</em>—the
                      “heaps,” or “aggregates,” in Pali—the components of self. Each heap, or
                      aggregate, is a process—that is, it is not fixed but is changing. In order for
                      self to arise, it must include form, sensation, perception, mental formations,
                      and consciousness. It is upon these five processes that the label of self is
                      affixed. To take a couple of examples: Form, which includes all of the physical
                      processes of the individual, is not-self because it is not under our control.
                      Likewise, perception, which includes all our faculties of discrimination,
                      together with the capacity of memory, is also not-self. This is because memory
                      is extremely partial, in that we may remember events from many years ago but
                      not recall what we did yesterday. With the onset of degenerative brain disease,
                      our capacity to remember becomes severely impaired, with the result that we may
                      even forget who we are! Similar arguments apply to the other <em>khandhas.</em> The self, therefore, according to this view, exists as a set of interrelated
                      processes rather than as an unchanging thing; so rather than try to find an
                      essence, the Buddha chooses to simply describe a phenomenon, avoiding the
                      essentialist trap. <br> <br> <strong>The Buddha describes the self as a composite of the khandhas; how does he
                      describe the world of which that self is a part?</strong> Our everyday world of
                      suffering—<em>samsara</em>—is described in terms of the mechanism that drives it:
                      dependent origination (<em>paticcasamuppada,</em> in Pali), which is depicted
                      most commonly as the Wheel of Life. <br> <br> <strong>How was this different from prevailing ideas of the Buddha’s day? </strong>Well,
                      take the Upanishads. Basically, the Buddha’s hijacking the language again.
                      Ultimately, they all come down to the idea that really everything is dependent
                      on something that’s outside of time and space: <em>brahman.</em> This direction
                      of thought later becomes Advaita Vedanta—the nondual school. Advaita is
                      basically an interpretation of the Upanishads offered by the Hindu thinker
                      Shankara. In his view, <em>brahman</em> and <em>atman</em> are essentially the same
                      thing—the term <em>advaita</em> literally means “not-two.” The pluralistic world
                      offered up to perception, according to Shankara, is ultimately an illusion (<em>maya</em>).
                      Only one thing really exists, and that is <em>brahman;</em> and <em>brahman</em> cannot depend on anything else for existence and also cannot change. But for
                      the Buddha, there is nothing that arises <em>ex nihilo,</em> out of nothing.
                      Everything arises out of previous causes and conditions, and the mechanism for
                      this is dependent origination: out of this, that arises. This ceasing, that
                      ceases. You’ve got this complex sense of, again, phenomenology, which is, the
                      Buddha explained, our world with its predominant feeling tone: <em>dukkha,</em> suffering. However, dukkha also arises out of causes and conditions, and with
                      the discernment of the causes and their elimination, <em>dukkha</em> will cease.
                      And that is Buddhism’s fundamental psychological element.<br> <strong><br> You’ve suggested in some of your lectures that there is a strong resistance to
                      Buddhist teachings of not-self even within the Buddhist traditions themselves,
                      that there is sometimes an irresistible temptation to essentialize phenomena.
                      Or, as you might say, to “self.” Where do you see this impulse within Buddhism?</strong> I see it in the formation of certain Mahayana ideas, particularly later ideas,
                      when, for example, Buddhism arrives in China, and in Tibet. In some cases I see
                      them almost smuggling the atman in through the back door somehow. For example,
                      if you talk about Cittamatra philosophy, then you’re talking about the <em>alaya
                      vijnana,</em> or “store of consciousness.” In some interpretations this sounds
                      very much like a self. When you talk about, say, <em>rigpa,</em> the notion of
                      pristine awareness—awareness without an object, the only true knower—it sounds
                      very much like Advaita, which defines <em>brahman</em> as pure consciousness and
                      the only knower. <br> <strong><br> Might this appear already in the Theravada tradition, this tendency?</strong> I
                      think there can be a tendency in the Theravada to make things more orthodox, of
                      making Buddhism much more doctrinal. This takes the form of a certain
                      literalism about the teachings, the interpretation of metaphors in a literal
                      manner, for example. Certain ideas get solidified, as can happen with an idea
                      like rebirth. <br> <br> <strong>What do you mean by “get solidified”? What is the danger of taking the
                      teachings literally?</strong> I’m inclined to wonder how, in a Western context, we
                      can make the best pragmatic use of the Buddha’s ideas, understanding them as
                      something more than a doctrinal staple. According to many, for instance, you
                      have to believe in rebirth to be a Buddhist. But there’s a tension here: Buddha
                      exhorts us to investigate, yet rebirth is quite clearly something we can’t
                      investigate. So what might it mean outside of its literal truth? How might we
                      apply the ideas in a practical and meaningful way that makes our lives better
                      and helps us to see things more clearly as they are? It is this practical
                      dimension, based on both a historical and a phenomenological approach to the
                      teachings, that I bring to my dharma teaching. This approach does not mean
                      ignoring what the traditions say; it means examining what they have to say in
                      the light of a close reading of the texts. We have to remember that the
                      historical forms of Buddhism have all become “traditions,” and that these
                      traditions, with their viewpoints, have often gone unquestioned. Such
                      unquestioning acceptance seems to me diminish the challenging nature and
                      dynamism of the Buddha’s teaching.<br> </span></p>
