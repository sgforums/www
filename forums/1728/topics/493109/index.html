              Guide For Traveling the World</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">12/07/2016 Ella Jameson The
              Huffington Post </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For backpackers, long-term travellers, or anyone who travels
              for work, sampling new local cuisines is one of the things to look forward to
              most. Who wouldn’t be enthusiastic about to trying traditional tacos in Mexico,
              sampling steaming-hot street food in Southeast Asia, or digging into a bowl of
              fresh spaghetti in Italy?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But if you don’t eat meat or fish, things can be trickier.
              Though the vegetarian movement is growing across the world, in many places
              meals still centre on meat, and even the concept of vegetarianism can be met
              with a blank look. It isn’t easy for vegetarians to stay healthy on the road,
              particularly if you’re on a backpacker’s budget. Often, veggie-friendly
              restaurants hike their prices up, because they know vegetarian tourists will
              pay for a good meal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But it doesn’t have to be so difficult. If you’re a committed
              vegetarian and avid traveller, here’s how to stay healthy while traveling the
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">CHOOSE YOUR
              DESTINATIONS WISELY</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Admittedly, this isn’t always something you can control - if
              you travel for work you often don’t get a say where you’re sent. But if you’re
              traveling independently, you have the luxury of choosing destinations where Vegetarians
              are spoilt for choice - and sometimes these aren’t the countries you expect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Take Belgium, for example. While it’s not exactly known for
              being a veggie-friendly country, it’s also home to the city with the largest
              number of vegetarians per capita: Ghent. This trailblazing town is also home to
              ‘Donderdag Veggiedag’ - Meat Free Thursdays, an initiative created to tackle
              growing obesity and greenhouse gas emissions. This soon spread throughout the
              city, and vegetarian street maps are handed out to visitors to Ghent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Away from Europe, there are vegetarian hotspots across the
              globe. India is quite simply a vegetarian’s dream: around a third of people
              here are vegetarian, and most restaurants have clearly marked meat-free meals.
              In Southeast Asia, the Buddhist culture that pervades Thailand means vegetarian
              meals are plentiful, and because dairy is rarely used vegans will also be in
              their element. In the Middle East, Israel offers a mouth-watering array of
              vegetarian treats, from pita bread and hummus to falafel to baba ganoush.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Do your research before you go and consider what meat-free
              food options will be easily available. Bear in mind that some South American
              countries are notoriously bad for vegetarians.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">DON’T BE SCARED TO
              SAMPLE STREET FOOD</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many vegetarians I’ve spoken to shun street food, believing
              that it’s usually meat-orientated and unhealthy. While this is often the case
              (particularly in the U.S.), in many countries the majority of street-food is in
              fact vegetarian by default. Meat is universally expensive, and the point of
              street food is usually that it’s quick and cheap.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Take Guatemala, for example. This country is the darling of
              backpackers across the globe and offers a wide-array of healthy and delicious
              vegetarian street food. This is starkly contrasted against its meat-loving
              neighbours - Mexican street food is infrequently vegetarian and in other
              Central American countries, meat makes an appearance at most street food
              stalls. In Guatemala, you can enjoy a whole array of vegetarian street food,
              from empanadas to rellenitos to salads and soups.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">IF IN DOUBT, ASK</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Though even the idea of vegetarian food is still alien in
              some cultures, most people will be happy to help you out if you ask. The local
              diet in much of Central America is known to revolve around simple meals of meat
              or fish with rice, beans, and vegetables. Take Costa Rica, for example, where
              the traditional meal of ‘casado’ consists of rice, beans, plantains, salad and
              some meat. One vegetarian traveler described how, on explaining she was
              vegetarian (”soy vegetariana” in Spanish), the restaurant staff happily
              replaced the customary meat with grilled cheese.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This is a great way to stay healthy in Central and South
              America, as due to their reliance on beans these meals provide vegetarians with
              enough protein. Bear in mind that ‘vegetarian’ can mean something else in other
              countries: it can refer to someone who doesn’t eat red meat but does eat
              chicken and fish. In Thailand, the term “vegetarian food” often isn’t
              understood unless you’re in touristy hubs, and asking for just vegetables -
              “pak” - is sometimes inferred as asking for pork. If you’re unsure, refer to
              yourself as a Buddhist, and it’ll be instantly understood that you don’t eat
              any meat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
              COOK</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cooking for yourself rather than eating out in a foreign
              country can seem like an admission of failure for vegetarians, especially if
              you’re someone who excitedly looks forward to trying new food. But it doesn’t
              have to be that way. Head to a local market and pick up some of the oft-used
              ingredients there, and make a vegetarian version of one of the national dishes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For example, you don’t have to buy fish to make a delicious
              ceviche; vegetarian ceviche is becoming a thing, and the blend of fresh
              vegetables with citrus makes an exceptionally healthy as well as a delicious
              meal. If you’re in Asia, replace the meat or fish in dishes with extra veg or
              tofu; a few tweaks to the traditional Tom Yum recipe will result in a wonderful
              vegetarian alternative that’s packed with vitamins. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In addition to helping you find healthy, delicious and varied
              vegetarian meals, traversing vibrant and bustling local markets is one of the
              best ways to understand a new culture. Buying fresh fruit and vegetables will
              always be cheap and healthy, and whether you’re on a budget or not, is a great
              way of ensuring you’re getting your five-a-day. Be brave and imaginative, and
              you may find yourself with a new understanding of a country’s culture - as well
              as a lasting appreciation of their cuisine.</span></p>
