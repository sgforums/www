            <div class='col-md body'>sui la. so a soul is not a soul. but is a conscious, that was influenced by the actions of another.. anyways, a person can remember his past lives through hypnosis, but he does not have memories of his past lives because they don't exist even though he can remember.. but actually the memories are there but he cannot remember because it was defiled, or rather garbage is blocking it. so there is nothing pernament, so a person has no past incarnation but has a past concious, but since he rebirth, its not the same concious so should be blank but karma dictates his present life, so there is memory of a past existence but not an existence that is of an existence, but a past concious that has memory that does not exist but could be retrieved through hypnosis somehow from emptiness. so the current concious does not exist, as it existed 5 minutes ago due to the changing state of time, so 5 minutes ago don't exist now, so it was being defiled into memory and this memory shouldn't exist but could be remembered and become garbage for the next concious after rebirth, yet not the same as the current one but a completely new concious even though karma dictates its life which only can be reflected in the next rebirth, which has no physical relations with the past life, but there is no past life, so its a past concious..<br><br></div>
