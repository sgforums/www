You see a 'waterfall', but when you examine further, you cannot find a truly existing 'waterfall' that never changes. 'It' changes every moment, yet 'it' is there. Actually there is no one truly existing unchanging 'waterfall' that exists there; there is only <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">continous flowing</span></strong>, forming the illusion of a 'truly existing entity called ' waterfall'.<br><br>Because there is continuity, we mistakenly think that there is a thing called "waterfall" truly existing there.<br><br>Similarly, because there is continuity in our lives from moment to moment and from live to live, we mistakenly think that there is such a thing called a "real me" truly existing and undergoing rebirth.<br><br>In the Milinda Panha, Ven Nagasena gave excellent replies to questions by King Milinda.<br>(http://web.singnet.com.sg/~rjp31831/nagasena.htm#ID)<br><br><span class="small"></span><br><br>Just as the flame of a candle. At moment 1, the 'flame1' is a production of the candle, the oil, the wick, the oxygen etc at moment 1.<br><br>At moment 2, the 'flame2' is the production of the candle oil wick etc at moment 2.<br><br>At moment 3, the 'flame3' is the production of those conditions at moment 3.<br><br>Each of these conditions are changing at every instant. Eg. the wick is shortening, the oil is depleting, the candle's mixture of elements have changed. So since these conditions have changed, the 'flames' have also changed.<br><br>Therefore, there is no one 'flame' existing throughout the night. There is only a succession of dependently arisen 'flames', which instantaneously arise and simultaneously cease, in a continuous fashion.<br><br>... flame 1 - flame 2 - flame 3 - flame 4 - ...<br><br>This is analogous to our experience of 'self'.<br><br>There appears to be a 'wanderer' that existed since age 1 till age 20.<br><br>However, 'age 1 wanderer' liked toys and 'age 20 wanderer' liked books.<br>'age 1 wanderer' had small hands while 'age 20 wanderer' has big hands.<br>'age 5 wanderer' wanted to be a teacher while 'age 20 wanderer' hated teaching.<br><br>now which is the real 'wanderer'?<br><br>while 'wanderer' recalls a continuity of growth from 'wanderer 1' to 'wanderer 20' and so on... there is no one truly existing 'wanderer' that grew up.<br><br>from wanderer 1 to wanderer 20, all the instantaneous moments of the 'wanderers' are merely dependently arisen, based on the coming together and falling apart of temporary causes and conditions. These causes and conditions, sometimes also known as karma, provide the force that continually brings about birth-death... This forms the illusion of a 'self' undergoing rebirth.<br><br>Your question of why some people can remember their past lives - it's because even though there is no 'self' truly existing, there is continuity due to the continuous occurrence of karma. Under particular circumstances, with the right conditions, people are able to have a glimpse of what happened in 'their' past lives.<br><br>It is just like when you sleep last night and you woke up this morning, you remember what happened to you last night. However, if you analyse the 'you' yesterday and the 'you' today, you realize that there is no real 'you' that slept through the night and woke up in the day, but there is a continuity of a dependently arisen temporary 'you before sleep' to the dependently arisen temporary 'you while sleeping' to the dependently arisen temporary 'you awake'.<br><br>*Phew* very lengthy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Hope it helps to clarify and doesn't create even more confusion.<br><br>This is a very impt qn in Buddhism.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>III.  The Yogacara View of the Role and Nature of Consciousness</strong><br><br>A.      In addition to 6 senses of early Buddhism (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind), Yogacara adds two: manas (a kind of subliminal consciousness) and the alaya ( a kind of non-conscious mind); this is the "storehouse consciousness."<br><br>B.  The role of the Alaya-consciousness: when a person performs an action, karmic traces are left in the alaya.  These traces are "seeds" that reproduce over time.  Memories also are stored here as seeds.  The result is a continuity of consciousnness and personality over time and beyond death into new births.  The alaya also preserves the continuity of consciousness during nonconscious states such as sleep.<br><br>C.  The alaya consciousness also contains "pure" seeds, the source of religious striving. The deepest level of alaya consciousness goes beyond individuality to a universal reality "within" all beings.<br><br>D.      All forms of individual consciousness (the six sense fields plus manas -- see A above) are projected from the alaya.  This "projection" is thus determined by our past karma that helps shape our consciousness and is equivalent to our "construction" of the world.<br><br>E.      Mechanics of "world-construction": Within the alaya, karmic seeds are matured through attachments to mental constructions.  The seeds then ripen in the flow of mental experience (6 fields + manas).  The flow of experience is split (by manas) into subject and object (an illusory distinction reinforced by language.  The subject is taken to be real permanent "I."  This "I delusion" causes attachment and more planting of karmic seeds leading to rebirth.<br><br>-----<br><br>Note: the 7th Consciousness is the Manas consciousness and is the consciousness of dualism and ego. The 7th Consciousness takes the 8th Consciousness - alaya/storehouse to be its 'self' and conventionally speaking, the 8th consciousness is 'yourself' on the karmic level. It is the storehouse of your entire history, memories, karmic seeds. During dreams our 7th consciousness sorts of replay the videotapes within our 8th consciousness. The 7th Consciousness also becomes an Antarabhava (zhong ying shen) after death and takes rebirth due to the ripening of the karmic seeds in the 8th Consciousness. One becomes enlightened by eliminating, transmuting the 7th Consciousness into pure awareness.<br><br>Although Alaya Consciousness is only found in Mahayana/Vajrayana Buddhism, it is actually also in Theravada Buddhism and one needs to look deeper into the scriptures to see it.

Reflections of energy being transform from one to one or multipules I guess. Wax burn can transform into heat, light &amp; air movement. 1 type of material having release it's energy, can be transformed into different energy. There is no self form of wax.<br><br>From deep meditations, Karma is felt like wind blowing &amp; blowing. As wind is air only but wind have a lot more energy then air alone. No doubt we can feel both wind &amp; air. We are always in wind &amp; air. We ourself induce some energy out of nothing, like waving our hands. We feel some air &amp; different things. That's all. Wind do not have meaning, we just feel it.<br><br>I feel karma much more like energy. Like we use heat energy to melt metals to make a car. With use of energy we can make things. Ourselfs are constantly using many kinds of energy to go around. We are physically inseparatable from this world. Dharma don't leave the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a conventional point of view, it is.  If we feel, see, hear and think in terms of Â‘entityÂ’, then it seems that there is a Â‘selfÂ’ leaving the body.  This is because all along, we experience all phenomenon appearances as Â‘solid thingsÂ’ existing independently.  Such conventional mode of comprehending our meditative experiences masked the true character of these experiences.<br><br>If we treat consciousness to be an atomic-like-particle residing in our body somewhere, then we are making it as a self too.  Do not do that.  The true character of Consciousness is not a thing, it does not enter, leave, reside within or outside the body.  Clear Luminosity is bonded by karmic propensities, causes and conditions.  There is no need for a place Â‘withinÂ’.  Yes, there is a Â‘mental phenomenonÂ’ arising but the sensation of Â‘enteringÂ’ and Â‘leavingÂ’ is the result of associating it with a Â‘selfÂ’.  Just like it is illusionary to see a Â‘selfÂ’ succeeding from moment to moment, an Â‘entranceÂ’ and Â‘exitÂ’ is equally illusionary.<br><br>Mystical experiences are extremely crucial during the journey of enlightenment.  Do not discard them unwisely but assign them correct places.  These experiences loosen karmic bonds that latent deep down in our consciousness where it is almost impossible to break through ordinary means.  It is an essential condition for the awakening of penetrating insight.  The main different between non Buddhist and Buddhist practitioners is that transcendental and mystical experiences are not molded into a Â‘selfÂ’ but correctly understood and purified with the wisdom of emptiness.  This applies true to the Luminous Clarity Knowingness that is non-dual, it is not wrongly personified into Brahman.  In perfect clarity, there are no praises for radiance bright, only the Dharma is in sight.  The wisdom of emptiness is so deep and profound that even if one has entered the realm of non-dual, he/she will still not be able to grasp its essence in full. This is the wisdom of the Blessed One.

This is the resultant terminal energy generated by the volitional activities of the past. Science teaches us that energy is indestructible but that it can be transmuted into other forms of energy. Why then cannot these powerful energies of the past Kamma, impelled as they are by the pulsation of craving and motivated as they are by the will-to-live, continue to exert their potent influences albeit in some other manner and in some other sphere? What is it that travels from one existence to another, you may ask. Do activities (Kammic energies) travel or do their resultant forces travel? Or does consciousness itself travel?<br><br>The answer is an emphatic, "No." None of these travel, but the Kammic energy of actions performed is a tremendous force or power which can make its influence felt and to effect this influence, distance is no bar. Distance is never a bar to Kammic energies making themselves felt. In the Maha-tanha-sankhaya Sutta of Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha strongly reprimanded the bhikkhu Sati for declaring as the Buddha's teachings that viÃ±Ã±ana or consciousness travels from existence to existence. "Foolish man," said the Buddha, "has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a figure of speech by me saying, 'apart from conditions there is no origination of consciousness'?" No physical contact is necessary for mind to influence matter. Sir William Crooke, in his Edinburgh lectures on mental science has said, "It has also been proved by experiment that by an act of will the mind can cause objects such as metal levers to move."</span><br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratna/wheel102.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratna/wheel102.html</a><br><br>On the nature of consciousness .... according to Yogacara:<br><br>it is the 7th Consciousness that perceives a dualism and self apart from all other phenomena, thus dividing 'inner and outer' and creating 'entering and leaving', thus creating an antarabhava even after we died. So illusion is the cause of the samsaric cycle. If one can transmute this 7th consciousness into awareness, at one's death one can enter the 'ji guang jing tu' (in pure land terms) or the clear light (tibetan terms)</div>
