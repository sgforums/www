              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              am struck by the way many of us hold the dharma to a strict interpretation of
              the suttas, as if Buddhism could be conveyed by only one possible translation
              and intention. When we have questions, many of us look to the Pali scholars for
              the derivation of a phrase or word, seeking its exact meaning, and we often confine
              our own practice to that explicit definition, even if the suggested wording
              runs counter to our insights. We must be careful not to know too much or
              interpret too precisely what the Buddha meant, because that intellectual
              knowing may distract us from the realization of his message and leave little
              room to probe the depth of his teaching in personally meaningful ways. If we
              look upon the suttas with a little more ease, the foundation of his teaching
              clearly emerges and the mystery of his message invites our own exploration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              more than 2,500 years, including 500 years of oral tradition, the suttas have
              been distilled down to the bare essentials to facilitate communication and
              deliverance. Much must be missing from the actual teaching delivered so long
              ago and, perhaps more importantly, must have been embellished and distorted
              along the way. I believe that we can rejuvenate the suttas and infuse them with
              renewed life through our own insights and modern metaphors. When we look at
              what is implied rather than what is strictly written, a plethora of meanings
              and purposes emerges—the sutta suddenly radiates out in breadth and extends
              itself into the farthest reaches of our lives. But at this point of expansion,
              a call of restraint must be voiced. Unless our implied translations are
              contained by our insights and held within the fundamental framework presented
              by the Buddha, we could quickly cast an unintentional veil of ignorance over
              the basic teaching of the Four Noble Truths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Undisputed
              is the essential understanding that the Buddha’s teaching moves us from a
              contracted, isolated entity called “me” to the freedom and interdependence of
              our empty and selfless nature, free of suffering. We could say that the
              Buddha’s teaching moves along a continuum from suffering to the end of
              suffering or from belief in self to the certainty of emptiness. We suffer
              because we imagine that reality holds options that it does not (Second Noble
              Truth), and we then infuse energy into those mental choices (attachment),
              ultimately resisting what is and creating dissatisfaction as a result (First
              Noble Truth). All this is done within our thoughts as the thinking mind
              embellishes the images of our fantasies and creates alternative stories and
              possibilities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Knowing
              the nature of our thinking mind and taking into account the resolution of
              suffering, which is to abide fully with things as they are (Third Noble Truth),
              we could then say that Buddhism moves us from the trance of thought (desire) to
              stillness (end of desire), and that the sacred is that which is not contained
              by thought and therefore unconditioned (nibbana). Our practice then should
              resolve the compulsion to think and ultimately lead us into deeper quietude.
              Notice that this is a different wording of the original continuum from
              suffering to the end of suffering, but that it is still very much aligned with
              the Buddha’s teaching. There are any number of continuums that establish a
              clear and wise view and direction for the dharma and fully support the Buddha’s
              message. The important point is that whatever continuum we choose, it must be
              consistent with the framework of the teaching and uniformly applied throughout
              our training.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              that we have imposed some limits on our “implied dharma,” let us have some fun
              and take a single paragraph from the Satipatthana Sutta to demonstrate how we
              can expand the meaning and intention of this sutta while staying within the
              Buddha’s orientation and direction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Furthermore,
              when going forward and returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking
              toward and looking away… when bending and extending his limbs…when carrying his
              outer cloak, his upper robe, and his bowl…when eating, drinking, chewing, and
              savoring…when urinating and defecating… when walking, standing, sitting,
              falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, he makes himself
              fully alert. —Majjhima Nikaya 10</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Satipatthana Sutta is held in high esteem as the application of the foundations
              of mindfulness meditation. In the above paragraph the Buddha seems to be
              encouraging us to move our mindfulness into a full embrace of life. He seems to
              imply that we should open the practice to the “full catastrophe” of life
              without any spiritual protection. By reference he does not leave any behavior
              out of being “fully alert,” and therefore does not leave any of life behind. We
              could infer that the Buddha is not drawing any distinction between the
              spiritual and secular worlds. In fact, the distinction between the spiritual
              and the secular is created by thought—and because the continuum we have set for
              ourselves is to move from thought to stillness (suffering to the end of
              suffering), this distinction must be removed if we are to become quieter and
              move forward within that continuum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              passage further implies that we can recover the sacred in the most remote areas
              of our lives, in the midst of difficulty and dissatisfaction, loneliness and
              despair. The Buddha seems to be encouraging us to embody our entire life of
              work, family, and relationship without spiritually prioritizing any activity,
              and, by inference, seems to be teaching that awakening is immediately
              accessible within these activities. Spiritual growth becomes abundantly
              available and is no longer associated exclusively with any particular
              presentation or form. We are to harbor no defense, seek no shelter, and avoid
              no conflict for the resolution of our freedom. It is here in the middle of our
              total involvement that this alchemy of spirit can best be engaged, and we find
              everything we need immediately before us within the circumstances and
              conditions we long begrudged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No
              longer leaning toward one form of life (attachment) and away from another
              (aversion) allows psychic energy to flow from our imagination into reality and
              transforms our ordinary existence into the sacred. Suddenly the Buddha is found
              not only in special environments or practices but within all activities,
              reactions, thoughts, and emotional responses, right where we are. Nothing is
              outside of the present moment because no boundary is drawn to separate the
              present from the past. The message of the Buddha is equally relevant in all
              locations and in all times. If we move to escape this environment for a better
              spiritual setting, we will be attempting to think our way out of the place we
              are in, and we will continue to suffer. With increased sensitivity to all areas
              of our suffering, we immediately feel the contraction of self when it arises
              and release the accompanying narrative to remain aligned within the continuum
              toward stillness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“He makes himself fully alert” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              me, the sutta’s phrase “he makes himself fully alert” stands out as needing our
              consideration. Here I would suggest that our insights trump translations when
              there is incompatibility between the two. From my practice I know the
              limitations of trying to make myself “fully alert.” In this selected paragraph
              of theSatipatthana Sutta the Buddha unfurls a seemingly endless list of
              activities requiring our mindfulness. Try maintaining mindfulness, given his
              implied admonition to be fully awake to all experiences equally. If we define
              mindfulness as selectively pairing an experience with our attention, this
              simply cannot be done. However, if the sense of self is stilled for a moment,
              “fully alert” means something quite different than self-engaged mindfulness. In
              the absence of a watcher, awareness emerges fully, and easily handles the task
              of inclusiveness. The key understanding is that the sense of self did not “make
              this happen” and therefore “I” cannot make myself “fully alert.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              would suggest that the implication of this passage is to guide the practitioner
              away from mindfulness toward awareness. Through much of the early training of
              insight meditation, to “be mindful” is the instruction of choice. Most of our
              spiritual effort goes into trying to remember to be mindful throughout the day.
              A constant theme of remembering and forgetting plays forth through most of the
              early years of practice, and here the image of a pump comes to mind. The effort
              needed to be mindful is like the burden of pumping water; when the effort of
              pumping stops, so does the water. A strong sense of despondency can accompany
              this effort because it is impossible for us to continuously remember anything.
              Though this may be a difficult insight, it is actually an important discovery
              if we intend to step out of the “doing” of practice and partake in the freedom
              within awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              constant inquiry among meditators is how to maintain awareness, but the
              question is being considered from the wrong end of the suffering continuum. The
              anxiety associated with the continuation of awareness is suffering, and
              becoming more worried about how we practice does not move us in a wise
              direction. We can begin to see how our personal struggle to be mindful is
              misplaced when we observe the sense of self arising within our effort to
              maintain mindfulness. The harder we try in this, the more forgetful we become.
              Since the sense of self is the embodiment of the absence of awareness,
              forgetting to observe is inevitable as we try harder to be aware. The problem
              of how to be mindful is actually resolved not through strenuous effort but by
              relaxing, allowing, and observing what is already here. Within the framework of
              relaxation, the sense of self has a diminishing power center, making space for
              awareness to be revealed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we place an emphasis on “me” entering the here and now, the here and now
              becomes a project, when actually the “me” is the real project. The “I” state is
              the unnatural component, but from the sense of self’s twisted logic the moment
              becomes the problem and needs “my” effort to enter it. This inherent
              contradiction— of trying to enter something that already is—limits access to
              the here and now and takes away what is naturally here already. An authentic
              spiritual practice begins to reverse this perception by abiding with the
              natural and dismissing the artificial.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we think of ourselves as outside the moment needing to get in, this is working
              our practice from the wrong view, intention, and effort. If we want to move
              from thinking to stillness, we have to relax and see what was there before we
              created the storybased assumption that we were outside anything. It dawns on us
              that we are powerless to make freedom happen because our efforts only
              disconnect us from our intended goal. We exist as a thought believed, and it is
              not within the power of a thought to control awareness. When this is realized,
              we stop trying to be mindful and relax into the awareness that existed before
              thought instead of holding to the mindfulness driven by thought. One is
              eternal, the other temporal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              give up the “doing” of mindfulness to fully participate in what mindfulness is
              attempting to do—that is, to allow a full abiding presence. Mindfulness has a
              way of both advancing and retracting that cause. It can maintain the observer
              and the observed and straddle the fence between these two. Mindfulness tries to
              have it both ways by proclaiming full participation in the moment even as it
              applies a fail-safe plan to pull out if the experience gets a little
              frightening. The observer or watcher is the part of our mind that likes to know
              what it is getting into, the contained and controlled part that maintains an
              escape route “just in case.” At a certain level of understanding our practice,
              this is all fine, but we soon tire of holding ourselves in reserve. The
              observer and the observed must eventually merge into a single abiding presence
              if there is to be spiritual fulfillment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Releasing our need to control </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              this passage of the sutta unleashes the full onslaught of experiences, it is
              implied that within this framework we should not attempt to control what is
              arising. Any attempt to control our experience leads to a distortion of that
              very occurrence and selectively misses the “full alertness” suggested. The more
              control we try to have, the tighter and tenser we become, and the noisier and
              more resistant our minds will be. Again, knowing that the Buddha’s overall aim
              is to lessen mental discord and move toward stillness, we reject control as a
              mechanism for growth. There are times, of course, when preferentially focusing
              on an experience is the appropriate response within a situation, but the
              Buddha’s repeated emphasis in the sutta on being “fully alert” might well imply
              that he is pointing beyond focused concentration toward the release of all tension
              by abiding in awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              may seem like a minor point until we realize that we cannot be fully alert and
              force our agenda upon a situation in the same moment. Full alertness suggests a
              receptive stance free of any form of manipulation. We are not leaning toward or
              away from any experience, desiring or expecting anything, but simply abiding
              within what is. This is perhaps the central reason that many of us feel so
              inept at carrying awareness forward into the next moment. Abiding in awareness
              is not our primary concern; establishing our preference is. As long as our
              primary intention is to control our place within the moment, the sense of self
              will remain in charge and awareness will be obscured.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              abide in awareness without asserting our need to control what is arising
              suggests a complete restructuring of our view and intention. The eighth-century
              Indian Buddhist scholar Shantideva said, “We are not here to change the world;
              the world is here to change us.” This is the level of reorganization necessary
              for moving a self-based paradigm into abiding awareness. When we attempt to
              force or influence reality, we are refusing to be affected by it. We have opted
              out of changing ourselves, investing our energy in the course of our desire.
              The sense of self remains fully empowered when it decides how the world must
              change to fit its needs, and nothing can get through to modify the mind,
              because it is externally focused. Suddenly the paradigm shifts when the mind
              starts accommodating reality and is modified by the facts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              switch to a new paradigm throws into question the meaning and purpose of our
              old conditioning. The sense of self thrives on feelings of accomplishment and
              uses standards of productivity for its scale of worth and value. I have heard
              many new students over the years ask whether meditation is really a selfish
              pursuit. It is hard for them to reconcile “doing nothing” with the generally
              perceived value of affecting change in the world. In this view, as long as we
              are doing something and can see what we have produced, then the day has been
              well served. Idleness is not valued because it means we are not living up to
              our work ethic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              this short passage the Buddha seems to be saying that engaging in activity and
              being affected by activity are simultaneous. He does not seem to be implying
              that we should simply sit and physically do nothing, but rather that doing
              nothing can coexist within the activity itself, that everything we need to do
              can get done and we can be spiritually transformed at the same moment. Action
              is usually possession-oriented and focuses on the product of what “I” want from
              the action. In doing so, we miss the life inherent within activity. When “I”
              reach for the glass, my thoughts are with the glass, and the life within the
              reaching is missed, but this sutta passage suggests that the means are just as
              important as the ends.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“When going forward and returning” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              way to offset our goal-oriented tendency is to allow awareness within each
              activity. Instead of being consumed by the destination, make the traveling the
              purpose of the activity. In moving toward a goal, deliberately look at the
              surroundings, hear the sounds, and allow life in. This embodied action leaves
              neither the process nor the product behind, and is therefore simultaneously
              qualitative and quantitative, which means that we live within the activity of
              the movement even as the goal is reached. The self’s agenda now becomes
              secondary to the lived experience of awareness, and the mind joins the body
              when the goal is not more important than the activity. When the goal is not the
              single focus, there is an immediate change of direction when something unexpected
              occurs, and a new action can manifest spontaneously from the unfolding
              situation. The reason we thought we were there turns out not to be the reason
              we were there at all. “Oh,” we say. “This is why I came.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              have temporarily freed this sutta passage from the repetitive and sometimes
              stylized translations that frequently accompany it. Infusing the teaching with
              new words and ideas may feel like turning our back on a worn but reliable pair
              of shoes. The comfort and ease of the old shoes are not easily relinquished. I
              realize that many practitioners love the ancient language of the commentaries
              and their accompanying translations. They do offer agreed-upon texts for
              teaching and support an established and well-honored tradition, but for some
              practitioners the words and phrases seem so antiquated that they may no longer
              serve their intended purpose. Refreshing the dharma with our insights should
              not threaten anyone, as long as the basic principles of the teaching are
              maintained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              more important point is that when we look at the same passage through similar
              translations over many years, our perception can become fixed about what these
              words mean experientially. We can become frozen within a cognitive map of the
              dharma. Over the years it has been very helpful for many of us to hear a
              variety of contemporary viewpoints, each evoking a slightly different
              perspective through meaning and interpretation. These implied perspectives
              allow us to renew our interest as we inquire into different possibilities. For
              example, the translation of kilesa as “defilement” (and its other variations,
              including “taints,” “cankers,” “fetters,” “poisons,” and “torments”) has a
              connotation of repugnancy. The word can be problematic for many Westerners
              because we already find ourselves aversive enough to the “defilements” when
              they arise without adding an additional undertone of disgust to the definition.
              It is important to remember that we are practicing to understand the entire
              mind, and the “defilements” are no exception. The “defilements” must be
              accepted, understood, and ultimately disarmed if their empty nature is to be
              seen.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              this short section of the Satipathanna Sutta, a fully embodied practice can be
              implied. We have expanded the literal meaning of the paragraph from a simple
              set of instructions for being mindful during activity to the broader truth of
              abiding in awareness. We have seen the limitation of our volition and willpower
              in making this happen and have switched paradigms so that life is influencing
              us by offering continuous feedback on the play of our consciousness. All of
              this is working well within the continuum we have established by moving us
              through the constant noise of our narrative to the stillness of emptiness, and
              once aligned within that continuum, we suffer less. We did this by connecting
              the sutta to the wisdom of our practice, and the sutta emerges stronger and
              more resolute from its implied message. The message feeds our spirit and
              provides momentum and deepening interest in reading further into the sutta,
              applying our understanding as we proceed.</span></p>
