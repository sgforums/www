              </p><p>Please read this and see what Korean Buddhists are experiencing in South Korea. I can't help but feel disturbed and wonder why does the Christians condone such heinious and ungodly acts. I am not angry at Christianity but some terrible Christians who look down on Buddhism. Why can't we live in a world of mutual respect? </p>

              <p>by Emi hayakawa, BTN, Nov 6, 2012</p>
              <p>Seoul, South Korea -- Vandalism and arson of Buddhist temples and treasures, and important cultural properties relating to Buddhism by the Korean Christian and Protestant communities continue. Although many legislative laws have changed to protect cultural properties and national treasure after the tragic arson of the Namdaemun gate, national treasure No.1, vandalism to Buddhist temples and Buddhist treasures continue in Korea.</p>
              <p>On October 4th, 2012, an arson tried to burn down the Gakhwangjeon Hall of Hwaomsa Temple in Gurye County, Korea. Fortunately, the fire only made a small damage to the gate of the hall due to quick actions of the monks and the fire prevention restoration made in 2008.  </p>
              <p>On the CCTV, the video captured a man pouring a flammable substance across the hall, and according to witnesses they smelt a very arsenic substance coming from the hall before the man threw in a match to burn down the Gakhwangjeon Hall. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>Due to this incident, the Korean Buddhist community is in shock once again and fighting for a stricter law enforcement for the perpetrators of vandalism and arson to Korean important cultural properties and National treasures.  </p>
              <p>Furthermore, on August 20th, 2012 a Protestant pastor, Seong, vandalized the dharma hall of Donghwasa Temple. This pastor self-proclaimed that he was from the SoonBokEum Church, was caught urinating in the dharma hall and vandalized the Buddhist portraits with a permanent marker. His poor actions was captured on CCTV of the dharma hall.</p>
              <p> The Buddhist community was outraged by this act and urged law enforcements to put a stricter punishment as this act cannot be charged with a simple invasion and vandalism punishment. </p>
              <p>Although the law enforcement captured the pastor, they considered this act as “unusual” and let the pastor go stating that he was under mental disorientation. Thus, enraging the Buddhist community because the Korean government and law enforcement is very lenient towards destruction of Buddhist artifacts and National treasures.</p>
              <p>On November 2011, the stele that accompanied the stupa of National Preceptor Jigwangguksa of Beopcheonsa temple, Korean National Treasure No. 59 was vandalized. A giant cross was drawn across the five meter stone statue and was opened to public on a christian man’s Facebook and twitter page. </p>
              <p>Similarly, in November 2011, near the Haewundae in Busan, Korea. Four Buddhist temples reported vandalism and invasion by the Korean Christian community, as they spray painted red lacquer on the hands and faces of the Buddha statues.</p>
              <p>Various vandalism of Buddhist cultural properties and Buddhist temples, vandalism and destruction of Korean national treasures have been going for several decades, and these actions are the root causes of religious disharmony between the Korean religious communities.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest and significant act of vandalism by Christians was in June of 2006 during the “Again 1907 in Busan” festival by Korean Christians. The Christians prayed earnestly for all the Buddhist temples and monasteries of the Busan area to be destructed, and many Korean citizens were dismayed to find Korean President Lee MyungBak to be the congratulatory commentator of this event.</p>
              <p>In February of 2011, there was another scandal where three pastors came to the Jogye temple and ordered the monastics to “believe in Jesus, as {koreans} we are all children of God.”</p>
              <p>In 2010, a pastor and college students of the Christian faith invaded Bongeunsa temple and began a “Ground stepping”  and had a protestant ritual for all the ground to be returned to the land of God.</p>
              <p>This was wide spread throughout youtube and the internet.</p>
              <p>These various vandalism sparks fear of Buddhist discrimination in Korea. Korea is in much need for the harmony of religions, and these vandalism of the Korean Christian and Protestant community need to stop.</p>

              <p><em><br><cite>tobes wrote:</cite>This is really a repugnant analogy: you're suggesting that there is something inherent in the nature of Islam...</em></p>
              <p><br><br>Yes, there is: <span class="posthilit">monotheism</span> i.e. a totalitarian utopian fantasy. <span class="posthilit">Monotheism</span> in all of its forms is the scorpion which stings any population upon which it rides. <br><br>Monotheistic
                           religions are inherently violent and wicked. The fact that there are 
                          kind, intelligent people in monotheistic faiths just not change the 
                          basic imperialistic and totalitarian aspects of these faiths. Islam is 
                          just another of these. The reason why it is in competition with 
                          Christianity is that two monotheistic faiths cannot long accommodate 
                          each other without one asserting dominance over the other. But neither 
                          has room for religions like Hinduism or Buddhism. <br><br>Islamic accommodation and tolerance of other faiths, like that of Christianity, is pragmatic -- it is about money. That's it. <br><br>N<br><br>.............<br><br><span class="posthilit">Monotheism</span> inevitably leads to warfare and genocide. <br><br>N</p>

This is 
                  irrefutable. All those minor Christian sects you mention are irrelevant,
                   eddies in the river of destruction monotheisms have wrecked upon human 
                  history. <span class="posthilit">Monotheism</span> is inherently imperialistic. If you don't see it, you just don't see it. I don't really have a need to convince you. <br><br>During the present day, Islam is the strongest form of <span class="posthilit">monotheism</span> -- it therefore the most dangerous; seconded only by Christian fundamentalism.<br><br>~ Namdrol<br><br>----------<br></p>
              <p>My comments:<br><br>Lets not forget... their scriptures state that their God is a jealous and angry one and cannot accomodate other religions.<br><br>Their tolerance (if they have, that is) is simply for pragmatic purposes. That's just the way it is...</p>

              <p>Well, I didn't share this to start a campaign against Christianity or even monotheism. I think it is bigotry that is at fault here, not the religion. We must not stereotype Christians as bigots because there are many wonderful examples of Christians that are close in spirit to the Bodhisattvas like Mother Teresa and so forth. Also, many of the world's charities and orphanages were started by Christians. </p>
              <p>However, with Islam, I do notice that I have to look harder to find someone with Bodhisattva-like qualities. I have not seen any yet but that doesn't mean they don't have selfless muslims. I am sure they do.</p>

              <p>Please read this and see what Korean Buddhists are experiencing
              in South Korea. I can't help but feel disturbed and wonder why does
              the Christians condone such heinious and ungodly acts. I am not
              angry at Christianity but some terrible Christians who look down on
              Buddhism. Why can't we live in a world of mutual respect? </p>

              <p>by Emi hayakawa, BTN, Nov 6, 2012</p>
              <p>Seoul, South Korea -- Vandalism and arson of Buddhist temples
              and treasures, and important cultural properties relating to
              Buddhism by the Korean Christian and Protestant communities
              continue. Although many legislative laws have changed to protect
              cultural properties and national treasure after the tragic arson of
              the Namdaemun gate, national treasure No.1, vandalism to Buddhist
              temples and Buddhist treasures continue in Korea.</p>
              <p>On October 4th, 2012, an arson tried to burn down the
              Gakhwangjeon Hall of Hwaomsa Temple in Gurye County, Korea.
              Fortunately, the fire only made a small damage to the gate of the
              hall due to quick actions of the monks and the fire prevention
              restoration made in 2008.  </p>
              <p>On the CCTV, the video captured a man pouring a flammable
              substance across the hall, and according to witnesses they smelt a
              very arsenic substance coming from the hall before the man threw in
              a match to burn down the Gakhwangjeon Hall. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>Due to this incident, the Korean Buddhist community is in shock
              once again and fighting for a stricter law enforcement for the
              perpetrators of vandalism and arson to Korean important cultural
              properties and National treasures.  </p>
              <p>Furthermore, on August 20th, 2012 a Protestant pastor, Seong,
              vandalized the dharma hall of Donghwasa Temple. This pastor
              self-proclaimed that he was from the SoonBokEum Church, was caught
              urinating in the dharma hall and vandalized the Buddhist portraits
              with a permanent marker. His poor actions was captured on CCTV of
              the dharma hall.</p>
              <p> The Buddhist community was outraged by this act and urged
              law enforcements to put a stricter punishment as this act cannot be
              charged with a simple invasion and vandalism punishment. </p>
              <p>Although the law enforcement captured the pastor, they
              considered this act as “unusual” and let the pastor go stating that
              he was under mental disorientation. Thus, enraging the Buddhist
              community because the Korean government and law enforcement is very
              lenient towards destruction of Buddhist artifacts and National
              treasures.</p>
              <p>On November 2011, the stele that accompanied the stupa of
              National Preceptor Jigwangguksa of Beopcheonsa temple, Korean
              National Treasure No. 59 was vandalized. A giant cross was drawn
              across the five meter stone statue and was opened to public on a
              christian man’s Facebook and twitter page. </p>
              <p>Similarly, in November 2011, near the Haewundae in Busan, Korea.
              Four Buddhist temples reported vandalism and invasion by the Korean
              Christian community, as they spray painted red lacquer on the hands
              and faces of the Buddha statues.</p>
              <p>Various vandalism of Buddhist cultural properties and Buddhist
              temples, vandalism and destruction of Korean national treasures
              have been going for several decades, and these actions are the root
              causes of religious disharmony between the Korean religious
              communities.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest and significant act of vandalism by
              Christians was in June of 2006 during the “Again 1907 in Busan”
              festival by Korean Christians. The Christians prayed earnestly for
              all the Buddhist temples and monasteries of the Busan area to be
              destructed, and many Korean citizens were dismayed to find Korean
              President Lee MyungBak to be the congratulatory commentator of this
              event.</p>
              <p>In February of 2011, there was another scandal where three
              pastors came to the Jogye temple and ordered the monastics to
              “believe in Jesus, as {koreans} we are all children of God.”</p>
              <p>In 2010, a pastor and college students of the Christian faith
              invaded Bongeunsa temple and began a “Ground stepping”  and
              had a protestant ritual for all the ground to be returned to the
              land of God.</p>
              <p>This was wide spread throughout youtube and the internet.</p>
              <p>These various vandalism sparks fear of Buddhist discrimination
              in Korea. Korea is in much need for the harmony of religions, and
              these vandalism of the Korean Christian and Protestant community
              need to stop.</p>

              <p>Well, I wouldn't know how they see it but if I was God, they would all be burning in hell for misrepresenting me. I wouldn't want such Christians and heck, if I am god. I would make sure the people combine Islam, Christianity and Judaism into one super-religion and I would definitely get rid of the devil now. </p>
