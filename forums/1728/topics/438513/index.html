              as MCK did, the next level or step will be, to be able to give others what you dear most vs what u don't want.

              <p>Agreed. </p>
              <p>I was just thinking yesterday that what we are materially endowed with is the result of merit accumulation and we shouldn't be squandering it.  If there's really something that no longer fits in with our lifestyle but still in good and useable condition, it's better to give it to someone who can use it, rather than just mindlessly discard. </p>
              <p>Somewhat like sharing one's merit...</p>

              <p>Many buddhist temples in Singapore now have recycling programs. If you don't want other stuffs such as clothings, books etc, you can donate them out . Actually, this is a practice of generosity.</p>
              <p>As for this Confucian quote å·±æ‰€ä¸�æ¬²ï¼Œå‹¿æ–½äºŽäºº, the more applicable philosophy behind this is that "<strong>do not impose upon others what you do not like</strong>" (<span class="st">è‡ªå·±ä¸�å–œæ­¡çš„æ�±è¥¿ï¼Œå�ƒè�¬ä¸�è¦�åŠ åœ¨åˆ¥äººèº«ä¸Š</span>ï¼‰. E.g. if you don't like others to be rude to you, then don't be rude to others (asking you to be polite). If you don't like others to criticize you, then don't critize others. It's actually a confucian practice of you putting yourself in other's shoe and being considerate of others (i.e. you think of yourself as another person and think in terms of him). If you wish yourself to live better, you also wish others to live better. If you don't like yourself to live in poverty, then you also don't wish others to live in poverty. It's more applicable to moral conduct and behaviour.</p>
              <p>In terms of donating the stuffs to others that you don't want, it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't "like" these stuffs. Thus, å·±æ‰€ä¸�æ¬²ï¼Œå‹¿æ–½äºŽäºº doesn't always apply to the case of donation or practice of generosity. What you don't want might be a need for others. If it's something that you don't like, then naturally, others might also not like it. In such a case, å·±æ‰€ä¸�æ¬²ï¼Œå‹¿æ–½äºŽäºº does apply.</p>
              <p>In this sense, it's quite similar to the moral law of karma in buddhism. You do a good thing, you reap good. You do evil, you reap evil. If you don't want to receive evil, you don't do evil to others.</p>
