              <p>Letting go is important... but there are many levels of letting go.</p>
              <p>In the first stage of dropping there is the idea of having 'someone' trying to 'suppress' thoughts (as if thoughts have inherent existence which the 'self' can push away), which is the wrong way of letting go. This is due to the wrong idea of there being a 'self' who can push away thoughts, and also the wrong idea of thoughts having substance or reality -- thoughts are already empty. As long as there the illusion of someone trying to let go of something, all letting go is only holding and reacting and contrived action in disguise of dropping.</p>
              <p>The next level of dropping is to be a background mirror, a background awareness behind thoughts and dissociate and detach from all thoughts and experiences. At this level it is still dualistic, the experience is on the I AM as the background awareness unaffected by thoughts, the insight into non-duality has not arisen. The insight that 'all dust/all phenomena is the mirror' has not arisen. One distants oneself from the object but still holds tightly to the Subject (a witness, a center).</p>
              <p>The next level is to drop endlessly without footing and reasoning and enter a state that feels like oblivion.</p>
              <p>Then the next level is to drop into vivid wide opening.</p>
              <p>The next level of dropping is to drop into vivid wide opening arising AS all scenery, sound, taste, touch, thoughts.</p>
              <p>The next level is just everything spontaneous arising and subsiding.</p>

              <p>But if you are a christian, I am not interested. It is because the Christians are the most naive and simple-minded  among all the religious followers.

              <p>Buddhist meditation is NOT simple no-thinking. Non-conceptual direct understanding of the ultimate reality in meditative equipose is NOT equal to simple no-thinking. In fact, not thinking per se is a form of thinking. It is just like the existence of God  and the absence of God are two polar constructs of our human conceptual mind to which we ignorantly grasp to.</p>
              <p>The ultimate reality is neither the existence nor the absence of God. It is the negation of the four 'horn' (catuskoti) in the madhyamaka tetralemma. This is the Great Middle Way taught by the Buddha. This is the reason why the Buddha was SILENT on the question of GOD's existence.</p>
              <p>Similarly, what is taking place in the mind of the meditator in meditative equipoise transcends thinking and no-thinking. If simple No-Thinking can lead to enlightenment, then becoming a buddha will be a very easy task for many. Especially those in COMA, lying in hospital, will be Buddha.</p>
              <p>For those who are interested in knowing more about thinking/ no-thinking in relation to mediation, please read Mipham Jamyang Gyatso's take on Hwashang's quietism in his debate with his Gelugpa opponents. </p>
