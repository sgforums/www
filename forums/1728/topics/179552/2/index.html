(www.dajiyuan.com)<br><br>A photo of two peculiar dragon-shaped objects taken from a plane flying over TibetÂ’s Himalayas piqued many usersÂ’ interest when displayed on a Chinese website. The photographer is an amateur.<br><br>On June 22, 2004, the photographer went to TibetÂ’s Amdo region to attend the Qinghai-to-Xizang Railroad laying ceremony, and then took a plane from Lhasa to fly back inland. When flying over the Himalayas, he accidentally caught these two "dragons" in a picture that he took. He called these two objects "the Tibet dragons."<br><br>Looking at the photo, these two objects appear to have the characteristics of crawling creatures: The bodies seem to be covered by scales, the backs have spine-like protuberances, and also they have gradually thinning rear ends. Although the photo caught only a portion of the entire scene, it was sufficient to create the appearance of two gigantic dragons flying in the clouds.<br><br>This photo, shown on some websites such as post.baidu.com and other forums, aroused the website visitorsÂ’ curiosity. One person commented, Â“No wonder that China is the homeland of the dragon! Nature is truly mysterious and powerful, it can always produce spectacular sights beyond people's expectations.Â”<br><br>Â“Is it really true? Is it possible there is an ancient civilization that we donÂ’t know about preserved in places that are sparsely populated?Â”<br><br>Â“It really looks like the dragons in fables, and I really hope it is.Â”<br><br>Certainly, most website visitors hoped that someone could confirm the authenticity of the dragons in the photo.<br><br><img src="http://img.epochtimes.com/i6/508042832628.jpg"><br>Photo of dragons taken from an airplane above the Himalayas. (www.dajiyuan.com)<br><br>In Chinese fairy tales, the dragon is a kind of rare heavenly creature. Fables say that it can conceal or reveal itself. It ascends to heaven in the spring breeze and dives and hides in deep water in the autumn wind. It can promote clouds and bring about rain. It also became the symbol of imperial authority later on; all emperors of previous dynasties self-designated as dragons, utensils were also decorated with dragons.<br><br>Culturally, the dragon is the Chinese ancestors' totem. Nearly all races in China had fables and stories with dragons as the main subject, such as dragon boat races, the dragon lantern dance to celebrate holidays, sacrificial offerings to the dragons to implore timely wind and rain for good crops.<br><br>Whether this kind of creature really exists is still an unsolved riddle. In the previous dynasties in China, there had been many documents recording eyewitness accounts of magical dragons. The most amazing events are the various "falling dragons," dragons that suddenly fell to the ground under peculiar circumstances, and were witnessed by many. A relatively recent tale occurred in the puppet Manchuria regime in August, 1944. A black dragon fell to the ground at the Chen FamilyÂ’s Weizi Village, about 9.4 miles northwest of Zhaoyuan County, on the south shore of the Mudan River (the old name of a section of Songhua River) in Heilongjiang province. The black dragon was on the verge of death. The eyewitness said that this creature had a horn on its head, scales covering its body, and had a strong fishy smell that attracted numerous flies.<br><br>The records from previous dynasties also mentioned the connection between the emergence of these kinds of mysterious creatures, Â“dragons,Â” and the transition of dynasties on earth. The appearance of TibetÂ’s magical dragon invites our curiosity and imagination. </div></blockquote></div>

It is infact because of some political factors or incidents that caused people to despise its own culture.<br>Sometimes also because of the "chop roots to beg for mercy" kind of thinking although it doesn't work. For instance, indonesian chinese can't even speak mother tounge, but it doesn't spare them from being rapped and killed in racial riots.<br><br>Despising own culture and mother tounge is an unfilial act. Buddha has said that being filial is a root of all good deed. It not only benefits ourselves and parents, but the good karma will also benefit our children. Saints in chinese history, for example Kong Zi. He has contributed a lot good philosphy to we chinese even to Japan and Korea. With this good karma, all his 79 descendants are rich and in the elite group, even after so many change of dynasty, government and war.<br><br>That's why buddhism never go against worshopping of ancestor or even deities like Tu Di Gong or Tai Shang Lau Jun. Tu Di Gong is the ancient emperor Da4 Yu3 that save people from flood and Lau Jun is the philosopher Lau2 Zi3.</div>

It might be that the majority of Chinese here still retain the colonial mentality, and thinks very highly of everything Western while degrading our own Chinese roots...<br><br>You see people frowning on all things Chinese, including Chinese names, Chinese ancestral practices, Chinese wah yang operas, language, TCM, etc etc. Heck, even the term "cheena" is invented to reflect this kind of negative sentiments. The sad thing is that you will not find any other races that actually feel proud to be alienating their own mother-culture. You certainly cannot find any "kay ang mohs" in Malays, Japanese, Indians etc.<br><br>Culture and religion are inseparable. There is obviously also a cross-over in religious implications. The exodus of joss-stick Taoists/ Buddhists to embrace Christianity might be another manifestation of this "kay ang moh" mentality, but that is another matter.<br><br>Some Chinese I know not only adopted Anglo-saxon names, but also changed the spelling of their surname to appear "ang moh"-ish. Eg, spelling surname "Lowe" instead of "Loh" etc. In one particularly jarring incident, my (Chinese) colleague commented to me that "Oh, Chinese characters are sooooo squarish and soooo cute!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If I hadn't know better, I would have thought that she is a foreigner seeing Chinese hanzi for the first time, but the fact is that she is a home-grown and home-educated Chinese Singaporean!<br><br>It is a sad state of affair to be sure.<br><br>Note that I don't mean to 'bash' those whose command of the Chinese language is poor, I am certainly not proclaiming that the Chinese culture is superior to all others. I am just lamenting that in Singapore, you cannot even proclaim your "Chineseness" without being branded a Chauvanist by the "kay ang mohs". </div></blockquote>Culture was one thing , but during the Communist Upheaval period , many have to avoid being implicated with chinese name<br><br>In indonesia,when the Partai Kommunis Indonesia staged a coup, many chinese have no choice but to change their allegiance to Chinese nationalist (or rather Republic of China) and not PRC<br><br>Communist Revolution still left scars on the chinese diaspora for years<br><br></div>
