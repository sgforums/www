The first objection is based on the need to maintain the truth of a particular creation story in order to preserve the underlying basis for all Biblical truth. This is not a worry to Buddhists because there is no corresponding Buddhist creation myth, and Buddhist philosophers have always accepted that the universe is many hundreds of millions of years old.<br><br>The second theological objection is that evolution states that there is a continuum between ape and man, ie human and animal.(A favourite anti-evolutionary slogan is  'Don't let them make a Monkey of You!). This is not a problem for Buddhists,  who believe that both humans and animals possess sentient minds which survive death. However it is a major problem for theologians. The church has always taught that only humans have immortal souls, whereas animals are automata whose minds cease at death. Humans and animals were created separatedly and hence are totally different types of being.  But if there was a gradual transition between animal and man, as the evolutionists claim,   then such theological beliefs fall apart.</blockquote>----<br><br>Buddhism and the Idea of Evolution<br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040228015033/http://www.buddhadust.org/dhammatalk/ethical_culture/evolution.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20040228015033/http://www.buddhadust.org/dhammatalk/ethical_culture/evolution.htm</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

Gods are discussed in a separate entry. (See gods.) Brief descriptions of the other seven follow.<br><br>Dragons "can do all kinds of transformations; they can become big or small. They can appear and disappear. How did they get to become dragons? They are said to be 'spiritual', that is, 'inconceivable'. How did they get to be dragons, that is, animals, if they have spiritual penetrations? When they were cultivating the Way, they were 'quick with the vehicle and slow with the precepts.' They cultivated the Great Vehicle Dharma with great vigor, but they did not keep the precepts. Because they cultivated the Great Vehicle Dharma, they gained spiritual penetrations. Because they failed to keep the precepts, they turned into animals. . . .<br><br>....<br>" are great golden winged -birds. They have a wingspan of three hundred sixty . When they flap their wings, the ocean waters part and all the dragons at the bottom of the sea are exposed as potential meals. The dragons have no time to transform into anything. They are gobbled up on the spot by the , who eat them with the same relish as we eat noodles. All gone!<br><br>"The dragons were getting very upset about this, because large numbers of them were being eaten, their species had become endangered. They went to the Buddha to complain, and the Buddha gave them each a thread from his precept sash, saying, 'You can wear this, and then you will be invisible to the -birds.'<br><br>"That worked fine for the dragons, but the -birds were then going hungry. And so they went to the Buddha and said, 'What about us? Dragons are our primary food supply. We're going to starve!' Shakyamuni Buddha said, 'Don't worry. I'll tell all of my disciples to set out some food for you when they eat lunch every day.' That is why left-home people set some food out for the birds.<br><br><a href="http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhistDict/BDE.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhistDict/BDE.html</a><br><br>/\</div>
