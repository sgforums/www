              <h1>Mind Is Buddha</h1>
              <p class="byline2">by <strong>Geoffrey Shugen Arnold, Sensei</strong></p>
              <h2>The Main Case</h2>
              <p><em>Damei once asked Master Mazu, “What is buddha?” Mazu answered, 
              “Mind is buddha.”</em></p>
              <h2>Wumen’s Commentary</h2>
              <p><em>If you can at once grasp “it,” you are wearing buddha clothes, 
              eating buddha food, speaking buddha words, and living buddha life; you 
              are a buddha yourself. Though this may be so, Damei has misled a number 
              of people and let them trust a scale with a stuck pointer. Don’t you 
              know that you have to rinse out your mouth for three days if you have 
              uttered the word “buddha”? If you are a real Zen person, you will stop 
              your ears and rush away when you hear, “Mind is buddha.”</em></p>
              <h2>Wumen’s Poem</h2>
              <p>A fine day under the blue sky!</p>
              <p>Don’t foolishly look here and there.</p>
              <p>If you still ask “What is buddha?”</p>
              <p>It is like pleading your innocence</p>
              <p><em>while</em><em> clutching stolen goods.</em></p>
              <p>From the moment we first engage the dharma, we encounter the truth of
               our buddhanature. This is the fundamental teaching of Zen, our 
              essential reality. Knowing this is our nature, shouldn’t we then 
              recognize our obligation and assume responsibility to realize it 
              directly? We often think of obligation as a burden, but to realize our 
              true nature is to alleviate the profound weight of our confusion, anger 
              and fear.</p>
              <p>Buddhanature is not something that we possess nor is it something we 
              can be. It is the nature of things, just as they are. To realize 
              buddhanature, to live in accord with this awakening, is the truth that 
              alleviates suffering in the world. Having encountered this dharma that 
              offers us a path of complete liberation, knowing that there is another 
              way that leads us out of our self-created darkness, shouldn’t we then 
              take on the obligation to bring it to life, to make it real? We should; 
              it’s the obligation expressed in our bodhisattva vows. It is the 
              wonderful burden we carry, a burden that only increases as we awaken to 
              the true nature of things.</p>
              <p>Damei asked, “What is buddha?” Damei was a disciple of Master Mazu. 
              It is said that Mazu had over eighty enlightened disciples, making him 
              one of the great teachers in the early Zen tradition. “Mind is buddha” 
              became one of his hallmark teachings. The story of Mazu meeting his own 
              teacher, Nanyue, is well known. Mazu was
              living in a small mountain temple, doing zazen day and night. Nanyue was
               teaching in another temple on the same mountain, and he heard about 
              this diligent monk. He decided to pay him a visit. When he saw Mazu, he 
              asked, “Reverend sir, what are you doing here?” Mazu replied, “I’m doing
               zazen.” Nanyue pursued his questioning, “What are you trying to 
              accomplish by doing zazen?” “I’m trying to become a buddha,” answered 
              Mazu. Nanyue then picked up a brick and quietly began to polish it. 
              Mazu, noticing this, asked, “What are you doing?” Nanyue said, “I’m 
              polishing this brick.” “For what?” asked Mazu. Nanyue said, “I want to 
              make a mirror out of it.” Mazu replied, “You can’t make a mirror out of a
               brick by polishing it.” Nanyue countered, “Can you become a buddha by 
              doing zazen?” Mazu inquired, “Well then, what should I do?” Nanyue said,
               “It’s like putting a cart to an ox. If the cart doesn’t move, what 
              should you do? Should you beat the cart or do you beat the ox?” Mazu 
              said, “I don’t understand.” Nanyue then explained, “You practice zazen 
              and try to become a buddha by sitting. If you want to learn how to do 
              zazen, know that Zen is not in sitting nor in lying down. If you want to
               become a buddha by sitting, know that buddha has no fixed form. Never 
              discriminate in living in the dharma of nonattachment. If you try to 
              become a buddha by sitting, you’re killing the buddha. If you’re 
              attached to the form of sitting, you can never attain buddhahood.”</p>
              <p>Mazu was trying to do what all Buddhist practitioners try to 
              do—become a buddha. But what does that actually mean? How do you become a
               buddha? Should we try to become calm and serene, wise and 
              compassionate? These are just ideas, and trying to live according to an 
              idea doesn’t lead to reality. Why is it not possible to become a buddha?</p>
              <p>Many years back, well before beginning my formal Zen training, I 
              studied to be a musician. It was something I wanted deeply, what I 
              wanted my whole life to be. I worked hard at it, practicing every day 
              for hours. Yet in the midst of this all-out effort, I had a feeling that
               somehow I wasn’t a musician. I wanted music to be my whole life and, 
              although I was filling my life with music, it was not filling me. 
              Something was missing. At one point, I was preparing for a recital 
              performance with another musician, and we were working on some pieces 
              together with one of my music teachers, whom I deeply respected. We 
              played through one of the pieces and after we finished, he sat quietly, 
              then said, “No, this is not working. Play it again.” We started playing 
              and he stopped us and said, “No! You’re doing this all wrong. It’s too 
              controlled. It has to be spirited, wild! Play it so it’s right on the 
              edge of flying out of control.” We started playing again and he kept 
              calling out, “Faster! Wilder! Faster!” until the whole thing started to 
              disintegrate and he cried out, “Yes! Yes! That’s it!”</p>
              <p>I walked away from that experience having felt something come alive. 
              There was a hint of something that I had been looking for that arose out
               of my forgetting the scales, the exercises and all of the discipline 
              that I was so necessarily and diligently developing, discipline that had
               become an obstacle to the music filling me completely. All of my 
              efforts and striving to become a “musician” were preventing me from 
              letting go and just experiencing the music directly.</p>
              <p>Nanyue said, “If you want to become a buddha by sitting, know that 
              buddha has no fixed form.” We cannot become something that has no fixed 
              form. That’s our buddhanature. It has no fixed form. Don’t attach to the
               form of sitting. But this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t practice 
              zazen. If we attach to the form, we can never attain buddhahood. If we 
              don’t sit deeply, it is also most unlikely that we’ll realize our true 
              nature. Clearly, neither extreme is the true path. To see zazen or the 
              dharma as a fixed object is a danger of a 2,500-year-old tradition. We 
              can understand zazen as a method, a technique, or an exercise that 
              offers a solution or an answer, like a formula to a problem. It’s not 
              that there is no resolution, but it’s not what we think it is. It has no
               fixed form.</p>
              <p>Damei came to Mazu one day and asked, “What is buddha?” Naturally, he
               was not asking about the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. He was not 
              interested in a specific person assuming a certain form. He was asking 
              about the fundamental truth. This practice can’t be fixed because 
              everything in this great universe is formless. Everything is 
              impermanence itself. Life doesn’t have a fixed form; a moment doesn’t 
              have a fixed form. If our freedom depends on something static—a special 
              state of mind or the absence of thought—then it has no true power, no 
              ability to respond in a formless world. Damei was asking about what is 
              true, what is real at all times, in all conditions, in all situations.</p>
              <p>Mazu said, “Mind is buddha.” Mind alone—all-pervading and without 
              edges—is the truth. Bodhidharma taught: “Everything that appears in the 
              three realms comes from mind. Hence the buddhas of the past and the 
              future teach mind to mind without bothering about definitions.” A 
              student then asked, “If they don’t define it, what do they mean by 
              mind?” Bodhidharma answered, “You ask. That’s your mind. I answer. 
              That’s my mind. If I had no mind, how could I answer? If you had no 
              mind, how could you ask? That which asks is your mind. Through endless 
              kalpas without beginning, whatever you do, wherever you are, that’s your
               real mind, that’s your real buddha.” To say “This mind is the Buddha” 
              is saying the same thing. Beyond this mind, you will never find another 
              buddha. To search for enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind is 
              impossible. The reality of your own self-nature, the absence of cause 
              and effect, is what’s meant by mind. Your mind is nirvana. You might 
              think you can find a buddha or enlightenment somewhere beyond the mind, 
              but such a place doesn’t exist.</p>
              <p>“You ask. That’s your mind.” What does that mean? We ask questions 
              all the time; we offer answers. How is  this mind? How is this buddha? 
              Bodhidharma also stated that buddha means “miraculous awareness.” The 
              universe asks; the universe itself responds. This is miraculous 
              awareness. Mind is buddha. This is the mind of the universe. It is the 
              one great body that fills heaven and earth. Where is the self to be 
              found?</p>
              <p>This is why the search for enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind 
              is impossible. There is nothing outside of it. That’s one of the most 
              difficult things for us to realize, because we look outside without even
               knowing. As we are seeking outside ourselves for the answers, this 
              turning away is so habitual and deeply conditioned that we don’t see it.
               From the moment we encounter the dharma, the moment we begin doing 
              zazen, we are instructed not to look outside ourselves. We know this is 
              true, we believe in it, but we don’t do it. We continually seek and 
              reach outside, searching for that which is beyond our awareness. We may 
              think we can find a buddha or enlightenment somewhere beyond this mind, 
              we might think we can find serenity, clarity and meaning beyond this 
              mind, but such a place does not exist. Everything that appears is this 
              mind. But if it encompasses everything, how can it be seen? That which 
              is seen is mind. That which is seeing is mind. Seeing itself is mind. So
               how can it be seen? Well, it can’t, and thus it must be realized.</p>
              <p>Mind is buddha. This is not our brain; it’s not in our head. This is 
              one reason why it’s so important to put our awareness in the <em>hara</em> and get out of our heads. While Mazu’s “Mind is buddha” was one of his 
              signature teachings, it was not original with him. Another old master 
              said, “To see into one’s nature is to be
              awakened to the buddha mind. Cast all thoughts and consciousness away 
              and see that mind is buddha. The one who realizes that their true mind 
              is buddha is the one who has attained buddhahood. One neither practices 
              good nor commits evil; one has no attachments to the mind. Your eyes see
               things, but you don’t become attached to them. Your tongue tastes, but 
              you don’t become attached. This mind that does not become attached to 
              each and every thing is buddha mind. This is why Master Mazu said, “Mind
               is buddha.” Being attached is what prevents us from seeing. It is what 
              clouds miraculous awareness.</p>
              <p>To be free of the discriminating mind is to manifest awareness that 
              is miraculously simple and unadorned. This is the koan of zazen, of <em>shikantaza</em>.
               Don’t do anything. Don’t be passive either. Being passive is still 
              doing. This is also the heart of every koan. A traditional case koan 
              creates a sense that you’re doing something. You have a question that 
              you drop down into your hara and inquire into deeply. You keep your mind
               still and stable within that question so it doesn’t turn or agitate the
               mind. But there’s still the sense that you’re doing something.</p>
              <p>I remember wondering about this in my own koan study: Isn’t this 
              somehow creating a state of mind,
              working with something that’s outside of myself? Can
              it be trusted to reveal the truth? It took a lot of work to see the 
              error in my
              way of understanding the nature of a koan. When the
              thinking mind ceases and the self falls away, there is no koan
              and nothing to create. That is when the koan is
              realized.</p>
              <p>In the commentary, Wumen wrote, “If you can at once grasp ‘it,’ you 
              are wearing buddha clothes, eating buddha food, speaking buddha words, 
              living buddha life. You are a buddha yourself.” Here’s the real point of
               difficulty with this koan. It seems so obvious, “Oh, I’m a buddha.” But
               when it’s just an idea, do we notice that nothing has changed? We’re 
              not actually wearing buddha clothes, eating buddha food, speaking buddha
               words, living buddha life. All we’re doing is carrying around the 
              thought, “I’m a buddha.” We just increased our confusion. What is it to 
              really wear buddha clothes? What is it to see “Mind is buddha?” That’s 
              why Wumen said, “Damei has misled a number of people and let them trust a
               scale with a stuck pointer.” There is no fixed form. But as soon as 
              Mazu said, “Mind is buddha,” it became static, like a slogan. It’s a 
              great slogan, isn’t it? Short and punchy. Yet right there the scale 
              sticks, which is a nice image. The scale gives a weight, but it’s a 
              fixed weight. Regardless of what you place on the scale, the reading is 
              the same, not reflecting the truth anymore. It’s showing something, but 
              what it’s showing is false. So, to even say, “Mind is buddha” creates a 
              problem.</p>
              <p><em>A fine day under the blue sky!</em></p>
              <p><em>Don’t foolishly look here and there.</em></p>
              <p><em>If you still ask, “What is buddha?”</em></p>
              <p><em>It is like pleading your innocence</em></p>
              <p><em>while</em><em> clutching stolen goods.</em></p>
              <p>Don’t foolishly look here and there. Why is this so difficult? Does 
              it, in fact, come back to our lack of trust in our own buddhanature or 
              lack of faith in our ability to realize it? Being confident in our 
              ability does not require being arrogant. If it’s arrogant, it’s 
              something other than confidence. This is simply about recognizing what’s
               true. When you get stuck in your own practice, rather than creating a 
              pit of self-pity and woe, have faith in yourself. Why shouldn’t you? 
              Being free of attachments, living a life that is joyful, is your 
              endowment and birthright.</p>
              <p><em>If you still ask “What is buddha?”</em></p>
              <p><em>It is like pleading your innocence</em></p>
              <p><em>while</em><em> clutching stolen goods.</em></p>
              <p>This is why realizing ourselves is an obligation. But whose 
              obligation is it? It can’t come from the outside. It has to arise from 
              within. So, please, having received the gift of this time and place, 
              meet your obligation. If you still have doubts about your 
              responsibility, consider the costs of confusion, delusion, jealousy, 
              anger in this world of ours. Take the posture of the buddha on your 
              meditation cushion and understand that there is one who knows. “Mind is 
              buddha” is awakening to that truth. It’s no one else’s affair.</p>
