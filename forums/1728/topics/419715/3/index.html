              <p>Kundalini is a Sanskrit word meaning either "coiled up" or "coiling like a snake." There are a number of other translations of the term usually emphasizing a more serpent nature to the word - e.g. 'serpent power'.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/caduceus.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">caduceus</span></span></a> symbol of coiling snakes is thought to be an ancient symbolic representation of Kundalini physiology.</p>
              <p>The concept of Kundalini comes from yogic philosophy of ancient India and refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation. It might be regarded by yogis as a sort of deity, hence the occasional capitalization of the term.</p>
              <p>Within a western frame of understanding it is often associated with the practice of contemplative or religious practices that might induce an altered state of consciousness, either brought about spontaneously, through a type of yoga, through psychedelic drugs, or through a near-death experience.</p>
              <p>According to the yogic tradition Kundalini is curled up in the back part of the root chakra in three and one-half turns around the sacrum. Yogic phenomenology states that kundalini awakening is associated with the appearance of bio-energetic phenomena that are said to be experienced somatically by the yogi.</p>
              <p>This appearance is also referred to as "pranic awakening". Prana is interpreted as the vital, life-sustaining force in the body. Uplifted, or intensified life-energy is called pranotthana and is supposed to originate from an apparent reservoir of subtle bio-energy at the base of the spine. This energy is also interpreted as a vibrational phenomena that initiates a period, or a process of vibrational spiritual development.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Tibetan lamas will do a 3-1/2 year of closed retreat and when they come out from their retreat, they have to show that they have their kundalini (tumo fire) awakened by walking in the snow with a wet towel around them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After a few rounds of walking in a circle, the towel would be inspected to see whether it is dry ( dried by tumo fire) to pass the test.</span></p>

              <p>There are certain Buddha statues with a huge cobra over the Buddha head or 5 huge Cobras over the Buddha Head.</p>
              <p>In the context of Kundalini (serpent energy), it signifies that the Buddha has awakened his kundalini successfully.  Another sign is the bright round halo over the Buddha. Even the Saints in Christanity also have this similar bright shinning halo.</p>
              <p>This is when a person's kundalini power has rose through the 7 chakras and came out through the head's crown chakra.</p>
              <p>Of course there is also the Buddhist story that the Cobra shielded Buddha on a rainy day when he was doing deep meditation under the tree.</p>

              <p><strong>Kundalini in the World's Religions</strong></p>
              <p>Kundalini is mainly associated with Hinduism. However, Kundalini as a spiritual experience is thought to have parallels in many of the mystical and gnostic traditions of the world's great religions.</p>
              <p>Many factors point to the universality of the phenomenon. The early Christians might have referred to the concept as 'pneuma', and there are some recent parallels in contemporary Christian Charismatic 'Holy Ghost' phenomena. Religious studies also note parallels in Quakerism, Shakerism, Judaic Shuckling (torso-rocking prayer), the swaying zikr and whirling dervish of Islam, the quiverings of the Eastern Orthodox hesychast, the flowing movements of tai chi, the ecstatic shamanic dance, the ntum trance dance of the Bushman, Tibetan Buddhist tummo heat as practised by Milarepa, and the Indically-derived Andalusian flamenco (Sovatsky, 1998). Kundalini practice is centerfold in Japan's Aum Shinrikyo group and Kundalini-yoga is also one of the stages the practitioner is able to achieve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kundalini is most often awaken through Yoga meditation - which include Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Laya Yoga or Kriya Yoga. I have prepared a meditation to help you on your path should Yoga not be available to you.</p>
              <p>To prepare for this meditation - you might want to tape record the words on this page to listen to as your move through the meditation. Please speak slowly and softly.</p>
              <p>Allow lots of time for the meditation - as you will need to relax when you are finished.</p>
              <p>You may want to listen to music or be in a quiet place - or be in nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Find a quiet place ... free of distractions.</p>
              <p><br>Adjust the lighting and room temperature.</p>
              <p><br>Adjust clothing . . . footwear . . . eyeglasses.</p>
              <p><br>Sit down or lie down<br>Find a position that is comfortable for you.</p>

              <p><br>Your legs . . . your feet . . . totally relaxed</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Focus on your breathing.</p>
              <p><br>Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose.</p>
              <p><br>Retain the breath as long as is comfortable.</p>
              <p><br>Exhale through the mouth slowly and completely.</p>
              <p><br>Repeat for two more breaths . . . or as is comfortable.</p>

              <p><br>Starting from the top of your head visualize your crown chakra opening.</p>
              <p>Watch as pure white light enters your crown chakra<br>and slowly spirals down through your spine.</p>

              <p><br>You may experiences vibrant colors especially in blue, and violet . . .</p>
              <p><br>The white light moves down to your throat chakra releasing your blockages.<br>You may feel like chanting or singing.</p>

              <p><br>The white light now enters your Root Chakra the seat of your kundalini energy.</p>
              <p><br>As it does, it begins to activate the energy of the base (root) chakra.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Feel the energy suddenly emerge from your Root Chakra,<br>Spiraling up through the base of your spine as if it were a coiled snake.</p>
              <p><br>The coiled snake represents the spiraling DNA -<br>opening, activating, bringing you to higher levels of consciousness.</p>

              <p>Kundalini awakening is not confined to Hinduism or Buddhism. Only the word kundalini is.</p>
              <p>This awakening is avilable to every human being whether he indulges in Hinduism or Indian mystical practices or not.</p>
              <p>Anthony Robbins is one that does not go the mystic way. He teaches to awaken the giant in you, thats another way of saying awakening the kundalini in you.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Actually i have asked a local singaporan who went through his full phrase of kundalini awakenings like Gopi Krishan. I asked him did he suffer when his sexual chakra was awakened, he told me that it nearly drove him insane but he knew it is a phrase that he had to go through as he goggled and read a lot on kundalini.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He told me that he knew he would not die from the energy but he just need to pass through the phrase.  Let it come and let it go.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ways to counter such a strong force is</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) start to eat less meat as meat contains hormones that will cause a sexual overdrive running even higher.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) become a vegetarian if possible. cut down from 3 meals to maybe 2 meals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Eating less will help a guy to be not overdriven by the energy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) take cold shower everyday, swim in the sea for a hobby.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) cut down on caffine drinks, spicy food.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5) meditate on emptiness</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">6) meditate and visualise all beauties turning into a skeleton</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is a high level tantric method to solve this problem. It is called the Milrepa Six Yoga postures.  It will help the practioner to dissolve the seminal fluid into air using the six yoga postures. However this is not openly taught to anybody except for those who have received the higher initiation from the Rinpoche Master.</span></p>

              <p>This topic is vital towards Ascension. Based on my personal experience and interactions with others, too many people(&gt;90%) in the tiny island I am currently living in are unaware of the energies in their body.</p>
              <p>I would like to remind all readers that these energies exist and affects everyone regardless of your gender, race, religions or beliefs.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Allow me to expand your knowledge base by sharing what I know. (I assume all of you are already familiar with the seven main chakras in the body.)</p>
              <p>1. Kundalini - the energy emanates from Mother Earth, enters the body at the base of the spine as Kundalini,  ascends in a sprial motion up the spine to the top of the head and outward through the crown chakra.</p>
              <p>2. Prana - the energy emanated from the Great Central Sun, enters through the top of the head at the crown chakra, descends in a spiral motion down the spine, out through the base of the spine and into the Earth.</p>
              <p>3. Love - although the energies are continuously moving up and down the spine in both directions, they merge and unify in the heart chakra as love. The merged energies radiate out through the heart in all directions as love and compassion.</p>
              <p>This love and compassion is essential for the individuals and Earth to ascend to 5D.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The above 3 points are optimum situations. In reality, less than 1% of the world's population has mastery over their chakras well enough to allow the energies to follow through with minimum resistance.</p>
              <p>Please take note that any resistance to these energies ( Kundalini, Prana &amp; Love) should be eliminated.</p>
              <hr>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Please contribute too so that i can also read and learn more from you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I read online that ascending energy flow down the front from our crown opens up the creativity in us. Many became suddenly artistic, creative and bursting with inspiration for arts works , music , designs etc.</span></p>

              Found something interesting from this website, anybody care to discuss?
              
              Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics (Scotton, 1996). In raising Kundalini, spiritual powers (siddhis) are also believed to arise, but many spiritual traditions see these phenomena as obstacles on the path, and encourages their students not to get hung up with them (Kason, 2000). Although the opening of higher chakras are believed to mark advanced spiritual unfoldment, it is important not to measure spiritual growth solely by the opening of higher potentials. According to this view chakras might be under- or overdeveloped, and lower chakras are thought to be just as important as higher.

              Anybody here has received a Shaktipat? 
              
              
              
              Spiritual literature also describes instances where Kundalini is said to be initiated. Initiation of kundalini activity is usually considered to take place by a practice called shaktipat. This is a form of 'laying on of hands' where physical contact to the body or the forehead of the subject by the guru, or initiator, is supposed to cause an experience of Kundalini that later may persist or grow with continuing practice, or fade away if practice is stopped. Scotton (1996) mentions that kundalini-symptomatology is associated with such practices as shaktipat. He also gives a case-example of such a practice from an American meditation retreat. 
              
              According to much contemporary spiritual literature, and the field of Transpersonal Psychology, it is not considered wise to engage in any of these practices without the guidance of a credible teacher or without thorough psychological preparation and education in yoga. Any form of intense contemplative or spiritual practice without the support of a cultural context, or without the support of thorough psychological preparation, is usually considered to be unfortunate, and in some cases even dangerous. Traditional teachers of kundalini meditation also warn neophytes of the potential dangers of experimenting with kundalini Yoga techniques. These warnings should not be underestimated. A growing body of clinical and psychological literature notes the growing occurrence of meditation-related problems in Western contemplative life. Among these we find the Kundalini Syndrome (which is presented more closely later in this article) and different forms of "wind illness" described in the Tibetan tradition.

              shaktipat is the laying of hands on someone's crown (top of head) to bless them. I have seen a father doing that in the open when i walked past this group of guys. He was blessing this young chap and he was like shaking all over. I think some sort of energy has passed to this young chap through this shaktipat. 
              
              Thus kundalini awakenings happen in all faiths.
