              <p>Kundalini practices can lead the realization of your true self, but it is a gradual path in contrast to practices like self-inquiry, which is a direct path. However, some people are more suited to the gradual path of practice.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing. Reason for asking is I experienced sudden jerking of my body while I was lying down or sleeping over a period of time. I don't know how it is related to kundalini awakenings. I know nothing about this prior to this post. Anyway, I don't need this awkenings as I'm a Pureland pracitioner who only knows how to recite Buddha's name diligently. Though the sudden jerking of my body did puzzle me. I ever suspect that some "dirty things" trying to enter my body or what but I'm ok so I don't really care.</p>

              <p>There was a long period that I experienced sudden body jerking many times a night while lying down. It there's a way to stop it, I would rather stop it as I'm not comfortable with it.</p>

              <p>Many kundalini experiencers visited countless doctors about their symptoms and they are often given a clean bill of health.  For eg racing heartbeat and pains in the chest, they go through numerous x-ray, scan and what not , nothing wrong with their heart and chest.</p>
              <p>When you have four or five or more of the symptoms combined together , and when you try your best to find out what's wrong with your body but being told by various doctors/specialists that you are perfectly healthy and normal, then you can consider you are experiencing kundalini.</p>

              <p>Kundalini and Chakra is well accepted in the West.  It's a very traditional knowledge for hindu and the Indians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The West has even started a transpersonal psychology school for these kundalini experiencers. They deal with it in a scientific manner, including out of body, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and using hypnothesis to recall a person's past lifes.</p>
              <p>Kundalini can happen to anyone.  Just share the information and less people will live in fear of being mocked at for being going crazy.</p>

              <p>this 2009 french movie Seraphine is a good example of kundalini.</p>
              <p><strong>Séraphine Louis</strong>, known as "<em>Séraphine de Senlis</em>" ("Séraphine of <a title="Senlis (Oise)" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Senlis_(Oise)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Senlis</span></a>") (1864–1942), was a French painter in the <a title="Na&amp;iuml;ve art" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_art"><span style="color: #0645ad;">naïve style</span></a>. Self-taught, she was inspired by her religious faith and by stained-glass church windows and other religious art. The intensity of her images, both in color and in replicative designs, are sometimes interpreted as a reflection of her own psyche, walking a tightrope between ecstasy and mental illness.</p>
              <p>She was greatly creative and artistic, her arts lived till now but she also hear voices of angels telling her to wed the church. She made a wedding gown and walked down the street and was sent to the mental hospital.</p>

              <p>The awakening of Kundalini energy at the base of your spine can be a dramatic experience that is said to profoundly shift your level of consciousness. Kundalini awakening symptoms vary a great deal from person to person. Some people experience intense physical symptoms. Others might have mostly psychological or emotional symptoms. Kundalini awakenings involve your unresolved physical or emotional situations coming to surface so that you can resolve and release them.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Involuntary Movements</h3>
              <p>As Kundalini energy moves through your body to clear away your physiological blocks, you might experience intense involuntary jerking movements of your body. These movements can include vibrations, shaking, muscle spasms and contractions. You might re-access emotions and memories connected to past injuries and traumas.</p>

              <h3 class="description_section">Yogic Phenomenon</h3>
              <p>Some Kundalini awakening symptoms involve people performing yogic postures or mudras (hand gestures) that you have never learned or could not perform in a regular state of consciousness. Additional symptoms include having an awareness of inner sound or music, tones or mantras. You might also have unusual breathing patterns that are slow or very rapid. You might not even breathe at all for an extended period of time during Kundalini awakening.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Physiological Symptoms</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening can cause strange physiological activity as the movement of energy helps release toxins from your body. Physiological symptoms can include pains in your spine and head, nervous system problems, heart problem and gastrointestinal disturbances. Internal symptoms may include burning sensations, hyperactivity or lethargy, greatly increased or decreased sexual desire, and even spontaneous orgasms. These symptoms might come and go without response to medical treatment.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Emotional Upheaval</h3>
              <p>You might experience an emotional roller coaster with feelings of guilt, depression, anxiety, joy, compassion, love accompanied by uncontrollable crying. These unexplainable emotional shifts are the result of the Kundalini energy helping you clear away your unresolved issues. The confusion and imbalance that accompanies these changes is normal.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Extrasensory Experience</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening symptoms can include unusual visual phenomena such as symbols or visions of lights. You may also hear voices, inner sounds, music or mantras. Symptoms include smelling incense, rose or sandalwood. You might also feel bigger than your body or out of your body with an accompanying sense of disorientation and confusion.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Psychic Ability</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening symptoms include psychic abilities like precognition (knowing something before it happens), telepathy, healing abilities and awareness of auras.</p>
              <h3 class="description_section">Deep Peace</h3>
              <p>Kundalini awakening can cause you to experience an altered state of consciousness through which you can perceive the unity that underlies the world. This creates a deep sense of serenity and peace.</p>

              <p><strong>Kundalini and The Chakras:</strong><br><br>When the chakras are cleansed and emotions have healed one may feel open, clean, wonderful joy and balance. Sometimes this may be mistaken as Kundalini rising, which in fact, is a part of the whole. If you look at the Kundalini as flowing through water dams of the chakras, as the Kundalini rises there is an activation of the properties of that chakra. Many gates are opened at this point so there are numerous symptoms that accompany this transition: emotional, physical, mental, spiritual and increased psychic abilities. Also I might add, when we undergo any spiritual change, or there is a cosmic flux, regardless of the Kundalini, we will experience nearly the same symptoms. So going with the flow of things and being energetically aware is important.<br><br>Some report the Kundalini being activated at different chakra points other than the root/base chakra. As in the above mentioned, the Kundalini is part of the whole. So if a chakra is "more clear" the Kundalini energy could be more "prevalent" in that sector and eventually will start spreading to other points, as in the example of the Kundalini coming from the top chakra down to the lower ones. From the "top down" is sometimes referred to as Grace and embraces the concept of a spiritual awakening. Kundalini primarily concerns itself with the root chakra with the energy moving upward along the spine.<br><br>The action of the "top down" also coincides with the "descension and ascension" process. In "descension" energy is coming down through the spheres passing into your auric energy, ultimately permeating your body. The Life Force is an amazing "creature" and is a gift from Spirit, no matter the way, form or circumstance it becomes activated.<br><br>Ki, Chi and Prana are synonymous as the same Life Force in which some people seem to get confused. You're not alone. Swami Shivom Tirth said that "the difference is not in the nature of the activity but in the consciousness that observes it." Perhaps Ki, Chi and Prana are merely part of the whole making up a common set of experiences that connect them. The Kundalini is hallmarked and documented as dealing with the central channel of the spine directly. Whereas, Ki, Chi and Prana are "more" all pervading, they are your Life Force regardless of the Kundalini rising. However, when the Kundalini is activated is does increase your awareness of Ki, Chi and Prana in all things.</p>

              <p><br>Some of the yogi teaching kundalini and chakra have controversial events about them, either involved in sexual abuses or money abuses.  Just be warned to read up more on these Guru/yogi and gather information about them.</p>

              <p><strong>K</strong>undalini is a psycho-spiritual energy, the energy of the consciousness, which is thought to reside within the sleeping body, and is aroused either through spiritual discipline or spontaneously to bring new states of consciousness, including mystical illumination. <em>Kundalini</em> is Sanskrit for "snake" or "serpent power," so-called because it is believed to lie like a serpent in the root <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/c/chakras.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">chakra</span></span></a> at the base of the spine. In Tantra Yoga kundalini is an aspect of Shakti, the divine female energy and consort of Shiva.(see also <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/t/tantrism.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Tantrism</span></span></a>)</p>
              <p>The power of kundalini is said to be enormous. Those having experienced it claim it to be indescribable. The phenomena associated with it varies from bizarre physical sensations and movements, pain, clairaudience, visions, brilliant lights, superlucidity, psychical powers, ecstasy, bliss, and transcendence of self. Kundalini has been described as liquid fire and liquid light.</p>
              <p>Indian yoga, with its emphasis on the transmutation of energy to higher consciousness, was the chief contributor to the cultivation of kundalini and the preservation of its knowledge prior to present times. Kundalini was a rarity in the West before the 1970s until more attention became centered upon the consciousness. In 1932, for example, psychiatrist Carl G. Jung and others observed that the kundalini experience was seldom seen in the West.</p>
              <p>However, an examination of mystical literature and traditions showed that kundalini, called by various names, seems to have been a universal phenomenon in esoteric teachings for perhaps three thousand years. Kundalini-type descriptions or experiences are found in esoteric teachings of the Egyptians, Tibetans, Chinese, some Native Americans, and the !Kung bushmen of Africa. Kundalini has been interpreted from the Bible as "the solar principle in man," and is referenced in the Koran, the works of Plato and other Greek philosophers, <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/a/alchemy.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">alchemical</span></span></a> tracts (the <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/p/philosophers_stone.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">philosopher's stone</span></span></a>), and in Hermetic, <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/kabbalah.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Kabbalistic</span></span></a>, Rosicrucian, and Masonic writings.</p>
              <p>There has been an awakening of kundalini knowledge among the Western populations since the 1970s because of two major reasons: more people who are trained in the spiritual disciplines are likely to release the energy, and the increased number of people that are aware of kundalini are more likely to recognize its symptoms or benefits.</p>
              <p>Not all kundalini experiences are identical to those classical awakenings experienced in yoga, but may vary in intensity and duration. Typically the yogi meditates to arouse the kundalini and then to raise it through his or her body. (It should be remembered though, not all types of yoga are devoted to the arousal of kundalini.) First, the yogi feels the sensation on heat at the base of the spine, which may be intensely hot or pleasantly warm. The energy then travels up a psychic pathway parallel to the spinal column. The <em>sushumna</em> is the central axis, crisscrossed in a helix by the <em>ida</em> and <em>pingala</em>. As it rises the kundalini activates the chakras in succession. The body becomes cold and corpse-like as the kundalini leaves the lower portions and begins to rise. The yogi is likely to shudder, tremble, or rock violently, feel extreme heat and cold, hear strange but not unpleasant sounds, and see various kinds of lights including an inner light. The length of the kundalini may be fleeting or last several minutes. The objective is to raise the kundalini to the crown chakra, where it unites with the Shiva, or the male polarity, and brings illumination. The yogi then attempts to lower the energy to another chakra, but not below the heart chakra because descent to lower chakras is thought to produce ego inflation, rampant sexual desire, and a host of other ills. By repeatedly raising the kundalini to the crown, the yogi can succeed in having the energy permanently stay there.</p>
              <p>It is said that kundalini opens new pathways in the nervous system; the pain associated with this apparently is due to the nervous system's inability to immediately copy with the energy. Yogis assert that the body must be properly attuned for kundalini through yoga, and that a premature or explosive awakening can cause insanity or death.</p>
              <p>Other individuals, it has been determined by Western psychologists and psychiatrists, have experienced kundalini awakenings but not the explosive kind. One notable characteristic of these lesser awakenings is that the individual thinks, acts, and feels remarkably different. Symptoms may involve involuntary and spasmodic body movements and postures; pain; abnormal breathing patterns; paralysis; tickling itching; vibrating sensations; hot and cold sensations; inner sounds, such as roaring, whistling, and chirping; insomnia; hypersensitivity to environment; unusual or extremes of emotions; intensified sex drive; distortion of thought processes; detachment; disassociation; sensations of physical expansion; and out-of-body experiences (OBEs). Generally the elimination of such symptoms can be brought about by a heavier diet and temporary cessation of meditation. The phenomena of these lesser kundalini awakenings seem to indicate that the definition may have to be expanded from that of the coiled serpent of yoga. Such experienced awakenings are difficult to definitely define though because scientific research of kundalini energy is still in its embryonic stages, little is known of the energy's nonphysical nature, and many of its symptoms are similar to those associated with mental disturbances and stress.</p>
              <p>One of the most dramatic instances of classic kundalini awakening was experienced by Gopi Krishna (1903-1984), of India, who meditated for three hours every morning over seventeen years. On Christmas Day, 1937, he had his explosive awakening with kundalini pouring up his spine. By his personal account, he rocked out of his body and was enveloped in a halo of light. His consciousness expanded in every direction, and a vision of luster unfolded before him; he was like a small cork bobbing on a vast ocean of consciousness. This extraordinary experienced occurred once again, and then Krishna was plunged into twelve years of misery, during which he "experienced the indescribable ecstasies of the mystics…and the agonies of the mentally afflicted." Following twelve years his body apparently adapted to the new energy and stabilized, but he was permanently changed. Everything in his vision was bathed in a silvery light. He heard an inner cadence, called the "unstruck melody" in kundalini literature. Eventually he could experience bliss just by turning his attention inward. He became, as he said, "a pool of consciousness always aglow with light." His creativity soared allowing him to write poetry and nonfiction books.</p>
              <p>Krishna devotedly spent most of the remainder of his life learning the secrets of kundalini. He considered it "the most jealously guarded secret in history" and "the guardian of human evolution." To him it was the driving force behind genius and inspiration. He also thought within the brain is the blueprint to evolve humankind to a higher consciousness, one that makes use of kundalini. Too, he believed kundalini could improve the health of humankind with its ability to regenerate and restore the body, to lengthen life, and eradicate such conditions as mental retardation.</p>
              <p>Krishna made ever effort increase the cultivation of kundalini in the West. Many researchers followed him, but some disagreed with the importance that he gave kundalini. <em><span>A.G.H.</span></em></p>
