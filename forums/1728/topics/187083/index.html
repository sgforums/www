It's like we may respect some other governments - maybe they're communist, but just because of that, does not mean we should practise Communism in our country.<br><br><blockquote>I am not talking about Falun Gong, I am talking about Dharma.

You are talking about dharma? Did Buddha ever teach that the world was created by Him or God? That is obviously your twisted view of Buddhism. Perhaps someone taught by your Falungong teacher - I don't know. But definitely not from Buddhism. That is why I merely said, your views is not in alignment with Buddhist teachings. I have already posted at least two replies refuting your false views, and you have yet to reply. Have you even read them?<br><br>I think it is YOU, who after losing the 'debate' (there isn't a debate to begin with - you have very little knowledge of Buddhadharma, how to debate?), start to criticise and send personal attacks to other people. I have never boasted that I have much dharma knowledge, I really do know only the basics. But when someone with twisted views and lack of dharma knowledge post info that is flawed, it is my responsibility as a moderator, and also the other Buddhist forummers, to try and correct those who have written these posts.<br><br>Now WHO is egotistic - to send personal attacks to others? See my post on <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=186228" rel="nofollow">Ego</a><br><br>And WHO is angry - that is so disturbed by a tiny little sentence telling him your views are not in alignment with Buddhism and cannot resist sending personal attacks in the forum? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote>They only cite passages and scriptures and think they are very knowledgeable where in truth they have only human intelligence.

I do not claim to have much wisdom, but to say that others have lack of wisdom - isn't that Ego again?<br><br><blockquote>I know people cannot be like lamas, or great spiritual people with great compassionate natures, they can only be like ordinary human beings and talk and write with intentions like ordinary human beings.<br><br>Afterall we are human beings and do not have great compassion of a Buddha.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">After reading this still nobody will understand what I write about.</span>[/b]</blockquote>We all can learn. But it is important to know that Compassion must come with Wisdom. And being compassion does not mean allowing all kinds of distorted views to be posted in our forum just because 'we are compassionate to people of all different religions'.</div>
