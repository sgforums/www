              Hi All Brothers and Sisters in Dharma
              Any of you know of others who are terminally ill or going through illness though not
              terminal type can contact me-inbox me your handphone. I can arrange for bed-side
              support group for the illed. He or she will not be alone to face this path. We will walk
              the path with he/she. Below is an article on what our support group does.
              
              The Bed-Side Support Group. (BSSG).
              
              The family goes through a very stressful period when a member is facing the dying process. The process may start with the discovery of a terminal illness; it is followed by the death and ends with the wake and the funeral.
              
              The Bed-Side Support Group helps families through the process by comforting both the dying and the living.
              
              When the grieving family is facing the dying process, CURE and HOPE must be replaced with CARE. The medical professionals take care of the body but the mind needs to be cared for too. Old wounds of the mind can reappear and quite often the pain of the mind can hurt more than the pain of the body. Volunteers at the BSSG provide counseling or just a pair of listening ears. A person may be bedridden but meditation empowers him. Learning meditation enables him to control his own state of mind; an untrained mind can constantly regret the past and worry about the future. Knowing that there are people in the community who are your friends in your need warms the heart. Chanting provides comfort and sharing the Dhamma helps provide answers to many questions.
              
              Many do not like to talk about death but it is a process everyone must go through. If well prepared, the process can be peaceful and joyful. Illness is uncomfortable but we have all experienced some form of illness before. Dying is a change of phase of our life. We too have all experienced changes in phases of our life, from childhood, adolescence, young adult, middle age to old age. The change of phase is a natural process. Every phase of our life ends, the end of one phase is the beginning of another phase, a better phase.
              
              There are some elements in the society who would take advantage of the grief of families to proselytize, often resulting in turmoil and agitation within the family. Others would capitalize on superstitions to sell their services, resulting in hard earned savings being spent on items to be burnt or buried.
              
              The BSSG operates on a strictly by invitation only basis. Volunteers are dispatched when calls for bedside support comes through the Buddhist Fellowship. We have volunteers who are knowledgeable in funeral arrangements and we also provide chanting and memorial service at wakes and funerals.

              <p>This is immeasurable altruistic kindness of true care towards a decease or dying and their immediate melancholic family. As all beings have Buddha seeds thus it yield super benefit to them especially the dying or decease who suffering excruciating pain beyond the living could possibly understand and felt... Grateful _()_ Amituofo</p>
              <p class="style29"><strong>“World Honored One, the bad habits of beings range from minor to major. Since all beings have such habits, their families or relatives should create blessings for them when they are on the verge of dying in order to assist them on the road ahead. That may be done by hanging banners and canopies; lighting oil lamps; reciting the sacred sutras; and making offerings before the images of Buddhas or sages. Another way to assist them is by reciting the names of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Pratyekabuddhas so that the recitation of each name passes by the ear of the dying one and is heard in his fundamental consciousness. </strong></p>
              <p class="style29"><strong>“Suppose the evil karma created by beings were such that they ought to fall into the bad destinies. If their relatives cultivate wholesome causes on their behalf when they are close to death, then their manifold offenses can be dissolved. If relatives can further do many good deeds during the first forty-nine days after the death of such beings, then the deceased can leave the evil destinies forever, be born as humans and gods, and receive supremely wonderful bliss.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></strong></p>
