              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Larry Rosenberg SUMMER 2000 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Death is all around us, everywhere. For the most
              part—following the lead of our culture—we avoid it. But if we do open our
              hearts to death, it can be a great help to us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Throughout our lives, our body has been our closest
              companion. At times it has seemed to be who we are. We have spent hours washing
              and cleaning and clipping and oiling and combing and brushing, taking care of
              our body in all kinds of ways. We have fed it and rested it. We might have had
              differing attitudes toward it, sometimes loving it and sometimes hating it. But
              now this closest companion, which has gone through everything with us, will no
              longer be here. It will no longer take oxygen. It will not circulate blood.
              This body that for so many years was so full of vitality will be lifeless. It
              will be a corpse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The first Panchen Lama says it well: “This body that we have
              cherished for so long cheats us at the time when we need it most.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is also true that this will not be the last change it will
              undergo. As a physical phenomenon, the dead body, if not cremated, will
              decompose, and it is common in Buddhist practice to consider the stages of
              change and decay in order to bring the reality of death home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhist monks sometimes actually visit the charnel grounds
              to contemplate these other forms, to see our final fate, and there is a whole
              series of charnel ground meditations as well. The Mahasatipatthana Sutra, the
              Buddha’s main teaching on what to be mindful of in meditation, offers some
              guidelines as to how to practice with dead bodies at various stages of
              decomposition. For our purposes, visualization of these stages is more
              practical.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As with the earlier contemplations, we first calm the mind
              with breath awareness; then through words and visualizations we create each
              stage and contemplate it. It is important to make a connection between the
              image and our own body. One traditional formulation is: “Truly, my body is of
              the same nature as the body being visualized. It won’t go beyond this nature.
              It is of the same lawfulness.” Our bodies don’t belong to us but to nature. And
              nothing in nature has a stable form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Reflecting in this way helps us come to terms with the nature
              of the body. We view it with wisdom, see that it can’t be any other way. If
              fear or resistance comes up, we see that too with nonjudgmental awareness,
              watching it arise and pass away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ajaan Suwat taught me a version of this practice that I found
              extremely helpful. In his approach, you would start out by visualizing an inner
              organ of the body that you can easily picture, then watch what happens to it
              after death as the body goes through its stages of decomposition. When you
              reach the ninth contemplation (listed here)—when everything is ashes and
              dust—visualize it re-forming to its starting point. Finally—and I found this
              crucial—focus on the mind that is aware of all this. See that it is completely
              separate. This understanding keeps the charnel ground contemplations from becoming
              overwhelmingly depressing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Both of my parents instructed me to have them cremated when
              they died. My father died first, and I placed his picture and the urn with his
              ashes on the home altar where I meditate each day. In addition to my daily
              vipassana practice, I would find some time in most sittings to look at his
              picture and remind myself that the urn contained all that was left of his body
              and that I was not exempt from the same process. Such reflections sometimes
              aroused a powerful sense of how unstable my body is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As I write these words, my mother’s ashes now rest in an urn
              on the same altar. I am carrying out the same practice with her, and it is
              proving to be equally rich. Such teaching is the last gift that my
              extraordinary, generous parents were able to give me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As with many deep truths, people tend to look at the death
              awareness meditations and say, Yes, I know all of that. I know I’m going to die
              someday. I know I can’t take it with me. I know my body will be dust.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And as with other things—as with the law of impermanence
              itself—I would say we know it and we don’t know it. We know it in our heads but
              haven’t taken it into our hearts. We haven’t let it penetrate the marrow of our
              bones. If we had, I can’t help thinking we would live differently. Our whole
              lives would be different. The planet would be </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we really faced our fear of death—and these contemplations
              will bring it up, again and again—our lives would ultimately be lighter and
              more joyful. I don’t propose death awareness to depress us. It enhances our
              ability to live more fully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we understood the reality of death, we would treat each
              other differently. Carlos Castaneda was once asked how we could make our lives
              more spiritual, and he said: Just remember that everyone you encounter today,
              everyone you see, will someday have to die. He’s right. That knowledge changes
              our whole relationship to people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During death awareness practice groups that I’ve led in
              Cambridge, I have asked people to leave the building after lunch, to walk
              around town, and to know that everyone they see will die; everyone is their
              brother or sister in death. It is a wonderful thing to do, especially after a
              period of death awareness meditation. It gives you a whole new attitude toward
              people you encounter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Finally, life is a great teacher and death is a great
              teacher. Death is all around us, everywhere. For the most part—following the
              lead of our culture—we avoid it. But if we do open our hearts to this fact of
              our lives, it can be a great help to us. It can teach us how to live.</span></p>
