              <br> Thusness
                   was deeply impressed by the degree of clarity of this article by S.N. 
                  Goenka-ji when I shared it with him today. It describes something he 
                  wanted to point out about the energy level. He said he has not seen someone (these days) with that degree of clarity in experience and deconstruction. He is describing an experiential state of anatta... when the subject and object constructions dissolve as well as the sense of ownership and personality, into the vibrational patterns of energy.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vridhamma.org%2Fen1995-04&amp;h=EAQE81ft_&amp;enc=AZObSqUKbJTtQiquQ3JprwL4ansqubdo6e5fdYBtzVEDiMi-Kw9hqQXB1kzV1WPsM-VnwGCH3XBWhUHe5WvcJtZICezK46aQxE006Sof-zfv7fijc7GFhIHVnzbuLSQ6H-9mz8BBLQv8_tR3fRVauKL-&amp;s=1">http://www.vridhamma.org/en1995-04</a><br> <br>

              <em><br>The following has been condensed from a public talk given by S. N. Goenka in Bangkok, Thailand in September, 1989.<br> <br> </em>Most Venerable Bhikkhu Saá¹…gha, friends, devotees of Lord Buddha:<br> <br> You have all assembled here to understand what Vipassana is and how it 
                  helps us in our day-to-day lives; how it helps us to come out of our 
                  misery, the misery of life and death. Everyone wants to come out of 
                  misery, to live a life of peace and harmony. We simply do not know how 
                  to do this. It was Siddhattha Gotama's enlightenment that made him 
                  realize the truth: where misery lies, how it starts, and how it can be 
                  eradicated.<br> <br> There were many techniques of meditation prevailing in those days, as 
                  there are today. The Bodhisatta Gotama tried them all, but he was not 
                  satisfied because he found that he was not fully liberated from misery. 
                  Then he started to do his own research. Through his personal experience 
                  he discovered this technique of Vipassana, which eradicated misery from 
                  his life and made him a fully enlightened person.<br> <br> There are many techniques that give temporary relief. When you become 
                  miserable you divert your attention to something else. Then you feel 
                  that you have come out of your misery, but you are not totally relieved.<br> <br> If something undesirable has happened in life, you become agitated. You 
                  cannot bear this misery and want to run away from it. You may go to a 
                  cinema or a theatre, or you may indulge in other sensual entertainments.
                   You may go out drinking, and so on. All this is running away from 
                  misery. Escape is no solution to the problemÄ€ indeed the misery is 
                  multiplying.<br> <br> In Buddha's enlightenment he realized that one must face reality. 
                  Instead of running away from the problem, one must face it. He found 
                  that all the types of meditation existing in his day consisted of merely
                   diverting the mind from the prevailing misery to another object. He 
                  found that practising this, actually only a small part of the mind gets 
                  diverted. Deep inside one keeps reacting, one keeps generating <em>saá¹…khÄ�ras </em>(reactions)
                   of craving, aversion or delusion, and one keeps suffering at a deep 
                  level of the mind. The object of meditation should not be an imaginary 
                  object, it should be reality—reality as it is. One has to work with 
                  whatever reality has manifested itself now, whatever one experiences 
                  within the framework of one's own body.<br> <br> In the practice of Vipassana one has to explore the reality within 
                  oneself—the material structure and the mental structure, the combination
                   of which one keeps calling "I, me, mine." One generates a tremendous 
                  amount of attachment to this material and mental structure, and as a 
                  result becomes miserable. To practise Buddha's path we must observe the 
                  truth of mind and matter. Their basic characteristics should be directly
                   experienced by the meditator. This results in wisdom.<br> <br> Wisdom can be of three types: wisdom gained by listening to others, that
                   which is gained by intellectual analysis, and wisdom developed from 
                  direct, personal experience. Before Buddha, and even at the time of 
                  Buddha, there were teachers who were teaching morality, were teaching 
                  concentration, and who were also talking about wisdom. But this wisdom 
                  was only received or intellectualized wisdom. It was not wisdom gained 
                  by personal experience. Buddha found that one may play any number of 
                  intellectual or devotional games, but unless he experiences the truth 
                  himself, and develops wisdom from his personal experience, he will not 
                  be liberated. Vipassana is personally experienced wisdom. One may listen
                   to discourses or read scriptures. Or one may use the intellect and try 
                  to understand: "Yes, Buddha's teaching is wonderful! This wisdom is 
                  wonderful!" But that is not direct experience of wisdom.<br> <br> The entire field of mind and matter - the six senses and their respective objects - have the basic characteristics of <em>anicca </em>(impermanence), <em>dukkha </em>(suffering) and <em>anattÄ� </em>(egolessness).
                   Buddha wanted us to experience this reality within ourselves. To 
                  explore the truth within the framework of the body, he designated two 
                  fields. One is the material structure: the corporeal structure, the 
                  physical structure. The other is the mental structure with four factors:
                   consciousness; perception; the part of the mind that feels sensation; 
                  and the part of the mind that reacts. So to explore both fields he gave 
                  us <em>kÄ�yÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>(observation of the body) and <em>cittÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>(observation of the mind).<br> <br> How can you observe the body with direct experience unless you can feel 
                  it? There must be something happening in the body which you feel, which 
                  you realize. Then you can say, "Yes, I have practised <em>kÄ�yÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>." One must feel the sensations on the body: this is <em>vedanÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>(observation of body sensations).<br> <br> The same is true for <em>cittÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>. Unless something arises in the mind, you cannot directly experience it. Whatever arises in the mind is <em>dhamma </em>(mental content). Therefore <em>dhammÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>(observation of the contents of the mind) is necessary for <em>cittÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>.<br> <br> This is how the Buddha divided these practices. <em>KÄ�yÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>and <em>vedanÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>pertain to the physical structure. <em>CittÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>and <em>dhammÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>pertain
                   to the mental structure. See from your personal experience how this 
                  mind and matter are related to each other. To believe that one 
                  understands mind and matter, without having directly experienced it, is 
                  delusion. It is only direct experience that will make us understand the 
                  reality about mind and matter. This is where Vipassana starts helping 
                  us.<br> <br> In brief, understand how we practise Vipassana. We start with Anapana, 
                  awareness of respiration—natural respiration. We don't make it a 
                  breathing exercise or regulate the breath as they do in prÄ�á¹‡Ä�yÄ�ma. We 
                  observe respiration at the entrance of the nostrils. If a meditator 
                  works continuously in a congenial atmosphere without any disturbance, 
                  within two or three days some subtle reality on this part of the body 
                  will start manifesting itself: some sensations—natural, normal bodily 
                  sensations. Maybe heat or cold, throbbing or pulsing or some other 
                  sensations. When one reaches the fourth or fifth day of practice, he or 
                  she will find that there are sensations throughout the body, from head 
                  to feet. One feels those sensations, and is asked not to react to them. 
                  Just observe; observe objectively, without identifying yourself with the
                   sensations.<br> <br> When you work as Buddha wanted you to work, by the time you reach the 
                  seventh day or the eighth day, you will move towards subtler and subtler
                   reality. The <em>Dhamma </em>(natural law) will start helping you. You 
                  observe this structure that initially appears to be so solid, the entire
                   physical structure at the level of sensation. Observing, observing you 
                  will reach the stage when you experience that the entire physical 
                  structure is nothing but subatomic particles: throughout the body, 
                  nothing but <em>kalÄ�pas </em>(subatomic particles). And even these 
                  tiniest subatomic particles are not solid. They are mere vibration, just
                   wavelets. The Buddha's words become clear by experience:<br> <br> <em>Sabbo pajjalito loko, sabbo loko pakampito.</em><br> The entire universe is nothing but combustion and vibration.<br> <br> As you experience it yourself, your <em>kÄ�yÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>, your <em>vedanÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>,
                   will take you to the stage where you experience that the entire 
                  material world is nothing but vibration. Then it becomes very easy for 
                  you to practise <em>cittÄ�nupassanÄ� </em>and <em>dhammÄ�nupassanÄ�</em>.<br> <br> Buddha's teaching is to move from the gross, apparent truth to the subtlest, ultimate truth, from <em>oá¸·Ä�rika </em>to <em>sukhuma</em>.
                   The apparent truth always creates illusion and confusion in the mind. 
                  By dividing and dissecting apparent reality, you will come to the 
                  ultimate reality. As you experience the reality of matter to be 
                  vibration, you also start experiencing the reality of the mind: <em>viññÄ�á¹‡a </em>(consciousness), <em>saññÄ� </em>(perception), <em>vedanÄ� </em>(sensation) and <em>saá¹…khÄ�ra </em>(reaction). If you experience them properly with Vipassana, it will become clear how they work.<br> <br> Suppose you have reached the stage where you are experiencing that the 
                  entire physical structure is just vibration. If a sound has come in 
                  contact with the ears you will notice that this sound is nothing but 
                  vibration. The first part of the mind, consciousness, has done its job: 
                  ear consciousness has recognized that something has happened at the ear 
                  sense door. Like a gong which, having been struck at one point, begins 
                  vibrating throughout its structure, so a contact with any of the senses 
                  begins a vibration which spreads throughout the body. At first this is 
                  merely a neutral vibration, neither pleasant nor unpleasant.<br> <br> The perception recognizes and evaluates the sound, "It is a word—what 
                  word? Praise! Oh, wonderful, very good!" The resulting sensation, the 
                  vibration, will become very pleasant. In the same way, if the words are 
                  words of abuse the vibration will become very unpleasant. The vibration 
                  changes according to the evaluation given by the perception part of the 
                  mind. Next the third part of the mind starts feeling the sensation: 
                  pleasant or unpleasant.<br> <br> Then the fourth part of the mind will start working. This is reaction; 
                  its job is to react. If a pleasant sensation arises, it will react with 
                  craving. If an unpleasant sensation arises, it will react with aversion.
                   Pleasant sensation: "I like it. Very good! I want more, I want more!" 
                  Similarly, unpleasant sensation: "I dislike it. I don't want it." 
                  Generating craving and aversion is the part played by the fourth factor 
                  of the mind—reaction.<br> <br> Understand that this process is going on constantly at one sense door or
                   another. Every moment something or the other is happening at one of the
                   sense doors. Every moment the respective consciousness cognizes; the 
                  perception recognizes; the feeling part of the mind feels; and the 
                  reacting part of the mind reacts, with either craving or aversion. This 
                  happens continuously in one's life.<br> <br> At the apparent, surface level, it seems that I am reacting with either 
                  craving or aversion to the external stimulus. Actually this is not so. 
                  Buddha found that we are reacting to our sensations. This discovery was 
                  the enlightenment of Buddha. He said:<br> <br> <em>Saá¸·Ä�yatana-paccayÄ� phasso<br> phassa-paccayÄ� vedanÄ�<br> vedanÄ�-paccayÄ� taá¹‡hÄ�.</em><br> With the base of the six senses, contact arises<br> with the base of contact, sensation arises<br> with the base of sensation, craving arises.<br> <br> It became so clear to him: the six sense organs come in contact with 
                  objects outside. Because of the contact, a sensation starts in the body 
                  that, most of the time, is either pleasant or unpleasant. Then after a 
                  pleasant or unpleasant sensation arises, craving or aversion start—not 
                  before that. This realization was possible because Buddha went deep 
                  inside and experienced it himself. He went to the root of the problem 
                  and discovered how to eradicate the cause of suffering at the root 
                  level.<br> <br> Working at the intellectual level of the mind, we try to suppress 
                  craving and aversion, but deep inside, craving and aversion continue. We
                   are constantly rolling in craving or aversion. We are not coming out of
                   misery through suppression.<br> <br> Buddha discovered the way: whenever you experience any sensation, due to any reason, you simply observe it:<br> <br> <em>Samudaya dhammÄ�nupassÄ« vÄ� kÄ�yasmiá¹ƒ viharati<br> vaya dhammÄ�nupassÄ« vÄ� kÄ�yasmiá¹ƒ viharati<br> samudaya-vaya-dhammÄ�nupassÄ« vÄ� kÄ�yasmiá¹ƒ viharati.</em><br> He dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body.<br> He dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body.<br> He dwells observing the phenomenon of simultaneous arising and passing away in the body.<br> <br> Every sensation arises and passes away. Nothing is eternal. When you 
                  practise Vipassana you start experiencing this. However unpleasant a 
                  sensation may be—look, it arises only to pass away. However pleasant a 
                  sensation may be, it is just a vibration—arising and passing. Pleasant, 
                  unpleasant or neutral, the characteristic of impermanence remains the 
                  same. You are now experiencing the reality of <em>anicca</em>. You are 
                  not believing it because Buddha said so, or some scripture or tradition 
                  says so, or even because your intellect says so. You accept the truth of
                   anicca because you directly experience it. This is how your received 
                  wisdom and intellectual understanding turn into personally experienced 
                  wisdom.<br> <br> Only this experience of <em>anicca </em>will change the habit pattern of
                   the mind. Feeling sensation in the body and understanding that 
                  everything is impermanent, you don't react with craving or aversion; you
                   are equanimous. Practising this continually changes the habit of 
                  reacting at the deepest level. When you don't generate any new 
                  conditioning of craving and aversion, old conditioning comes on the 
                  surface and passes away. By observing reality as it is, you become free 
                  from all your conditioning of craving and aversion.<br> <br> Western psychologists refer to the "conscious mind" Buddha called this part of the mind the <em>paritta citta</em> (a very small part of the mind). There is a big barrier between the <em>paritta citta</em> and the rest of the mind at deeper levels. The conscious mind does not 
                  know what is happening in the unconscious or half-conscious. Vipassana 
                  breaks this barrier, taking you from the surface level of the mind to 
                  the deepest level of the mind. The practice exposes the <em>anusaya kilesa</em> (latent mental defilements) that are lying at the deepest level of the mind.<br> <br> The so-called "unconscious" mind is not unconscious. It is always 
                  conscious of body sensations, and it keeps reacting to them. If they are
                   unpleasant, it reacts with aversion. If they are pleasant, it reacts 
                  with craving. This is the habit pattern, the behaviour pattern, of the 
                  so-called unconscious at the depth of the mind.<br> <br> Here is an example to explain how the so-called unconscious mind is 
                  reacting with craving and aversion. You are in deep sleep. A mosquito 
                  bites you and there is an unpleasant sensation. Your conscious mind does
                   not know what has happened. The unconscious knows immediately that 
                  there is an unpleasant sensation, and it reacts with aversion. It drives
                   away or kills the mosquito. But still there is an unpleasant sensation,
                   so you scratch, though your conscious mind is in deep sleep. When you 
                  wake up, if somebody asks you how many mosquito bites you got during the
                   night, you won't know. Your conscious mind was unaware but the 
                  unconcious knew, and it reacted.<br> <br> Another example: Sitting for about half an hour, some pressure starts 
                  somewhere and the unconscious mind reacts: "There is a pressure. I don't
                   like it!" You change your position. The unconscious mind is always in 
                  contact with the body sensations. You make a little movement, and then 
                  after some time you move again. Just watch somebody sitting for fifteen 
                  to twenty minutes. You will find that this person is fidgeting, shifting
                   a little here, a little there. Of course, consciously he does not know 
                  what he is doing. This is because he is not aware of the sensations. He 
                  does not know that he is reacting with aversion to these sensations. 
                  This barrier is ignorance.<br> <br> Vipassana breaks this ignorance. Then one starts understanding how 
                  sensations arise and how they give rise to craving or aversion. When 
                  there is a pleasant sensation, there is craving. When there is an 
                  unpleasant sensation, there is aversion, and whenever there is craving 
                  or aversion, there is misery.<br> <br> If one does not break this behaviour pattern, there will be continual 
                  craving or aversion. At the surface level you may say that you are 
                  practising what Buddha taught, but in fact, you are not practising what 
                  Buddha taught! You are practising what the other teachers at the time of
                   Buddha taught. Budd<br> ha taught how to go to the deepest level where suffering arises. 
                  Suffering arises because of one's reaction of craving or aversion. The 
                  source of craving and aversion must be found, and one must change one's 
                  behaviour pattern at that level.<br> <br> Buddha taught us to observe suffering and the arising of suffering. 
                  Without observing these two we can never know the cessation of misery. 
                  Suffering arises with the sensations. If we react to sensations, then 
                  suffering arises. If we do not react we do not suffer from them. However
                   unpleasant a sensation may be, if you don't react with aversion, you 
                  can smile with equanimity. You understand that this is all <em>anicca</em>, impermanence. The whole habit pattern of the mind changes at the deepest level.<br> <br> Through the practice of Vipassana, people start to come out of all kinds
                   of impurities of the mind—anger, passion, fear, ego, and so on. Within a
                   few months or a few years the change in people becomes very evident. 
                  This is the benefit of Vipassana, here and now. In this very life you 
                  will get the benefit.<br> <br> This is the land of Dhamma, a land of the teaching of Buddha, a land 
                  where you have such a large Sangha. Make use of the teaching of Buddha 
                  at the deepest level. Don't just remain at the surface level of the 
                  teaching of Buddha. Go to the deepest level where your craving arises:<br> <br> <em>VedanÄ� paccayÄ� taá¹‡hÄ�;<br> vedanÄ�-nirodhÄ� taá¹‡hÄ�-nirodho;<br> taá¹‡hÄ�-nirodhÄ� dukkha-nirodho.</em><br> Sensations give rise to craving.<br> If sensations cease, craving ceases.<br> When craving ceases, suffering ceases.<br> <br> When one experiences the truth of nibbÄ�na—a stage beyond the entire 
                  sensorium—all the six sense organs stop working. There can't be any 
                  contact with objects outside, so sensation ceases. At this stage there 
                  is freedom from all suffering.<br> <br> First you must reach the stage where you can feel sensations. Only then 
                  can you change the habit pattern of your mind. Work on this technique, 
                  this process, at the very deepest level. If you work on the surface 
                  level of the mind you are only changing the conscious part of the mind, 
                  your intellect. You are not going to the root cause, the most 
                  unconscious level of the mind; you are not removing the <em>anusaya kilesa</em>—deep-rooted
                   defilements of craving and aversion. They are like sleeping volcanoes 
                  that may erupt at any time. You continue to roll from birth to death; 
                  you are not coming out of misery.<br> <br> Make use of this wonderful technique and come out of your misery, come 
                  out of the bondages and enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness.<br> <br> May all of you enjoy real peace,real harmony, real happiness.</div>

               working with both you reach the stage of feeling sensation throughout 
              the body—sabba-kÄ�ya. Initially it is very gross, solidified, 
              intensified, but as you keep practising patiently, persistently, 
              remaining equanimous with every experience, the whole body dissolves 
              into subtle vibrations, and you reach the stage of bhaá¹…ga, total 
              dissolution. Having started with natural breath, you learn to reach the 
              important station of feeling sensations in the whole body in one breath:
               from top to bottom as you breathe out, from bottom to top as you 
              breathe in....</span><br><br><span>...A meditator must understand this and the next stage of bhaá¹…ga well.</span><br><br><span>…‘atthi kÄ�yo’ti vÄ� panassa sati paccupaá¹­á¹­hitÄ� hoti.</span><br><br><span>Now
               his awareness is established: "This is body" (‘atthi kÄ�yo’ ti). This is
               the stage in which the body is experienced as "not I," "not mine," but 
              just body, just a mass of vibrations, bubbles, wavelets. It is merely a 
              collection of kalÄ�pas, subatomic particles, arising and passing. There 
              is nothing good or bad, beautiful or ugly, white or brown about it. 
              Initially the acceptance of anattÄ�, "not I," is intellectual or 
              devotional, based on the words of someone else. The actual experience 
              starts with anicca, because every pleasant sensation turns into an 
              unpleasant one. The danger of attachment is realised. It is dukkha 
              because of its inherent nature of change. Then anattÄ� is understood: the
               body is felt as just subatomic particles arising and passing, and 
              automatically the attachment to body goes away. It is a high stage when 
              the awareness, sati, gets established, paccupaá¹­á¹­hitÄ� hoti, in this truth
               from moment to moment.</span><br><br><span>Proceeding further:</span><br><br><span>YÄ�vadeva ñÄ�á¹‡amattÄ�ya paá¹­issatimattÄ�ya…</span><br><br><span>Matta
               means "mere." There is mere wisdom, mere knowledge, mere observation. 
              This is to the extent (yÄ�vadeva) that there is no wise person, no-one to
               know or experience. In another Indian tradition it is called 
              kevala-ñÄ�á¹‡a kevala-dassana, "only knowing, only seeing."</span><br><br><span>In
               the Buddha’s time a very old hermit lived at a place called 
              SupÄ�rapattaá¹ƒ, near present-day Bombay. Having practised the eight 
              jhÄ�nas, deep mental absorptions, he thought himself fully enlightened. A
               well-wisher corrected him, telling him that a Buddha was now present at
               SÄ�vatthi, who could teach him the real practice for becoming 
              enlightened. He was so excited to hear this he went all the way to 
              SÄ�vatthi in northern India. Reaching the monastery, he found that the 
              Buddha had gone out for alms, so he went directly to the city. He found 
              the Buddha walking down a street and immediately understood that this 
              was the Buddha. He asked him then and there for the technique to become 
              an arahant. The Buddha told him to wait for an hour or so, to be taught 
              in the monastery, but he insisted: he might die within the hour, or the 
              Buddha might die, or he might lose his present great faith in the 
              Buddha. Now was the time when all these three were present. The Buddha 
              looked and realised that very soon this man would die, and indeed should
               be given Dhamma now. So he spoke just a few words to this developed old
               hermit, there on the side of the road: Diá¹­á¹­he diá¹­á¹­hamattaá¹ƒ bhavissati… 
              "In seeing there is mere seeing, in hearing mere hearing, in smelling 
              mere smelling, in tasting mere tasting, in touching mere touching, and 
              in cognising only cognising"…viññÄ�te viññÄ�tamattaá¹ƒ bhavissati.</span><br><br><span>This
               was sufficient. At the stage of mere knowing, what is being cognised or
               the identity of who cognises is irrelevant. There is mere 
              understanding. The dip in nibbÄ�na follows, where there is nothing to 
              hold, no base to stand on (anissito).</span><br><br><span>…anissito ca viharati, na ca kiñci loke upÄ�diyati</span><br><br><span>The entire field of mind and matter (loka) is transcended, and there is no world or universe to grasp (upÄ�diyati).</span><br><br><span>Whether
               it is for a few minutes or few hours depends on the capacity and 
              previous work of the person. A person in nibbÄ�na is as if dead: none of 
              the senses function, although inside the person is very aware, very 
              alert, very awakened. After that the person returns and again starts 
              functioning in the sensory field, but a fully liberated person has no 
              attachment, no clinging, because there is no craving. Such a person will
               cling to nothing in the entire universe and nothing clings to them. 
              This is the stage described.</span><br><br><span>So
               a meditator practises. Those who practise these sentences will 
              understand the meaning of every word given, but mere intellectualisation
               won’t help. Real understanding comes with experience.</span><br><br><span>IriyÄ�pathapabbaá¹ƒ—Postures of the Body</span><br><br><span>IriyÄ�patha are postures of the body.</span><br><br><span>gacchanto
               vÄ� ‘gacchÄ�mÄ«’ti pajÄ�nÄ�ti, á¹­hito vÄ� ‘á¹­hitomhÄ«’ ti pajÄ�nÄ�ti, nisinno vÄ�

               walking (gacchanto), a meditator knows well ‘I am walking’ 
              (‘gacchÄ�mi’). Similarly, whether standing (á¹­hito), sitting (nisinno), or
               lying down (sayÄ�no) a meditator knows this well. This is just the 
              beginning. In the sentence that follows, not "I", but just "body" is 
              known well in whatever posture (yathÄ� yathÄ� paá¹‡ihito).</span><br><br><span>YathÄ� yathÄ� vÄ� panassa kÄ�yo paá¹‡ihito hoti, tathÄ� tathÄ� naá¹ƒ pajÄ�nÄ�ti.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

              technique was the Chinese Zen monk Han-shan, who practiced Kuan-Yin's method of
              hearing on a bridge next to a noisy torrent of water. Han-shan reported that at
              first the noise of the water was quite audible, but in time it could only be
              heard when his thoughts arose, and not when they ceased. Then one day, his practice
              improved such that he did not hear the sound of the water any longer: sounds
              and noises vanished completely. <br> <br> When describing this method in the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, Kuan-Yin said:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #17365d;  ">I entered into the
              stream of the self-nature of the sense of hearing, thereby eliminating the
              sound of what was heard. Now proceeding from this stillness, both sound and
              silence ceased to arise. Advancing in this way, both hearing and what was heard
              melted away and vanished. When hearing and what is heard are both forgotten,
              then the sense of hearing leaves no impression in the mind. When sense and the
              objects of sense both become empty, then emptiness and sense merge and reach a
              state of absolute perfection. When emptiness and what is being emptied are both
              extinguished, then arising and extinction are naturally extinguished. At this
              point the absolute emptiness of nirvana became manifest, and suddenly I
              transcended the mundane and supra-mundane worlds.</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #17365d;  "></span></p>
