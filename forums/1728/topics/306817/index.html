              <p>In Buddhism, we do not believe in fate, and nothing is pre-determined. Buddha taught that Fatalism is a false view.</p>
              <p>We believe in karma, as well as causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>When causes meets conditions, something happens... but it is in no means 'fated'.</p>
              <p>We must understand that karma is only one out of many factors, and without conditions there is no ripening of karma.</p>
              <p>Our karma are entirely our own doing, in fact karma literally means 'Action'. And karmic causes can lead to karmic effects when conditions are met. There is no judge or higher power or something that determines 'fate'. It is simply the natural way/law the universe work - of causes, conditions and effect.</p>

              <p>The early
              Buddhist notion of karma
              focused on the liberating potential of the present moment</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-large;">K</span>arma is
              one of
              those words we don't translate. Its basic meaning is simple enough --
              action. But because of the weight the Buddha's teachings give to the
              role of action, the Sanskrit word "karma'' is packed with many meanings
              and the English word "action'' can't carry all its luggage. <br> <br> This is why we've simply airlifted the original word into our
              vocabulary.<br> <br> But when we try unpacking the connotations the word carries, now that
              it has arrived into everyday usage, we find that most of its luggage
              has gotten mixed up in transit. <br> <br> In the eyes of most Westerners, for example, karma functions like fate
              -- bad fate, at that: an inexplicable, unchangeable force coming out of
              our past, for which we are somehow vaguely responsible and which we are
              powerless to fight.<br> <br> "I guess it's just my karma,'' I've heard people sigh when bad fortune
              strikes with such force that they see no alternative to resigned
              acceptance. <br> <br> The fatalism implicit in this statement is one reason why so many
              people are repelled by the concept of karma, for it sounds like the
              kind of callous myth-making that can justify almost any kind of
              suffering or injustice in the status quo: "If he's poor, it's because
              of his karma.'' "If she's been raped, it's because of her karma.'' <br> <br> From this, it seems a short step to saying that he or she deserves to
              suffer, and so doesn't deserve our help. <br> <br> This misperception comes from the fact that the Buddhist concept of
              karma came to the West at the same time as non-Buddhist concepts, and
              so ended up with some of their luggage.</p>
              <p>Although many Asian concepts of
              karma
              are fatalistic, the early Buddhist concept was not fatalistic at all.
              In fact, if we look closely at early Buddhist ideas of karma, we'll
              find that they give even less importance to myths about the past than
              most modern Americans do. <br> <br> For the early Buddhists, karma was non-linear. Other Indian schools
              believed that karma operated in a straight line, with actions from the
              past influencing the present, and present actions influencing the
              future. As a result, they saw little room for free will.<br> <br> Buddhists, however, saw that karma acts in feedback loops, with the
              present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions;
              present actions shape not only the future but also the present.<br> <br> This constant opening for present input into the causal process makes
              free will possible. <br> <br> This freedom is symbolised in the imagery the Buddhists used to explain
              the process: flowing water. Sometimes the flow from the past is so
              strong that little can be done except to stand fast, but there are also
              times when the flow is gentle enough to be diverted in almost any
              direction. <br> <br> So, instead of promoting resigned powerlessness, the early Buddhist
              notion of karma focused on the liberating potential of what the mind is
              doing with every moment. <br> <br> Who you are -- what you come from -- is not anywhere near as important
              as the mind's motives for what it is doing right now. Even though the
              past may account for many of the inequalities we see in life, our
              measure as human beings is not the hand we've been dealt, for that hand
              can change at any moment. <br> <br> We take our own measure by how well we play the hand we've got. If
              you're suffering, you try not to continue the unskilful mental habits
              that would keep that particular karmic feedback going. <br> <br> If you see that other people are suffering, and you're in a position to
              help, you focus not on their karmic past but your karmic opportunity in
              the present: Some day you may find yourself in the same predicament
              that they're in now, so here's your opportunity to act in the way you'd
              like them to act toward you when that day comes. <br> <br> This belief that one's dignity is measured, not by one's past but by
              one's present actions, flew right in the face of the Indian traditions
              of caste-based hierarchies, and explains why early Buddhists had such a
              field day poking fun at the pretensions and mythology of the Brahmans. <br> <br> As the Buddha pointed out, a Brahman could be a superior person not
              because he came out of a Brahman womb, but only if he acted with truly
              skilful intentions. <br> <br> We read the early Buddhist attacks on the caste system and, aside from
              their anti-racist implications, they often strike us as quaint. <br> <br> What we fail to realise is that they strike right at the heart of our
              myths about our own past: our obsession with defining who we are in
              terms of where we come from -- our race, ethnic heritage, gender,
              socio-economic background, sexual preference -- our modern tribes. We
              put inordinate amounts of energy into creating and maintaining the
              mythology of our tribe so that we can take vicarious pride in our
              tribe's good name. Even when we become Buddhists, the tribe comes
              first. We demand a Buddhism that honours our myths. <br> <br> From the standpoint of karma, though, where we come from is old karma,
              over which we have no control. What we "are'' is a nebulous concept at
              best -- and pernicious at worst, when we use it to find excuses for
              acting on unskilful motives. <br> <br> The worth of a tribe lies only in the skilful actions of its individual
              members. Even when those good people belong to our tribe, their good
              karma is theirs, not ours. And, of course, every tribe has its bad
              members, which means that the mythology of the tribe is a fragile
              thing. To hang onto anything fragile requires a large investment of
              passion, aversion, and delusion, leading inevitably on to more
              unskilful actions in the future. <br> <br> So the Buddhist teachings on karma, far from being a quaint relic from
              the past, are a direct challenge to a basic thrust -- and basic flaw --
              in our culture. Only when we abandon our obsession with finding
              vicarious pride in our tribal past, and can take actual pride in the
              motives that underlie our present actions, can we say that the word
              karma, in its Buddhist sense, has recovered its luggage. <br> <br> And when we open the luggage, we'll find that it's brought us a gift:
              the gift we give ourselves and one another when we drop our myths about
              who we are, and can instead be honest about what we're doing with each
              moment -- at the same time making the effort to do it right.</p>

              <p>I dont think this world works as easily as cause and effect. In fact, buddha have said that karma is only 1 out of i think 5 factors for something to occurr. In Buddhism, we dont call fate as it is. We usually say destiny. Destiny that are current is pre-destinied, and destiny in your future is not. Why is it pre-destinied? It is because of our karma in our past lives. What we experience now is what we have done previously. Our current destiny is already set according to our past karma. The reason why some people are ill is because of their unwholesome actions which they have done in their past. This is the law of cause and effect. It is not appropirate to say that getting this illness is un predestinied. In fact, its already destinied that this will happen. Destiny is not controlled by some outer or supreme force, but we control our own destiny.</p>
              <p>Destiny is 'fated' because of karma. Therefore, there is something call Fate/Destiny or whatever you call it. Ever wondered why when you meet some people, you have a strong liking for them or both of you are sort of very close although it is the first time meeting? Thats because of our past karmic afflictions with them. Therefore we change our own fate, we seal our own fate and control it all through karma.</p>

              <p>Actually we cannot say that karma is pre-destined, because as you said karma is merely one of the conditions. When causes and conditions meet, an effect occurs. But karma is not a pre-determining force... and the Buddha taught that pre-determinism or fatalism are false views.</p>
              <p>Rather than pre-determinism, we should simply see all as merely the arising of the congregation of causes and conditions. Karma is volition and in this moment negative karma or positive karma may arise depending on your mind, speech, action.

              <p>I dont think this world works as easily as cause and effect. In fact, buddha have said that karma is only 1 out of i think 5 factors for something to occurr. In Buddhism, we dont call fate as it is. We usually say destiny. Destiny that are current is pre-destinied, and destiny in your future is not. Why is it pre-destinied? It is because of our karma in our past lives. What we experience now is what we have done previously. Our current destiny is already set according to our past karma. The reason why some people are ill is because of their unwholesome actions which they have done in their past. This is the law of cause and effect. It is not appropirate to say that getting this illness is un predestinied. In fact, its already destinied that this will happen. Destiny is not controlled by some outer or supreme force, but we control our own destiny.</p>
              <p>Destiny is 'fated' because of karma. Therefore, there is something call Fate/Destiny or whatever you call it. Ever wondered why when you meet some people, you have a strong liking for them or both of you are sort of very close although it is the first time meeting? Thats because of our past karmic afflictions with them. Therefore we change our own fate, we seal our own fate and control it all through karma.</p>

              <p>I agree with what you say,especially about the example whereby some people can like each at the first meeting.</p>
