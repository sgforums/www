              Moment</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span class="author8"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; ">Jack

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">The "present moment" is on everyone's lips nowadays. But do we
              really know what we mean by it? The philosophers of antiquity help us get
              underneath the cliché.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">In the history of Buddhism, popular movements that present meditation as
              a relatively simple practice, accessible without extensive training, are
              nothing new. It happened in 8th-century China, and again in 19th-century Burma.
              And—growing directly out of the Burmese movement—it is happening again in
              today’s secularized mindfulness movement, represented most notably in the
              practice of MBSR, or Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Wherever such movements flourish, a backlash quickly develops. No one
              denies the potential benefit from learning to calm or focus the mind, but many
              Buddhist teachers worry that an approach may be easy and give immediate
              benefits and yet risk discarding essential elements in the Buddha’s teachings.
              And so the battle is joined. Does the secularized mindfulness movement zero in
              on the most vital points, or is it just “McMindfulness,” a simplified, less
              nourishing version of dharma that turns meditation into a form of self-help?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The debate will no doubt continue, yet both sides fail to ask an
              essential question: if MBSR presents mindfulness as “purposeful, nonjudgmental
              attention <em>in the present moment</em>,” do we really know what we mean by the
              present moment? Can we assume in advance that we know how to maintain
              present-moment attention? Asking these questions will do a lot to clarify what
              the mindfulness movement does and does not do. If we understand what goes on in
              the present moment and how best to engage it, we may discover new resources for
              bridging the divide between traditional mindfulness practice and the current
              mindfulness boom.<br> <br> <strong>Starting Way Back</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Around the start of the Common Era, and for centuries afterward, several
              flourishing schools of Western philosophy, especially the Stoics and the
              Epicureans, presented their teachings much as Buddhism does: as a way of life
              and a path to deeper realization and profound peace. As far as we know,
              followers of these schools did not practice sitting meditation in the Buddhist
              sense, but they did offer a meditative approach to daily life, based on
              cultivating the insights of their founders. Both schools emphasized the
              importance of present-moment attention, and their teachings are helpful in
              reflecting on how we understand mindfulness today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Why look back to the past, instead of striking out on our own? For one
              thing, wisdom is scarce, and it’s always good to seek guidance from the great
              thinkers of the past. More fundamentally, however, the dialogue between
              Buddhism and the West in recent decades has been too narrow in its range. In
              our historically-challenged culture, we seldom look back at the sources that
              shape how we make sense of our lives. There are plenty of people ready to tell
              us about the links between Buddhism and psychology, and others who see
              interesting possibilities for a conversation between Buddhism and science. Some
              look to the 18th- and 19th-century Romantics, such as Schiller and Blake, or
              reach back to individual philosophers, such as Spinoza or Nietzsche. But if
              that’s as far as we go, we are leaving out of account more than 2,000 years of
              Western thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Because the Stoics and the Epicureans share with Buddhism a concern for
              how to live one’s life well, they are natural conversational partners for the
              meeting of dharma traditions with the West. In fact, their worldview may be
              closer to a Buddhist outlook than anything we are likely to find by sifting
              through the insights of the materialistic, nihilistic thinkers of our own time.
              You could put it this way: can the Buddha’s teachings truly transform who we
              are when we don’t know in any deep sense who we have been?<br> <br> <strong>Three Ways to Be Present</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">When we bring the Stoic and Epicurean teachings into the picture, it
              makes sense to distinguish at least three different ways to practice being
              attentive in the present. All three figure in the current debates, but usually
              they are not clearly separated out. For clarity’s sake, we can call them
              therapeutic presence, joyful presence, and mindful presence.<br> <br> <em>Therapeutic Presence</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">One way to practice present-moment attention is to let go of the past
              and the future. The guiding principle is hardly subject to debate: we all spend
              a lot of our time obsessing about the past and the future—worry, regrets,
              replaying and anticipating, making plans, falling into fantasies and daydreams.
              If we can learn to drop such characteristic moves, our world becomes a simpler,
              kinder, friendlier place, and we can live without all those desires, judgments,
              and the like. Here’s how Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of MBSR, put it in an
              interview: “Quite simply, the future is not here. . . . The past is already
              over. We have to deal with things as they are in the moment. . . . Healing and
              transformation are possible the moment we accept the actuality of things as
              they are.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">A wide range of Buddhist texts and teachers make the same point, and it
              has become central in the modern mindfulness movement. As Thich Nhat Hanh
              writes in a book on mindfulness, “From now, I’ll use the term ‘mindfulness’ to
              refer to keeping one’s consciousness alive to the present reality.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Here we can start to make some comparisons, because
              the Stoics gave the same advice. Marcus Aurelius wrote, “If you separate from .
              . . everything you have done in the past, everything that disturbs you about
              the future . . . and apply yourself to living the life that you are living—that
              is to say, the present—you can live all the time that remains to you until your
              death in calm, benevolence, and serenity.”</span>                            <br> <br> <em>Joyful Presence</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Another way to attend to the present moment is to cultivate full
              appreciation of the rich experience available in each moment. Think of the
              well-known MBSR practice of slowly, mindfully eating a raisin. It has been
              argued that this dimension of mindfulness meditation owes less to classical
              Buddhist teachings than to the unacknowledged elements of 19th-century
              Romanticism that color modern Western Buddhist understanding. Still, joyful
              appreciation (or the closely related practice of complete acceptance) is by now
              firmly embedded in modern Buddhist practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The best classical comparison here comes from the Epicureans, who
              insisted that only in the present moment is happiness possible. What is more,
              they said, happiness in this one moment is all the happiness one could ever
              want. In his influential reinterpretation of ancient philosophy as presenting a
              way of life rather than just abstract ideas, the late historian of philosophy
              Pierre Hadot summarized this Epicurean outlook: happiness comes “when we learn
              to accord infinite value to the slightest moment of existence.” It was the
              Epicurean poet Horace who coined the well-known phrase<em> Carpe diem</em>,
              “Seize the day,” and even if there is more of melancholy in this phrase than
              joy (act now, for death awaits), it can stand in for joyful presence, for that
              is how it is most often understood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Mindful Presence</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Buddhist scholars regularly point out that the word translated into
              English as “mindfulness” (<em>sati</em> in Pali, <em>smriti</em> in Sanskrit) has
              ‘remembering’ as its fundamental meaning. This is “mindful presence”—presence
              that remembers. And to be clear, “remembering” here does not just mean
              remembering to be mindful: it refers instead to remembering what has value,
              what matters most.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Secular mindfulness practice (including MBSR) has little to say about
              mindful presence, yet there’s no denying that it figures prominently in the
              tradition. Let’s take the example of present-moment attention to the body. In
              the <em>Satipatthana Sutta</em>, the single most important scriptural source for
              the mindfulness-movement teachings, mindfulness of the body certainly includes
              “therapeutic presence,” or nonjudgmental, present-moment attention to body
              sensations:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; ">When walking, the monk
              discerns, ‘I am walking.’ When standing, he discerns, ‘I am standing.’ When
              sitting, he discerns, ‘I am sitting.’ When lying down, he discerns, ‘I am lying
              down.’ Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it. . . . when
              going forward and returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward
              and looking away . . . when bending and extending his limbs . . . when carrying
              his outer cloak, his upper robe and his bowl . . . when eating, drinking,
              chewing, and savoring . . . when urinating and defecating . . . when walking,
              standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, he
              makes himself fully alert.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">But the sutta goes on from there in a very different vein, instructing
              listeners to practice “mindful presence” with respect to the body.
              Specifically, it tells the assembled monks to remember certain fundamental
              insights meant to counteract attachment to the body. Here are three: view the
              various constituents of the body (blood, pus, snot, phlegm, urine, feces and
              the like) as unclean or repulsive; analyze the body as composed of the basic
              elements of matter; and remind yourself that the body is mortal and will one
              day turn into a decaying corpse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">With mindful presence, then, we move beyond immediate sensory experience
              and disregard for past and future, beyond joyful and therapeutic presence. In
              fact, mindful presence might seem to take us out of the realm of present-moment
              attention entirely. After all, being mindful that the body is constructed out
              of the basic building blocks of matter invites reflecting on the body’s past
              origins, while being mindful of the body’s decay after death invokes events
              that will take place in the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">A better way to make sense of the practice of mindful presence, however,
              is to see it as inviting a broader sense of what it means to inhabit the
              present moment. We can see this clearly if we focus on the fact of mortality.
              True, your death is an event in the future, but the certainty that you will die
              is a present reality, true in each present moment. Dropping your concern with
              the future (therapeutic presence) does not mean losing sight of your mortality,
              which (as Buddhist and Western thinkers alike steadily remind us) colors every
              moment of our lives. As Marcus Aurelius writes: “Let your every deed and word and
              thought be those of one who might depart from this life this very moment.” For
              the very same thought, see the <em>Bhaddekaratta Sutta</em>: “Today, effort must
              be made; tomorrow death may come, who knows?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Mindful presence, then, does not turn away from the present moment at
              all. However, it requires us to rethink what goes in that moment. As human
              beings, we do not live in a point-instant present, even if experience does
              change from one moment to the next. Instead, we live in a present that draws on
              the past and the future. We understand our own experience in terms of ongoing
              stories that we use to make sense of the way things are. Our sense of having or
              being a self, for instance, is such a story. My present experience only makes
              sense in terms of who I am, where I come from and where I am headed; my plans
              and projects, my history and circumstances. Therapeutic presence encourages us
              not to cling to these elements of experience, which means radically simplifying
              the story, and there is clearly value in this. Yet when we operate in the
              world, the story of our lives—unfolding from past to future, shaped by memory
              and anticipation—structures our experience at the deepest level.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Mindful presence acknowledges this wider temporal presence and asks us
              to frame it according to the insights of the Buddha. To go back to the example
              of giving mindful present attention to the body, you do not just experience
              feelings and sensations in the body; rather, right now, in the present, you see
              the body as repulsive, composite, and mortal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">When you practice this kind of mindful presence—presence that remembers
              or keeps in mind key Buddhist teachings—a certain attitude toward life takes
              hold. For instance (keeping the focus on the body), you no longer concern
              yourself as much with taking care of the body, beautifying the body, gratifying
              bodily impulses, and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">It may seem that the practice of mindful presence puts us squarely back
              within traditional mindfulness practice, but looking to the traditions of
              Western philosophy helps us see that what is at stake here is much broader.
              There is a striking parallel between Stoic and Buddhist practice here that
              helps make the point clear. Stoic writers regularly invite their followers to
              practice by memorizing (shades of sati/smriti!) short sayings or maxims that
              embody Stoic teachings, so that you always have them on hand to apply to each
              new situation. Here is the Stoic statesman and philosopher Seneca (c. 4 BC) on
              such short sayings: “These are the precepts that [the practitioner] must never
              let go. Rather, he must cling fast to them and make them a part of himself, and
              by daily meditation reach the point where these salutary maxims occur to him of
              his own accord.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Now, exactly the same instruction appears in the well-known root text of
              the mind training teachings (<em>lojong</em>) brought to Tibet in the 11th
              century by the Buddhist master Atisha. The text consists of 59 sayings. Saying
              9 instructs the practitioner: “Use sayings to train in all forms of activity.”
              For our purposes, we can rephrase this slightly: “To train the mind, use
              sayings in each present moment of action.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">What emerges here is that Buddhists and Stoics both ask us to maintain
              present-moment attention, but they also both understand that this will involve
              a way of being present that takes us beyond the particulars of “this single
              moment.” The present moment is not defined solely by letting go of past and
              future (therapeutic presence), nor by accepting and appreciating what arises
              right now (joyful presence), but by choosing in this very moment how we make
              sense of the world (mindful presence).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">There is,
              however, a fourth way of practicing attention in the present moment, which we
              might call “active presence.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Active Presence</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Mindful presence involves choosing to orient ourselves in the world in
              accord with a certain outlook or set of teachings, whether we have them
              available as sayings and instructions or have embedded them in our awareness in
              some other form. But it is not enough to accept this outlook. We also have to
              take responsibility for this outlook, to act on our convictions. This is
              “active presence.” Open and attentive to the multiple dimensions of experience,
              seeing the world as we understand it to be, we act accordingly. This is a point
              emphasized by the Stoics. We can only act in the present, not the past or the
              future. When we practice active presence, choosing how to act in this moment,
              we also choose who and what we will be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Active presence—choosing how to act in this moment—takes mindfulness out
              of the range of sitting meditation and inserts it into daily life. Think here
              of practicing the eightfold path. We start with right view and right thoughts
              or intentions, and then live our lives accordingly. As the Sri Lankan Buddhist
              monk and author Henepola Gunaratana has emphasized, to live our lives in accord
              with the eightfold path means practicing mindfulness—“active mindfulness”—in
              each moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">In this sense, active presence includes the other three forms of
              present-moment attention already identified here. In therapeutic presence, you
              actively choose where to focus your attention. In joyful presence, you actively
              choose how you react to your experience. In mindful presence, you actively
              choose how to make sense of your experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Active presence has the potential to go further, for it invites an
              open-ended engagement with experience. When I am actively present, I choose the
              whole: what values I will enact, what commitments I will make, what
              understanding I will bring to bear. Potentially, it makes available for questioning
              each and every ordinary, taken-for-granted structure of my experience. It puts
              everything into play. What is my relationship to the objects I encounter in the
              world, or to other beings? How do my moods and emotions affect the ways I
              engage the world? What happens when thought carries me away from direct
              experience? Can I be attentive <em>within</em> thought? Each and every dimension
              of experience is available; nothing is presupposed. Each position I take is
              more a provisional positioning than a fixed structure.<br> <br> <strong>Taking the Present-Moment Plunge</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Seneca wrote, “<em>Toti se inserens mundo</em>,” a phrase translated by
              Hadot as “plunging oneself into the totality of the world.” Taking this plunge
              could be understood as the heart of active presence, of “being here now.” The
              Tibetan lama Tarthang Tulku writes in <em>Love of Knowledge</em> (1987) that the
              self lives in the world like an illegal alien, always afraid that its identity
              will be questioned. “Taking the plunge” is the exact opposite. It means
              fearless presence, total involvement, holding nothing back. If it is difficult
              for the self to do this, if it clings to and defends its own positions and
              wants, that only underscores the need to challenge the self and the conditions
              it imposes on experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Those who question the contemporary mindfulness movement ask whether it
              does justice to the Buddha’s revolutionary call to transform both self and
              world. But we do not have to conclude from this that the only alternative is to
              stay within the tradition, though for some that will clearly be the right
              response. Active presence does justice to the Buddha’s revolutionary impulse on
              a wholly different basis. Not holding back, fearlessly questioning, always
              going beyond what we know, active presence offers a way into the deeper
              existential and universal concerns that the Buddha raised through his
              teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">From the perspective of active presence, neither therapeutic nor joyful
              presence is sufficient to turn us toward the existential transformation that
              the Buddha asked of us. Mindful presence is the right place to start, provided
              we are ready to respond to what we call to mind. It is really a question of how
              we live in the world. When we engage the present, we engage the whole of our
              lives. When we plunge into the world, we accept the whole of what is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The
              present moment is more than we imagine it to be. Active in the present, we act
              on our intentions and our values as well as our perceptions and our attitudes.
              Ready to question our ordinary concerns, commitments, and understanding, we
              come close to the teaching of the Buddha, even if we choose not to think and
              see and frame reality in accord with the models for understanding that the
              Buddha put in place. Present in the moment, we are present to ourselves, and
              perhaps also to the universal truths that the Buddha made available.</span></p>
