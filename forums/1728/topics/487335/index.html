                  anniversary of the Indian Ocean Tsunami, a psychologist who volunteered to help
                  survivors in Thailand recalls her staggering confrontation with death and
                  considers how a Buddhist country coped with the truth of impermanence. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">On the morning of December 26, 2004, shortly after
                  the sun rose over the Andaman Sea, three killer waves swept over the
                  southwestern shores of Thailand, swallowing—and spitting back out—5,385 people.
                  Thousands more vanished completely in the sea. As this was happening, I was
                  miles up in the air, returning from a pilgrimage in India to northern Thailand,
                  my home for the previous two and a half years. A few hours earlier, I had sat
                  in the Bangkok airport, awaiting a connecting flight, as planeloads of tourists
                  seeking fun, relaxation, and novelty took off for the coastal resorts that now
                  lay in watery ruins. The first images I had of the devastation unrolled on my
                  TV screen later that day in the lakeside town of Phayao, where my husband and I
                  were living during our sabbatical.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">There were shots of bikini-clad corpses on beaches
                  and stunned survivors frantically searching among them for loved ones. Video
                  clips showed demolished homes and hotels, capsized fishing boats, crushed cars,
                  and acres of debris. Seawater still gushed from broken storefront windows and
                  down streets and alleys. The Indian Ocean tsunami turned out to be one of the
                  most devastating natural disasters in recorded history, leaving an estimated
                  227,898 dead, 125,000 injured, 45,752 missing, and 1.69 million displaced over
                  a 22,540-square-mile area. In that idyllic tropical setting, the day after
                  Christmas, who could have imagined that “this will be the day that I die.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The next morning, I got a call from a rabbi friend
                  in Bangkok who had hurled himself into the disaster relief effort. As he
                  described the tragedies unfolding in the wake of the tsunami, it occurred to me
                  that I could provide psychological support to survivors and told him I would
                  fly to the southern beach city of Phuket. At the time, there were just 40 to 50
                  psychiatrists in all of Thailand and the Phuket International Hospital,
                  inundated with traumatized and wounded survivors, had no designated psychiatric
                  ward. When I arrived, the one resident Thai psychiatrist had barely slept since
                  the tsunami struck a few days earlier, so I offered to cover for him while he
                  rested. “Are you sure?” he asked and proceeded to pile dozens of charts onto my
                  outstretched arms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For the next two days and nights, I went from room
                  to room, visiting patients and hearing survivors’ stories as nurses and doctors
                  came in and out, delivering painkillers, changing IVs and catheters, and
                  conducting pre- and post-op consultations. Embassy officials were frequent
                  visitors, too, arranging medical transport for wounded tourists who had no
                  clothing, passports, or money. Whether groggy from medication, panicked from
                  trauma, or alert with anticipation, most patients were eager to tell their
                  stories. “We were waiting for our omelets when . . . ” “I was playing with my
                  children when . . . ” “I was riding a motorbike when . . . ” They described
                  terror and chaos—people running, yelling, hurling themselves into trees or
                  holding on to railings they prayed wouldn’t collapse. And then—the realization
                  of who was missing and what was destroyed. I listened carefully to each story,
                  aware of the teller’s need to narrate the details of the experience, with all
                  of its attendant confusion, pain, and disbelief. I could feel each one trying
                  to piece together the events, like a puzzle, one memory at a time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For the previous 18 months, I had been living at forest monasteries in
                  Thailand, where I had learned to recite the short, straightforward daily
                  reflection on impermanence: “All that is mine, beloved and pleasing, will
                  become otherwise, will become separated from me.” The reflection, similar to
                  ones I practice every Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, helps awaken us
                  to the harsh realities of life but also to its transcendent and eternal
                  qualities. We’re forced to think about where and what our refuge is. What can
                  we rely on? Our worldly pursuits inevitably end in sorrow; acquisitions in
                  dispersion; buildings in destruction; meetings in separation; birth in death.
                  These facts—the irrefutable laws of nature—took on a visceral meaning as I met
                  with those facing sudden, irrevocable loss.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Regardless of their physical condition, nearly
                  everyone I visited was in shock, consumed by grief, uncertainty, and dread.
                  They were reliving the tsunami—the roar of crashing waves, the desperate cries
                  of victims—especially during sleepless nights, as they tossed and turned in
                  their hospital beds. Where were their families and friends? How could they
                  search for them? “What about those searching for me? How will they find me
                  here? Where should I even begin?” I was asked, over and over again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">One morning I looked in on a Dutch man who owned a
                  resort that had been reduced to splintered timber and rubble, and who still
                  hadn’t learned the fate of his family and 30 employees. I had seen him earlier,
                  when he was hysterical with panic and grief. The nurses said he’d barely slept
                  and had refused all offers of sedatives. When I entered his room—curtains drawn
                  against the daylight, television blaring—he stared at me, expressionless. “How
                  are you?” I asked. “I just want to watch television,” he said, and turned back
                  to face the screen. I realized that the best I could offer the survivors I met
                  was to be an equanimous witness to their broken hearts. There was so little to
                  say that could make a difference.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">After several days in the hospital, I was asked to
                  travel to the resort town of Krabi, where a psychologist was needed to counsel
                  survivors and people attempting to identify the bodies of loved ones. The van
                  that took me to Krabi was packed with large black boxes, like props from a
                  James Bond movie, filled with forensic equipment—microscopes, test tubes, DNA
                  sample kits. We stopped at one of the many beach areas that had become a body
                  collection center, staffed by the Thai Army, doctors, and volunteers. The odor
                  of death greeted us. The beach was still littered with corpses, and people
                  picked through them searching for loved ones, exactly as my husband and I had
                  seen on television. Even elephants joined in the search for bodies washed into
                  the dense forest undergrowth nearby, and headed there with rescue teams where
                  heavy earth-moving machinery couldn’t go.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Body bags were lined up in neat rows in a grassy
                  area close to the beach. Large piles of crumpled corpses lay nearby, decaying
                  and covered with flies and insects. Mourners were standing among them. I
                  recalled the wisdom of the sages: do not comfort the bereaved while their dead
                  lie before them. The shock of grief needs both honor and time. Near the piles
                  of bodies, volunteers were building makeshift coffins, their hammer blows providing
                  a staccato soundtrack.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">I was taken to a makeshift morgue housed in a <em>wat</em> [Buddhist monastery]. The floor of the building was covered with about 500
                  bodies, with more lying outside. Masked workers were spraying the grounds with
                  disinfectant and, until it ran out, placing dry ice around the bodies to reduce
                  the stench. At home in Berkeley, I had volunteered with the Chevra Kadisha, the
                  Jewish society that helps prepare the dead for burial. Nothing of that work had
                  prepared me for this. Just as at the body collection center at the beach, the
                  corpses had been drenched in seawater and exposed to Thailand’s searing heat,
                  leaving most blackened, bloated, and unrecognizable. Some teemed with maggots
                  and worms. Although I was wearing a surgical mask drenched in menthol ointment,
                  the odor was sickening. Inside the morgue, I estimated that the ratio of dead
                  to living might be 50 to one. But there was no way to tell for sure, as the
                  corpses were so densely packed and more were being delivered by the hour.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Among the living were members of an Orthodox Jewish rescue service known
                  as ZAKA (a Hebrew acronym for “identification of victims of disaster”). ZAKA
                  members are trained to identify body parts after suicide bombings, to ensure
                  complete burial in accordance with Jewish law. Clad in face masks and
                  protective overalls reminiscent of astronauts’ suits, the forensic
                  experts—dental, fingerprint, and DNA specialists—had come to Thailand intending
                  to identify missing Israelis (the country is a popular destination for Israeli
                  soldiers on holiday). But the demand for identification of the thousands of
                  dead was so extreme, they ended up collecting physical evidence on every victim
                  they could, regardless of faith, nationality, or race. In the morgue, whenever
                  someone spoke, the sound of the voice punctured the silence and we all
                  listened. At one point, there was a crescendo of excited talking. The team had
                  just identified an Israeli woman by the Hebrew words on the label sewn onto the
                  back of her bra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">There was no shortage of body parts for the team to
                  collect and match. They were everywhere. Before our eyes, bodies were
                  disintegrating and returning to the elements. The temple had become a massive,
                  open charnel ground meditation, exactly as the Buddha had described it—here a hand
                  bone, there a foot bone, there a tooth, here a skull. Outside the
                  temple-morgue, monks from local monasteries gathered around the clock to chant
                  the traditional funeral verses in Pali: <em>Anicca vata sankhara,
                  uppadavaya-dhammino; uppajjitva nirujjhanti, tesam vupasamo sukho</em>:
                  Conditions are impermanent, rising and falling away; having been born, they all
                  must cease. The stilling of all conditions is true peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">About 96 percent of Thais are Buddhists. Although
                  many don’t practice meditation, most have strong faith in the Buddha’s
                  teachings. Those who could not find the bodies of loved ones believed that the
                  departed would receive the merit of good deeds performed in life, and also that
                  of the good deeds dedicated to their memory. The Thai way of grieving, from
                  what I could see, was composed, reflecting what is known as <em>jai yen</em>—a
                  cool heart. Mourners appeared to see death as part of life, not as an injustice
                  or a dreadful mistake, even when it was unexpected or swift.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Expressing emotions wasn’t an issue for Westerners,
                  who had<em> jai rawn</em>—a hot heart. Many felt angry and betrayed by the
                  tsunami and by the experts who didn’t detect it in time to transmit warnings.
                  “They should have known! How irresponsible,” they declared. Parents bitterly
                  blamed themselves for not being able to protect their children from death. “I’m
                  a bad parent, it’s my fault,” they confessed, as if they were personally
                  responsible for the natural disaster.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">This difference between the two perspectives demonstrates one of the
                  Buddha’s key teachings: our minds are habituated to relate to suffering by
                  resisting it through blame, bitterness, anger, resentment. That resistance is
                  what the Buddha called “the second arrow,” which follows the first arrow, the
                  direct experience of pain. So much additional suffering comes from believing
                  that “things shouldn’t be this way”—when in fact they are that way. Although
                  tragedy and loss feel personal, they are not. Suffering and loss are built into
                  the human condition. I spoke with one local woman in her late twenties who
                  stood beside three stacked caskets containing her young son, daughter, and
                  husband. “<em>Pen tamada, pen tamachat,”</em> she whispered in response to my
                  condolences—“this is natural, this is nature.” Her house and family swept away,
                  she was staying at the nearby monastery of Ajahn Jamnian, a well-known
                  meditation master. Along with a thousand other displaced people, she received
                  food, supplies, and medical attention. Ajahn Jamnian, meanwhile, spent his days
                  and nights walking up and down the beaches strewn with corpses and caskets,
                  chanting and spreading <em>metta</em> and goodwill to the dead and to the living.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Back at the morgue, I met a mother searching for
                  the body of her 8-year-old daughter, Ploy. The girl had been out playing at the
                  beach with some friends when the first wave struck. While combing through
                  photos of the dead posted on the Internet, the mother thought she recognized
                  her child, a decaying corpse dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, with a
                  three-digit number painted across her chest (part of the identification process
                  set up by the Thai Army). We held hands and tiptoed up and down the aisles of
                  corpses in various stages of decomposition. With just Kleenex over our mouths
                  and noses, we tried to find a cadaver bearing digits that matched the ones
                  written on a scrap of paper in the mother’s hand. We saw bikini-clad bodies
                  crawling with maggots, a toddler’s body infested with worms. But we couldn’t
                  find the child’s numbered body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">Ploy’s mother continued to search while I took a
                  break outside. There were still a few hundred bodies in the morgue we hadn’t
                  yet seen, and hundreds more were being unloaded from pickup trucks. I gazed up
                  into the hot, star-spangled night sky and then at some teenagers and Thai
                  soldiers delivering bagged cadavers. On the trucks, I could see leftover limbs,
                  belonging to no one. My phone rang. It was Ajahn Anan, one of my meditation
                  teachers. “</span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">Sabai dee mai</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">—how are you?” he asked. I couldn’t respond.
                  There was no coherent answer to the question. “</span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">Mi upekkha. Glap pai chuay
                  kon</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">,” he offered. “Have equanimity. Go back and help people.” I could think
                  only of the fact that I had lost track of the mother looking for Ploy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">At the entry to the morgue, a line of people had
                  formed, numbers in hand, waiting for me to accompany them. I escorted a few</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> inside, but the sight and smell was so overwhelming that they turned
                  and left. Could I assure them that their loved ones would be identified through
                  DNA testing? No one could make that guarantee. I returned to the morgue to talk
                  with the workers. With so many new corpses arriving every hour, was there any
                  order to the bodies on the ground? I noticed that the numbers of the dead were
                  not in sequence—number 473 was next to 112. The only thing I could understand
                  from their replies was that babies and young children were on the left side,
                  wrapped in white, like mummies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For days, survivors and family members continued to comb through
                  photographs of the deceased and fill out lengthy missing-person forms. There
                  were computer banks at the hospital and outside the morgue. Internet databases
                  were filled with images of documents retrieved from the dead—credit cards,
                  passports, driver’s licenses—and large bags of these items overflowed on a
                  table close to the morgue’s entryway. A kind of camaraderie emerged. Survivors swapped
                  suggestions on how to hasten body identification and retrieval: Start with the
                  numbered photographs of jewelry—fingers with wedding rings, wrists with
                  bracelets, ears with earrings, and necks with necklaces. Then switch to
                  pictures of moles, scars, and tattoos.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Over the days that followed, I worked with dozens
                  of grieving families, helping identify the corpses of their loved ones,
                  attending cremations, arranging rides to the airport, administering
                  tranquilizers to survivors too distressed to function. I met the parents of a
                  Korean bride who perished during her honeymoon and whose body I helped to lug
                  out of a refrigerated truck and accompany to a monastery for cremation. There
                  were the Scandinavian father and son who left the country ebullient—because
                  they had managed to identify and claim the bodies of a missing wife and
                  daughter. And there was the Thai father searching photo databases for his son,
                  a young monk. Another monk told me that the father was optimistic about finding
                  the body, amid the hundreds of photos of corpses. “A small monk with a shaved
                  head, dressed in robes, is easy to spot,” he explained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">My ability to keep people’s stories and needs in
                  order finally began to crumble. It was time to leave. As I packed my clothes,
                  cosmetics, and notebook, I recalled how the Buddha had instructed his monks to
                  sew their robes from scraps of burial cloth found in charnel grounds: the smell
                  of death would focus their attention on the fragility of life and the certainty
                  of death. But I’d had enough of the stench. My skirts and blouses were
                  saturated with it, and I threw most of my clothes away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">An American news team took me to the airport, which
                  was teeming with tourists from around the globe. In the departure lounge, I
                  recognized several volunteers, but none of us greeted or even acknowledged each
                  other. I took it as a silent agreement to put the past behind us. What else was
                  there to say? Besides, maybe death would take a few days off. That thought
                  dissolved as I headed across the tarmac, toward my plane. Stacks of caskets,
                  interspersed with luggage, rolled up the conveyor belt into the airplane’s
                  cargo, tagged for their final destination.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">From Bangkok, I went to visit my teacher Ajahn Anan at his monastery
                  about two hours south of the city. I returned to</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "> the <em>kuti</em> (meditation hut) where I had lived for many months, hoping to
                  find some solace. But my mind raced and rambled with memories, images, and
                  stories. I wandered around the monastery, perched on the side of a mountain,
                  hoping to exhaust my body and quiet my thoughts, but when night fell I was
                  still in turmoil. Hoping a book might distract me, I went in search of a volume
                  in English. I entered a large room in the women’s section and was shocked to
                  see bodies littering the floor—but these were alive and engaged in the ordinary
                  act of sleeping. I had become so accustomed to the sight of decomposing corpses
                  that it took me a moment to readjust my perception. I listened to the gentle
                  snores of the women and girls, admired their healthy skin, and appreciated that
                  their heads, limbs, skin, and internal organs were still intact. These living
                  beings would eventually die and decay, just as I and everyone I loved would. I
                  understood that in trying to deny that things are always changing, we lose our
                  sense of the sacredness of life. It’s easy to forget that life and death are
                  part of the natural scheme of things, intrinsic to our lives in an eternally
                  shifting universe.</span></p>
