            <div class='col-md body'>Apart from this powerful 'energy', it is possible to receive blessings from Medicine Buddha. I would like to relate (I have posted this before) one true story:<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=147300" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=147300</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Speaking of Medicine Buddha... I roughly remembered a true story I was told over a year ago, by a Buddhist friend who experienced it himself. I can't really remember the detail now as it has been a long time.. but anyway...<br><br>This guy had some problem and needed to go for brain surgeries several times... Before he went, he went to a foreign lama who came to Singapore to teach the teachings on Medicine Buddha. I can't remember which Lama, but I know the name starts with S. Anyway, during some kind of ritual (or maybe not ritual, something else), everyone was sitting in a circle. The lama walked to him and pulled him out of the circle, and told him he got (Karmic) Obstructions, and he needs to practice well.<br><br>Soon, he went for the surgery (or is it not? i cant remember)... I believe he had been practising.. and then he slipped into a coma. For 4 days he remained unconscious, until the 4th day, the first thing he remembered was seeing a figure of a man, he done quite some description but i really cannot remember it anymore. After awaking from it he asked the doctors/nurses whether someone came to visit him. They said nope, nobody had visited him when he woke up. It was later he visited the lama again, and the lama told him the figure was a manifest of the Medicine Buddha, and he was saved by the Medicine Buddha. Later he went for several surgeries and succeeded. I still see him sometimes these days.</div></blockquote>Even though your cousin has not taken refuge, it is also good to chant for him the Buddha-name or mantra of Medicine Buddha. However, you receive most of the benefits of the chanting rather than him. There is a saying... when you chant, 6 parts goes to u, 1 part goes to person (you intend to chant to benefit). It is best for him to chant or at least recognise your chanting. And it is also important if possible, that he takes refuge in the Three Treasures, Buddha Dharma Sangha. However if he does not believe in Buddha it may be very difficult, unless he meets a good venerable who can convince him.</div>

Also when she use her handphone, she could feel the same thing. Maybe I should tell her to at least get an LCD monitor which should help.<br><br>And it is not only harmful to body, it is harmful to practise/mind. Any form of indulgence is an escape to our 'Present Awareness', if you have read about what I posted earlier.
