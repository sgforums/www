              <p>Excerpts from from two conversations I had with Thusness in August 2006.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thusness:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> "One should mentally let go of everything, then the clarity of presence is real strength. Letting go of all things is extremely important to create the calmness for Presence to surface. Otherwise what one glimpse is just a moment of our true nature, there is no strength."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When you sit and meditate, just learn how to let go completely everything, until you experience unsurpassed calm and tranquillity, then be mindful."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When the presence is experienced, the letting go is even more crucial. When meditating, drop everything including your Buddha Nature. There is nothing to keep. This must be the attitude mentally, spiritually."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"First let go completely the body, feel like if anyone wants it, give it away... just let go of it... everything... this is prepare you to experience the most subtle."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Your letting go must be more thorough than any nihilist, your Presence must be more thorough than any realist, through the right understanding of emptiness."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When you are practicing, it might not be easy to go through, because we engaged in so much intellectual activities and do not really practice impermanence and emptiness. Though we experienced Presence, the root is not strong and we are unable to contain the experience. Being real to impermanence is not intellectual or conceptual, it is total disengaging mentally... it must result in deep and serene calmness. This is a very important factor for true Presence to surface."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(on whether samatha and vipassana can be practiced at the same time): "Nope. Concentration can come first and lead to insight later and vice versa. There can be great intensity of clarity and presence and understanding of our Buddha Nature, but suffering will still exist. This is because of us not being able to let go... we focus too much on the luminosity and claim only in words about the emptiness nature. The strength that must be resulted from disbanding and letting go is not experienced. That will cause suffering. This is like the case of 'TheVoice' (a friend of ours), a certain aspect of luminosity is experienced but there is no strength and without good karmic conditions, he will not be able to overcome it that easily."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The experience of true presence has to be as natural as possible, it is a reflection of our purity due to the loosening of inner bond. However for one that has experienced Presence, he is able to feel the Presence in and out like a deliberate attempt. This is because he is able to go beyond thoughts and concepts, but the attachment is still working behind him. It depends what energy is stronger. So we must practice letting go through correct understanding of impermanence and emptiness. It is not easy to let go, the mind will tend to identify, and the identification will make us cling. The state of Presence can become an object of experience for a practitioner to cling, and that becomes a problem."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There is nothing wrong with the experience of Presence, but it is the attachment (that hinders). It is the subtle attachment that prevents us from deep sleep because we are unwilling to let go of that experience (even into sleep). Though one will not feel anything wrong or it does not disturb one much, it is not a form of achievement as described. It is a retrogression instead. When one is able to let go and let everything subside, even the loss of consciousness, it is a more profound state instead. It has to be a natural momentum that is being built up, until the propensities is gone, the letting go is complete, it is illuminated everywhere."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Total Presence is Nirvana, at least to me. To me, there is no further. If the letting go is thorough, then the Presence is complete."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There is a great difference between subtle attachment that we (become) unwilling (to) go into sleep, and letting the conditions take place without self, just empty phenomenon that takes its own course."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I do not (generally) advice people to go into experiencing of Buddha Nature directly. One should always start from developing the qualities of mind, to experience the deep calmness resulting from settling our thoughts. Still our mind (first), then (develop) wisdom. It can be any practices as long as it leads us to the experience of calmness, (be it) mindfulness of breath, or mindfulness itself, or chanting. One must experience this calmness first, because it is the 'ground' that strengthen other experience. However, some people are vested with the conditions to experience the end-result first, then they have to return to these practices to stabilize the experience. Like experiencing our Buddha Nature directly, then the entire life becomes the unfolding and understanding of this experience, like those experiencing 'I AMness'. It is a mistaken identity. Due to our karmic propensities, they cannot discern the nature of that experience. However after many years of contemplation, they are able to have deeper glimpse of it. And the next stage is the experience of no-self to further refine our understanding. The Mind then is experienced as a crystal clear mirror, there is no-I. Then emptiness must step in to know that there is no mirror in the first place reflecting anything. The manifestation is the arising is the Buddha Nature. There is no mirror bright at all, the arising is the Buddha Nature itself. Samsara is Nirvana. Even with this illumination, one is not able to overcome the defilement, our karmic propensities, because they do not start from the perfection of calmness, there is no strength. They are unable to 'control' their thoughts (meaning settle their thoughts)."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When we reach a state of deep calmness and we turn it into mindfulness, then there is the experience of blissfulness, clarity, vitality and wisdom. Stilling the body and mind only results in a deep and stable calmness that gathers strength. For the other qualities to arise, it needs the direct experience and intuitive wisdom."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"That is why I told Longchen to eliminate the (attachment to) Presence and start experiencing the deep calmness by letting go. The letting go is to settle the mind till he is about to have mastery over the thought patterns. This is very important for progress. Direct perception is crucial, because Buddha Nature cannot be understood conceptually. But without the ground of deep calmness, there is no strength. And one might suffer because we do not know how to deal with these experiences."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"After Longchen has more experience of the no-self nature of the pristine awareness, the next step is to gather strength through experiencing that sense of calmness and tranquillity and then fuse his anatta experience into this tranquil calm. Then experience the total dissolving of the consciousness of Presence into deep sleep. Dare to face the great death and be nothing."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Merge completely into the place as if we were never there before... love and fuse completely into nothingness... don't worry about anything... total wakefulness when waking and complete death in deep sleep. This is true Presence according to conditions. The mental state of sleep must emerge before we become no one there."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When this is perfectly clear (meaning you go into deep sleep by controlling the thought patterns and slow down our thoughts), we will enter into sleep. That is why I said when someone says that they are so aware that (they) bring (the awareness) beyond the night, (that) is not true experience. Because there is no control of thoughts at all. This is due to the lack of practice or overlooking the practice of deep calmness that provides the ground of controlling thought patterns. This is very, very, important. In fact that is always the base of practice. That is the simplest way of keeping the mind (that) is taught to all levels."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Chant first, even if one does not have the capacity of understanding anything. Any form of practice must start from there... that is the best, then progress slowly. However if the capacity and conditions are already there and (the practitioner is) so close to experiencing the more profound experience of our pristine awareness, we have to lead one to the experience first, then later slowly lead him into the experience of the tranquil calmness to stabilize the experience."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Any form of experience must lead one to experience the tranquil calm, it comes from keeping the mind still. But stilling of mind comes easier from stilling the body first. But this state will not (directly result in the) experience of the luminous clarity of our pristine awareness. The posture is very important, and watching our breath is best to me."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Mindfulness has the effect of luminosity and calmnesss. (It is an) ingenious way towards enlightenment. But to come to the understanding of everything as awareness like the experience of Ken Wilber requires deep yuan (conditions)."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I do not like to talk about 'I AM'. But 'I AM' is a very important state. However, I talk more about no-self and emptiness and our pristine awareness. Most of the time (I talk about) the happening, nothing about the source, and later the spontaneous arising as the expression of luminosity and vitality. But never about the 'Self' or 'I' or anything. Only for the explanation we spoke of the 'Self' when comparing to the tathagatagarbha sutras and vedanta teachings."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Meditative posture is really important to still the mind. When we are young, we should keep this posture and use it to help keep our thoughts. You must experience the entire body as no more there, no more a hindrance and completely still just like the last time you lost the sense of your lower half of your body, except that it is your entire body this time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Straighten your back when you meditate. This is a good exercise."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Sitting meditation is important, it will help you still your mind and heighten your awareness. You must learn to still your body first, the experience similar to the lower half of your body must be extended to the whole body. When you are able to still your mind, just motionless and when you sit, it is stable and still. It then comes to the mind, to watch the breath and settle your thoughts. Practice this until you can calm your thoughts through your breath. Once you are able to still your thoughts or settle your thoughts, then start to be aware, until you feel the full presence of your sensation, taste, touch, etc. Sense them. If possible contemplate on what Buddhaghosa said, 'Only the thinking, no thinker', 'The taste, no one tasting', till directness arises. Keep practicing this if possible in the morning or afternoon, not night, till you are able to control your thought pattern."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"During waking state, practice mindfulness. When your feet touches the floor... When your hand touches anything... Spend time, just like what Eckhart Tolle said in The Power of Now and A New Earth. When you swallow your saliva... feel the sensation completely, then relax and don't practice that at night, until morning. Till one day you tell me you know what has thought pattern got to do with calmness and how awareness is being misidentified with self and what are the relationships. What is bliss and clarity. Then when you experience no-self and our pristine awareness and clearly knows that is awareness, tell me why is it everything. Challenging and going beyond thought can be a painful experience if it is not practiced correctly, because we have been using thoughts and it will come, so do not underestimate it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Exercise more, a healthy body for a healthy mind. it will help your practice."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In meditation, content of the mind is not important. It is the quality of the mind - peace, bliss, tranquillity, calmness are not content. Even in deep relaxation, you do not want to chat in your mind, you simply let go. The content and meaning isn't important at all. You don't have to understand anything. Nothing to understand at all. So don't worry, just the sensation, the raw sensation. But for start, you will contemplate 'What is no-self', 'What is directness', 'What are words'. During meditation, you will surely ask. It is ok, but start with calming the mind first before you contemplate. When you contemplate, you can also be mindful. The two can go hand in hand, it doesn't matter. When you experience directness, concepts and thoughts will be replaced with directness gradually. But you must precede with mindfulness of breath to settle the thoughts first, to have mastery over thoughts, or the ability to settle thoughts through your breath."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"Mindfulness has the effect of luminosity and calmnesss. (It is an) ingenious way towards enlightenment. But to come to the understanding of everything as awareness like the experience of Ken Wilber requires deep yuan (conditions)."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I do not like to talk about 'I AM'. But 'I AM' is a very important state. However, I talk more about no-self and emptiness and our pristine awareness. Most of the time (I talk about) the happening, nothing about the source, and later the spontaneous arising as the expression of luminosity and vitality. But never about the 'Self' or 'I' or anything. Only for the explanation we spoke of the 'Self' when comparing to the tathagatagarbha sutras and vedanta teachings."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Meditative posture is really important to still the mind. When we are young, we should keep this posture and use it to help keep our thoughts. You must experience the entire body as no more there, no more a hindrance and completely still just like the last time you lost the sense of your lower half of your body, except that it is your entire body this time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Straighten your back when you meditate. This is a good exercise."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Sitting meditation is important, it will help you still your mind and heighten your awareness. You must learn to still your body first, the experience similar to the lower half of your body must be extended to the whole body. When you are able to still your mind, just motionless and when you sit, it is stable and still. It then comes to the mind, to watch the breath and settle your thoughts. Practice this until you can calm your thoughts through your breath. Once you are able to still your thoughts or settle your thoughts, then start to be aware, until you feel the full presence of your sensation, taste, touch, etc. Sense them. If possible contemplate on what Buddhaghosa said, 'Only the thinking, no thinker', 'The taste, no one tasting', till directness arises. Keep practicing this if possible in the morning or afternoon, not night, till you are able to control your thought pattern."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"During waking state, practice mindfulness. When your feet touches the floor... When your hand touches anything... Spend time, just like what Eckhart Tolle said in The Power of Now and A New Earth. When you swallow your saliva... feel the sensation completely, then relax and don't practice that at night, until morning. Till one day you tell me you know what has thought pattern got to do with calmness and how awareness is being misidentified with self and what are the relationships. What is bliss and clarity. Then when you experience no-self and our pristine awareness and clearly knows that is awareness, tell me why is it everything. Challenging and going beyond thought can be a painful experience if it is not practiced correctly, because we have been using thoughts and it will come, so do not underestimate it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Exercise more, a healthy body for a healthy mind. it will help your practice."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In meditation, content of the mind is not important. It is the quality of the mind - peace, bliss, tranquillity, calmness are not content. Even in deep relaxation, you do not want to chat in your mind, you simply let go. The content and meaning isn't important at all. You don't have to understand anything. Nothing to understand at all. So don't worry, just the sensation, the raw sensation. But for start, you will contemplate 'What is no-self', 'What is directness', 'What are words'. During meditation, you will surely ask. It is ok, but start with calming the mind first before you contemplate. When you contemplate, you can also be mindful. The two can go hand in hand, it doesn't matter. When you experience directness, concepts and thoughts will be replaced with directness gradually. But you must precede with mindfulness of breath to settle the thoughts first, to have mastery over thoughts, or the ability to settle thoughts through your breath."</p>

              <p>a question though. when one experiences presence as the 'i am', the sense of self is so heightened to such a point, is it actually possible that one can break free through the same continuous practice if it keeps reifying that sensation?</p>
              <p>from memory yes the sensation of presence does become an object of clinging, remember there were times when i constantly 'checked' to 'confirm its still there'. while its very confusing, there wasnt a question of doubt about the sense of self at that time. and this sense of heightened self does propel one without proper guidance to act or live forth in even more confusing ways.</p>
              <p>from some of your previous posts was mentioned that the presence of 'i am' is actually not a necessary experience. i tend to agree with this, lest there are also benefits to this experience?</p>

              <p>There are different degrees to the I AM insight/experience. The initial experience will be like individual, the I AM is still mixed with a sense of an individuality, personality to it, even though it is beyond thought (it is not mental personality, just a very individualized/personified sense of Presence).</p>
              <p>Later, through continuous investigation, self inquiry and letting go, the sense of personality is separated from the I AMness. In other words the 'I' disappears, what's left is AMness, which is experienced as impersonal and universal. So at this point, as I wrote in <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333; "><a class="entry-title" style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188; font-size: 14px; " rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582">Certainty of Being</a><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; line-height: 19px; font-size: 16px; ">, "<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; ">I notice that the sense of self dissolves just by resting in awareness, where previously there was a sense of self and locality tied to awareness."</span></span></span></p>
              <p>After the I AM phase, there is non-dual, where subject and object, are dissolved into One Mind, a unified reality. Everything you see, hear, smell is only Mind, not divided into perceiver and perceived. However there is still attachment to Mind/Awareness as inherent.</p>
              <p>However to overcome the attachment to a metaphysical Self be it individual or universal or unified, to totally overcome the "I AM" conceit as Buddha taught, the insight/realisation into Anatta has to arise. Thusness told me to refine the I AM experience through the 4 phases/aspects* (he also told me I will cycle through these phases again and again), then experience non dual, then penetrate Anatta and eventually Emptiness. From I AM to Emptiness, is a natural progression and maturation of insights on our Pristine Awareness, though a teacher to point out the right view so one does not get stuck at any stage is important.</p>

              <p>I would say that if you are strictly following the path of Vipassana ala Theravadin style, you do not go through the I AM experience (particularly: Burmese Vipassana style). That is why Kenneth Folk distinguished First Gear from Second Gear (I AM), and this is a valid point. First Gear, i.e. Burmese Vipassana meditation, does not lead to I AM realization and experience, and he said in his <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-witness-turning-the-light-around-2/">interview</a> that <em>"It is a completely different category of practice, and this needs to be explicitly understood. This is not vipassana as I learned it in Burma. They never told me to do this. They do not talk about this, so you can do vipassana until the cows come home, but unless you understand that the idea with 2nd Gear is to turn the light around and look at the supposed knower, you are not making the leap to the next level"</em>.</p>
              <p>Example of practitioners who focused on first gear vipassana are Daniel M. Ingram, who followed strict vipassana path and went straight to non-dual and anatta realization without going through the I AM stage. </p>
              <p>Those following Vipassana path will climb the insight stages (nanas) but will not realise the luminosity until later phase of their practice, i.e. Anagami stage, where they penetrate into the non-duality of subject and object and realise everything as luminous manifestation. Those who wants to follow the Direct Path in penetrating in one's luminous Buddha Nature will usually go through the I AM phase first, via methods like self inquiry. However the initial insight does not mean one has realised Anatta and Emptiness, more like the I AM.</p>

              <p>Also, back in March 2008 in a thread where I wrote some of my non-dual experiences and also asked Thusness if I AM is necessary (in <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="/forums/1728/topics/310956">Death, Consciousness, Nondual Perception</a></span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">)</span></p>

              <p>Also in a blog article in October 2009, Thusness wrote about the importance to give rise to the *realization* of I AMness (especially in the 'Direct Path' that emphasizes directly realising one's true nature or luminosity):</p>

They focus too much on the experience but overlook the realization. Honestly I do not like to make this distinction as I see realization also as a form of experience. However in this particular case, it seems appropriate as it could better illustrate what I am trying to convey. It also relates to the few occasions where you described to me your space-like experiences of Awareness and asked whether they correspond to the phase one insight of Eternal Witness. While your experiences are there, I told you ‘not exactly’ even though you told me you clearly experienced a pure sense of presence.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">So what is lacking? You do not lack the experience, you lack the realization. You may have the blissful sensation or feeling of vast and open spaciousness; you may experience a non-conceptual and objectless state; you may experience the mirror like clarity but all these experiences are not Realization. There is no ‘eureka’, no ‘aha’, no moment of immediate and intuitive illumination that you understood something undeniable and unshakable -- a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from this realization because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of anatta. Actually there is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature. Like what Rob said, "keep the experience but refine the views".<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Lastly this realization is not an end by itself, it is the beginning. If we are truthful and not over exaggerate and get carried away by this initial glimpse, we will realize that we do not gain liberation from this realization; contrary we suffer more after this realization. However it is a powerful condition that motivates a practitioner to embark on a spiritual journey in search of true freedom. :)</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also on another note, Thusness gives differing advices to people on what to practice. Some he would advice to practice vipassana, sometimes he advice self-inquiry, there was even once he adviced someone (who is deep into the I AM and penetrating into non-dual) to practice chanting as an antidote to her clinging to Presence. In fact in the conversation with Thusness I posted in this topic, his advice were mostly on Vipassana and experiencing Calmness (shamatha) - nothing about self-inquiry. It is only in I think 2008 where he started advicing me on self inquiry. It all depends on the person's conditions, he will meditate on the person's conditions before giving the appropriate advice. He isn't biased towards self inquiry, or biased towards vipassana. Especially when he also mentioned before, self inquiry isn't meant for everyone, and it has its dangers as well (for example, before the realisation of I AMness, one can experience utter confusion and suffer during self inquiry, and after I AMness one can be so attached to Presence and end up having poor and very little sleep). So it really depends on whether that person is vested with the conditions to go into that path, both the teacher and student must check/gauge their conditions. (however, I am also aware that Thusness doesn't want to be seen as a dharma teacher of sorts)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, he also said that (hypothetically) if he starts a new sect or school, he will teach people self-inquiry as a starting practice, as he has gone through that path and will be able to guide and advice people more appropriately.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It does not mean that self inquiry is a better path than Vipassana, or that Vipassana is a better path than Self-Inquiry: it all depends on the practitioner, what works for him is the best. For Daniel Ingram, Vipassana is the best. For Thusness, Self Inquiry is very important to lead to the initial realization of Buddha Nature, and it is something he has had experienced with. At a later phase, Thusness also practiced Vipassana (when he came into Buddhism, he started contemplating on anatta).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If one follows the direct path however, one will go through the I AM phase, which as Thusness said is actually an important state though it isn't the end or final realisation (at least in Buddhism).</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There are different degrees to the I AM insight/experience. The initial experience will be like individual, the I AM is still mixed with a sense of an individuality, personality to it, even though it is beyond thought (it is not mental personality, just a very individualized/personified sense of Presence).</p>
              <p>Later, through continuous investigation, self inquiry and letting go, the sense of personality is separated from the I AMness. In other words the 'I' disappears, what's left is AMness, which is experienced as impersonal and universal. So at this point, as I wrote in <span style="color: #333333;"><a style="font-size: 14px; color: #551188; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582">Certainty of Being</a><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #000000; line-height: 19px; border-collapse: separate;">, "<span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">I notice that the sense of self dissolves just by resting in awareness, where previously there was a sense of self and locality tied to awareness."</span></span></span></p>
              <p>After the I AM phase, there is non-dual, where subject and object, are dissolved into One Mind, a unified reality. Everything you see, hear, smell is only Mind, not divided into perceiver and perceived. However there is still attachment to Mind/Awareness as inherent.</p>
              <p>However to overcome the attachment to a metaphysical Self be it individual or universal or unified, to totally overcome the "I AM" conceit as Buddha taught, the insight/realisation into Anatta has to arise. Thusness told me to refine the I AM experience through the 4 phases/aspects* (he also told me I will cycle through these phases again and again), then experience non dual, then penetrate Anatta and eventually Emptiness. From I AM to Emptiness, is a natural progression and maturation of insights on our Pristine Awareness, though a teacher to point out the right view so one does not get stuck at any stage is important.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">*(from an old post about the 4 phases/aspects)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Thusness told me that at present try not to talk too much about non-dual (to someone else in another forum) and he also talked to me about the deepening of the "I AM" in 4 aspects: 1) the aspect of impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of luminosity, 3) the aspect of dissolving the need to re-confirm and abide in I AMness and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the aspect of experiencing effortlessness.<br><br>Impersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the danger of making one attached to a metaphysical essence. It makes a practitioner feel "God".</em> <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"><br><br>The degree of luminosity refers to feeling with entire being, feel wholely and directly without thoughts. Feeling 'realness' of whatever one encounters, the tree bark, the sand, etc. (see the next post)</em> <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"><br><br>Dissolving the need to re-confirm is important as whatever is done is an attempt to distant itself from itself, if there is no way one can distant from the "I AM", the attempt to abide in it is itself an illusion.</em> <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"><br><br>On the other hand, abiding in presence is a form of meditative practice, like chanting, and leads to absorption. It can result in the oceanic experience. But once one focuses on the 4 aspects mentioned above, one will have that experience too.</em> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">According to Thusness model on the four phases/aspects of I AMness, as the I AMness experience matures, we will overcome and dissolve the need to re-confirm or abide in Self. After all any attempts to re-confirm is distancing ItSelf from ItSelf.</p>
              <p>I would say that if you are strictly following the path of Vipassana ala Theravadin style, you do not go through the I AM experience (particularly: Burmese Vipassana style). That is why Kenneth Folk distinguished First Gear from Second Gear (I AM), and this is a valid point. First Gear, i.e. Burmese Vipassana meditation, does not lead to I AM realization and experience, and he said in his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-witness-turning-the-light-around-2/">interview</a> that <em>"It is a completely different category of practice, and this needs to be explicitly understood. This is not vipassana as I learned it in Burma. They never told me to do this. They do not talk about this, so you can do vipassana until the cows come home, but unless you understand that the idea with 2nd Gear is to turn the light around and look at the supposed knower, you are not making the leap to the next level"</em>.</p>
              <p>Example of practitioners who focused on first gear vipassana are Daniel M. Ingram, who followed strict vipassana path and went straight to non-dual and anatta realization without going through the I AM stage. </p>
              <p>Those following Vipassana path will climb the insight stages (nanas) but will not realise the luminosity until later phase of their practice, i.e. Anagami stage, where they penetrate into the non-duality of subject and object and realise everything as luminous manifestation. Those who wants to follow the Direct Path in penetrating in one's luminous Buddha Nature will usually go through the I AM phase first, via methods like self inquiry. However the initial insight does not mean one has realised Anatta and Emptiness, more like the I AM.</p>
              <p>Thusness also commented in Daniel's forum Dharma Overground in early 2009 (and I highly some parts for emphasis),</p>
              <p><em>"Hi Gary,</em></p>
              <p><span><em>It appears that there are two groups of practitioners in this forum, one adopting the gradual approach and the other, the direct path. I am quite new here so I may be wrong.<br><br>My take is that you are adopting a gradual approach yet you are experiencing something very significant in the direct path, that is, the ‘Watcher’. As what Kenneth said, “You're onto something very big here, Gary. This practice will set you free.” But what Kenneth said would require you to be awaken to this ‘I’. It requires you to have the ‘eureka!’ sort of realization. Awaken to this ‘I’, the path of spirituality becomes clear; it is simply the unfolding of this ‘I’.<br><br><strong>On the other hand, what that is described by Yabaxoule is a gradual approach and therefore there is downplaying of the ‘I AM’. You have to gauge your own conditions, if you choose the direct path, you cannot downplay this ‘I’; contrary, you must fully and completely experience the whole of ‘YOU’ as ‘Existence’.</strong> Emptiness nature of our pristine nature will step in for the direct path practitioners when they come face to face to the ‘traceless’, ‘centerless’ and ‘effortless’ nature of non-dual awareness.<br><br>Perhaps a little on where the two approaches meet will be of help to you.<br></em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Awakening to the ‘Watcher’ will at the same time ‘open’ the ‘eye of immediacy’; that is, it is the capacity to immediately penetrate discursive thoughts and sense, feel, perceive without intermediary the perceived. It is a kind of direct knowing. You must be deeply aware of this “direct without intermediary” sort of perception -- too direct to have subject-object gap, too short to have time, too simple to have thoughts. It is the ‘eye’ that can see the whole of ‘sound’ by being ‘sound’. It is the same ‘eye’ that is required when doing vipassana, that is, being ‘bare’. Be it non-dual or vipassana, both require the opening of this 'eye of immediacy'."</em></span></p>
              <p>Also, back in March 2008 in a thread where I wrote some of my non-dual experiences and also asked Thusness if I AM is necessary (in <span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #5d5ebc; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/310956">Death, Consciousness, Nondual Perception</a></span><span style="color: #333333;">)</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There are different degrees to the I AM insight/experience. The
              initial experience will be like individual, the I AM is still mixed
              with a sense of an individuality, personality to it, even though it
              is beyond thought (it is not mental personality, just a very
              individualized/personified sense of Presence).</p>
              <p>Later, through continuous investigation, self inquiry and
              letting go, the sense of personality is separated from the I
              AMness. In other words the 'I' disappears, what's left is AMness,
              which is experienced as impersonal and universal. So at this point,
              as I wrote in <span style="color: #333333;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #551188; font-size: 14px;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582">Certainty
              of Being</a><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; line-height: 19px; font-size: 16px;">,
              "<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">I notice that
              the sense of self dissolves just by resting in awareness, where
              previously there was a sense of self and locality tied to
              awareness."</span></span></span></p>
              <p>After the I AM phase, there is non-dual, where subject and
              object, are dissolved into One Mind, a unified reality. Everything
              you see, hear, smell is only Mind, not divided into perceiver and
              perceived. However there is still attachment to Mind/Awareness as
              inherent.</p>
              <p>However to overcome the attachment to a metaphysical Self be it
              individual or universal or unified, to totally overcome the "I AM"
              conceit as Buddha taught, the insight/realisation into Anatta has
              to arise. Thusness told me to refine the I AM experience through
              the 4 phases/aspects* (he also told me I will cycle through these
              phases again and again), then experience non dual, then penetrate
              Anatta and eventually Emptiness. From I AM to Emptiness, is a
              natural progression and maturation of insights on our Pristine
              Awareness, though a teacher to point out the right view so one does
              not get stuck at any stage is important.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">*(from an old
              post about the 4 phases/aspects)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Thusness told
              me that at present try not to talk too much about non-dual (to
              someone else in another forum) and he also talked to me about the
              deepening of the "I AM" in 4 aspects: 1) the aspect of
              impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of luminosity, 3) the
              aspect of dissolving the need to re-confirm and abide in I AMness
              and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the aspect of
              experiencing effortlessness.<br> <br> Impersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the
              danger of making one attached to a metaphysical essence. It makes a
              practitioner feel "God".</em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><br> <br> The degree of luminosity refers to feeling with entire being, feel
              wholely and directly without thoughts. Feeling 'realness' of
              whatever one encounters, the tree bark, the sand, etc. (see the
              next post)</em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><br> <br> Dissolving the need to re-confirm is important as whatever is done
              is an attempt to distant itself from itself, if there is no way one
              can distant from the "I AM", the attempt to abide in it is itself
              an illusion.</em> <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><br> <br> On the other hand, abiding in presence is a form of meditative
              practice, like chanting, and leads to absorption. It can result in
              the oceanic experience. But once one focuses on the 4 aspects
              mentioned above, one will have that experience too.</em> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">According to Thusness model on the four phases/aspects of I AMness,
              as the I AMness experience matures, we will overcome and dissolve
              the need to re-confirm or abide in Self. After all any attempts to
              re-confirm is distancing ItSelf from ItSelf.</p>
              <p>I would say that if you are strictly following the path of
              Vipassana ala Theravadin style, you do not go through the I AM
              experience (particularly: Burmese Vipassana style). That is why
              Kenneth Folk distinguished First Gear from Second Gear (I AM), and
              this is a valid point. First Gear, i.e. Burmese Vipassana
              meditation, does not lead to I AM realization and experience, and
              he said in his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-witness-turning-the-light-around-2/">interview</a> that <em>"It is a completely different
              category of practice, and this needs to be explicitly understood.
              This is not vipassana as I learned it in Burma. They never told me
              to do this. They do not talk about this, so you can do vipassana
              until the cows come home, but unless you understand that the idea
              with 2nd Gear is to turn the light around and look at the supposed
              knower, you are not making the leap to the next level"</em>.</p>
              <p>Example of practitioners who focused on first gear vipassana are
              Daniel M. Ingram, who followed strict vipassana path and went
              straight to non-dual and anatta realization without going through
              the I AM stage. </p>
              <p>Those following Vipassana path will climb the insight stages
              (nanas) but will not realise the luminosity until later phase of
              their practice, i.e. Anagami stage, where they penetrate into the
              non-duality of subject and object and realise everything as
              luminous manifestation. Those who wants to follow the Direct Path
              in penetrating in one's luminous Buddha Nature will usually go
              through the I AM phase first, via methods like self inquiry.
              However the initial insight does not mean one has realised Anatta
              and Emptiness, more like the I AM.</p>
              <p>Thusness also commented in Daniel's forum Dharma Overground in
              early 2009 (and I highly some parts for emphasis),</p>
              <p><em>"Hi Gary,</em></p>
              <p><span><em>It appears that there are two groups of
              practitioners in this forum, one adopting the gradual approach and
              the other, the direct path. I am quite new here so I may be
              wrong.<br> <br> My take is that you are adopting a gradual approach yet you are
              experiencing something very significant in the direct path, that
              is, the ‘Watcher’. As what Kenneth said, “You're onto something
              very big here, Gary. This practice will set you free.” But what
              Kenneth said would require you to be awaken to this ‘I’. It
              requires you to have the ‘eureka!’ sort of realization. Awaken to
              this ‘I’, the path of spirituality becomes clear; it is simply the
              unfolding of this ‘I’.<br> <br> <strong>On the other hand, what that is described by Yabaxoule is a
              gradual approach and therefore there is downplaying of the ‘I AM’.
              You have to gauge your own conditions, if you choose the direct
              path, you cannot downplay this ‘I’; contrary, you must fully and
              completely experience the whole of ‘YOU’ as ‘Existence’.</strong> Emptiness nature of our pristine nature will step in for the direct
              path practitioners when they come face to face to the ‘traceless’,
              ‘centerless’ and ‘effortless’ nature of non-dual awareness.<br> <br> Perhaps a little on where the two approaches meet will be of help
              to you.<br></em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Awakening to the ‘Watcher’ will at the same
              time ‘open’ the ‘eye of immediacy’; that is, it is the capacity to
              immediately penetrate discursive thoughts and sense, feel, perceive
              without intermediary the perceived. It is a kind of direct knowing.
              You must be deeply aware of this “direct without intermediary” sort
              of perception -- too direct to have subject-object gap, too short
              to have time, too simple to have thoughts. It is the ‘eye’ that can
              see the whole of ‘sound’ by being ‘sound’. It is the same ‘eye’
              that is required when doing vipassana, that is, being ‘bare’. Be it
              non-dual or vipassana, both require the opening of this 'eye of
              immediacy'."</em></span></p>
              <p>Also, back in March 2008 in a thread where I wrote some of my
              non-dual experiences and also asked Thusness if I AM is necessary
              (in <span style="color: #333333;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/310956">Death, Consciousness,
              Nondual Perception</a></span><span style="color: #333333;">)</span></p>
              <p>He wrote:</p>
              <p><em>"...</em><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Yes AEN,
              you are beginning to experience what that is known in the Advaita
              Vedanta as ‘Atman’ except that the experiences you had did not lead
              to you to the wrong conclusion.  This is because the doctrine
              of anatta has sunk sufficiently deep in your inmost
              consciousness.  Although the 'teaching of anatta' helps to
              prevent you from landing into wrong views, the downside is it also
              denies you from experiencing that deep and utimate conviction,
              that certainty beyond doubt of your very own existence -- "I
              AM'.  This is a very important factor for Advaita
              practitioners...."</em></span></p>

              experience of our luminosity.  There must be certainty of our
              luminosity but this luminosity is empty of an essence. 
              This is most difficult to understand and the purpose of insight
              into our emptiness and anatta nature (to me) is really just about

              <p>Also in a blog article in October 2009, Thusness wrote about the

              articles by Rob Burbea and Rupert is that they missed one very and
              most important point when talking about the Eternal Witness
              Experience -- The Realization. They focus too much on the
              experience but overlook the realization. Honestly I do not like to
              make this distinction as I see realization also as a form of
              experience. However in this particular case, it seems appropriate
              as it could better illustrate what I am trying to convey. It also
              relates to the few occasions where you described to me your
              space-like experiences of Awareness and asked whether they
              correspond to the phase one insight of Eternal Witness. While your
              experiences are there, I told you ‘not exactly’ even though you
              told me you clearly experienced a pure sense of presence.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> So what is lacking? You do not lack the experience, you lack the
              realization. You may have the blissful sensation or feeling of vast
              and open spaciousness; you may experience a non-conceptual and
              objectless state; you may experience the mirror like clarity but
              all these experiences are not Realization. There is no ‘eureka’, no
              ‘aha’, no moment of immediate and intuitive illumination that you
              understood something undeniable and unshakable -- a conviction so
              powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from this
              realization because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of
              it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This is the
              realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the
              Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for
              those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the
              doctrine of anatta. Actually there is no forgoing of this
              ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the
              non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous
              nature. Like what Rob said, "keep the experience but refine the
              views".<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> Lastly this realization is not an end by itself, it is the
              beginning. If we are truthful and not over exaggerate and get
              carried away by this initial glimpse, we will realize that we do
              not gain liberation from this realization; contrary we suffer more
              after this realization. However it is a powerful condition that
              motivates a practitioner to embark on a spiritual journey in search
              of true freedom. :)</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also on another note, Thusness gives differing advices to people
              on what to practice. Some he would advice to practice vipassana,
              sometimes he advice self-inquiry, there was even once he adviced
              someone (who is deep into the I AM and penetrating into non-dual)
              to practice chanting as an antidote to her clinging to Presence. In
              fact in the conversation with Thusness I posted in this topic, his
              advice were mostly on Vipassana and experiencing Calmness
              (shamatha) - nothing about self-inquiry. It is only in I think 2008
              where he started advicing me on self inquiry. It all depends on the
              person's conditions, he will meditate on the person's conditions
              before giving the appropriate advice. He isn't biased towards self
              inquiry, or biased towards vipassana. Especially when he also
              mentioned before, self inquiry isn't meant for everyone, and it has
              its dangers as well (for example, before the realisation of I
              AMness, one can experience utter confusion and suffer during self
              inquiry, and after I AMness one can be so attached to Presence and
              end up having poor and very little sleep). So it really depends on
              whether that person is vested with the conditions to go into that
              path, both the teacher and student must check/gauge their
              conditions. (however, I am also aware that Thusness doesn't want to
              be seen as a dharma teacher of sorts)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">However, he also said that (hypothetically) if he starts a new sect
              or school, he will teach people self-inquiry as a starting
              practice, as he has gone through that path and will be able to
              guide and advice people more appropriately.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">It does not mean that self inquiry is a better path than Vipassana,
              or that Vipassana is a better path than Self-Inquiry: it all
              depends on the practitioner, what works for him is the best. For
              Daniel Ingram, Vipassana is the best. For Thusness, Self Inquiry is
              very important to lead to the initial realization of Buddha Nature,
              and it is something he has had experienced with. At a later phase,
              Thusness also practiced Vipassana (when he came into Buddhism, he
              started contemplating on anatta).</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If one follows the direct path however, one will go through the I
              AM phase, which as Thusness said is actually an important state
              though it isn't the end or final realisation (at least in
              Buddhism).</p>

                                  practice if it keeps reifying that sensation?</p>
              <p>from memory yes the sensation of presence does become an object
                                  of clinging, remember there were times when i constantly 'checked'
                                  to 'confirm its still there'. while its very confusing, there
                                  wasnt a question of doubt about the sense of self at that time. and
                                  this sense of heightened self does propel one without proper
                                  guidance to act or live forth in even more confusing
                                  ways.</p>
              <p>from some of your previous posts was mentioned that the presence
                                  of 'i am' is actually not a necessary experience. i tend to agree
                                  with this, lest there are also benefits to this experience?</p>

              <p>From my experience, the concentration practice such as 'focus on breathe' meditation will lead to the experience of I AM.</p>
              <p>To me, I AM is an experience of Presence that is mixed with some unconscious attachment/seeking. </p>
              <p>I dunno much about self-enquiry because i never really follow this practice... so can't comment on that.</p>
              <p>But I do the mindfulness/vipassana practice of noting. That is, i make an effort to note and be mindful of all that is going on in the daily experience of life. From my experience, this can lead to the cutting away of the attachments associated with the I AM presence experience.</p>
              <p>At I AM, presence is mixed with a sense of personal experience... This sense that expereince is personal give one's a feeling that the self ('I') is the doer/controller of one's action. It is felt that the decision making is that of the 'I'.</p>

              <p>There is a tricky part here which i am hesitant to write.. but felt that it is necessary but with risk. That is that, the noting practice should just be a noting. It should not be with the additonal 'action' of eliminating what is percieved as negative. This additonal action/intention of eliminating is actually also 'I/sense of self'. For example, in the mindfulness practice, one feel that anger has arised. By the normal convention of the memory, anger will be labelled as negative. The mind will automatically goes into elimination mode in order to try to kill/get rid of the arising anger. With this, the experience goes into a loop ... machiam the error of programing loop. It is just loop and loop. This is because the sense of self has took over to try to eliminate the anger.</p>
              <p>Point is, just note everything. Don't let anything become more important than the noting to take over it... Here, i can't fnd a better way to describe. :)</p>
              <p>The main difference in a 'self' and 'no-self (no 'I')' experience is that of center of reference.  The experience with self is felt to be experience through a personal center that is you/I/me. The experience of no-self is experienced without this personal reference center.</p>

              <p>Hi Longchen, thank you for this very clear explanation :)</p>
              <p>yes what u say does resonate :) agree that labelling of negative/ positive does result in a loop of reifying the self.</p>
              <p>once the loop is identified, noting the labelling and noting the 'act' of eliminating any negative thought opens up the mindfulness practice. its the identifying that is difficult. it is easier to discern this through focusing on the physical sensations aspect of feelings (vedana) as i find it more salient.</p>

              <p>Yah, Sir... that is very true indeed.</p>
              <p>About the 'self/I', it is easier to identify it when we are alone... and is not interacting with others.</p>
              <p>For my case, eating and walking are the easiest activties to be 'no-self'. There are just the actions without the 'I' there. Chewing is chewing, walking is walking...just pure action.</p>
              <p>It is alot more difficult to see 'no-self' when we are interacting with others. This is because the very act of interacting with other implies there are others to interact with oneself. However it is possible.</p>
              <p>I am just beginning to enter deeper into this phase... so can't be of much help. The key, that i see, is the daringness to drop the attachment of seeing others as separate. This is different from dropping all thoughts... because to maintain communication thoughts must be deployed. IMO, perhaps, before this phase can be maintained with any level of stability, a clear understanding of emptiness is firstly required. This is because the realisation of emptiness encompasses the insight that there is no-others. Without the clear insight of emptiness, it is very hard for the mind to be convinced that there are no one and no others.</p>

              <p>Japanese Zen is not common in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But if the follow is an accurate description of Shikantaza, then yes I do practice it :)</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Shikantaza: My thoughts on the practice of just sitting as an effective 
              means to noticing that which is
              <br> <br> In Shikantaza, we sit in a comfortable erect posture. Then we allow our 
              awareness to be in its natural state - Zen Mind, Original Face, and 
              realize this to be our ordinary everyday mind as it is. What exactly 
              this means is we 'allow' our mind to just be aware in an entirely 
              uncontrived manner. This can be surprisingly difficult for the beginner 
              because most people are unconscious of subtle tensions and "efforts to 
              do, to suppress or not do" something with their mind which are deeply 
              habitual - thinking, analyzing, fantasizing etc. If we can 'just sit' 
              and just be aware of what is, focusing on nothing in particular and 
              allowing our minds to rest, let go and just be aware and rest as THAT - 
              as-we-are - we will notice a sense of awareness opening up, of 
              brightness, of peace and ease. If allowed further, we will notice energy
               and bliss at some deeper dimension of awareness as Being itself. Taken 
              further we get an increasing, yet subtle sense of infinity and loss of 
              identification with the separate self arising from sensory stimuli.
              <br> <br> Implicit to this discussion is a distinction between awareness and mind.
               I am defining awareness as our basic fundamental nature - the Tao 
              itself. Mind in this context, is defined as cognitive activities or 
              functions arising out of the brain and possibly astral levels of being. 
              Mind may be considered a tool like the body. The body rests and just 
              sits there; the mind rests and just sits there unengaged. Awareness as 
              the fundamental nature of 'you' sees both the mind and the body, but is 
              neither mind nor body, nor is it dependent on mind and body for its 
              existence and function. Awareness is prior to mind and body. Awareness 
              is essential and unchanging; mind and body are epiphenomena existing in 
              awareness.
              <br> <br> The simple meditation practice of Shikantaza is this:
              <br> Just sit and be aware. The key then is to just be aware with no effort 
              to be aware - no doing, just be natural awareness as it is. If you find 
              yourself trying to be natural awareness as it is, then that is contrived
               and you have engaged the mind. Simply LET GO, relax, and be aware of 
              what is, but of nothing in particular. In letting go and naturally being
               aware of what is you will find that natural still point. Allow the mind
               to ease off and open up. This can be practiced at all time during the 
              day. Just be naturally aware, openly at ease, and spontaneously engaging
               - whether sitting or otherwise.
              <br> <br> This is true vipassana. Uncontrived. To see the natural state of reality
               as it is.
              <br> We should allow ourselves to notice mind throughout this period of 
              sitting, as with other particulars that arise; as mind is part of 
              reality, and not to be rejected, as rejection is an act of mind, not 
              awareness. Rejection is based on the false premises of mind. In so doing
               we will notice when we find ourselves having fallen into doing in which
               we 'try' to be open and relaxed, when this happens we are no longer in 
              an uncontrived state of natural abiding. The whole process requires 
              concentration; that is, being brightly aware of what is. Concentration 
              in this sense simply means being naturally aware and not being 
              distracted by having our attention divided by activities of mind. As 
              concentration wanes, awareness may become dull and one my space out, or 
              more often, one's thoughts will re-assert themselves and we will go off 
              on a tangent of thought. When we notice this we allow the stream of 
              thought to drop by letting go again of the activities of mind, and just 
              rest brightly aware of what is.
              <br> <br> So, it really is simple, just sit and be aware.
              <br> <br> A further point. Do not concentrate on sensory stimuli in particular, as
               that is contrived, it is effort of mind to do something. See this 
              subtle distinction. Awareness is brightly aware as its natural state, 
              there is not effort - no doing. Just be aware of what is - environment 
              and awareness itself - no artificial distinction between external and 
              internal - just the continuum of awareness. This, however, does not mean
               we are practicing awareness of awareness, that again is a contrived 
              condition, a use of mind to focus on awareness. In such a case we would 
              be privileging one object of awareness over another, and that is a use 
              of mind. Rather, we are just being aware, just sitting. Discrimination 
              in terms of intention, demarcation, effort, judgment are all discursive 
              faculties of mind. Awareness operates entirely through direct knowing or
               clearly apprehending the nature of what is - it simply sees it for 
              itself. No recourse to the inferential faculties of mind.
              <br> So, Shikantaza or Dzogchen practice is simple on the surface, but there 
              is much subtly and depth to it. Just sitting does not give it 
              explanatory justice.
              <br> <br> A final point on the body. Since the body is peripheral to awareness, it
               does not matter if the eyes are open or closed. Traditionally, they are
               open. There are merits and problems with both options. My 
              recommendation is conclude this question by what feels natural to you. 
              We do not wish to maintain unnatural, contrived states of body and mind 
              in our practice. Awareness is the practice... drop all else.
              <br> <br> In kind regards,
              <br> <br> Adam.</p>

              the cutting away of the attachments associated with the I AM
              presence experience.</p>
              <p>At I AM, presence is mixed with a sense of personal
              experience... This sense that expereince is personal give one's a
              feeling that the self ('I') is the doer/controller of one's action.
              It is felt that the decision making is that of the 'I'.</p>
              <p>To me, to be able to identify the 'I' is a very important phase

              for the 'I' to be discovered. As mentioned, mindfulness practice is
              the method (at least for me).</p>
              <p>There is a tricky part here which i am hesitant to write.. but
              felt that it is necessary but with risk. That is that, the noting
              practice should just be a noting. It should not be with the
              additonal 'action' of eliminating what is percieved as negative.
              This additonal action/intention of eliminating is actually also
              'I/sense of self'. For example, in the mindfulness practice, one
              feel that anger has arised. By the normal convention of the memory,
              anger will be labelled as negative. The mind will automatically
              goes into elimination mode in order to try to kill/get rid of the
              arising anger. With this, the experience goes into a loop ...
              machiam the error of programing loop. It is just loop and loop.
              This is because the sense of self has took over to try to eliminate
              the anger.</p>
              <p>Point is, just note everything. Don't let anything become more
              important than the noting to take over it... Here, i can't fnd a
              better way to describe. :)</p>
              <p>The main difference in a 'self' and 'no-self (no 'I')'
              experience is that of center of reference.  The experience
              with self is felt to be experience through a personal center that
              is you/I/me. The experience of no-self is experienced without this
              personal reference center.</p>

              <p>One has to resolve attention first before dissolving attention owing to our tendencies but when trust &amp; confidence is developed, not necessary. like a young kid learning to ride bicycle, one has to stop every very often at first to stand on his legs, until at one point, he can go on indefinitely without standing.</p>

              <p>It is just like you cannot create the sun, you can only realise that the sun is already hanging there behind the clouds. Even though clouds dissipating may make it easier to notice or recognise the sun, it doesnt mean that when there are clouds it's not there. In fact we can equally recognise awareness in the presence of thoughts.</p>
              <p>What's very important here is to clarify your true identity: whether you
                                                               are a person who can experience, be aware of, or lose awareness of Presence, or are you the naturally Self-Knowing/Self-Aware Awareness/Presence
                                                               which experiences the illusory thought of being a person, or the illusory thought of having 'gained' or 'lost' Presence (as well as 
                                                              being aware in the absence of thoughts). What is important is not achieving a state you don't yet have, but clearing the delusion about who you are, and all threads of delusion of being an individual person separate from Reality itself. That is why simply inquiring 'Who Am I' will clear all doubts and confusion and lead the practitioner back to the Source.</p>
              <p>Update: just found a very relevant pointer from this week's pointers by John Wheeler: <em>"</em><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, helvetica; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13px;"><em>You have never been some limited, separate thing standing apart from reality. This recognition undermines once and for good the basis of all the seeking, suffering and doubt, which is predicated on being a limited “I” in the appearance. This you never were. So you are only what you are and always have been. Words can only point, but with or without the words, you are."</em></span></p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Adam West is someone who used to frequent Dharma Overground and Kenneth Folk Dharma forum. Thusness and I thinks his posts are quite good. He has non-dual realisation and is recently moving into No Mind. Btw just curious, did you receive shikantaza instructions from a living teacher or do you read it from books?</p>
              <p>I'd say non-dual awareness is not impossible but unavoidable, because awareness is not a state to be contrived by effort. Rather, your very essence is Awareness - right now effortlessly seeing, effortlessly reading these words, effortlessly observing the thoughts, effortlessly just being, without which nothing is or can be. As Daniel says, <em>"</em><span><em>the whole sensate universe by definition can't arise without the quality of awareness by definition"</em>.</span> So it is not so much that we have to create a state of awareness, but rather a noticing and realising of what is always already so, just plain ordinary present awareness, that which allows everything to be seen and experienced. Awareness is always already self-aware by nature, it is by nature unfabricated vivid, self-knowing presence, that is what it is. We just need to recognise that... and, again and again (as we tend to get distracted by dualistic thoughts). You cant fabricate or create a state of awareness of awareness (that would be dualistic, as it implies two: someone becoming aware of something called awareness - which means there is still delusion of a being separate person), it is not that you have to go and find and be aware of something called 'awareness', there isn't a thing you can do to bring about awareness (it is already here!), rather you can only recognise that unfabricated self-knowing awareness that is already present as your very essence and already non-dual by nature, pervading and giving rise to all experiences.</p>
              <p>It is just like you cannot create the sun, you can only realise that the sun is already hanging there behind the clouds. Even though clouds dissipating may make it easier to notice or recognise the sun, it doesnt mean that when there are clouds it's not there. In fact we can equally recognise awareness in the presence of thoughts.</p>
              <p>What's very important here is to clarify your true identity: whether you are a person who can experience, be aware of, or lose awareness of Presence, or are you the naturally Self-Knowing/Self-Aware Awareness/Presence which experiences the illusory thought of being a person, or the illusory thought of having 'gained' or 'lost' Presence (as well as being aware in the absence of thoughts). What is important is not achieving a state you don't yet have, but clearing the delusion about who you are, and all threads of delusion of being an individual person separate from Reality itself. That is why simply inquiring 'Who Am I' will clear all doubts and confusion and lead the practitioner back to the Source.</p>
              <p>Update: just found a very relevant pointer from this week's pointers by John Wheeler: <em>"</em><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, helvetica;"><em>You have never been some limited, separate thing standing apart from reality. This recognition undermines once and for good the basis of all the seeking, suffering and doubt, which is predicated on being a limited “I” in the appearance. This you never were. So you are only what you are and always have been. Words can only point, but with or without the words, you are."</em></span></p>
              <p>Attention/concentration is necessary, but not in the way we might think it is. It is more like resting in the recognition of naturally abiding awareness, than a focusing of sorts.</p>
              <p>As Adam West wrote above: <em>The whole process requires concentration; that is, being brightly aware of what is. Concentration in this sense simply means being naturally aware and not being distracted by having our attention divided by activities of mind. As concentration wanes, awareness may become dull and one my space out, or more often, one's thoughts will re-assert themselves and we will go off on a tangent of thought. When we notice this we allow the stream of thought to drop by letting go again of the activities of mind, and just rest brightly aware of what is.</em></p>
              <p>and also,<em><br><br>A further point. Do not concentrate on sensory stimuli in particular, as that is contrived, it is effort of mind to do something. See this subtle distinction. Awareness is brightly aware as its natural state, there is not effort - no doing. Just be aware of what is - environment and awareness itself - no artificial distinction between external and internal - just the continuum of awareness. This, however, does not mean we are practicing awareness of awareness, that again is a contrived condition, a use of mind to focus on awareness. In such a case we would be privileging one object of awareness over another, and that is a use of mind. Rather, we are just being aware, just sitting.</em></p>
              <p>And Zen Master Anzan Hoshin says:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wwzc.org/teisho/beginners.htm">http://www.wwzc.org/teisho/beginners.htm</a></p>
              <p><em>One way of working with experience can be called the path of meditation. And this recognizes that we get very confused because we identify a lot with our names and stories and words and our attention is always scattering. And so we want to take this scattering and bring it to a kind of settled state so that instead of the mind flipping around to the past, the present, the future, and all of these different things that we are aware of, we want to find one thing that we are aware of and pay attention to it. And so we narrow our attention down and just pay attention to one thing instead of letting our attention scatter.</em></p>
              <p><em>Now, if we catch any of you doing that here, you will be thrown out because that is not what we do. Zen is not about meditation. You cannot compare it to meditation. The problem is not the scattering. The scattering occurs because of focusing, because our attention contracts on something and then excludes everything else. So, simply focusing our attention on something else, say [counting] the breath or [focusing on] a mantra or a visualized image is exactly the same thing that we have been doing that has been confusing us in the first place, except that we are just going to learn how to do it better so that we can become even more thoroughly confused. Because all that we will have done is focus on one fragment of our experience. We will not understand what our experience in itself is, what our life in itself is, or who we are because the most fundamental question, of course, is what is it that is experiencing experience? What is it that is aware?</em></p>
              <p><em>There are all kinds of things that we are aware of: Colours and forms and sounds, different ways of being aware, waking, sleeping, dreaming, all kinds of subtle states, yogic states and so on, which are possible. But those are all things that we are aware of. What is the awareness? Regardless of what we are aware of -- a colour, a person, a building, anger, fear -- what do all of those things have in common? They all have in common the fact that we are aware of them. Regardless of what we are experiencing, the basic fact is that there is this experiencing presenting itself as these experiences. And if we want to understand what that is, we have to work with the whole of our experience and we have to work with the process of how experience presents itself.</em></p>
              <p>Also,</p>
              <p><em><strong>Toni Packer said,</strong> "There is no need for awareness to turn anywhere. It's here! Everything is here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no one who does it. Awareness and the sound of a plane are here with no one in the middle trying to "do" them or bring them together. They are here together! The only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is the "me"-circuit with its separative thinking. When that is quiet, divisions do not exist."<br><br>Joan Tollifson ("student" of Toni), "This open being is not something to be practiced methodically. Toni points out that it takes no effort to hear the sounds in the room; it's all here. There's no "me" (and no problem) until thought comes in and says: "Am I doing it right? Is this 'Awareness'? Am I enlightened?" Suddenly the spaciousness is gone—the mind is occupied with a story and the emotions it generates."<br><br>As John Welwood says: "This larger awareness is self-existing: it cannot be fabricated or manufactured because it is always present, whether we notice it or not."</em></p>
              <p>And Shayne says, "<em><br><br>their is no great void.<br><br>their is nothingness.<br><br>no one thing ness.<br><br>this emptiness you speak of springs from the self.<br><br>when i was a boy of 13 i remember attempting to look for something. i found it. my attention. i looked in the mirror. i looked at my eyes. i looked at my eyebrows....my lips. then i just stopped. my " mind " unfocused and i was pure awareness.<br><br>when i was a young adult i was without i till i met my ex.<br><br>now that im 38 i am unpreoccupied with my attention. ive learnt my " lesson "<br><br>when not thinking the attention dont exist.<br><br>when not focusing on a particular sense object the attention dont exist.<br><br>attention is insecureity is doubt.<br><br>close your eyes.............the eyes naturally open by themselves when you are no longer focusing.<br><br>what is was and always will be is this moment.<br><br>bipolar is a conditioning of the mind.<br><br>i dont believe in the id the ego or the super ego.<br><br>i dont believe in the subconscious.<br><br>i dont believe in time.</em></p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>As you have said, awareness is always there. Trungpa Rp said it quite well, awareness is like the wind, juz leave the windows open.  I think the Surangama sutra said it very well about awareness.</p>
              <p>However, it is not possible to juz go into full-fledged awareness immediately. We rely on clutches, first resolve attention to cut distractions, then dissolve attention to cut fixation.  That's how i see it.   The constant checking back to be aware of awareness is inevitable and also helpful to keep the meditation fresh until one goes on to deeper trust of the paranormicness.  I think that's the same as what u mean by attention or mindfulness.</p>
              <p>Fabrication is always inevitable till the deepest realisation. </p>
              <p>I talk like i understand... actually i'm juz a novice... hee hee ... no, i have not received instructions on Japanese meditation at all. I am juz struck at the profundity of the technique of Shikantaza... personally i dun really like to dwell too much on the analysis of meditating... as Longchen said quite well,</p>

              <p>As you have said, awareness is always there. Trungpa Rp said it
                                                                                          quite well, awareness is like the wind, juz leave the windows
                                                                                          open.  I think the Surangama sutra said it very well about
                                                                                          awareness.</p>

                                                                                          That's how i see it.   The constant checking back to be

              <p>On the other hand, full fledge awareness is always already present whether you notice or not ;) In fact there is no half fledge, full fledge... there is just Awareness. It is just thoughts that separates it.</p>
              <p>For me if I'm lost in distractions, I might ask, Who is distracted? And then you see that it is not so much that I am a separate self being distracted from Awareness, all that is happening is that thoughts are occuring, there is misidentification with the mind (thoughts) and the body, but in actuality there are simply thoughts appearing in the Presence of Awareness which I am. You have in actuality never been (someone) distracted from Awareness, because you Are Awareness, you are not a limited self separate from Reality.</p>
              <p>It's like misidentifying yourself as some objects or characters in the cinema screen, and then asking "where is the screen?" and then you may then try to 'resolve the attention', do something about it in the movie etc but with the delusion of still being that separate self and hence not really resolving the issue - actually, the screen is always here, you just misidentify yourself as a particular object and overlook your true nature as Total Presence (i.e. the screen). In fact as I see it... attention can only change from one object to another (in the cinema screen). We are always paying attention already one way or another. Previously you are attending to/chasing some moving objects in the cinema screen, but now you are focusing on a stable object on the cinema screen, and yet there is still no clarity on what the screen is. Attention simply amplifies a particular object of awareness - attention 
                                              is not the same as awareness, attention is a focused thought form, while 
                                              awareness simply awares everything without choice.  The question that needs to be asked is, to whom is attention happening, without which there can be no attention? And further: when you are paying attention to your breathe, what is it that choicelessly hears the sound of bird chirping even without you intending to do so? What is the screen in which all is occuring?</p>
              <p>As Rupert Spira said to me (I asked him about distractions months ago):</p>
              <p><em>This 'I' that we now consider ourselves to be seems to be distracted, 
                                                                                          to<br>believe such and such, to overlook Awareness and to enter a dream. 
                                                                                          However,<br>this 'I' is non-existent as such. A non-existent entity never does 
                                                                                          anything.<br>With this understanding, the 'I' is returned to its proper place, 
                                                                                          as<br>Awareness.</em></p>
              <p>When the 'I' is returned to its proper place, then you are back at the naturally abiding Awareness. You realise you are not a limited self entity that can be distracted from, or even experience, Awareness, you are also not even attention (which is another contrived thought form), rather you ARE the natural, effortless, ordinary Awareness. You don't have to try to maintain the Awareness, there is just this recognition that it is there - as Adam says, <em>Awareness is brightly aware
                                                                                                                  as its natural state, there is not effort - no 
                                                                                          doing.</em></p>

              <p>To focus attention on an object is fine at the beginning - in fact it will help develop good qualities like the Tranquil Calm that Thusness mentioned.</p>
              <p>However this does not directly lead to the arising of insight into our nature. The question of identity must be resolved for wisdom into our pristine awareness to arise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I quoted from someone before.. <em>Imagine a torch shining on a wall...The torch symbolises
                                          the SEEING, and the light which emanates from 
                  the torch and hits
                                          the wall symbolises the thoughts. The problem is
                   that you are
                                          trying to find the torch, (ie: the SEEING), but 
                  you are looking for
                                          it on the wall, (ie: in the thoughts). Also, 
                  thoughts can happen
                                          thick and fast and can be quite erratic...  so 
                  not only are
                                          you <strong>looking in the wrong place</strong>,
                   but you are
                                          chasing a moving target. A mantra at least 
                  steadies the appearance
                                          of the thoughts. It's like steadying the light 
                  on the wall, so you
                                          have a better chance of tracing the beam back to
                   its source, but
                                          never forget, only the torch (the SEEING) is the
                   source. The mantra
                                          is nothing but a thought, an appearance that has
                   no independent
                                          nature, repeated. However, as I have said, 
                  whilst a mantra can help
                                          on the so called 'search', it is not actually 
                  necessary. Knowledge
                                          is the DIRECT method.</em></p>
              <p><em>No techniques are needed. The SEEING ( 
                  the ordinary everyday
                                          awareness ) does not need to do anything to BE, 
                  to exist. Any
                                          techniques can only be on the level of thought, 
                  and therefore are
                                          outside of the only reality which is the SEEING.
                   The SEEING is
                                          NEVER not there, it is ALWAYS seeing the 
                  thoughts, no matter what
                                          they may be. It is always aware of everything, 
                  it cannot under any
                                          circumstances not be there, you can't lose it. 
                  So just BE IT. HAVE
                                          A SENSE OF IDENTITY WITH IT AND NOTHING ELSE. 
                  You ARE the torch
                                          !</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, Zen Master Anzan Hoshin said:</p>
              <p><em>simply focusing our attention on something else, say
                                      [counting] the breath or [focusing on] a mantra 
              or a visualized
                                      image is exactly the same thing that we have 
              been doing that has
                                      been confusing us in the first place, except 
              that we are just going
                                      to learn how to do it better so that we can 
              become even more
                                      thoroughly confused. Because all that we will 
              have done is focus on
                                      one fragment of our experience. We will not 
              understand what our
                                      experience in itself is, what our life in itself
               is, or who we are
                                      because the most fundamental question, of 
              course, is what is it
                                      that is experiencing experience? What is it that
               is aware?</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Also... I notice that though Awareness is always present, there can be degrees of luminosity - clarity to it.</p>
              <p>Actually Awareness is 100% fully present all the times, but if we keep engaging in conceptual activities, then awareness is not experienced as vivid as before.</p>
              <p>Why is that so?</p>
              <p>Because Awareness can only be experienced directly, without intermediary, it must be directly touched. That is why the importance of "<em>not being distracted by having our attention divided by activities
                                                                                              of mind"</em></p>
              <p>The further we drop... the brighter and more intense the luminosity is experienced. Perception becomes vivid and 'intense' (not that things becomes more intense, but even ordinary things like eating and walking becomes vivid and clear and wonderful). That is why Adam says be 'brightly' aware. Sometimes I even get a mental image of my mind as brightly shining like a sun, even though the mental image is not the reality itself but the closest conceptual representation of the formless 'thing' that the mind can find.</p>
              <p>It can be so intense that you will spontaneously smile, there may even be tears, at the sheer wonder of it. Friends may find you weird if you are walking with them. LOL</p>
              <p>So why did Mahakashyapa smile at the twirling flower?</p>
              <p>By the way... the letting go and the luminosity re-inforces each other: the more you let go, the more luminous perception is, and the more luminous perception is, the more willing you are to let go of the mind activities. Because it is so wonderful!</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is what Thusness meant when he said years ago,</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: arial;">To drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the 
                              mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is possible; an

                              experiences of the joy, bliss and clarity of wholeness. Without the 
                              insight into the possiblity and the experience of the positive factors, 
                              the mind will not release itself from holding.</span><br><br></em><span style="font-family: arial;"><em>Even open pure and innocent inquiry is a

                               from such mode of inquiry aka 'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of 
                              this resting must be experienced for the 'willingness' to arise.</em><br></span></p>

              <p>Btw, Awareness is equally present whether it is realised or not. Investigate and see if it is otherwise. In terms of Buddha Nature, there is no difference between a bee, a human, a Buddha.</p>
              <p>If there is no awareness, you won't be reading these words now. Who is seeing?</p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>true that awareness is always there... i agree fully with this.  Surangama sutra say it so well.  I am talking from point of view of the person on the path... You and I are talking about the same thing juz from different perspective.</p>
              <p>When awareness is fully realised, all the qualities of Buddhahood will arise naturally as it is inherent in rigpa.  But fact is we have not realised it fully, so qualities have not arisen.  It is there but not realised.  And as i've said, whatever glimpse one has is unstable and for most people, still more or less stained with fabrication</p>

              <p>Oh yes of course.. Awareness is ever-present but realization must arise. But it is not somewhere out there in the future to work 'towards' (that 'over there' is an illusion and leads to looking at the wrong direction), just look at Who am I?</p>
              <p>Actually 'no time', 'no distance' and 'seeing future' are different things, and are experienced in different levels.</p>
              <p>We experience time and space when we are lost in conceptual identities.</p>
              <p>When you are abiding as I AM, there is no sense of time and space. There is only the all-pervading Self. It is very obvious that Awareness doesn't move! It is totally timeless. From this perspective, there is no death. Why? Because Awareness is the ground reality, the Eternal Now, in which things come and go, pops in and out of this Ground, but this Eternal Present, this Awareness, which is what you are, is unaffected, unmoved. As Awareness, you are unborn, undying. Ask yourself - things come and go, thoughts come and go, but have you ever moved out of the Present Moment, and is the Present Moment even affected in any way by the comings and goings? The answer is No!</p>
              <p>However, when you reach non-dual, then timelessness and no distance enters a new level. At this level we also experience 'no distance' with anything perceived because experience is not at all divided by subject and object. I have several glimpses of non-dual, but for it to become permanent there must be arising non-dual insight (Thusness Stage 4 and 5)</p>

                                               He/she will eventually move to the experience that the “Light is really
                                               the Everything”.<br><br>In the first case, the Light will appear to be 
                                              still and the transience appears to be moving. Collapsing of space and 
                                              time will only be experienced when one resides in Self. However if the 
                                              mind continues to see the 'Light' as separated from the 'Everything' , 
                                              then realization will appear to be apart from development.<br><br>In the
                                               second case when we experience the “Light is really the Everything”, 
                                              then Everything will be experienced as manifesting yet not moving. This 
                                              is the experience of wholeness and completeness in an instantaneous 
                                              moment or Eternity in a moment. When this experience becomes clear in 
                                              practice, then witness is seen as the transience. Space and time will 
                                              also collapse when we experience the completeness and wholeness of 
                                              transience. An instantaneous moment of manifestation that is complete 
                                              and whole in its own also does not involve movement and change (No 
                                              changing thing, only change). Practicing being 'bare' in attention yet 
                                              at the same time noticing the 3 characteristics will eventually bring us
                                               to this point.<br><br>However what has a yogi overcome when moving from
                                               case 1 to 2 and what exactly is the cause of separation in the first 
                                              place? I think realizing this cause is of utmost importance for solving 
                                              the paradox of realization and development.</p>

              <p>Next is 'seeing into the future'. Seeing into the future is the area of shamatha, and insight practictioners need not experience clairvoyance.</p>
              <p>However there will be a time when 'insight absorption' arises and leads to 'non local events'. Things like seeing into future, remote vision, mind read, seeing past lives, etc etc. happens normally. But this is different from 'shamatha absorption' and only when one enters very deeply into Anatta and Emptiness does this arise.</p>
              <p>I don't think those who only experienced I AM and Non Dual will necessarily experience these unless they are also trained in Shamatha.</p>

                                              the job of concentration. Concentration till one enters into a deep 
                                              stage of absorption and object-subject becomes one, a state of 
                                              transcendence. Non-local experiences in such a practice are reached 
                                              through the power of ‘focus’. So the key towards non-local experiences 
                                              is absorption and transcendence.<br><br>Non-duality on the other hand is
                                               a form of realization, a realization that all along there never was a 
                                              split. Its clarity and level of transcendence come from dissolving the 
                                              ‘seeds’ that prevents the ‘seeing’. Very seldom we hear people talk 
                                              about the non-local aspect in the practice of wisdom but non-duality do 
                                              meet non-locality at the point of transcendence (phase 4). It is some 
                                              sort of absorption as in the case of concentration but it is more of 
                                              'clarity till the point of absorption'. It may sound paradoxical, but 
                                              this is true. This is the way of wisdom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;">There are many layers of 
                                          consciousness and the truth of non-duality must first sink deep down 
                                          into the inmost consciousness. It is important to reach the phase of 
                                          ‘turning point’ as at this phase, the realization of no-self has sunk 
                                          sufficiently deep into consciousnesses till there is no retreat. 
                                          Otherwise that joy and experience of no-self will be lost in few months 
                                          time (This is my experience) and re-surface again until "Emptiness as 
                                          forms' is deeply experienced. In phase 2-3, non-local experiences may be
                                           experienced for some people and mostly with the help of concentration 
                                          (like asking a question of our past lives) it can be experienced after 
                                          6-9 months of practices especially after deeply experiencing ‘Emptiness 
                                          is Form’. Non-local aspect is triggered at the point of transcendence.</span></p>

              <p>Actually 'no time', 'no distance' and 'seeing future' are different things, and are experienced in different levels.</p>
              <p>We experience time and space when we are lost in conceptual identities.</p>
              <p>When you are abiding as I AM, there is no sense of time and space. There is only the all-pervading Self. It is very obvious that Awareness doesn't move! It is totally timeless. From this perspective, there is no death. Why? Because Awareness is the ground reality, the Eternal Now, in which things come and go, pops in and out of this Ground, but this Eternal Present, this Awareness, which is what you are, is unaffected, unmoved. As Awareness, you are unborn, undying. Ask yourself - things come and go, but have you ever moved out of the Present  Moment, and is the Present Moment even affected in any way by the comings and goings? The answer is No!</p>
              <p>However, when you reach non-dual, then timelessness and no distance enters a new level. At this level we also experience 'no distance' with anything perceived because experience is not at all divided by subject and object. I have several glimpses of non-dual, but for it to become permanent there must be arising non-dual insight (Thusness Stage 4 and 5)</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote previously regarding the difference between 'timelessness' in I AM and the 'timelessness' in Anatta,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next is 'seeing into the future'. Seeing into the future is the area of shamatha, and insight practictioners need not experience clairvoyance.</p>
              <p>However there will be a time when 'insight absorption' arises and leads to 'non local events'. Things like seeing into future, remote vision, mind read, seeing past lives, etc etc. happens normally. But this is different from 'shamatha absorption' and only when one enters very deeply into Anatta and Emptiness does this arise.</p>
              <p>I don't think those who only experienced I AM and Non Dual will necessarily experience these unless they are also trained in Shamatha.</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/different-degrees-of-non-duality.html">The Different Degrees of Non-Duality</a>,</p>

              <p>What we are discussing is whether a person on the path will experience non-dual awareness or not... my proof is that if one is always experiencing such, one will be in the experience of timelessness and be able to tell the future...</p>
              <p>I am sure that one who has realised rigpa, juz thru that realisation, is able to see the future at will and accurately.  I have not heard that seeing the future is within the province of the shamatha meditators... but it may be due to my ignorance. </p>
              <p>You say that insight meditators need not experience clairvoyance.  I dun think so.  To me that is quite a strange suggestion. Such qualities are inherent within awareness.  When the concept of time is truly dissolved through realisation, the veils that block one from seeing the future fall apart and this is the natural state of things... Anyway, we may not be talking about the same thing.  I am not familiar with many of your terms, eg I-AM etc.</p>
              <p>In Dzogchen terminology, shamatha is considered to be the 'stable' aspect of the recognition of rigpa. It can't be divorced from insight.  Not the same as what shamatha is in the other vehicles.  It is not juz concentration.  Shamatha takes on different meanings in the different levels of the teachings.</p>
              <p>What Thusness wrote about the light and source... i feel is already addressed in the teachings as essence and manifestation... i think if a person had a teacher guiding him, he will not have such a misunderstanding in the first place... it is quite needless because he or she will already be equipped with the right view.</p>

              <p>Seeing the future is definitely within the province of shamatha, in fact it is said that even ghosts can tell the future (though to a limited extent according to Ven Chin Kung). Even if you can see future through Shamatha doesn't mean enlightenment. Therefore telling the future is no indication or evidence of enlightenment. As a matter of fact, out of the 6 supernatural powers, Hindus and other religions have many practitioners throughout history that have mastery of Shamatha and have mastered the first 5 supernatural powers. Only the 6th concerns enlightenment and Buddhahood and therefore is peculiar to Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Non Dual (aka no subject object duality, aka Thusness Stage 4) is not enough for non local (aka supernatural) experiences unless one also masters shamatha. To experience non locally purely by insight requires very deep realisation of Anatta and Emptiness, leading to non-local experience and insight-absorption.</p>
              <p> p.s. just added a line to the previous post:</p>
              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>maybe i can put it this way... in non-dual 
                              awareness, there is
                                                      no sense of time.... or even distance etc.  Is 
                              that in our
                                                      normal experience of things now always?  The 
                              answer is quite
                                                      obviously no... a person who has realised 
                              non-dual awareness can
                                                      see the future quite easily, is that within the 
                              usual ability of
                                                      everyone... so no again.  Therefore i say that 
                              although
                                                      non-dual awareness is always there for everyone,
                               but we have to
                                                      work to realise it fully.</p>

              <p><em>Oh yes of course.. Awareness is ever-present
