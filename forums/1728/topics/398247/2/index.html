              Conventionally, to experience non-local aspect of pristine awareness is through concentration. It is the job of concentration. Concentration till one enters into a deep stage of absorption and object-subject becomes one, a state of transcendence</blockquote>
              <p><br>Regarding this part, maybe you need to do some explanation, how is it that concentration can lead to the dissolving of 'object-subject'... it is very suspicious and feels more like one of the worldly meditative states... i think the object-subject dissolution or nonduality is used too loosely and leaves out the possibility of subtle fixation.</p>

              <p>Seeing the future is definitely within the province of shamatha, in fact it is said that even ghosts can tell the future (though to a limited extent according to Ven Chin Kung). Even if you can see future through Shamatha doesn't mean enlightenment. Therefore telling the future is no indication or evidence of enlightenment. As a matter of fact, out of the 6 supernatural powers, Hindus and other religions have many practitioners throughout history that have mastery of Shamatha and have mastered the first 5 supernatural powers. Only the 6th concerns enlightenment and Buddhahood and therefore is peculiar to Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Non Dual (aka no subject object duality, aka Thusness Stage 4) is not enough for non local (aka supernatural) experiences unless one also masters shamatha. That requires very deep realisation of Anatta and Emptiness, leading to non-local experience and insight-absorption.</p>
              <p> p.s. just added a line to the previous post:</p>
              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>maybe i can put it this way... in non-dual awareness, there is no sense of time.... or even distance etc.  Is that in our normal experience of things now always?  The answer is quite obviously no... a person who has realised non-dual awareness can see the future quite easily, is that within the usual ability of everyone... so no again.  Therefore i say that although non-dual awareness is always there for everyone, but we have to work to realise it fully.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Oh yes of course.. Awareness is ever-present but realization must arise. But it is not somewhere out there in the future to work 'towards' (that 'over there' is an illusion and leads to looking at the wrong direction), just look at Who am I?</em></p>

              <p>I dunnu if it is mentioned in Buddhist sutras, but it is mentioned in Hindu sutras:</p>
              <p>Excerpt</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.yogichen.org/cw/cw28/bk029.html">http://www.yogichen.org/cw/cw28/bk029.html</a></p>
              <h1>Supernatural Power, Buddhist and Hindu</h1>
              <h2>CW28:No.29<br> (Chapter 17 of "Discriminations Between Buddhist and Hindu 
              Tantras")</h2>
              <h3>Yogi C. M. Chen</h3>
              <p><br> We Buddhists give most of our attention to the practice of 
              concentration
                      and meditation on voidness, through this, all the sorrows and 
              the root
                      of sorrow, which is the inner self, the eighth consciousness, 
              may be overcome
                      and transformed into Buddha's wisdom. We are not desirous of 
              getting supernatural
                      powers that will make the inner self strong enough to fight with
               others.
                      When the farmer works diligently in the field and it is time for
               harvest,
                      the chaff is gotten along with the rice; so we practice 
              according to tantric
                      instructions for full Enlightenment in this lifetime and when we
               become
                      accomplished, supernatural powers are also attained 
              simultaneously. But
                      to the Western scholars or researchers, supernatural power is an
               interesting
                      subject. They read books on Tantric Hinduism which describe many
               wonderful
                      things and think that the Hindus certainly have no less power 
              than the
                      Tantric Buddhists. In order to correct this misunderstanding, I 
              am writing
                      this chapter.</p>
              <p>The main difference in this regard is this--the Tantric Hindus 
              and other
                      non-Buddhists have five supernatural powers: divyacaksus 
              (instantaneous
                      view of anything anywhere), divyasrotra (ability to hear any 
              sound anywhere),
                      paracittajnana (ability to know the thoughts of all other 
              minds), purvanivasanusmrtijnana
                      (knowledge of all former existences of oneself and others), and 
              rddhi-saksatkriya
                      (the power to be anywhere or do anything at will). But only the 
              Buddhist
                      has the final one, Anasrava, which accompanies all the others. 
              With Anasrava,
                      the above mentioned powers become limitless and greater in 
              power. The reason
                      for the Buddhist superiority is this: the Buddhist Tantric 
              practitioner
                      spends much time and energy avoiding his own sorrows whether 
              gross or subtle.
                      The root of sorrow is ignorance and the root of ignorance is the
               inner
                      self. The Tantric Hindu, holding tightly to the higher self, 
              limits his
                      wisdom and power while the Buddhist, being free of even this, 
              attains unlimited
                      wisdom and power.</p>
              <p>Enough of theory. Let us look at some actual comparisons. 
              We can begin
                      with the scriptures.</p>
              <p>A. In Hinduism, in the book Mysterious Kundalini by
                      Vasant G. Rele, on page 68, eight Ashta siddhis are written of:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>1) "Anima--A yogi concentrating, meditating and fixing his 
              attention
                        on this quality of the soul during forced exhalation, draws 
              together
                        his entire energy to a point which is then made to penetrate 
              into all
                        bodies so as to make them vibrate according to the will of the
               Yogi."</p>
              <p>But he cannot again draw his energy from this little point 
              into the voidness
                        nature which is the final truth of Buddhism. He does not 
              believe in that.</p>
              <p>2) "Mahima--This is also a special quality of the soul. A 
              yogi by mere
                        inhalation of air makes his body assume a large size and 
              comprehends
                        the universe in himself as was done by Krishna."</p>
              <p>This universe spoken of is the worldly one and does not 
              include that of
                        Buddhism, and he cannot enlarge and extend himself from his 
              universe to
                        the voidness nature because of the same reason given in the 
              last Siddhi.
                        It is said in the philosophy of mathematics that infinity and 
              the unlimited
                        decimals are equal to zero, so the voidness can be both 
              infinity and unlimited
                        decimals. The Hindus have no anasrava supernatural power and 
              they cannot
                        reach voidness.</p>
              <p>3) "Laghima--He can make his body as light as a feather so 
              that it can
                        float in the air or in water. The yogi's power of traveling 
              thousands
                        of miles in a moment is attributed to this Siddhi."</p>
              <p>Even traveling in a moment is limited by time. In Buddhism 
              there are
                        many good examples of this power, one of which was quoted in 
              "Kundalini Yoga" (a
                        Hindu work by Sivananda) as follows: "Once an outsider asked 
              Milarepa for
                        a contest to see which of them could arrive at the top of the 
              snow hill
                        first. This outsider is riding on a magic drum and begins to 
              fly up the
                        hill the next morning while Milarepa was still sleeping. When 
              his disciple
                        saw the outsider halfway up the hill, he called for Milarepa 
              to get up
                        but Milarepa continued to sleep. The outsider had almost 
              arrived at the
                        top of the hill. By only one thought Milarepa arrived at the 
              top. The outsider
                        lost all his supernatural power and fell down." Here Milarepa,
               though
                        quoted by a Hindu worker, is well-known even to Westerners as 
              the Great
                        Tibetan Yogi. To a great yogi accomplished in the voidness 
              meditation,
                        there is no limitation in space and time, but to a Hindu there
               is the
                        limitation of Brahma or the high self which I have mentioned 
              in practically
                        every chapter.</p>
              <p>4) "Garima--A yogi increases specific gravity of the body 
              thus making
                        it as heavy as a mountain by swallowing large draughts of air 
              and compressing
                        them in the tissues of the body."</p>
              <p>The quantities of air swallowed cannot compare with that of 
              the Tantric
                        Buddhist.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5) "Prapti--When in Samadhi the yogi acquires the power of 
              predicting
                        future events, of understanding unknown languages, of curing 
              disease
                        and of divining the unexpressed thoughts of others." </strong></span></p>
              <p>The time of the future is limited by the kapla of Brahma's

              expectations and
                        the power of casting off the old skin and maintaining a 
              youthful appearance
                        for an unusually long period of time. This is recorded as 
              being true
                        in the case of yogi King Yayati and Aleiluades who maintained 
              unfading
                        youth to the last day of their lives."</p>

              Buddhist yogis
                        such as the lotus-born Padmasambhava who are still alive. Not 
              only he but
                        many, many others such as Saraha, Harvarapa, Biwapa, and 
              females Such as
                        Nukuma, Yishitoga, Sukarsiddhi who have attained non-death

              <p>This occurs in Tantric Buddhism also. Even in Ch'an there are
               disciples
                        who were tigers. In Christianity Saint Francis tamed a fox who
               had killed
                        many people.</p>

              <p><br> Regarding this part, maybe you need to do some explanation, how is
                                              it that concentration can lead to the dissolving of
                                              'object-subject'... it is very suspicious and feels more like one
                                              of the worldly meditative states... i think the object-subject
                                              dissolution or nonduality is used too loosely and leaves out the
                                              possibility of subtle fixation.</p>

              <p>Samadhi can lead to a state where duality dissolves. In fact samadhi precisely means subject and object merge or dissolve.</p>
              <p>But it is not a realisation of non-duality, it is just a state where you become one with the chanting, or the object of meditation. There is no inner or outer, subject and object. But it is just a temporary state. It is due to concentration only, no insight.</p>
              <p>Realisation of reality as never been divided into subject and object is a different thing: it is a realisation, not a stage of experience.</p>
              <p>Through maturation of realisation one can be perpetually in absorption, but not through concentration that forces subject and object to merge, but by insight that sees that there is no subject-object division to begin with. It is 'clarity till the point of absorption'.</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote before,</p>
              <p><em>Division of subject and object is merely an assumption.<br>Thus someone giving up and something to be given up is an illusion.<br>When self becomes more and more transparent,<br>Likewise phenomena become more and more luminous.<br>In thorough transparency all happening are pristinely and vividly clear.<br>Obviousness throughout, aliveness everywhere!</em></p>
