            <div class='col-md body'>hi thnks for posting.I think is useful to explore some basic differences between <strong>Theravada </strong>and <strong>Mahayana Buddhism</strong><br><br>Given that the goals of Theravada and Mahayana are different, it is no surprise that the Path to these goals is also said to be different. Theravada seems to make use of the famous "eight-fold" path. In Mahayana, the most common path I've seen mentioned is the five-fold path: the path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no more learning.<br><br>So there are major differences between the Theravada and the Mahayana, and I feel it can be quite important to decide which branch of Buddhism we are going to locate ourselves in<br><br>i'm more towards theravada(althought my buddha status is 'Mahayana') so wat about you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so is the topic about views on filial piety from different traditions or which tradition one started &amp; settled with? anyway whichever, i'll carry on with my post.<br><br>initially i don't know if i had theravada teachings as a foundation or vajrayana as a foundation. (it doesn't matter to me now) cos both were present for me at the same time &amp; thus lead me on to mahayana teachings &amp; settling down with vajrayana. all dharmas are one. i'm very touched by bodhisattva ksitigarbha's filial piety for his parents &amp; it's a good example for me to learn &amp; practice &amp; i also hope my kid will grow up &amp; understand the meaningful practice of honouring one's parents. of cos not forgetting to practice compassion with wisdom. it is not a demand from me that i think i want that way as a return, but its all for her good benefits &amp; well being that matters most.<br><br>i'd like to take this chance to say abit more.<br><br>when it comes to filial piety, naturally there's really no discrimination in different traditions of views &amp; practices. parents' kindness are difficult to repay. no matter how good or how strict they have been to us, it's their compassion for us that  they'd like us to be well &amp; happy. it is our misconception caught up in a moment of fury when we think that they are too strict, always scold us or sometimes give us a good lecturing &amp; we just couldn't be receptive. the kind of pain in their heart when they punish us cannot be easily understood, it is equally sharply painful. be it theravada, mahayana or vajrayana traditions, we ought to honour our parents through out. be it an arhat or bodhisattva cultivating in samsara for liberation, they can't make it here without the warmth of a mother's womb.<br><br>for a moment...., i'd also wish to share another thing. i have personally come across a mother who adopted a kid &amp; the most amazing &amp; touching thing is that she regards her adpoted kid like her own flesh &amp; blood child. it is truly selfless. i pay homage to her.<br><br>i'll not be too serious in this topic but i see the importance of filial piety that i have a piece of my views to share. please be patient with me as i will try my best to be as brief as i could.<br><br>as a parent, a mother myself, i learned to empathise &amp; feel with other parents. typically &amp; normally, mothers go through a lengthy period of pregnancy both pleasurable &amp; exhaustible, carrying the heavy weight in the body so huge that could even strain the waist &amp; back muscle, giving up own's beauty due to water retention, putting on weight, extremely exhausted &amp; sometimes with worrying thoughts of will she die in difficult child birth &amp; unable to live to bring up the child....., &amp; then going thru the labour with extreme pain that is hard to describe &amp; after that to recuperate &amp; tend day &amp; night to the new born without a good proper rest up till the child grows up, etc..., all these are natural feelings &amp; roles of a mum. &amp; also not forgetting fathers who are always there from the beginning for the support, care &amp; love for the children &amp; family. they are equally divine. even if they are sad troubled or happy or appear to be joyful or extremely tired, they always make good conditions for their children to be comfortable. after going through it myself, i truly understand how my mum &amp; dad felt &amp; went through. it's hard for me to repay them their kindness. whether one's parents are togther or separated, they ARE after all one's parents. eventually, to summarise, all parents give unconditional love, no matter how hard they been through, they will not take it to heart &amp; not ask for anything in return as long as their children are well &amp; happy that matters.<br><br>ok hope this is not boring, if it is, i'm very sorry about that as i hardly write long enough post so i may not be that articulate.<br>thanks for reading.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to me,  filial piety is part of the foundational teaching/hinayana/first floor. second floor is mahayana that go into detail theory.  vajrayana is final floor of experimentation and practical aspect. so vajrayana also need mahayana/theory as foundation.<br><br>hinayana looses the grip of xiang/form aspect.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">like in Diamond sutra : no 'Bodhisattva' who is a real Bodhisattva cherishes the form aspect of an ego-entity, the form aspect of a Buddha-entity, the form aspect of infinity sentient beings, or the form aspect of time-entity.</span><br><br>but for mahayana, they loose the grip of jian/concept aspect.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ie: no 'Bodhisattva' who is a real Bodhisattva cherishes the concept aspect of an ego-entity, the concept aspect of a Buddha-entity, the concept aspect of infinity sentient beings, or the concept aspect of time-entity.</span><br><br>----<br><br>btw: below is what i meant by "sunyata of self and dharma" in earlier post:<br><br><blockquote>egolessness (Tib. dag me) Also called selflessness. There are two kinds of egolessnessÂ—the egolessness of other, that is, the emptiness of external phenomena and the egolessness of self, that is, the emptiness of a personal self.<br><br>egolessness or selflessness of person (Skt. pudgalanairatmya) This doctrine asserts that when one examines or looks for the person, one finds that it is empty. The person does not possess a self (Skt. atman, Tib. bdag-nyid) as an independent or substantial self. This position is held by most Buddhist schools.<br><br>egolesseness or selflessness of phenomena (Skt. dharma-nairatmya) This doctrine aserts than not only is there selflessness of person, but when one examines out phenomena, one finds that this external phenomena is also empty, i. e. it does not have an independent or substantial nature. This position is not held by the hinayana schools, but is put forth by the mahayana schools, particularly the Chittamatra school. </blockquote><a href="http://www.rinpoche.com/glossary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rinpoche.com/glossary.htm</a><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

So, they returned to the Buddha to ask for another subject of meditation which would suit them better. On reflection, the Buddha found that those bhikkhus had, during the time of Kassapa Buddha, meditated on impermanence.
