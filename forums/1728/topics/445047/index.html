              <div class="rteindent1"><br></div>
              In this verse Milarepa sings about his realization of the true nature 
              of reality. To realize the true nature of reality, the necessary outer 
              condition is for the “three realms” to be “shining in freedom.” The 
              three realms refer to the universe and all of the sentient beings within
               it. Sentient beings inhabit the desire realm, the form realm, and the 
              formless realm, so these three realms include all the experiences that 
              one could possibly have, and they are shining in freedom—they are 
              self-liberated.*<br> <br> “Self-liberation” in one sense means that appearances of the three 
              realms do not require an outside liberator to come and set them free, 
              because freedom and purity are their very nature. This is because 
              appearances of the three realms are not real. They are like appearances 
              in dreams. They are the mere coming together of interdependent causes 
              and conditions; they have no essence of their own, no inherent nature. 
              This means that the appearances of the three realms are 
              appearance-emptiness inseparable, and therefore, the three realms are 
              free right where they are. Freedom is their basic reality. However, 
              whether our experience of life in the three realms is one of freedom or 
              bondage depends upon whether we realize their self-liberated true nature
               or not. It is like dreaming of being imprisoned: If you do not know you
               are dreaming, you will believe that your captivity is truly existent, 
              and you will long to be liberated from it. But if you know you are 
              dreaming, you will recognize that your captivity is a mere appearance, 
              and that there is really no captivity at all—the captivity is 
              self-liberated. Realizing that feels very good.<br> <br> The term “self-liberation” is also used in the Mahamudra and Dzogchen 
              teachings, which describe appearances as “self-arisen and 
              self-liberated.” This means that phenomena have no truly existent 
              causes. For example, with a car that appears in a dream, you cannot say 
              in which factory that car was made. Or with the person who appears in 
              the mirror when you stand in front of it, you cannot say where that 
              person was born. Since the dream car and the person in the mirror have 
              no real causes for arising, all we can say about them is that they are 
              self-arisen, and therefore they are also self-liberated.<br> <br> When we apply this to an experience of suffering, we find that since 
              our suffering has no real causes, it does not truly arise, like 
              suffering in a dream. So it is self-arisen, and therefore it is 
              self-liberated. Since the suffering is not really there in the first 
              place, it is pure and free all by itself. And apart from knowing 
              self-liberation is suffering’s essential nature and resting within that,
               we do not need to do anything to alleviate it.<br> <br> Thus, Milarepa sings that what one needs on the inside is to realize 
              self-arisen original wisdom. This wisdom is the basic nature of mind, 
              the basic nature of reality, and all outer appearances are this wisdom’s
               own energy and play. Original wisdom is self-arisen in the sense that 
              it is not something created; it does not come from causes and 
              conditions; it does not arise anew, because it has been present since 
              beginningless time as the basic nature of what we are. We just have to 
              realize it. The realization of original wisdom, however, transcends 
              there being anything to realize and anyone who realizes something, 
              because original wisdom transcends duality.<br> <br> How can we gain certainty about and cultivate our experience of this 
              wisdom? Since wisdom is the true nature of mind, begin by looking at 
              your mind. When you look at your mind, you do not see anything. You do 
              not see any shape or color, or anything that you could identify as a 
              “thing.” When you try to locate where your mind is, you cannot find it 
              inside your body, outside your body, nor anywhere in between. So mind is
               unidentifiable and unfindable. If you then rest in this unfindability, 
              you experience mind’s natural luminous clarity. That is the beginning of
               the experience of original wisdom. For Milarepa, original wisdom is 
              shining. It is manifesting brightly through his realization of the 
              nature of the three realms and of his own mind.<br> <br> In the third line, Milarepa sings of his confidence of realizing the 
              true nature of reality, the true meaning. There are the expressions and 
              words that we use to describe things, and the meaning that these words 
              refer to—here Milarepa is singing about the latter. He is certain about 
              the basic nature of reality, and as he sings in the fourth line, he has 
              no fear of it, no doubts about what it is. He is also not afraid of the 
              truth and reality of emptiness. When he sings: “that’s all I’ve got,” he
               is saying: “I am not somebody great. I do not have a high realization. 
              All I have got is this much.” This is Milarepa’s way of being humble.<br> <br> One can easily be frightened by teachings on emptiness. It is easy to 
              think: “Everything is empty, so I am all alone in an infinite vacuum of 
              empty space.” If you have that thought, it is a sign that you need to 
              meditate more on the selflessness of the individual. If you think of 
              yourself as something while everything else is nothing, it is easy to 
              get a feeling of being alone in empty space. However, if you 
              rememberthat all phenomena, including you yourself, are equally of the 
              nature of emptiness, beyond the concepts of “something” and “nothing,” 
              then you will not be lonely; you will be open, spacious, and relaxed.<br> <br> In the context of this verse, it is helpful to consider a stanza from the Song of Mahamudra by Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye:<br> <br>
              <div class="rteindent1"><strong>From mind itself, so difficult to describe,<br> Samsara and nirvana’s magical variety shines.<br> Knowing it is self-liberated is view supreme.</strong></div>
              <div class="rteindent1"><br></div>
              “Mind itself,” the true nature of mind, original wisdom, is difficult 
              to describe—it is inexpressible. And from this inexpressible true nature
               of mind come all the appearances of samsara and nirvana. Appearances do
               not exist separately from the mind. What appears has no nature of its 
              own. Appearances are merely mind’s own energy; mind’s own radiance; 
              mind’s own light. And so appearances are a magical display. To describe 
              the appearances of samsara and nirvana as a magical variety means that 
              they are not real—they are magic, like a magician’s illusions. 
              Appearances are the magical display of the energy of the inexpressible 
              true nature of mind. When we know this, we know that appearances are 
              self-arisen and self-liberated, and that is the supreme view we can 
              have.<br>

              * Most sentient beings, including animals and humans, inhabit the 
              desire realm, so named because desire for physical and mental pleasure 
              and happiness is the overriding mental experience of beings in this 
              realm. The form realm and the formless realm are populated by gods in 
              various meditative states who are very attached to 
              meditative experiences of clarity and the total absence of thoughts, 
              respectively.</div>

              <div><br></div>
              In this verse Milarepa sings about his realization of the true
              nature of reality. To realize the true nature of reality, the
              necessary outer condition is for the “three realms” to be “shining
              in freedom.” The three realms refer to the universe and all of the
              sentient beings within it. Sentient beings inhabit the desire
              realm, the form realm, and the formless realm, so these three
              realms include all the experiences that one could possibly have,
              and they are shining in freedom—they are self-liberated.*<br> <br> “Self-liberation” in one sense means that appearances of the three
              realms do not require an outside liberator to come and set them
              free, because freedom and purity are their very nature. This is
              because appearances of the three realms are not real. They are like
              appearances in dreams. They are the mere coming together of
              interdependent causes and conditions; they have no essence of their
              own, no inherent nature. This means that the appearances of the
              three realms are appearance-emptiness inseparable, and therefore,
              the three realms are free right where they are. Freedom is their
              basic reality. However, whether our experience of life in the three
              realms is one of freedom or bondage depends upon whether we realize
              their self-liberated true nature or not. It is like dreaming of
              being imprisoned: If you do not know you are dreaming, you will
              believe that your captivity is truly existent, and you will long to
              be liberated from it. But if you know you are dreaming, you will
              recognize that your captivity is a mere appearance, and that there
              is really no captivity at all—the captivity is self-liberated.
              Realizing that feels very good.<br> <br> The term “self-liberation” is also used in the Mahamudra and
              Dzogchen teachings, which describe appearances as “self-arisen and
              self-liberated.” This means that phenomena have no truly existent
              causes. For example, with a car that appears in a dream, you cannot
              say in which factory that car was made. Or with the person who
              appears in the mirror when you stand in front of it, you cannot say
              where that person was born. Since the dream car and the person in
              the mirror have no real causes for arising, all we can say about
              them is that they are self-arisen, and therefore they are also
              self-liberated.<br> <br> When we apply this to an experience of suffering, we find that
              since our suffering has no real causes, it does not truly arise,
              like suffering in a dream. So it is self-arisen, and therefore it
              is self-liberated. Since the suffering is not really there in the
              first place, it is pure and free all by itself. And apart from
              knowing self-liberation is suffering’s essential nature and resting
              within that, we do not need to do anything to alleviate it.<br> <br> Thus, Milarepa sings that what one needs on the inside is to
              realize self-arisen original wisdom. This wisdom is the basic
              nature of mind, the basic nature of reality, and all outer
              appearances are this wisdom’s own energy and play. Original wisdom
              is self-arisen in the sense that it is not something created; it
              does not come from causes and conditions; it does not arise anew,
              because it has been present since beginningless time as the basic
              nature of what we are. We just have to realize it. The realization
              of original wisdom, however, transcends there being anything to
              realize and anyone who realizes something, because original wisdom
              transcends duality.<br> <br> How can we gain certainty about and cultivate our experience of
              this wisdom? Since wisdom is the true nature of mind, begin by
              looking at your mind. When you look at your mind, you do not see
              anything. You do not see any shape or color, or anything that you
              could identify as a “thing.” When you try to locate where your mind
              is, you cannot find it inside your body, outside your body, nor
              anywhere in between. So mind is unidentifiable and unfindable. If
              you then rest in this unfindability, you experience mind’s natural
              luminous clarity. That is the beginning of the experience of
              original wisdom. For Milarepa, original wisdom is shining. It is
              manifesting brightly through his realization of the nature of the
              three realms and of his own mind.<br> <br> In the third line, Milarepa sings of his confidence of realizing
              the true nature of reality, the true meaning. There are the
              expressions and words that we use to describe things, and the
              meaning that these words refer to—here Milarepa is singing about
              the latter. He is certain about the basic nature of reality, and as
              he sings in the fourth line, he has no fear of it, no doubts about
              what it is. He is also not afraid of the truth and reality of
              emptiness. When he sings: “that’s all I’ve got,” he is saying: “I
              am not somebody great. I do not have a high realization. All I have
              got is this much.” This is Milarepa’s way of being humble.<br> <br> One can easily be frightened by teachings on emptiness. It is easy
              to think: “Everything is empty, so I am all alone in an infinite
              vacuum of empty space.” If you have that thought, it is a sign that
              you need to meditate more on the selflessness of the individual. If
              you think of yourself as something while everything else is
              nothing, it is easy to get a feeling of being alone in empty space.
              However, if you rememberthat all phenomena, including you yourself,
              are equally of the nature of emptiness, beyond the concepts of
              “something” and “nothing,” then you will not be lonely; you will be
              open, spacious, and relaxed.<br> <br> In the context of this verse, it is helpful to consider a stanza
              from the Song of Mahamudra by Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thaye:<br> <br>
              <div><strong>From mind itself, so difficult to
              describe,<br> Samsara and nirvana’s magical variety shines.<br> Knowing it is self-liberated is view supreme.</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              “Mind itself,” the true nature of mind, original wisdom, is
              difficult to describe—it is inexpressible. And from this
              inexpressible true nature of mind come all the appearances of
              samsara and nirvana. Appearances do not exist separately from the
              mind. What appears has no nature of its own. Appearances are merely
              mind’s own energy; mind’s own radiance; mind’s own light. And so
              appearances are a magical display. To describe the appearances of
              samsara and nirvana as a magical variety means that they are not
              real—they are magic, like a magician’s illusions. Appearances are
              the magical display of the energy of the inexpressible true nature
              of mind. When we know this, we know that appearances are
              self-arisen and self-liberated, and that is the supreme view we can
              have.<br> * Most sentient beings, including animals and humans, inhabit the
              desire realm, so named because desire for physical and mental
              pleasure and happiness is the overriding mental experience of
              beings in this realm. The form realm and the formless realm
              are populated by gods in various meditative states who are
              very attached to meditative experiences of clarity and the
              total absence of thoughts, respectively.</div>
