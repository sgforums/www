            <div class='col-md body'>There are many ways to practice Buddhism that often people find by themselves.As Buddha said we all have deferent ways of understanding and learning things. But we all have equal minds to think and find the best way to practice Buddhism for ourselves. But unfortunately Buddhism is one of the world complex philosophies. Because its complexity cause many to find Buddhism harder than any religion that they have experience before.<br><br>Every Buddhist who practice Buddhism must understand following concept before proceed further depth into philosophy:<br><br><span style="color: red;">i. Buddhism is a practical theory and it has almost no dogmas and theologies that cannot be proved.<br><br>ii. Buddhists are not second to Gods, Buddhas nor they never become servants of them. We are free to make our own decisions on what we want.<br><br>iii. Buddhists do not have any boundaries on what they do. But they have ethics to help them out along the way. We built ourselves not by rule but by ethics. (Entirely deferent from religions.)<br><br>iv. Buddhist logics play a large role in explaining and understanding higher levels of Buddhism.</span><br><br>Above four statements are the simplest forms that Buddhists understand of themselves<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following steps are the fundamental stages that Buddhist students should follow to understand Buddhism:<br><br><span style="color: red;">1. Reasonable believes: Do not believe anything before you analyze them with reasons by yourself and understand the concepts properly.<br><br>2. Understanding.<br><br>3. Doing and practically experiencing.<br><br>4. Proving concepts using evidence.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">1. Believing: </span>Once a person decides to become a Buddhist, she/he must have already acquired some knowledge of Buddhism and has developed a certain amount of belief and understand in the philosophy. He will now be able to thoroughly study, investigate, analyze and understand the principles of Buddhism to gain the benefits because the principles are so complex and voluminous. If you do not believe Buddhist teachings you could not even think about learning Buddhism nor understand concepts. Believe is very important and one must have certain amount of faith before even understand the concepts. Doubts that you may have on Buddhism must be reasonable and if not you should think about Buddhism anyway. The other thing is you have freedom to question and ague Buddhist concepts as long as you doing it the right way. We do not encourage enforcement to believe in Buddhism.<br><br><span style="color: red;">2. Understanding:</span> After one believes, he or she must understand the principles of Buddhism - Most important one is that we believe that this world is suffering due to desire. How can Buddhism remove sufferings? What are the answers to the universe and life? How can man achieve enlightenment? It is only after one has accurately and thoroughly understood the teachings of the Buddha that one can solidify his belief and confidence in Buddhism.<br><br><span style="color: red;">3. Doing and practically experiencing:</span> This is actually doing what one has learned and experienced. As I mention before everything in Buddhism is practical and you will be able to understand and relate concepts into your day-to-day life.<br><br><strong>Some people recognize the superior knowledge contained in the Buddhist principles, however they only recognize but do not accept or believe in the philosophy. (Ex. Drinking alcohol and been a Buddhist. This is very negative.) Others study Buddhism as an academic subject; they understand the principles but do not follow these principles. (Ex. Most of the western mediators and researchers.)</strong><br><br><strong><span class="large">To properly practise Buddhism, after understanding the principles, one must follow up with actual experience, to practise Buddhism according to what he has learned. One must maintain good conduct and behaviour, and purify the mind. All must be practical not just theoretical.This is the only way to change delusion to wisdom, and reap the full benefits of practising Buddhism.<br></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">4. Proving concepts using evidence:</span> The last but not least stage in practising Buddhism is proving.<br><br>Whenever one deals with a matter, one must have confidence, good understanding, and carry out the task with endurance and dedication. To realize the benefits of Buddhist teachings followers must use Dharma day-to-day life and it must be practical. This way you understand concepts properly and you can use these whenever it is necessary. We believe that a modeller who do things practically better than an adviser who cannot use the theories in practical way.<br><br>If one has great confidence, understand the Dharma well, and practise according to the Dharma with endurance and endeavour, one will remove sufferings, find true happiness and peace of mind, and eventually attain enlightenment. This will be the proof of what one has learned from the Dharma to be true.<br><br>Buddhists should use our teaching wherever they live, whet ever the society they associated with and under any kind of circumstance. For example, if you practice how to be patience from Buddhist perspectives, you should know how to apply the concept where it is needed; such as family, personal problems, problems in your office, school, etc, etc.<br><br>At the same time, Buddhism can bring peace to a society; purify people's minds, giving people hope and confidence for the future. It has incomparable power to stimulate and excite life. It helps people to live more reasonable and high quality lives with proper understand on the nature of human life.<br><br>In general terms, religion has a comforting effect for the pessimists; it has a cautioning effect for the criminals, and an encouraging effect for the kind people. The advantages of practising Buddhism are very real and practical.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The important concepts that one should be familiar with are the investigative mind (right beliefs), understand, practice and proofs. In addition to that there are two other major areas. One is Four Noble Truths and the other is Eight-Fold Path.But the most important teaching that influence all Buddhists is known as the Five Precepts<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">-Five Precepts<br><br>-Four Noble Truths<br><br>-Eight-Fold Path</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">Taking Refuge In The Three Jewels</span></span><br><br>Everything is impermanent and our efforts to find security are in vain. We need a reliable refuge: something to hold onto. The Three Jewels can be that refuge. They are a practice, not a belief. If we have practised taking refuge in the island of self, the three jewels are in every cell of our body.<br><br><strong>Taking Refuge in the Buddha</strong><br><br>The true Buddha is not a person, a God, or words or images or concepts. It is made of our mindfulness, wisdom and compassion. Taking refuge in the Buddha within is taking refuge in mindfulness.<br><br><img src="http://www.kmspks.org/kmspks/templetour/images/photos/newhall.jpg"><br><br><strong>Taking refuge in the Dharma</strong><br><br>The dharma is not anything other than the Truth.  You can touch this yourself without needing to go through the person Buddha.<br><br>We can look deeply into our suffering without drowning.  The best time is when conditions are good.  It is better not to leave it until we are in difficulty before we look at suffering.<br><br>When we are faced with a tragedy the more we can let go the better.  We need to let go of ideas.  We can guard our body and mind by going back to our breathing. Going back to our breathing can help us to let go of worries and anxieties.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/lifestyl/book.gif"><br><br><strong>Taking Refuge in the Sangha</strong><br><br>Buddhist practice is not an absolute, but something created in the relative world for our temporary support and guidance. In the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha speaks of the magic city parable.  Merchants are journeying across the desert and are tired and exhausted.  The guide knows that it is fatal to turn back, so he says that they must go on.  He describes a magic city with fruit and relaxing baths.  This is the help they need to go on.<br><br>Our sangha can be our magic city - a safe place because the mindfulness trainings are practised. Sometimes we attempt other kinds of security.  We gather material possessions and try to accumulate wealth to gain security.  This is a difficult kind of security. When we have the security of our practice, we are not caught in the process of running after something we do not have.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/lifestyl/sangha.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">To study Buddhism, is it necessary to take refuge? What is the importance of taking refuge? </span><br><br>The Buddha never claimed any divinity. People take refuge in the Buddha as a teacher or master who has shown the real path of emancipation. It is perhaps the only religion which states that a human being has the power to help and free himself.<br><br>On the other hand, Buddhism is an education. Taking refuge is just like registration and admission in school. With the guidance by the teachers and the support from the classmates, studying in school is generally better than self-studying. All persons who have resolved in studying Buddhism and cultivating the Way should take refuge. Buddhists who take refuge in the Buddha are not seeking for protection nor reward for them, but to gain inspiration and right understanding for their own purification and cultivation of the Way.<br><br>Taking refuge is voluntary and sincere, self-conscious and self-discipline. It is a vow to oneself, taking refuge with:<br><br><strong>Buddha</strong> --- to understand the Great Way profoundly and to bring forth the Bodhi mind<br><br><strong>Dharma</strong> --- to enter deeply the sutra treasury and have wisdom like the sea<br><br><strong>Sangha </strong>--- to form together a great assembly and to be one and all in harmony<br><br>The Three are also known as Three Jewels or Three Treasures<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">The Precepts</span><br><br>The precepts are a condensed form of Buddhist ethical practice. They are often compared with the ten commandments of Christianity, however, the precepts are different in two respects: First, they are to be taken as recommendations, not commandments. This means the individual is encouraged to use his/her own intelligence to apply these rules in the best possible way. Second, it is the spirit of the precepts -not the text- that counts, hence, the guidelines for ethical conduct must be seen in the larger context of the Eightfold Path.<br><br>The first five precepts are mandatory for every Buddhist, although the fifth precept is often not observed, because it bans the consumption of alcohol. Precepts no. six to ten are laid out for those in preparation for monastic life and for devoted lay people unattached to families. The eight precepts put together number eight and nine and omit the tenth. Lay people may observe the eight precepts on Buddhist festival days.<br><br>I undertake to observe the precept<br><br><strong>Do not Kill </strong><br><br>One must not deliberately kill any living creatures, either by committing the act oneself, instructing others to kill, or approving of or participating in act of killing. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is a respect to others' lives. </span><br><br>One should not deprive others (animals not excluded) of the right to live. If one is hurt or killed, one's family, relatives, friends will suffer.<br><br>In observing the first precept, one tries to protect life whenever possible. Furthermore, one cultivates the attitude of loving kindness to all beings by wishing that they may be happy and free from harm.<br><br><strong>Do not Steal </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is a respect to other's properties and the right to own property</span>. If something is not given, one may not take it away by stealing, by force or by fraud. Besides these, one should avoid misusing money or property belonging to the public or other persons. In a broader sense, the second precept also means that one should not evade oneÂ’s responsibilities. If an employee is lazy and neglects the duties or tasks assigned to him, he is, in a way, "stealing" time that should have been spent on his work.<br><br>In its broadest sense, observing the second precept also means that one cultivates the virtue of generosity. A Buddhist gives to the poor and sick because of their need. He makes offerings to the monks, nuns and masters because he respects the qualities they possess. He is generous in his gifts to his parents, teachers and friends because of the advice, guidance and kindness they have shown him.<br><br>Besides giving material things to the needy and the worthy, Buddhists should also offer sympathy and encouragement to those who are hurt or discouraged. It is said, however, that the best of all gifts is the gift of the Dharma in the form of teaching it or in the production and distribution of Buddhist books.<br><br><strong>Do not Indulge in Sexual Misconduct </strong><br><br>Though the moral standards are different in different countries and in different times, rape, adultery and other abnormal sexual behaviour that involve physical and mental injury to others should be prohibited. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is also a matter of respect for people and personal relationships. </span><br><br><strong> Do not Lie </strong><br><br>To refrain from telling lies is to show respect for the truth. No good can come from telling lies, be it out of fun or malice. When a Buddhist observes the fourth precept, he refrains from telling lies or half-truths that exaggerate or understate, and instead cultivates the virtue of truthfulness. Once people uphold the respect for truth, there will be fewer quarrels and misunderstandings and fewer cases of false accusations in the courts of justice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Society will then become more peaceful and orderly</span><br><br><strong>Do not Take Intoxicant </strong><br><br>Buddhism emphasises wisdom. Taking intoxicant will descend and lose the seed of wisdom. Intoxicants, such as drugs, liquor, smoking, etc., are harmful to health. It seems that taking intoxicant is not hurting others. However, if we are drunk and lose our consciousness, we may easily commit evil deeds and hurt others. Therefore, one who breaks this precept will tend to break all other precepts along with it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fifth precept is based on respect for mental health. </span>It guard against the loss of control of oneÂ’s mind. It is particularly important to those who meditate because, by refraining from taking intoxicants, they can more easily cultivate awareness, attention and clarity of mind. Thus the observance of the fifth precept not only contributes to happiness in the family and peace in society, it also prepares a person for the practice of Mental Development<br></div>
