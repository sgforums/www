              <p>There's another good one not mentioned in the talk above... from sgclubs:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hi
              quietfight, just to share a very humourous and yet insightful story
              told by Ajahn Brahm that is quite related to the above that i read in a
              book of his. It was about his experience when a lay disciple came to
              his master Ajahn Chah for a reading of his future as meditating monks
              are often regarded as excellent fortune tellers. <br> <br> So one day, this lay disciple came to the great master Ajahn Chah and
              asked for a prediction of his future. Of course, Ajahn Chah refused
              like all good monks do. But the disciple was very determined and
              reminded the master how much donations and offerings he had made to the
              monastery. Even reminding the master about the numerous occasions when
              he sacrificed his own personal time to chauffeur the master, to the
              extent that he neglect his family and work. Seeing how determined that
              man was, Ajahn Chah made an exception to this no fortune telling rule. <br> <br> He asked for the disciple to show him his palm and the disciple was
              excited since this was never done before by the great master and the
              master was thought to be a saint with great psychic powers. Whatever
              the master predict would surely come through. So Ajahn Chah traced the
              palm with his index finger and said words like, "Interesting, Hmm,
              Well, well and Ooh.." <br> <br> And when he's finished, he put down the palm and said to the disciple
              that he will reveal his future to him and that he is never wrong. The
              disciple nodded and said yes eagerly, absolutely thrilled that his
              future will be revealed to him soon. <br> <br> Ajahn Chah said, "Your future will be uncertain." And he was absolutely correct! <br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Biggrin" src="http://www.sgclub.com/images/smilies/largesmiles/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> In that we can all learn a good lesson that the future truly lies in
              the actions of the present as the present is the child of our past and
              the parent of our future. So, there's no need to dwell on if you are
              able to meditate to the level you can see the future or not for the
              future is uncertain. What's important is to live here and now for that
              is what we truly have. <br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://www.sgclub.com/images/smilies/largesmiles/qmarksmile.gif" border="0" alt=""></span></em></p>
