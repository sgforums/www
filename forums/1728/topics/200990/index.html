            <div class='col-md body'>The origin of the Jade Emperor<br><br>It was said that the Jade Emperor was originally the crown prince of the kingdom of Pure Felicity and Majestic Heavenly Lights and Ornaments. At birth he emitted a wondrous light that filled the entire kingdom. When he was young, he was kind, intelligent and wise. He devoted his entire childhood to helping the needy (the poor and suffering, the deserted and single, the hungry and disabled). Furthermore, he showed respect and benevolence to both men and creatures. After his father died, he ascended the throne. He made sure that everyone in his kingdom found peace and contentment, after that he told his ministers that he wished to cultivate Dao on the Bright and Fragant Cliff. After 1,750 trials, each trial lasting for 120,976 years, he attained Golden Immortality. After another a hundred million years of cultivation, he finally became the Jade Emperor.(In total, using the given figures, this period before his becoming the Jade Emperor lasted for about 311,708,000 years.)<br>[edit]<br><br>The Jade Emperor vanquishing evil<br><br>There is a little known myth which tells of how the Jade Emperor became the monarch of all the deities in heaven. It is one of the few myths in which the Jade Emperor really shows his might. In the beginning of time, the earth was a very hard and difficult place to live. Men were having tremendous difficulty coping with existence; not only did men have to deal with harsh conditions, but also with all kinds of monstrous beings. At this time, there were also not many gods or deities to protect men. Furthermore, a lot of powerful, evil demons were defying the immortals of heaven. The Jade Emperor was still an ordinary immortal who roamed earth to help as many people as he could. However, he felt sad because his powers were limited and could only ease the sufferings of men. He decided to retreat in a mountain cave and cultivate his Dao. He passed 3,200 trials, each trial lasted for about 3 million years. Unfortunately, a powerful, evil entity which dwelt on earth had the ambition to conquer the immortals and gods in heaven and proclaim sovereignty over the entire universe. He went into retreat later than the Jade Emperor. This evil entity retreated himself too and went into meditation to expand his power. He passed through 3,000 trials each trial lasting for about 3 million years too. After he passed his final trial, he felt confident that no one could defeat him anymore. He re-entered the world again, and recruited an army of demons with the purpose of attacking heaven. The immortals being aware of the threat gathered themselves and prepared for war. The gods were unable to stop the powerful demon and all were defeated by him. The Three Pure Ones were leading the celestial beings at that time. Fortunately, the Jade Emperor finished his cultivation in the midst of this war. He was changing the land to make it more liveable for men and repelling all kinds of monstrous beasts. Suddenly, he saw an evil glow emitting from heaven and knew something was amiss. He ascended and saw that a war was going on, he saw that the demon was too powerful to be stopped by any of the gods present. He went up and challenged the demon, and a battle ensued between them. Mountains shook and rivers and seas toppled; however, the Jade Emperor stood victorious due to his deeper and wiser cultivation, not for might but for benevolence. After totally annihilating the demon, all the other demons were scattered by the gods and immortals. Because of his noble and benevolent deeds, the gods, immortals and mankind proclaimed the Jade Emperor the supreme sovereign of all.<br>[edit]<br><br>Creation myth<br><br>According to one creation myth, the Jade Emperor fashioned the first humans from clay, but as he left them to harden in the sun, it rained, misshaping some of the figures, thus explaining the origin of sickness and physical abnormalities. (The most common alternative Chinese creation myth states that human beings were once fleas on the body of Pangu.) The story above is also told as NÃ¼wa who fashions humans out of the mud from the Yellow River by hand. Those she made herself became the richer people of the earth. After getting lazy she used a rope and swung it around. The drops that fell from the rope became the poorer humans.<br><br>His predecessor and successor<br><br>The Jade Emperor was originally the assistant of the Divine Master of the Heavenly Origin, Yuan-shi tian-zun. Yuan-shi tian-zun is said to be the supreme beginning, the limitless and eternal creator of Heaven and Earth, whom picked Yu-huang, or the Jade Emperor, as his personal successor. The Jade Emperor will eventually be succeeded by the Heavenly Master of the Dawn of Jade of the Golden Door. The characters for both are stamped on the front of the arms of his throne.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Dharma Realm of Gods </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Explained by the Venerable Master Hua in 1972 at Gold Mountain Monastery, San Francisco, USA </span><br><br><strong>Beings of the Six Desire and the Brahma heavens,<br>Practice the five precepts and the ten good deeds<br>Planting seeds with outflows,<br>They cannot terminate their transmigration. </strong><br><br>Commentary:<br>Beings of the Six Desire and the Brahma heavens. First of all, there are the Six Desire Heavens, which are the Heavens of the Desire Realm. There are heavens in the Desire Realm, the Form Realm, and the Formless Realm-in all of the Three Realms.<br><br>Our world is located under the first of the six heavens of the Desire Realm-the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings. This heaven, which is directly above us, is governed by the four Heavenly Kings. It is located halfway up Mount Sumeru, which means that half of Mount Sumeru is within the human realm, while the other half is above the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings. The parts of this heaven located on the north, south, east, and west sides of Mount Sumeru are governed by the four Heavenly Kings, as are the four continents of our world: Purvavideha to the east, Jambudvipa to the south, Aparagodaniya to the west, and Uttarakuru to the north. If we were to go into detail, we would never finish our discussion of this heaven.<br><br>The beings in the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings have a life span of 500 years, but that's not the same as 500 years in our world. One day and night in that heaven is equal to 50 years on earth. Figure it out: How many years on earth is 500 years in the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings? The beings in that heaven live for 500 years. One of their days is 50 human years. How many human years is 365 of their days? If you know math, you can figure it out.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The second heaven in the Desire Realm is the Trayastrimsha Heaven. Trayastrimsha is a Sanskrit word. You don't know what that means? Then let's call it the "Don't Know Heaven." The Don't Know Heaven is just the Trayastrimsha, a Sanskrit word that means "thirty-three." Shakra, known as yin tuo la ye (Indra) in the Shurangama Mantra, resides in the center of these heavens. He is the "God" revered in Christianity, and in China he is known as the Jade Emperor. The Book of History (Shu-jing) refers to him as the Supreme Lord and says, "Bathe and observe purity in order to worship the Supreme Lord." </span><br>In ancient China no one knew about the Buddha; they knew only about the Supreme Lord. In the Shang Dynasty, Emperor Tang used a black bull as an offering to the Supreme Lord and said, "I, LÃ¼, but a small child, presume to use this black bull in venturing to make known to the Supremely Exalted Ruling Lord that if I have offenses, they are not the people's, and if the people have offenses, the offenses rest with me."<br><br>Emperor Tang's name was LÃ¼, and he referred to himself as a small child out of respect for the Supreme Lord. He very sincerely offered a black bull and told the Supreme Lord that if he made errors, the citizens should not be blamed, and that if the common folk of his country committed offenses, the responsibility should rest with the Emperor for not having taught them correctly.<br><br>The ancients blamed themselves in that way, unlike people of today who clearly know that they are in the wrong but say, "Don't look at me! It's his fault! How can you blame me?" and complain, "God is unjust. Why does he confer wealth on others and make me so poor? Why does he bestow honor on some and leave me so wretched?" They blame heaven and curse mankind, looking for faults in others instead of admitting their own wrongs. The ancients acknowledged their own mistakes.<br><br>In the Trayastrimsha Heaven, Shakra resides in the middle, with eight heavens surrounding him to the north, south, east, and west, making thirty-three in all.<br><br>The third of the Desire Heavens is the Yama [Suyama] Heaven. Yama is a Sanskrit word which means "time period." In this heaven, the gods are so happy that they sing songs about their bliss day and night. They sing, "How happy I am! I'm so happy!" They are joyful throughout the six periods of the day and night. Hence, the name of this heaven is translated as "time period." Every time period is filled with happiness.<br><br>The fourth of the Desire Heavens is the Tushita (Tushiita) Heaven, which translates as "happiness and contentment." The beings there are always happy and satisfied. Those who know contentment are always happy. That heaven is also called the "Heaven of Contentment," because the beings there never have a worry or care from morning to night. They don't have any afflictions or worries.<br><br>The fifth of the Desire Heavens is the Heaven of the Transformation of Bliss (Nirmanarati). The beings in this heaven can derive happiness from transformations. In the previous heaven of "happiness and contentment," the beings are happy and content regardless of whether there are transformations; they are content even in unhappy situations. In this heaven, the beings bring about happiness through transformations.<br><br>The sixth of the Desire Heavens is the Heaven of the Transformation of Others' Bliss (Paranirmita-vashavartin). The beings of this heaven haven't any bliss of their own, but they can take it from beings in other heavens for their own enjoyment. Many demons live in this heaven along with their retinues. Why do they take the happiness of beings in other heavens? Because they are unreasonable. Common thieves in the world of men are generally gods fallen from the Heaven of the Transformation of Others' Bliss. Having fallen, they still have the habit of stealing money from others.<br><br>The Brahma Heavens include the Great Brahma (Mahabrahma) Heaven, the Multitudes of Brahma (Brahmakayika) Heaven, and the Ministers of Brahma (Brahmapurohita) Heaven. Beings of the Six Desire Heavens and the Brahma Heavens practice the five precepts and the ten good deeds. Because these beings cultivated the five precepts and the ten good deeds, they obtain the blessings and rewards of the heavens. However, the cultivation of the five precepts and the ten good deeds plants good roots that have outflows, so the verse says: Planting seeds with outflows. It has nothing to do with anyone else at all. [Note: This last line is actually from the verse for the Dharma Realm of People.] You yourself are responsible.<br><br>It's not easy to explain the Dharma in the Sutras. When I speak, I don't prepare ahead of time. "The Master said it wrong," some of you are thinking, but you don't dare to say it aloud. However, once you say it in your mind, strangely enough, I receive your telegram. So I'll correct the last line: They cannot terminate their transmigration. Am I right this time? Did you say in your mind that I said it wrong? [Disciple: "Yes."] Ha! It wasn't just one person who thought that way. The rest of you should also admit it if you were having such thoughts. [Another disciple: "Yes, I was."] You have to be honest. If you aren't honest, you will never attain the Way. [Other disciples also admit that they were thinking that way.]<br><br></div>

However, Taoists rejects this parallel. Taoists say that the Jade Emperor and all Daluo Golden Immortals are outside of the wheel of birth and death, therefore it's impossible for them to be in the Realm of Desire and to wage war against asuras. Will the Venerable Master please tell us the truth?</strong><br><br>A: This issue is an unsettled lawsuit. An idiom goes, "An honorable judge can't settle family affairs." Well, this Dharma Master can't settle such religious affairs. Each religion claims that it is the best as it espouses its own principles. Actually, they're trying to scratch an itch on their foot through their boots. They're like the blind men who were feeling the elephant to figure out what it looked like. Do they know how tall, how big, and what color is the Jade Emperor? Do I know? Do you know? I believe there is no proof to any of this.<br><br><strong>Q: Why do people pay homage not to the Monk from Tang, Great Master Xuanzhuang, but rather to Sun Wukung (the monkey in Journey to the West)? Also, is there really a Sun Wukung?</strong><br><br>A: Since Sun Wukung had the golden rod; knew how to perform somersaults, ascend to the heavens and enter the earth; and was skilled in everything, everyone adored him. Sun Wukung, Ju Bajie, Sha Seng, and so forth, actually existed, but they were invisible spirits. They aided and protected the Monk from Tang on his trip to India to obtain the sutras. They were not visible to the eyes of ordinary people. They didn't possess physical bodies like ordinary people; they were spirits. But Great Master Xuanzhuang was an honest, down-to-earth cultivator. He didn't know how to do flying somersaults, or cause a big uproar in the celestial palaces. He only knew how to hide his talent and truly cultivate the Way. Relying on the three qualities of determination, sincerity, and constancy, he single-mindedly went to obtain the sutras, and dedicated himself to benefiting living beings. As a result, Sun Wukung and the others were moved to guard and support him.<br><br></div>

It is just that Buddhism has spread to the Chinese for a long time, and the common folk not knowing what is the Dhamma, tend to pay respect to both religions. The usual Chinese has this mindset that the more one prays, the more blessings one get.<br><br>In Buddhism context, the Jade Emperor is by this sanskrit name Sakra-devanam-Lndra. However, no sutra mentioned his fight with Sun Wu Kong (ie. its a myth). He is one of the dharma protector. This is as far as my understanding. Hope it helps. &lt;---In regards to this, buddhists simply view the equivalent between Jade Emperor and Sakra, both supposed to be the King of Heavens in their respective religions. So Jade Emperor may not necessarily is Sakra as per se. But this is not important to our practice anyway.<br><br>In buddhist point view, the King of Heaven is not the most supreme. As they are at most the top of the desire world, where in Buddhism we recognised there are higher worlds like form and formless.<br><br>Buddha taught that even if one were to be reborned as a god, he'll eventually die and go through the cycle of birth and death. In Buddhism, the most supreme should be Lord Buddha Himself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yamizi posted right to the point. I think there is still a lot of confusion between 'folks practise' and 'Buddhism' in Singapore, although these two are completely different. Furthermore fictionous stories like Journey to the West gives people a completely distorted idea about Buddhism by mixing Buddhist characters with folklore.<br><br>Jade Emperor or Lord Sakra is one of protectors of Buddhadharma, he has taken refuge in the Triple Gems - Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Therefore "Jade Emperor" does have a place in Buddhism, that is, we do respect him. But we do not worship him as the folks practitioners does.<br><br>In Buddhism Lord Sakra is not worshipped, just as we do not worship any other gods or deities. In fact we also do not worship Buddhas or other enlightened beings, I think 'veneration', 'respect', 'homage', 'reverence' is the correct terms, and Buddha is seen as the supreme teacher of all beings.<br><br>In Buddhism, only one who is completely liberated and has become enlightened is considered a supreme source of refuge, worthy of offerings, therefore any beings still in samsara, even the devas, look upon the enlightened ones as teachers. Buddhists do not aim to be reborn in heaven as their ultimate goal, but supreme enlightenment.</div>

At birth he emitted a wondrous light that filled the entire kingdom. When he was young, he was kind, intelligent and wise. He devoted his entire childhood to helping the needy (the poor and suffering, the deserted and single, the hungry and disabled). Furthermore, he showed respect and benevolence to both men and creatures. After his father died, he ascended the throne. He made sure that everyone in his kingdom found peace and contentment, after that he told his ministers that he wished to cultivate Dao on the Bright and Fragant Cliff. After 1,750 trials, each trial lasting for 120,976 years, he attained Golden Immortality. <span style="color: red;">After another a hundred million years of cultivation, he finally became the Jade Emperor.(In total, using the given figures, this period before his becoming the Jade Emperor lasted for about 311,708,000 years.)<br></span></strong></blockquote>i dun understand.. so was he a human in the very beginning? even dinosaurs existed 65 million yrs ago.. how he cultivated for 311,708,000 years??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Thanks for clarifying your point, anyway whether Lord Sakra is the same as Jade Emperor, it is very clear that the understanding of Jade Emperor and Buddhist understanding of Lord Sakra is very different, therefore there is no reason for Buddhist to worship Jade Emperor in the Taoist way. Furthermore celestial beings not a worthy subject of refuge.</div>
