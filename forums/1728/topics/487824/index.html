              China during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), on 26 August 1840. This was the time
              of the first Opium War, when Hong Kong was ceded to the British Government. His
              father was from the privileged Xiao (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">è•­</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>)
              family, who were descendants of the Buddhist emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–49).
              The Master was born in his caul, or skin bag (amniotic sac), and while the next
              day a barefoot doctor came and cut him out, his mother died as a result of the
              birth. Xu Yun received a Daoist education but had a strong urge to follow
              Buddhism, and so at the age of 17 ran away from home to become a monk. He was
              soon caught, however, and taken home, where his family forced him to remain. He
              was also obliged to marry two teenage girls in order to continue the family
              line. The Master had a platonic relationship with the girls, and taught them
              the Buddha-Dharma. They were later ordained as nuns, along with his stepmother,
              who had raised him.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              away again and soon became a novice monk at Bubbling Spring Chan Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">æ¹§æ³‰ç¦…å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>) on Drum Mountain (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">é¼“å±±</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>) in Fujian. The next year he was fully
              ordained, and was given the Dharma names De Qing (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">å¾·æ¸…</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>; Virtuous Clarity), Gu Yan (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">å�¤å·–</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>; Ancient Rock), and Yan Che (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">æ¼”å¾¹</span><span style="font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">; Develop Thoroughly)</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>. Afterwards, he lived
              and practiced alone in a cave near the monastery, hiding out as he did not want
              his father’s scouts to find him again. When his father died three years later
              he returned to the monastery, where he lived for the next three years. Feeling
              that monastery life was not helping his practice to develop, however, he left
              to wander around freely and openly, living a hippy-style life as a
              poetry-writing, enlightened young sage, eating wild herbs and drinking spring
              water. Then, one day, he came across a Buddhist teacher in a thatched temple on
              Tiantai Mountain. This is where he first learned about Chan meditation, and his
              spiritual practice quickly and significantly improved.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              Empty Cloud decided to go on a “three steps, one bow” style of pilgrimage,
              partly to repay the debt to his parents. He started off from the island Putuo
              Shan near the city of Ningbo and went all the way to the mountain Wutai Shan,
              near the city of Datong in northern China. Reciting the name of the bodhisattva
              Manjushri with each prostration as he went, it took him three long years. After
              that, he walked across China and into Tibet, where he wept at the sight of
              monks eating meat. He then went on pilgrimage to India and Burma, before
              returning to China in 1890.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              retreat at High Heaven Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">é«˜æ—»å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>)
              near Yangzhou on the Yangzi River. One evening during the eighth week, a tea
              server missed the teacup the Master was holding out and spilled hot tea on his
              hand. He dropped the cup, and as it broke, the sound caused him to have a deep
              spiritual experience, or awakening, after which he wrote an “enlightenment
              poem”:</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              Beijing with the imperial family, some of whom he had previously met in the
              monasteries where he had taught. Along the way, they witnessed the dire poverty
              and food shortages that were affecting the country, and soon after reaching
              Reclining Dragon Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">å�§é¾�å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>)
              in Xi’an, he assisted in Buddhist ceremonies to pray for snow and rain to end
              the terrible drought and famine. Feeling that there was too much activity at
              the monastery, however, he left one night in secret and climbed the nearby
              Zhongnan Mountains, which are inhabited by both Daoist and Buddhist hermits to
              this day. High up in the clouds he found a secluded spot, where he built a hut
              from stone and thatch and called it the “Lion Hut.” There he grew potatoes,
              chanted the <em>Diamond Sutra,</em> and meditated. It was at that time that he
              changed his name to Empty Cloud so that nobody would know he was there. He did
              not want to be disturbed by people coming to see him. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>One day, a couple of years later, while still in the
              mountain hermitage, he put some potatoes on to boil and sat down in meditation
              to wait for them to cook. When some other hermits who lived nearby came to wish
              him a Happy New Year and to find out why they had not seen him around, they saw
              tiger’s paw prints in the snow outside his hut. Finding him deeply absorbed in
              meditation, they roused him. “The potatoes should be cooked by now, so please
              eat,” he offered, unaware that any significant length of time had passed. In
              fact he had been sitting there in deep samadhi for ten days, and the potatoes
              were covered with over an inch of mold! The hermits laughed, and then melted
              some ice to cook some more. A lot of people came to see Xu Yun after that, so
              one night he took off and left again, with just a few provisions slung on his
              back.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>In 1906, Xu Yun returned to Beijing, where the Guangxu
              emperor (r. 1871–1908) issued a decree instructing that he was to be overall
              abbot of the monasteries on Chicken Foot Mountain (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">é›žè¶³å±±</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>) in Yunnan Province, in China’s southwest.
              He was given the title “Grand Master Buddha’s Compassion and Vast Dharma,” (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">ä½›æ‚²æ´ªæ³•å¤§å¸ˆ</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>) and also a copy of the entire Buddhist
              canon and a purple <em>kashaya</em> (robe), together with a sedan chair. He thus
              returned to Chicken Foot Mountain, which he had visited on his return from
              India, at which time he had vowed to re-establish Buddhism there. He soon began
              to raise funds in neighboring countries to restore the monasteries on the
              mountain to their former glory and to build a hall to house the canon. This
              included going to Thailand, where, at one point, he sat in samadhi for over a
              week, when no one dared to disturb him. Partly because of this, the king became
              his personal student. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              Fujian Province, where he had been ordained, and in 1930 officiated as abbot
              there. While there he restored Bubbling Spring Chan Monastery. In 1934, he
              moved to the large monastery of the Sixth Chan Patriarch in Guangdong Province,
              known as Southern Flower Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">å�—èŠ±å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>),
              and restored that one as well, and completely rebuilt the nearby Cloud Gate
              Chan Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">é›²é–€ç¦…å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>). The money came in
              part from Hong Kong, which he visited a couple of times specifically in order
              to raise funds. However, in the spring of 1951, when Xu Yun was around 112,
              thugs looking for gold and money attacked Cloud Gate monastery, breaking the
              Master’s nose and ribs and torturing and beating him almost to death. When the
              government in Beijing found out, they sent officials to the monastery to
              investigate. There, they found the Master and around 100 monks held in
              captivity. It was at this time that the Master began dictating his life
              story—he had been so close to death that the monks had asked him to tell it,
              fearing that it would be lost forever.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              Buddhist Association of China, which was set up by various Buddhist groups to
              try and protect Buddhism under the communist regime. He later undertook the
              rebuilding of True Suchness Chan Monastery (</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">çœŸå¦‚ç¦…å¯º</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>), near the city of Nanchang in Jiangxi
              Province, which had been destroyed during the Japanese occupation. This was the
              last Buddhist monastery built before the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). Money
              poured in from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Canada, and it was therefore completed
              very quickly. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              his simple plank bed, the Master had been alive for 119 years and a monk for
              roughly 100. His last home was a converted thatched adobe cowshed that he
              liked. Xu Yun was the Dharma heir to all five Chan schools in China. During his
              life, he led many Chan meditation retreats at which people experienced
              awakening; he taught Pure Land Buddhism and lectured on the sutras; and he
              restored six great Chan monasteries and many smaller temples. He injected new
              life into the Chan school, which had been in real danger of being lost in
              China. His example inspired the present generation of Chinese Buddhists, who
              came to know him through his direct students. Some of them taught Chan
              internationally, as was his wish, and some remained in China throughout the
              Cultural Revolution.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              There are now shrines with statues of him across China as well as regular Chan
              retreats in his style held in large Chan training monasteries. Last year saw an
              exhibition of photos in Shanghai attended by his personal attendant, Master
              Shao Yun. There have been TV documentaries about him, and recently, a film was
              made of his entire life story.
