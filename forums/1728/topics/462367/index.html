              <p>why? Affinity lor.</p>
              <p>there are many stories regarding these.</p>
              <p>last time when Buddha and his disciples went to collect alms. and there's this old lady(?), no matter how, don't like to give to Buddha. later Buddha asked Ananda or was it Mahakasyapa, to go and when the lady saw Ananda, the lady was delighted to gave to him. this was because in the past,  Ananda helped buried her (an animal body then) while Buddha just walk passed.</p>
              <p> ------------</p>
              <p> Once, Shakyamuni Buddha went to a certain country to collect<br>alms, accompanied by all of his disciples except Mahamaudgalyayana<br>only to find that no one there would give them offerings.<br>Neither the king, nor his government officials, nor the citizens<br>made offerings to the Buddha or his disciples. Later, however,<br>when Mahamaudgalyayana arrived in that country, there was a<br>complete change of heart. The king, the officials, and all the<br>citizens very respectfully gathered around to welcome Mahamaudgalyayana<br>and to bow to him. They beseeched him to let them know<br>what he needed so they could make offerings to him. The Buddha’s<br>disciples did not understand why the Buddha, one of such great<br>virtue, received no offerings from the people of this country, while<br>when the Buddha’s disciple arrived, the whole town turned out to<br>greet him and everyone made offerings to him. “What’s the<br>meaning of this?” the disciples asked the Buddha.</p>
              <p> The Buddha told his disciples: “The great officials and the<br>citizens made no offerings to me because in a past life I failed to set<br>up conditions with them and consequently we have no affinity with<br>one another. Once long, long ago, ages prior to this one, Mahamaudgalyayana<br>was a firewood gatherer. One day while picking up<br>firewood he bumped against a nest of bees, and they swarmed out<br>to attack him. Mahamaudgalyayana simply recited the Buddha’s<br>name and made a vow saying, ‘Namo Buddha. You bees, don’t<br>sting me! In the future when I have realized the Way, you will be<br>the first ones I take across to Buddhahood. Renounce your evil<br>thoughts and stop harming people.’ As a result of this vow, the bees<br>did not sting him. Eventually the queen bee became the king of this<br>country and the drones and workers became the officials and<br>citizens. When Mahamaudgalyayana, now a Bhikshu, came to this<br>city, the former bees whom he had to take across all bowed and<br>welcomed him. Such is the power of his former vow.”</p>

              <p>Due to the discriminating mind, we judge the situation and people.  Actually in true compassion as taught by Buddha, there is total impartiality.  We try to help all sentient beings without differentiating, even between animals, spirits, humans and other realms... there shouldn't be differentiation. Of course, we must also do it with wisdom. For eg. if you know someone is going to do something negative with the money, then it is not right to support him/her.</p>
              <p>It is not so easy to drop our judgements. But i think we should train in the direction that Buddha indicated.</p>

              when the generosity and sincerity is there, there's no different in donating 1 dollar/cent  to a street begger and 1thousand to a charity organisation. we had heard that before in Buddhism story,
