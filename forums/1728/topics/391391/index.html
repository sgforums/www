              <p>MANY roads lead to the Path, but basically there are only two: reason
                       and 
                      practice. To enter by reason means to realize the essence through 
                      instruction 
                      and to believe that all living things share the same true nature, which 
                      isn’t 
                      apparent because it’s shrouded by sensation and delusion. Those who turn
                       from 
                      delusion back to reality, who meditate on walls,’ the absence of self 
                      and other, 
                      the oneness of mortal and sage, and who remain unmoved even by 
                      scriptures are in 
                      complete and unspoken agreement with reason. Without moving, without 
                      effort, 
                      they enter, we say, by reason.</p>
              <p>To enter by practice refers to four all-inclusive practices: 
                      Suffering 
                      injustice, adapting to conditions, seeking nothing, and practicing the 
                      Dharma. 
                      First, suffering injustice. When those who search for the Path encounter
                       
                      adversity, they should think to themselves, "In Countless ages gone by, 
                      I’ve 
                      turned from the essential to the trivial and wandered through all manner
                       of 
                      existence, often angry without cause and guilty of numberless 
                      transgressions.</p>
              <p>Now, though I do no wrong, I’m punished by my past. Neither gods nor 
                      men can 
                      foresee when an evil deed will bear its fruit. I accept it with an open 
                      heart 
                      and without complaint of injustice. The sutras say " when you meet with 
                      adversity don’t be upset because it makes sense." With such 
                      understanding you’re 
                      in harmony with reason. And by suffering injustice you enter the Path. 
                      Second, 
                      adapting to conditions. As mortals, we’re ruled by conditions, not by 
                      ourselves. 
                      All the suffering and joy we experience depend on conditions. If we 
                      should be 
                      blessed by some great reward, such as fame or fortune, it’s the fruit of
                       a seed 
                      planted by us in the past. When conditions change, it ends. Why delight 
                      In Its 
                      existence? But while success and failure depend on conditions, the mind 
                      neither 
                      waxes nor wanes. Those who remain unmoved by the wind of joy silently 
                      follow the 
                      Path.</p>
              <p>Third, seeking nothing. People of this world are deluded. They’re 
                      always 
                      longing for something-always, in a word, seeking. But the wise wake up. 
                      They 
                      choose reason over custom. They fix their minds on the sublime and let 
                      their 
                      bodies change with the seasons. All phenomena are empty. They contain 
                      nothing 
                      worth desiring. Calamity forever alternates with Prosperity! To dwell in
                       the 
                      three realms is to dwell in a burning house. To have a body is to 
                      suffer. Does 
                      anyone with a body know peace? Those who understand this detach 
                      themselves from 
                      all that exists and stop Imagining or seeking anything. The sutras say, 
                      "To seek 
                      is to suffer.</p>
              <p>To seek nothing is bliss." When you seek nothing, you’re on the Path.
                       Fourth, 
                      practicing the Dharma.’ The Dharma is the truth that all natures are 
                      pure. By 
                      this truth, all appearances are empty. Defilement and attachment, 
                      subject and 
                      object don’t exist. The sutras say, "The Dharma includes no being 
                      because it’s 
                      free from the impurity of being, and the Dharma includes no self because
                       it’s 
                      free from the impurity of self." Those wise enough to believe and 
                      understand 
                      these truths are bound to practice according to the Dharma. And since 
                      that which 
                      is real includes nothing worth begrudging, they give their body, life, 
                      and 
                      property in charity, without regret, without the vanity of giver, gift, 
                      or 
                      recipient, and without bias or attachment. And to eliminate impurity 
                      they teach 
                      others, but without becoming attached to form. Thus, through their own 
                      practice 
                      they’re able to help others and glorify the Way of Enlightenment. And as
                       with 
                      charity, they also practice the other virtues. But while practicing the 
                      six 
                      virtues to eliminate delusion, they practice nothing at all. This is 
                      what’s 
                      meant by practicing the Dharma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bloodstream Sermon</span></strong></span><a name="bloodstream"></a></p>
              <p>Everything that appears in the three realms comes from the mind. 
                      Hence 
                      Buddhas of the past and future teach mind to mind without bothering 
                      about 
                      definitions. But if they don’t define it, what do they mean by mind? You
                       ask. 
                      That’s your mind. I answer. That’s my mind. If I had no mind how could I
                       answer? 
                      If you had no mind, how could you ask? That which asks is your mind. 
                      Through 
                      endless kalpas" without beginning, whatever you do, wherever you are, 
                      that’s 
                      your real mind, that’s your real buddha. This mind is the buddha" says 
                      the same 
                      thing. Beyond this mind you’ll never find another Buddha. To search for 
                      enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind is impossible. The reality of 
                      your own 
                      self-nature the absence of cause and effect, is what’s meant by mind. 
                      Your mind 
                      is nirvana. You might think you can find a Buddha or enlightenment 
                      somewhere 
                      beyond the mind’, but such a place doesn’t exist.</p>
              <p>Trying to find a Buddha or enlightenment is like trying to grab 
                      space. Space 
                      has</p>
              <p>a name but no form. It’s not something you can pick up or put down. 
                      And you 
                      certainly can’t grab if. Beyond mind you’ll never see a Buddha. The 
                      Buddha is a 
                      product of the mind. Why look for a Buddha beyond this mind?</p>
              <p>Buddhas of the past and future only talk about this mind. The mind is
                       the 
                      Buddha, and the Buddha is the mind. Beyond the mind there’s no Buddha 
                      and beyond 
                      the Buddha there’s no mind. If you think there is a Buddha beyond the 
                      mind’, 
                      where is he? There’s no Buddha beyond the mind, so why envision one? You
                       can’t 
                      know your real mind as long as you deceive yourself. As long as you’re 
                      enthralled by a lifeless form, you’re not free. If you don’t believe me,
                       
                      deceiving yourself won’t help. It’s not the Buddha’s fault. People, 
                      though, are 
                      deluded. They’re unaware that their own mind is the Buddha. Otherwise 
                      they 
                      wouldn’t look for a Buddha outside the mind.</p>
              <p>Buddhas don’t save Buddhas. If you use your mind to look for a 
                      Buddha, you 
                      won’t see the Buddha. As long as you look for a Buddha somewhere else, 
                      you’ll 
                      never see that your own mind is the Buddha. Don’t use a Buddha to 
                      worship a 
                      Buddha. And don’t use the mind to invoke a Buddha." Buddhas don’t recite
                       
                      sutras." Buddhas don’t keep precepts." And Buddhas don’t break precepts.
                       Buddhas 
                      don’t keep or break anything. Buddhas don’t do good or evil.</p>
              <p>To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his 
                      nature is a 
                      Buddha. If you don’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras,
                       making 
                      offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking Buddhas 
                      results in</p>
              <p>good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping 
                      precepts 
                      results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future 
                      blessings-but 
                      no buddha. If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll have to find a 
                      teacher to 
                      get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such
                       a 
                      person isn’t a tea6er. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he 
                      can’t 
                      escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms 
                      without hope 
                      of release. Long ago, the monk Good Star 21 was able to recite the 
                      entire Canon. 
                      But he didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If 
                      this was 
                      the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or
                       
                      shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, 
                      reciting 
                      so much prose is useless.</p>
              <p>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature 
                      is the 
                      Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free: free of plans, free of 
                      cares. 
                      If you don’t see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere 
                      else, 
                      you’ll never find a buddha. The truth is there’s nothing to find. But to
                       reach 
                      such an understanding you need a teacher and you need to struggle to 
                      make 
                      yourself understand. Life and death are important. Don’t suffer them in 
                      vain.</p>
              <p>There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have 
                      mountains of 
                      jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the 
                      Ganges, you 
                      see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your eyes are 
                      shut? You 
                      should realize then that everything you see is like a dream or illusion.</p>
              <p>If you don’t find a teacher soon, you’ll live this life in vain. It’s
                       true, 
                      you have the buddha-nature. But the help of a teacher you’ll never know 
                      it. Only 
                      one person in a million becomes enlightened without a teacher’s help. 
                      If, 
                      though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone understands what the 
                      Buddha 
                      meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. Such a person has a natural 
                      awareness 
                      superior to anything taught. But unless you’re so blessed, study hard, 
                      and by 
                      means of instruction you’ll understand.</p>
              <p>People who don’t understand and think they can do so without study 
                      are no 
                      different from those deluded souls who can’t tell white from black." 
                      Falsely 
                      proclaiming the Buddha-Dharma, such persons in fact blaspheme the Buddha
                       and 
                      subvert the Dharma. They preach as if they were bringing rain. But 
                      theirs is the 
                      preaching of devils not of Buddhas. Their teacher is the King of Devils 
                      and 
                      their disciples are the Devil’s minions. Deluded people who follow such 
                      instruction unwittingly sink deeper in the Sea of Birth and Death. 
                      Unless they 
                      see their nature, how can people call themselves Buddhas they’re liars 
                      who 
                      deceive others into entering the realm of devils. Unless they see their 
                      nature, 
                      their preaching of the Twelvefold Canon is nothing but the preaching of 
                      devils. 
                      Their allegiance is to Mara, not to the Buddha. Unable to distinguish 
                      white from 
                      black, how can they escape birth and death?</p>
              <p>Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha; whoever doesn’t is a mortal. But
                       if you 
                      can find your buddha-nature apart from your mortal nature, where is it? 
                      Our 
                      mortal nature is our Buddha nature. Beyond this nature there’s no 
                      Buddha. The 
                      Buddha is our nature. There’s no Buddha besides this nature. And there’s
                       no 
                      nature besides the Buddha. But suppose I don’t see my nature, cant I 
                      still 
                      attain enlightenment by invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras, making 
                      offerings, 
                      observing precepts, Practicing devotions, or doing good works?</p>
              <p>No, you can’t. Why not?</p>
              <p>If you attain anything at all, it’s conditional, it’s karmic. It 
                      results in 
                      retribution. It turns the Wheel. And as long as you’re subject to birth 
                      and 
                      death, you’ll never attain enlightenment. To attain enlightenment you 
                      have to 
                      see your nature. Unless you see your nature, all this talk about cause 
                      and 
                      effect is nonsense. Buddhas don’t practice nonsense. A Buddha free of 
                      karma free 
                      of cause and effect. To say he attains anything at all is to slander a 
                      Buddha. 
                      What could he possibly attain? Even focusing on a mind, a power, an 
                      understanding, or a view is impossible for a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t one 
                      sided. 
                      The nature of his mind is basically empty, neither pure nor impure. He’s
                       free of 
                      practice and realization. He’s free of cause and effect.</p>
              <p>A Buddha doesn’t observe precepts. A Buddha doesn’t do good or evil. A
                       Buddha 
                      isn’t energetic or lazy. A Buddha is someone who does nothing, someone 
                      who can’t 
                      even focus his mind on a Buddha. A Buddha isn’t a Buddha. Don’t think 
                      about 
                      Buddhas. If you dont see what I’m talking about, you’ll ever know your 
                      own mind. 
                      People who don’t see their nature and imagine they can practice 
                      thoughtlessness 
                      all the time are lairs and fools. They fall into endless space. They’re 
                      like 
                      drunks. They can’t tell good from evil. If you intend to cultivate such a
                       
                      practice, you have to see your nature before you can put an end to 
                      rational 
                      thought. To attain enlightenment without seeing your nature is 
                      impossible. Still 
                      others commit all sorts of evil deeds, claiming karma doesn’t exist. 
                      They 
                      erroneously maintain that since everything is empty committing evil 
                      isn’t wrong. 
                      Such persons fall into a hell of endless darkness with no hope of 
                      release. Those 
                      who are wise hold no such conception.</p>
              <p>But if our every movement or state, whenever it occurs, is the mind, 
                      why 
                      don’t we see this mind when a person’s body dies?</p>
              <p>The mind is always present. You just don’t see it.</p>
              <p>But if the mind is present, why don’t I see it?</p>
              <p>Do you ever dream?</p>
              <p>Of course.</p>
              <p>When you dream, is that you?</p>
              <p>Yes, it’s me.</p>
              <p>And is what you’re doing and saying different from you?</p>
              <p>No, it isn’t.</p>
              <p>But if it isn’t, then this body is your real body. And this real body
                       is your 
                      mind. And this mind, through endless kalpas without beginning, has never
                       varied. 
                      It has never lived or died, appeared or disappeared, increased or 
                      decreased. Its 
                      not pure or impure, good or evil, past or future. It’s not true or 
                      false. It’s 
                      not mate or female. It doesn’t appear as a monk or a layman, an elder or
                       a 
                      novice, a sage or a fool, a Buddha or a mortal. It strives ‘for no 
                      realization 
                      and suffers no karma. It has no strength or form. It’s like space. You 
                      can’t 
                      possess it and you can’t lose it. Its movements can’t be blocked by 
                      mountains, 
                      rivers, or rock walls. Its unstoppable powers penetrate the Mountain of 
                      Five 
                      Skandhas and cross the River of Samsara." No karma can restrain this 
                      real body. 
                      But this mind is subtle and hard to see. It’s not the same as the 
                      sensual mind. 
                      Every I one wants to see this mind, and those who move their hands and 
                      feet by 
                      its light are as many as the grains of sand along the Ganges, but when 
                      you ask 
                      them, they can’t explain it. They’re like puppets. It’s theirs to use. 
                      Why don’t 
                      they see it?</p>
              <p>The Buddha said people are deluded. This Is why when they act they 
                      fall into 
                      the river of endless rebirth. And when they try to get out they only 
                      sink 
                      deeper. And all because they don’t see their nature. If people weren’t 
                      deluded 
                      why would they ask about something right in front of them? Not one of 
                      they 
                      understands the movement of his own hands and feet. The Buddha wasn’t 
                      mistaken. 
                      Deluded people don’t know who they are. A Buddha and no one else know 
                      something 
                      so hard to fathom. Only the wise knows mind, this mind call nature, this
                       mind 
                      called liberation. Neither life nor death can restrain this mind. 
                      Nothing can. 
                      It’s also called the Unstoppable Tathagata," the Incomprehensible, the 
                      Sacred 
                      Self, the Immortal, the Great Sage. Its names vary but not its essence. 
                      Buddhas 
                      vary too, but none leaves his own mind. The mind’s capacity is 
                      limitless, and 
                      its manifestations are inexhaustible. Seeing forms with your eyes, 
                      hearing 
                      sounds with your ears, smelling odors with your nose, tasting flavors 
                      with your 
                      tongue, every movement or state is your entire mind. At every moment, 
                      where 
                      language can’t go, that’s your mind.</p>
              <p>The sutras say, "A Tathagata’s forms are endless. And so is his 
                      awareness." 
                      The endless variety of forms is due to the mind. Its ability to 
                      distinguish 
                      things, whatever their movement or state, is the mind’s awareness. But 
                      the mind 
                      has no form and its awareness no limit. Hence it’s said, "A Tathagata’s 
                      forms 
                      are endless. And so is his awareness." A material body of the four 
                      elements" is 
                      trouble. A material body is subject to birth and death. But the real 
                      body exists 
                      without existing, because a Tathagata’s real body never changes. The 
                      sutras say, 
                      "People should realize that the buddha-nature is something they have 
                      always 
                      had." Kashyapa only realized his own nature.</p>
              <p>Our nature is the mind. And the mind is our nature. This nature is 
                      the same 
                      as the mind of all Buddhas. Buddhas of the past and future only transmit
                       this 
                      mind. Beyond this mind there’s no Buddha anywhere. But deluded people 
                      don’t 
                      realize that their own mind is the Buddha. They keep searching outside. 
                      They 
                      never stop invoking Buddhas or worshipping Buddhas and wondering Where 
                      is the 
                      buddha? Don’t indulge in such illusions. Just know your mind. Beyond 
                      your mind 
                      there’s no other Buddha. The sutras say, "Everything that has form is an
                       
                      illusion." They also say, "Wherever you are, there’s a Buddha." Your 
                      mind is the 
                      Buddha. Don’t use a Buddha to worship a Buddha.</p>
              <p>Even if a Buddha or bodhisattva" should suddenly appear before you, 
                      there’s 
                      no need for reverence. This mind of ours is empty and contains no such 
                      form. 
                      Those who hold onto appearances are devils. They fall from the Path. Why
                       worship</p>
              <p>illusions born of the mind? Those who worship don’t know, and those 
                      who know 
                      don’t worship. By worshipping you come under the spell of devils. I 
                      point this 
                      out because 1 afraid you’re unaware of it. The basic nature of a Buddha 
                      has no 
                      such form. Keep this in mind, even if something unusual should appear. 
                      Don’t 
                      embrace it, and don’t fear it, and don’t doubt that your Mind is 
                      basically pure. 
                      Where could there be room for any such form? Also, at the appearance of 
                      spirits, 
                      demons, or divine conceive neither respect nor fear. Your mind is 
                      basically 
                      empty. All appearances are illusions. Don’t hold on to appearances. If 
                      you 
                      envision a Buddha, a Dharma, or a bodhisattva" and conceive respect for 
                      them, 
                      you relegate yourself to the realm of mortals. If you seek direct 
                      understanding, 
                      don’t hold on to any appearance whatsoever, and you’ll succeed. I have 
                      no other 
                      advice. The sutras say, "All appearances are illusions." They have no 
                      fixed 
                      existence, o constant form. They’re impermanent. Don’t cling to 
                      appearances and 
                      you’ll be of one mind with the Buddha. The sutras say, "’That which is 
                      free of 
                      all form is the Buddha."</p>
              <p>But why shouldn’t we worship Buddhas and bodhisattvas?</p>
              <p>Devils and demons possess the power of manifestation. They can create
                       the 
                      appearance of bodhisattvas in all sorts of guises. But they’re false. 
                      None of 
                      them are Buddhas. The Buddha is your own mind. Don’t misdirect your 
                      worship.</p>
              <p>Buddha is Sanskrit for what you call aware, miraculously aware. 
                      Responding, 
                      arching your brows blinking your eyes, moving your hands and feet, its 
                      all your 
                      miraculously aware nature. And this nature is the mind. And the mind is 
                      the 
                      Buddha. And the Buddha is the path. And the path is Zen. But the word 
                      Zen is one 
                      that remains a puzzle to both mortals and sages. Seeing your nature is 
                      Zen. 
                      Unless you see your nature, it’s not Zen.</p>
              <p>Even if you can explain thousands of sutras and shastras, unless you 
                      see your 
                      own nature yours is the teaching of a mortal, not a Buddha. The true Way
                       is 
                      sublime. It can’t be expressed in language. Of what use are scriptures? 
                      But 
                      someone who sees his own nature finds the Way, even if he can’t read a 
                      word. 
                      Someone who sees his nature is a Buddha. And since a Buddha’s body is 
                      intrinsically pure and unsullied, and everything he says is an 
                      expression of his 
                      mind, being basically empty, a buddha can’t be found in words or 
                      anywhere in the 
                      Twelvefold Canon.</p>
              <p>The Way is basically perfect. It doesn’t require perfecting. The Way 
                      has no 
                      form or sound. It’s subtle and hard to perceive. It’s like when you 
                      drink water: 
                      you know how hot or cold it is, but you can’t tell others. Of that which
                       only a</p>
              <p>Tathagata knows men and gods remain unaware. The awareness of mortals
                       falls 
                      short. As long as ,they’re attached to appearances, they’re unaware that
                       their 
                      minds are empty.</p>
              <p>And by mistakenly clinging to the appearance of things they lose the 
                      Way. If 
                      you know that everything comes from the mind, don’t become attached. 
                      Once 
                      attached, you’re unaware. But once you see your own nature, the entire 
                      Canon 
                      becomes so much prose. Its thousands of sutras and shastras only amount 
                      to a 
                      clear mind. Understanding comes in midsentence. What good are doctrines?
                       The 
                      ultimate Truth is beyond words. Doctrines are words.</p>
              <p>They’re not the Way. The Way is wordless. Words are illusions. 
                      They’re no 
                      different from things that appear in your dreams at night, be they 
                      palaces or 
                      carriages, forested parks or lakeside ‘lions. Don’t conceive any delight
                       for 
                      such things. They’re all cradles of rebirth. Keep this in mind when you 
                      approach 
                      death. Don’t cling to appearances, and you’ll break through all 
                      barriers. A 
                      moment’s hesitation and you’ll be under the spell of devils. Your real 
                      body is 
                      pure and impervious. But because of delusions you’re unaware of it. And 
                      because 
                      of this you suffer karma in vain. Wherever you find delight, you find 
                      bondage. 
                      But once you awaken to your original body and mind," you’re no longer 
                      bound by 
                      attachments.</p>
              <p>Anyone, who gives up the transcendent for the mundane, ill any of its
                       myriad 
                      forms, is a mortal. A Buddha is someone who finds freedom in good 
                      fortune and 
                      bad. Such is his power that karma can’t hold him. No matter what kind of
                       karma 
                      Buddha transforms it. Heaven and hell are nothing to him. But the 
                      awareness of a 
                      mortal is dim compared to that of a Buddha who penetrates everything 
                      inside and 
                      out. If you’re not sure don’t act. Once you act, you wander through 
                      birth and 
                      death and regret having no refuge. Poverty and hardship are created by 
                      false 
                      thinking. To understand this mind you have to act without acting. Only 
                      then will 
                      you see things from a Tathagata’s perspective.</p>
              <p>But when you first embark on the Path, your awareness won’t focused. 
                      But you 
                      shouldn’t doubt that all such scenes come from your own mind and nowhere
                       
                      else.</p>
              <p>If, as in a dream, you see a light brighter than the sun, your 
                      remaining 
                      attachments will suddenly come to an end and the nature of reality will 
                      be 
                      revealed. Such an occurrence serves as the basis for enlightenment. But 
                      this is 
                      something only you know. You can’t explain it to others. Or if, while 
                      you’re 
                      walking, standing, sitting, or lying in a quiet grove, you see a light, 
                      regardless of whether it’s bright or dim, don’t tell others and don’t 
                      focus on 
                      it. It’s the light of your own nature.</p>
              <p>Or if, while you’re walking, standing, sitting, or lying in the 
                      stillness and 
                      darkness of night, everything appears as though in daylight, don’t be 
                      startled. 
                      It’s your own mind about to reveal itself.</p>
              <p>Or if, while you’re dreaming at night, you see the moon and stars in 
                      all 
                      their clarity, it means the workings of your mind are about to end. But 
                      don’t 
                      tell others. And if your dreams aren’t clear, as if you were walking in 
                      the 
                      dark, it’s because your mind is masked by cares. This too is something 
                      of" you 
                      know. if you so your nature,, you don’t need to read sutras or invoke 
                      buddhas. 
                      Erudition and Knowledge are not only useless but also cloud your 
                      awareness. 
                      Doctrines are only for pointing to the mind. Once you see your mind, why
                       pay 
                      attention to doctrines?</p>
              <p>To go from mortal to Buddha, you have to put an end to karma, nurture
                       your 
                      awareness, and accept what life brings. If you’re always getting angry, 
                      you’ll 
                      turn your nature against the Way. There’s no advantage in deceiving 
                      yourself. 
                      Buddhas move freely through birth and death, appearing and disappearing 
                      at will. 
                      They can’t be restrained by karma or overcome by devils. Once mortals 
                      see their 
                      nature, all attachments end. Awareness isn’t hidden. But you can only 
                      find it 
                      right now. It’s only now. If you really want to find the Way, don’t hold
                       on to 
                      anything. Once you put an end to karma and nurture your awareness, any 
                      attachments that remain will come to an end. Understanding comes 
                      naturally. You 
                      don’t have to make any effort. But fanatics don’t understand what the 
                      Buddha 
                      meant. And the harder they try, the farther they get from the Sage’s 
                      meaning. 
                      All day long they invoke Buddhas and read sutras. But they remain blind 
                      to their 
                      own divine nature, and they don’t escape the Wheel.</p>
              <p>A Buddha is an idle person. He doesn’t run around after fortune and 
                      fame. 
                      What good are such things in the end? People who don’t see their nature 
                      and 
                      think reading sutras, invoking Buddhas’, studying long and hard, 
                      practicing 
                      morning</p>
              <p>and night, never lying down, or acquiring knowledge is the Dharma, 
                      blaspheme 
                      the Dharma. Buddhas of the past and future only talk about seeing your 
                      nature. 
                      All practices are impermanent. Unless they see their nature people who 
                      claim to 
                      have attained unexcelled, complete enlightenment" are liars. Among 
                      Shakyamuni’s 
                      ten greatest disciples, Ananda was foremost in learning. But he didn’t 
                      know the 
                      Buddha. All he did was study and memorize. Arhats don’t know the Buddha.
                       All 
                      they know are so many practices for realization, and they become trapped
                       by 
                      cause and effect. Such is a mortal’s karma: no escape from birth and 
                      death. By 
                      doing the opposite of what lie intended, Such people blaspheme the 
                      Buddha. 
                      Killing them would not be wrong. The sutras say, "Since icchantikas are 
                      incapable of belief, killing them would be blameless, whereas people who
                       believe 
                      reach the state of Buddhahood."</p>
              <p>Unless you see your nature, You shouldn’t go around criticizing the 
                      goodness 
                      of others. There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Good and bad are 
                      distinct. Cause and effect are clear. Heaven and hell are right before 
                      your 
                      eves. But fools don’t believe and fall straight into a hell of endless 
                      darkness 
                      without even knowing it. What keeps them from believing is the heaviness
                       of 
                      their karma. They’re like blind people who don’t believe there’s such a 
                      thing as 
                      light. Even if you explain it to them, they still don t believe, because
                       they’re 
                      blind. How can they possibly distinguish light?</p>
              <p>The same holds true for fools who end up among the lower orders of 
                      existence 
                      or among the poor and despised. They can’t live and they can’t die. And 
                      despite 
                      their sufferings, if you ask them, they say they’re as happy as gods. 
                      All 
                      mortals even those who think themselves wellborn, are likewise unaware. 
                      Because 
                      of the heaviness of their karma, such fools can’t believe and can’t get 
                      free.</p>
              <p>People who see that their mind is the Buddha don’t need to shave 
                      their head" 
                      Laymen are Buddhas too. Unless they see their nature, people who shave 
                      their 
                      head are simply fanatics.</p>
              <p>But since married laymen don’t give up sex, bow can they become 
                      Buddhas? I 
                      only talk about seeing your nature. I don’t talk about sex simply 
                      because you 
                      don’t see your nature. Once you see your nature, sex is basically 
                      immaterial. It 
                      ends along with your delight in it. Even if some habits remain’, they 
                      can’t harm 
                      you, because your nature is essentially pure. Despite dwelling in a 
                      material 
                      body of four elements, your nature is basically pure. It can’t be 
                      corrupted.</p>
              <p>Your real body is basically pure. It can’t be corrupted. Your real 
                      body has 
                      no sensation, no hunger or thirst’, no warmth or cold, no sickness, no 
                      love or 
                      attachment, no pleasure or pain, no good or bad, no shortness or length,
                       no 
                      weakness or strength. Actually, there’s nothing here. It’s only because 
                      you 
                      cling to this material body that things like hunger and thirst, warmth 
                      and cold, 
                      sickness appear Once you stop clinging and let things be, you’ll- be 
                      free, even 
                      of birth and death. You’ll transform everything. You’ll possess 
                      Spiritual powers 
                      " that cant be obstructed. And you’ll be at peace wherever you are. If 
                      you doubt 
                      this, you’ll never see through anything. You’re better off doing 
                      nothing. Once 
                      you act, you can’t avoid the cycle of birth and death. But once you see 
                      your 
                      nature, you’re a Buddha even if you work as a butcher.</p>
              <p>But butchers create karma by slaughtering animals. How can they be 
                      Buddhas?</p>
              <p>I only talk about seeing your nature. I don’t talk about creating 
                      karma. 
                      Regardless of what we do, our karma has no hold on us. Through endless 
                      kalpas 
                      without beginning, its only because people don’t see their nature that 
                      they end 
                      up in hell. As long as a person creates karma, he keeps passing through 
                      birth 
                      and death. But once a person realizes his original nature, he stops 
                      creating 
                      karma. If he doesn’t see his nature, invoking Buddhas won’t release him 
                      from his 
                      karma, regardless of whether or not he’s a butcher. But once he sees his
                       nature, 
                      all doubts vanish. Even a butcher’s karma has no effect on such a 
                      person. In 
                      India the twenty-seven patriarchs only transmitted the imprint of the 
                      mind.</p>
              <p>And the only reason I’ve come to China is to transmit the 
                      instantaneous 
                      teaching of the Mahayana This mind is the Buddha. I don’t talk about 
                      precepts, 
                      devotions or ascetic practices such immersing yourself in water and 
                      fire, 
                      treading a wheel of knives, eating one meal a day, or never lying down. 
                      These 
                      are fanatical, provisional teachings. Once you recognize your moving, 
                      miraculously aware nature.</p>
              <p>Yours is the mind of all Buddhas. Buddhas of the past and future only
                       talk 
                      about transmitting the mind.</p>
              <p>They teach nothing else if someone understands this teaching, even if
                       he’s 
                      illiterate he’s a Buddha. If You don’t see your own miraculously aware 
                      nature, 
                      you’ll never find a Buddha even if you break your body into atoms.</p>
              <p>The Buddha is your real body, your original mind. This mind has no 
                      form or 
                      characteristics, no cause or effect, no tendons or bones. It’s like 
                      space. You 
                      can’t hold it. Its not the mind or materialists or nihilists. Except for
                       a 
                      Tathagata, no one else- no mortal, no deluded being-can fathom it.</p>
              <p>But this mind isn’t somewhere outside the material body of four 
                      elements.Without this mind we can’t move. The body has no awareness. 
                      Like a 
                      plant or stone, the body has no nature. So how does it move? It’s the 
                      mind that 
                      moves. Language and behavior, perception and conception are all 
                      functions of the 
                      moving mind. All motion is the mind’s motion. Motion is its function. 
                      Apart from 
                      motion there’s no mind, and apart from the mind there’s no motion. But 
                      motion 
                      isn’t the mind. And the mind isn’t motion. Motion is basically mindless.
                       And the 
                      mind is basically motionless. But motion doesn’t exist without the mind.
                       And the 
                      mind doesn’t exist without motion. Theres no mind for motion to exist 
                      apart 
                      from, and</p>
              <p>no motion for mind to exist apart from. Motion is the mind’s 
                      function, and 
                      its function is its motion. Even so, the mind neither moves nor 
                      functions, the 
                      essence of its functioning is emptiness and emptiness is essentially 
                      motionless. 
                      Motion is the same as the mind. And the mind is essentially motionless. 
                      Hence 
                      the Sutras tell us to move without moving, to travel without traveling, 
                      to see 
                      without seeing, to laugh without laughing, to hear without hearing, to 
                      know 
                      without knowing, to be happy, without being happy, to walk without 
                      walking, to 
                      stand without standing. And the sutras say, "Go beyond language. Go 
                      beyond 
                      thought." Basically, seeing, hearing, and knowing are completely empty. 
                      Your 
                      anger, Joy, or pain is like that of puppet. You search but you won’t 
                      find a 
                      thing.</p>
              <p>According to the Sutras, evil deeds result in hardships and good 
                      deeds result 
                      in blessings. Angry people go to hell and happy people go to heaven. But
                       once 
                      you know that the nature of anger and joy is empty and you let them go, 
                      you free 
                      yourself from karma. If you don’t see your nature, quoting sutras is no 
                      help, I 
                      could go on, but this brief sermon will have to do.</p>

              <p>The essence of the Way is detachment. And the goal of those who 
                      practice is 
                      freedom from appearances. The sutras say, Detachment is enlightenment 
                      because it 
                      negates appearances. Buddhahood means awareness Mortals whose minds are 
                      aware 
                      reach the Way of Enlightenment and are therefore called Buddhas. The 
                      sutras say, 
                      "Those who free themselves from all appearances are called Buddhas." The
                       
                      appearance of appearance as no appearance can’t be seen visually but can
                       only be 
                      known by means of wisdom. Whoever hears and believes this teaching 
                      embarks on 
                      the Great Vehicle" and leaves the three realms. The three realms are 
                      greed, 
                      anger, and delusion. To leave the three realms means to go from greed, 
                      anger, 
                      and delusion back to morality, meditation, and wisdom. Greed, anger, and
                       
                      delusion have no nature of their own. They depend on mortals. And anyone
                       capable 
                      of reflection is bound to see that the nature of greed, anger, and 
                      delusion is 
                      the buddha-nature. Beyond greed, anger, and delusion there is no other 
                      buddha-nature. The sutras say, "Bu as have only become buddhas while 
                      living with 
                      the three poisons and nourishing themselves on the pure Dharma." The 
                      three 
                      poisons are greed, anger, and delusion.</p>
              <p>The Great Vehicle is the greatest of all vehicles. It’s the 
                      conveyance of 
                      bodhisattvas, who use everything wit out using anything and who travel 
                      all day 
                      without traveling. Such is the vehicle of Buddhas.</p>
              <p>The sutras say, "No vehicle is the vehicle of Buddhas."</p>
              <p>Whoever realizes that the six senses aren’t real, that the five 
                      aggregates 
                      are fictions, that no such things can be located anywhere in the body, 
                      understands the language of Buddhas. The sutras say, "The cave of five 
                      aggregates is the hall of Zen. The opening of the inner eye is the door 
                      of the 
                      Great Vehicle." What could be clearer?</p>
              <p>Not thinking about anything is Zen. Once you know this, walking, 
                      standing, 
                      sitting, or lying down, everything you do is Zen. To know that the mind 
                      is empty 
                      is to see the Buddha. The Buddhas of the ten directions" have no mind. 
                      To see no 
                      mind is to see the Buddha.</p>
              <p>To give up yourself without regret is the greatest charity. To 
                      transcend 
                      motion and stillness is the highest meditation. Mortals keep moving, and
                       Arhats 
                      stay still." But the highest meditation surpasses both that of mortals 
                      and that 
                      of Arhats. People who reach such understanding free themselves from all 
                      appearances without effort and cure all illnesses without treatment. 
                      Such is the 
                      power of great Zen.</p>
              <p>Using the mind to look for reality is delusion. Not using the mind to
                       took 
                      for reality is awareness. Freeing oneself from words is liberation. 
                      Remaining 
                      unblemished by the dust of sensation is guarding the Dharma. 
                      Transcending life 
                      and death is leaving home."</p>
              <p>Not suffering another existence is reaching the Way. Not creating 
                      delusions 
                      is enlightenment. Not engaging in ignorance is wisdom. No affliction is 
                      nirvana. 
                      And no appearance of the mind is the other shore.</p>
              <p>When you’re deluded, this shore exists. When you wake tip, it doesn’t
                       exist. 
                      Mortals stay on this shore. But those who discover the greatest of all 
                      vehicles 
                      stay on neither this shore nor the other shore. They’re able to leave 
                      both 
                      shores. Those who see the other shore as different from this shore don’t
                       
                      understand Zen.</p>
              <p>Delusion means mortality. And awareness means Buddhahood. They’re not
                       the 
                      same. And they’re not different. It’s ‘List that people distinguish 
                      delusion 
                      from awareness. When we’re deluded there’s a world to escape. When we’re
                       aware, 
                      there’s nothing to escape.</p>
              <p>In the light of the impartial Dharma, mortals look no different from 
                      sages. 
                      The sutras say that the impartial Dharma is something that mortals can’t
                       
                      penetrate and sages can’t practice. The impartial Dharma is only 
                      practiced by 
                      great bodhisattvas and Buddhas. To look on life as different from death 
                      or on 
                      motion as different from stillness is to be partial. To be impartial 
                      means to 
                      look on suffering as no different from nirvana,, because the nature of 
                      both is 
                      emptiness. By</p>
              <p>imagining they’re putting an end to Suffering and entering nirvana 
                      Arhats end 
                      up trapped by nirvana. But bodhisattvas know that suffering is 
                      essentially 
                      empty. And by remaining in emptiness they remain in nirvana. Nirvana 
                      means no 
                      birth and no death. It’s beyond birth and death and beyond nirvana. When
                       the 
                      mind stops moving, it enters nirvana. Nirvana is an empty mind. When 
                      delusions 
                      dont exist, Buddhas reach nirvana. Where afflictions don’t exist, 
                      bodhisattvas 
                      enter the place of enlightenment An uninhabited place is one without 
                      greed, 
                      anger, or delusion. Greed is the realm of desire, anger the realm of 
                      form, and 
                      delusion the formless realm. When a thought begins, you enter the three 
                      realms. 
                      When a thought ends, you leave the three realms. The beginning or end of
                       the 
                      three realms, the existence or nonexistence of anything, depends on the 
                      mind. 
                      This applies to everything, even to such inanimate objects as rocks and 
                      sticks.</p>
              <p>Whoever knows that the mind is a fiction and devoid of anything real 
                      knows 
                      that his own mind neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Mortals keep 
                      creating the 
                      mind, claiming it exists. And Arhats keep negating the mind, claiming it
                       doesn’t 
                      exist. But bodhisattvas and Buddhas neither create nor negate the mind. 
                      This is 
                      what’s meant by the mind that neither exists nor doesn’t exist. The mind
                       that 
                      neither exists nor doesn’t exist is called the Middle Way.</p>
              <p>If you use your mind to study reality, you won’t understand either 
                      your mind 
                      or reality. If you study reality without using your mind, you’ll 
                      understand 
                      both. Those who don’t understand don’t understand understanding. And 
                      those who 
                      understand, understand not understanding. People capable of true vision 
                      know 
                      that the mind is empty. They transcend both understanding and not 
                      understanding. 
                      The absence of both understanding and not understanding is true 
                      understanding 
                      Seen with true vision, form isn’t simply form, because form depends on 
                      mind. And 
                      mind isn’t simply mind, because mind depends on form. Mind and form 
                      create and 
                      negate each other. That which exists exists in relation to that which 
                      doesn’t 
                      exist. And that which doesn’t exist doesn’t exist in relation to that 
                      which 
                      exists. This is true vision. By means of such vision nothing is seen and
                       nothing 
                      is not seen. Such vision reaches throughout the ten directions without 
                      seeing: 
                      because nothing is seen; because not seeing is seen; because seeing 
                      isn’t 
                      seeing. What mortals see are delusions. True vision is detached from 
                      seeing. The 
                      mind and the world are opposites, and vision arises where they meet. 
                      When your 
                      mind doesn’t stir inside, the world doesn’t arise outside. When the 
                      world and 
                      the mind are both transparent, this is true vision. And such 
                      understanding is 
                      true understanding.</p>
              <p>To see nothing is to perceive the Way, and to understand nothing is 
                      to know 
                      the Dharma, because seeing is neither seeing nor not seeing and because 
                      understanding is neither understanding nor not understanding. Seeing 
                      without 
                      seeing is true vision. Understanding without understanding is true 
                      understanding.</p>
              <p>True vision isn’t just seeing seeing. It’s also seeing not seeing. 
                      And true 
                      understanding isn’t just understanding understanding. It’s also 
                      understanding 
                      not understanding. If you understand anything, you don’t understand. 
                      Only when 
                      you understand nothing is it true understanding. Understanding is 
                      neither 
                      understanding nor not understanding.</p>
              <p>The sutras say, "Not to let go of wisdom is stupidity." When the mind
                       doesn’t 
                      exist, understanding and not understanding are both true. When the mind 
                      exists, 
                      understanding and not understanding are both false. When you understand,
                       reality 
                      depends on you. When you don’t understand, you depend on reality. When 
                      reality 
                      depends on you, that which isn’t real becomes real. When you depend on 
                      reality, 
                      that which is real becomes false. When you depend on reality, everything
                       is 
                      false. When reality depends on you, everything is true. Thus, the sage 
                      doesn’t 
                      use his mind to look for reality, or reality to look for his mind, or 
                      his mind 
                      to look for his mind, or reality to look for reality. His mind doesn’t 
                      give rise 
                      to reality. And reality doesn’t give rise to his mind. And because both 
                      his mind 
                      and reality are still, he’s always in samadhi.</p>
              <p>When the mortal mind appears, buddhahood disappears. When the mortal 
                      mind 
                      disappears, buddhahood appears. When the mind appears, reality 
                      disappears. When 
                      the mind disappears, reality appears. Whoever knows that nothing depends
                       on 
                      anything has found the Way. And whoever knows that the mind depends on 
                      nothing 
                      is always at the place of enlightenment.</p>
              <p>When you don’t understand, your wrong. When you understand, you re 
                      not wrong. 
                      This is because the nature of wrong is empty. When you don’t understand 
                      right 
                      seems wrong. When you understand, wrong isn’t wrong, because wrong 
                      doesn’t 
                      exist. The sutras say, "Nothing has a nature of its own." Act. Don’t 
                      question. 
                      When you question, you’re wrong. Wrong is the result of questioning. 
                      When you 
                      reach such an understanding, the wrong deeds of your past lives are 
                      wiped away. 
                      When you’re deluded, the six senses and five shades are constructs of 
                      suffering 
                      and mortality When you wake up, the six senses and five shades are 
                      constructs of 
                      nirvana and immortality.</p>
              <p>Someone who seeks the Way doesn’t look beyond himself. He knows that 
                      the mind 
                      is the Way. But when he finds the mind, he finds nothing. And when he 
                      finds the 
                      Way, he finds nothing. If you think you can use the mind to find the 
                      Way, you’re 
                      deluded. When you, re deluded, buddhahood exists. When you’re aware, it 
                      doesn’t 
                      exist. This is because awareness is buddhahood.</p>
              <p>If you’re looking for the Way, the Way won’t appear until your body’ 
                      disappears. It’s like stripping bark from a tree. This karmic body 
                      undergoes 
                      constant change. It has no fixed reality. Practice according to your 
                      thoughts. 
                      Don’t hate life and death or love life and death. Keep your every 
                      thought free 
                      of delusion, and in life you’ll witness the beg- inning of nirvana and 
                      in death 
                      you’ll experience the assurance of no rebirth.</p>
              <p>To see form but not be corrupted by form or to hear sound but not to 
                      be 
                      corrupted by sound is liberation. Eyes that aren’t attached to form are 
                      the 
                      gates of Zen. In short, those who perceive the existence and nature of 
                      phenomena 
                      and remain unattached are liberated. Those who perceive the external 
                      appearance 
                      of phenomena are at their mercy. Not to be subject to afflictions is 
                      what’s 
                      meant by liberation. There’s no other liberation. When you know how to 
                      look at 
                      form, form doesn’t give rise to mind and mind doesn’t give rise to form.
                       Form 
                      and mind are both pure.</p>
              <p>When delusions are absent, the mind is the land of Buddhas. When 
                      delusions 
                      are present, the mind is hell. Mortals create delusions. And by using 
                      the mind 
                      to give birth to mind they always find themselves in hell. Bodhisattvas 
                      see 
                      through delusions. And by not using the mind to give birth to mind they 
                      always 
                      find themselves in the land of Buddhas. If you don’t use your mind to 
                      create 
                      mind, every state of mind is empty and every thought is still. You go 
                      from one 
                      buddhaland to another. If you use your mind to create mind, every state 
                      of mind 
                      is disturbed and every thought is in motion. You go from one hell to the
                       next. 
                      When a thought arises, there’s good karma and bad karma, heaven and 
                      hell. When 
                      no thought arises, there’s no good karma or bad karma, no heaven or 
                      hell.</p>
              <p>The body neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Hence existence as a 
                      mortal and 
                      nonexistence as a sage are conceptions with which a sage has nothing to 
                      do. His 
                      heart is empty and spacious as the sky. That which follows is witnessed 
                      on the 
                      Way. It’s beyond the ken of Arhats and mortals.</p>
              <p>When the mind reaches nirvana, you don’t see nirvana, because the 
                      mind is 
                      nirvana. If you see nirvana somewhere outside the mind, you’re deluding 
                      yourself.</p>
              <p>Every suffering is a buddha-seed, because suffering impels mortals to
                       seek 
                      wisdom. But you can only say that suffering gives rise to Buddhahood. 
                      You can’t 
                      say that suffering is Buddhahood. Your body and mind are the field. 
                      Suffering is 
                      the seed, wisdom the sprout, and Buddhahood the grain. The Buddha in the
                       mind is 
                      like a fragrance in a tree. The Buddha comes from a mind free of 
                      suffering, just 
                      as a fragrance comes from a tree free of decay. There’s no fragrance 
                      without the 
                      tree and no Buddha without the mind. If there’s a fragrance without a 
                      tree, it’s 
                      a different fragrance. If there’s a Buddha without your mind, it’s a 
                      different 
                      Buddha.</p>
              <p>When the three poisons are present in your mind, you live in a land 
                      of filth.</p>
              <p>When the three poisons are absent from your mind, you live in a land 
                      of 
                      purity.</p>
              <p>The sutras say, "if you fill a land with impurity and filth, no 
                      Buddha will 
                      ever appear." Impurity and filth refer to on and the other poisons. A 
                      Buddha 
                      refers to a pure and awakened mind. There’s no language that, isn’t the 
                      Dharma. 
                      To talk all day without saying anything is the Way. To be silent all day
                       and 
                      still say something isn’t the Way. Hence neither does a Tathagata speech
                       depend 
                      on silence, nor does his silence depend on speech, nor does his speech 
                      exist 
                      apart from his silence. Those who understand both speech and silence are
                       in 
                      samadhi. If you speak when you know, Your speech is free. If you’re 
                      silent when 
                      you don’t know, your silence is tied. If speech isn’t attached to 
                      appearances 
                      its free. If silence is attached to appearances, it’s tied. Language is 
                      essentially free. It has nothing to do with attachment. And attachment 
                      has 
                      nothing to do with language. Reality has no high or low. If you see high
                       or low, 
                      It isn’t real. A raft isn’t real. But a passenger raft is. A person who 
                      rides 
                      such a raft can cross that which isn’t real. That’s why it’s real.</p>
              <p>According to the world there’s male and female, rich and poor. 
                      According to 
                      the Way there’s no male or female, no rich or poor. When the goddess 
                      realized 
                      the Way, she didn’t change her sex. When the stable boy" awakened to the
                       Truth, 
                      he</p>
              <p>didn’t change his status. Free of sex and status, they shared the 
                      same basic 
                      appearance. The goddess searched twelve years for her womanhood without 
                      success. 
                      To search twelve years for ones manhood would likewise be fruitless. The
                       twelve 
                      years refer to the twelve entrances. Without the mind there s no Buddha.
                       Without 
                      the Buddha there is no mind.</p>
              <p>Likewise, without water there’s no ice, and without ice there is no 
                      water. 
                      Whoever talks about leaving the mind doesn’t get very far. Don’t become 
                      attached 
                      to appearances of the mind. The sutras say, "When you see no appearance,
                       you see 
                      the Buddha." This is what’s meant by being free from appearances of the 
                      mind. 
                      Without the mind there’s no Buddha means that the-buddha comes from the 
                      mind. 
                      The mind gives birth to the Buddha. But although the Buddha comes from 
                      the mind, 
                      the mind doesn’t come from the Buddha, just as fish come from water, but
                       water 
                      doesn’t come from fish. Whoever wants to see a fish sees the water 
                      before lie 
                      sees the fish. And whoever wants to see a Buddha sees the mind before he
                       sees 
                      the Buddha. Once you’ve seen the fish, You forget about the water. And 
                      once 
                      you’ve seen the Buddha, you forget about the mind. If you don’t forget 
                      about the 
                      mind, the mind will confuse you, just as the water will confuse you if 
                      you don’t 
                      forget about it.</p>
              <p>Mortality and Buddhahood are like water and ice. To be afflicted by 
                      the three 
                      poisons is mortality. To be purified by the three releases" is 
                      Buddhahood. That 
                      which freezes into ice in the winter melts into water in summer. 
                      Eliminate ice</p>
              <p>and there’s no more water. Get rid of mortality and there’s no more 
                      Buddhahood. Clearly, the nature of ice is the nature of water. And the 
                      nature of 
                      water is the nature of ice. And the nature of mortality is the nature of
                       
                      Buddhahood. Mortality and Buddhahood share the same nature, just as 
                      Wutou and 
                      Futzu share the same root but not the same season. It’s only because of 
                      the 
                      delusion of differences that we have the words mortality and buddhahood.
                       When a 
                      snake becomes a dragon, it doesn’t change its scales. And when a mortal 
                      becomes 
                      a sage, he doesn’t change his face. He knows his mind through internal 
                      wisdom 
                      and takes care of his body through external discipline.</p>
              <p>Mortals liberate Buddhas and Buddhas liberate mortals. This is what’s
                       meant 
                      by impartiality. Mortals liberate Buddhas because affliction creates 
                      awareness. 
                      And Buddhas liberate mortals because awareness negates affliction. There
                       can’t 
                      help but be affliction. And there can’t help but be awareness. If it 
                      weren’t for 
                      affliction, there would be nothing to create awareness. And if it 
                      weren’t for 
                      awareness, there would be nothing to negate affliction. When you’re 
                      deluded, 
                      Buddhas liberate mortals. When you’re aware, mortals liberate Buddhas. 
                      Buddhas 
                      don’t become Buddhas on their own. They’re liberated by mortals. Buddhas
                       regard 
                      delusion as their father and greed as their mother. Delusion and greed 
                      are 
                      different names for mortality. Delusion and mortality are like the left 
                      hand and 
                      the right hand. There’s no other difference.</p>
              <p>When you’re deluded, you’re on this shore. When you’re aware, you’re 
                      on the 
                      other shore. But once you know your mind is empty and you see no 
                      appearances, 
                      you’re beyond delusion and awareness. And once you’re beyond delusion 
                      and 
                      awareness, the other shore doesn’t exist. The tathagata isn’t on this 
                      shore or 
                      the other shore. And he isn’t in midstream. Arhats are in midstream and 
                      mortals 
                      are on this shore. On the other shore is Buddhahood. Buddhas have three 
                      bodies: 
                      a transformation body a reward body, and a real body. The transformation
                       body is 
                      also called the incarnation body. The transformation body appears when 
                      mortals 
                      do good deeds, the reward body when they cultivate wisdom, and the real 
                      body 
                      when they become aware of the sublime. The transformation body is the 
                      one you 
                      see flying in all directions rescuing others wherever it can. The reward
                       body 
                      puts an end to doubts. The Great Enlightenment occurred in the Himalayas
                       
                      suddenly becomes true. The real body doesn’t do or say anything. It 
                      remains 
                      perfectly still. But actually, there’s not even one buddha-body, much 
                      less 
                      three. This talk of three bodies is simply based on human understanding,
                       which 
                      can be shallow, moderate, or deep. People of shall</p>

              <p>IF someone is determined to reach enlightenment, what is the most 
              essential 
              method he can practice?</p>
              <p>‘The most essential method, which includes all other methods, is 
              beholding 
              the mind.</p>
              <p>But how can one method include all others?</p>
              <p>The mind is the root from which all things grow if you can understand
               the 
              mind, everything else is included. It’s like the root of a tree. All a 
              tree’s 
              fruit and flowers, branches and leaves depend on its root. If you 
              nourish its 
              root, a tree multiplies. If you cut its root, it dies. Those who 
              understand the 
              mind reach enlightenment with minimal effort. Those who don’t understand
               the 
              mind practice in vain. Everything good and bad comes from your own mind.
               To find 
              something beyond the mind is impossible.</p>
              <p>But bow can beholding the mind be called understanding?</p>
              <p>When a great bodhisattva delves deeply into perfect wisdom, he 
              realizes that 
              the four elements and five shades are devoid of a personal self. And he 
              realizes 
              that the activity of his mind has two aspects: pure and impure. By their
               very 
              nature, these two mental states are always present. They alternate as 
              cause or 
              effect depending on conditions, the pure mind delighting in good deeds, 
              the 
              impure mind thinking of evil. Those who aren’t affected by impurity are 
              sages. 
              They transcend suffering and experience the bliss of nirvana. All 
              others, 
              trapped by the impure mind and entangled by their own karma, are 
              mortals. They 
              drift through the three realms and suffer countless afflictions and all 
              because 
              their impure mind obscures their real self.</p>
              <p>The Sutra of Ten Stages says, "in the body of mortals is the 
              indestructible 
              buddha-nature. Like the sun, its light fills endless space, But once 
              veiled by 
              the dark clouds of the five shades, it’s like a light ‘inside a ‘at, 
              hidden from 
              view." And the Nirvana Sutra says, "All mortals have the buddha-nature. 
              But it’s 
              covered by darkness from which they can’t escape. Our buddha-nature is 
              awareness: to be aware and to make others aware. To realize awareness is
               
              liberation," Everything good has awareness for its root. And from this 
              root of 
              awareness grow the tree of all virtues and the fruit of nirvana. 
              Beholding the 
              mind like this is understanding.</p>
              <p>You say that our true Buddha-nature and all virtues have awareness 
              for their 
              root. But what is the root of ignorance?</p>
              <p>The ignorant mind, with its infinite afflictions, passions, and 
              evils, is 
              rooted in the three poisons. Greed, anger, and delusion. These three 
              poisoned 
              states of mind themselves include countless evils, like trees that have a
               single 
              trunk but countless branches and leaves. Yet each poison produces so 
              many more 
              millions of evils that the example of a tree is hardly a fitting 
              comparison. The 
              three poisons are present in our six sense organs’ as six kinds of 
              consciousness’ or thieves. They’re called thieves because they pass in 
              and out 
              of the gates of the senses, covet limitless possessions, and mask their 
              true 
              identity. And because mortals are misled in body and mind by these 
              poisons or 
              thieves, they become lost in life and death, wander through the six 
              states of 
              existence, and suffer countless afflictions. These afflictions are like 
              rivers 
              that surge for a thousand miles because of the constant flow of small 
              springs.</p>
              <p>But if someone cuts off their source, rivers dry up. And if someone 
              who seeks 
              liberation can turn the three poisons into the three sets of precepts 
              and the 
              six thieves into the six paramitas, he rids himself of affliction once 
              and for 
              all. But the three realms and six states -of existence are infinitely 
              vast. How 
              can we escape their endless afflictions if all we do is behold the mind?
               The 
              karma of the three realms comes from the mind alone. If your mind isn’t 
              within 
              the three realms, it’s beyond them. The three realms correspond to the 
              three 
              poisons- greed corresponds to the realm of desire, anger to the realm of
               form, 
              and delusion to the formless realm. And because karma created by the 
              poisons can 
              be gentle or heavy, these three realms are further divided into six 
              places known 
              as the six states of existence.</p>
              <p>And bow does the karma of these six differ?</p>
              <p>Mortals who don’t understand true practice and blindly perform good 
              deeds are 
              born into the three higher states of existence within the three realms. 
              And what 
              are these three higher states? Those who blindly perform the ten good 
              deeds and 
              foolishly seek happiness are born as gods in the realm of desire. Those 
              who 
              blindly observe the five precepts and foolishly indulge in love and hate
               are 
              born as men in the realm of anger, And those who blindly cling to the 
              phenomenal</p>
              <p>world, believe in false doctrines, and pray for blessings are born as
               demons 
              in the realm of delusion. These are the three higher states of 
              existence.</p>
              <p>And what are the three lower states? They’re where those who persist 
              in 
              poisoned thoughts and evil deeds are born. Those whose karma from greed 
              is 
              greatest become hungry ghosts. Those whose karma from anger is greatest 
              become 
              sufferers in hell. And those whose karma from delusion is greatest 
              become 
              beasts. These three lower states together with the previous three higher
               states 
              form the six states of existence. From this you should realize that all 
              karma, 
              painful or otherwise, comes from your own mind. If you can just 
              concentrate your 
              mind and transcend its falsehood and evil, the suffering of the three 
              realms and 
              six states of existence will automatically disappear. And once free from
               
              suffering, you’re truly free. But the Buddha said, "Only after 
              undergoing 
              innumerable hardships for three asankhya kalpas did I achieve 
              enlightenment," 
              Why do you now say that simply beholding the mind and over-coming the 
              three 
              poisons is liberation?</p>
              <p>The words of the Buddha are true. But the three-asankhya kalpas refer
               to the 
              three poisoned states of mind. What we call asankhya in Sanskrit you 
              call 
              countless. Within these three poisoned states of mind are countless evil
               
              thoughts, And every thought lasts a kalpa. Such an infinity is what the 
              Buddha 
              meant by the three asankhya kalpas, Once the three poisons obscure your 
              real 
              self, how can you be called liberated until you overcome their countless
               evil 
              thoughts? People who can transform the three poisons of greed, anger, 
              and 
              delusion into the three releases are said to pass through the 
              three-sankhya 
              kalpas. But people of this final age are the densest of fools. They 
              don’t 
              understand what the Tathagata really meant by the three-asankhya kalpas.
               They 
              say enlightenment is only achieved after endless kalpas and thereby 
              mislead 
              disciples to retreat on the path to Buddhahood. But the great 
              bodbisattvas have 
              achieved enlightenment only by observing the three sets of precepts"’ 
              and 
              practicing the six Paramitas, Now you tell disciples merely to behold 
              the mind. 
              How can anyone reach enlightenment without cultivating the rules of 
              discipline?</p>
              <p>The three sets of precepts are for overcoming the three poisoned 
              states of 
              mind, When you overcome these poisons, you create three sets of 
              limitless 
              virtue, A set gathers things together-in this case, countless good 
              thoughts 
              throughout your mind. And the six paramitas are for purifying the six 
              senses. 
              What we call paramitas you call means to the other shore. By purifying 
              your six 
              senses of the dust of sensation, the paramitas ferry you across the 
              River of 
              Affliction to the Shore of Enlightenment.</p>
              <p>According to the sutras, the three sets of precepts are, "I vow, to 
              put an 
              end to all evils. I vow to cultivate all virtues. And I vow to liberate 
              all 
              beings." But now you say they’re only for controlling the three poisoned
               states 
              of mind.</p>
              <p>Isn’t this contrary to the meaning of the scriptures?</p>
              <p>The sutras of the Buddha are true. But long ago, when that great 
              bodhisattva 
              was cultivating the seed of enlightenment, it was to counter the three 
              poisons 
              that he made his three vows. Practicing moral prohibitions to counter 
              the poison 
              of greed, he vowed to put an end to all evils. Practicing meditation to 
              Counter 
              the poison of anger, he vowed to cultivate all virtues. And practicing 
              wisdom to 
              counter the poison of delusion, he vowed to liberate all beings. Because
               he 
              persevered in these three pure practices of morality, meditation, and 
              wisdom, he 
              was able to overcome the three poisons and reach enlightenment. By 
              overcoming 
              the three poisons he wiped out everything sinful and thus put an end to 
              evil. By 
              observing the three sets of precepts he did nothing but good and thus 
              cultivated 
              virtue. And by putting an end to evil and cultivating virtue lie 
              consummate all 
              practices, benefited himself as well as others, and rescued mortals 
              everywhere. 
              Thus he liberated beings.</p>
              <p>You should realize that the practice you cultivate doesn’t exist 
              apart from 
              your mind. If your mind is pure, all buddha-lands are pure. The sutras 
              say, "if 
              their minds are impure, beings are impure. If their minds are pure, 
              beings are 
              pure," And "To reach a buddha-land, purify your mind. As your mind 
              becomes pure, 
              buddha-lands become pure." Thus by overcoming the three poisoned states 
              of mind 
              the three sets of precepts are automatically fulfilled.</p>
              <p>But the sutras say the six Paramitas are charity, morality, patience,
               
              devotion, meditation, and wisdom. Now you say the paramitas refer to the
               
              purification of the senses. What do you mean by this? And why are they 
              called 
              ferries?</p>
              <p>Cultivating the paramitas means purifying the six senses by 
              overcoming the 
              six thieves. Casting out the thief of the eye by abandoning the visual 
              world is 
              charity. Keeping out the thief of the ear by not listening to sound is 
              morality. 
              Humbling the thief of the nose by equating smells as neutral is 
              patience. 
              Controlling the thief of the mouth by conquering desires to taste, 
              praise, and 
              explain is devotion. Quelling the thief of the body by remaining unmoved
               by 
              sensations of touch is meditation. And taming the thief of the mind by 
              not 
              yielding to delusions but practicing wakefulness is wisdom, These six 
              paramitas 
              are transports. Like boats or rafts, they transport beings to the other 
              shore.</p>
              <p>Hence they’re called ferries.</p>
              <p>But when Sbakyamuni was a bodhisattva, he consumed three bowls of 
              milk and 
              six ladles of gruel prior to attaining enlightenment. If he bad to drink
               milk 
              before be could taste the fruit of buddhahood, how can merely beholding 
              the mind 
              result in liberation?</p>
              <p>What you say is true. That is how he attained enlightenment. He had 
              to drink 
              milk before he could become a Buddha. But there are two kinds of milk. 
              That 
              which Shakyamuni drank wasn’t ordinary impure milk but Pure Dharma-talk.
               The 
              three bowls were the three sets of precepts. And the six ladies were the
               six 
              paramitas. When Sbakyamuni attained enlightenment, it was because he 
              drank this 
              pure dharma-rnilk that he tasted the fruit of Buddhahood. To say that 
              the 
              Tathagata drank the worldly concoction of impure, rank-smelling cow’s 
              milk is 
              the height of slander. That which is truly so, the indestructible, 
              passionless 
              Dharma-self, remains forever free of the world’s afflictions. Why would 
              it need 
              impure milk to satisfy its hunger or thirst?</p>
              <p>The sutras say, "This ox doesn’t live in the highlands or the 
              lowlands. It 
              doesn’t eat grain or chaff. And it doesn’t graze with cows. The body of 
              this ox 
              is the color of burnished gold." The ox refers to Vairocana. Owing to 
              his great 
              compassion for all beings, he produces from within his pure Dharma-body 
              the 
              sublime Dharma-milk of the three sets of precepts and six paramitas to 
              nourish 
              all those who seek liberation. The pure milk of such a truly pure ox not
               only 
              enabled the ‘tathagata to achieve buddhahood but also enables any being 
              who 
              drinks it to attain unexcelled, complete enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Throughout the sutras the Buddha tells mortals they can achieve 
              enlightenment 
              by performing such meritorious works as building monasteries, casting 
              statues, 
              burning incense, scattering flowers, lighting eternal lamps, practicing 
              all six 
              periods" of the day and night, walking around stupas, observing fasts, 
              and 
              worshipping. But if beholding the mind includes all other practices, 
              then such 
              works as these would appear redundant.</p>
              <p>The sutras of the Buddha contain countless metaphors. Because mortals
               have 
              shallow minds and don’t understand anything deep, the Buddha used the 
              tangible 
              to represent the sublime. People who seek blessings by concentrating on 
              external 
              works instead of internal cultivation are attempting the impossible, 
              What you 
              call a monastery we call a sangbarama, a place of purity. But whoever 
              denies 
              entry to the three poisons and keeps the gates of his senses pure, his 
              body and 
              mind still, inside and outside clean, builds a monastery.</p>
              <p>Casting statues refers to all practices cultivated by those who seek 
              enlightenment. The Tathagata’s sublime form can’t be represented by 
              metal. Those 
              who seek enlightenment regard their bodies as the furnace, the Dharma as
               the 
              fire, wisdom as the craftsmanship, and the three sets of precepts and 
              six 
              paramitas as the mold. They smelt and refine the true buddha-nature 
              within 
              themselves and pour it into the mold formed by the rules of discipline. 
              Acting 
              in perfect accordance with the -Buddha’s teaching, they naturally create
               a 
              perfect likeness. ‘Me eternal, sublime body isn’t subject to conditions 
              or 
              decay. If you seek the Truth but dont learn how to make a true likeness,
               what 
              will you use in its place?</p>
              <p>And burning incense doesn’t mean ordinary material incense but the 
              incense of 
              the intangible Dharma, which drives away filth, ignorance, and evil 
              deeds with 
              its perfume. There are five kinds of such Dharma-incense. First is the 
              incense 
              of morality, which means renouncing evil and cultivating virtue. Second 
              is the 
              incense of meditation, which means deeply believing in the Mahayana with
               
              unwavering resolve. Third is the incense of wisdom, which means 
              contemplating 
              the body and mind, inside and out. Fourth is the incense of liberation, 
              which 
              means severing the bonds of ignorance. And fifth is the incense of 
              perfect 
              knowledge, which means being always aware and nowhere obstructed. These 
              five are 
              the most precious kinds of incense and far superior to anything the 
              world has to 
              offer.</p>
              <p>When the Buddha was in the world, he told his disciples to light such
               
              precious incense with the fire of awareness as an offering to the 
              Buddhas of the 
              ten directions. But people today don’t understand the Tathagata’s real 
              meaning. 
              They use an ordinary flame to light material incense of sandalwood or 
              frankincense and pray for some future blessing that never comes.</p>
              <p>For scattering flowers the same holds true. This refers to speaking 
              the 
              Dharma, scattering flowers of virtue, in order to benefit others and 
              glorify the 
              real sell. These flowers of virtue are those praised by the Buddha. They
               last 
              forever and never fade. And whoever scatters such flowers reaps infinite
               
              blessings. If you think the Tathagata meant for people to harm plants by
               cutting 
              off their flowers, you’re wrong. Those who observe the precepts don’t 
              injure any 
              of the myriad life forms of heaven and earth. If you hurt something by 
              mistake, 
              you suffer for it. But those who intentionally break the precepts by 
              injuring 
              the living for the sake of future blessings suffer even more, How could 
              they let 
              would-be blessings turn into sorrows?</p>
              <p>The eternal lamp represents perfect awareness. Likening the 
              illumination of 
              awareness to that of a lamp, those who seek liberation see their body as
               the 
              lamp, their mind as its wick, the addition of discipline as its oil, and
               the 
              power of wisdom as its flame. By lighting this lamp of perfect awareness
               they 
              dispel all darkness and delusion. And by passing this Dharma on to 
              others 
              they’re able to use one lamp to light thousands of lamps. And because 
              these 
              lamps likewise light countless other lamps, their light lasts forever.</p>
              <p>49</p>
              <p>Long ago, there was a Buddha named Dipamkara, or lamplighter. This 
              was the 
              meaning of his name. But fools don’t understand the metaphors of the 
              Tathagata. 
              Persisting in delusions and clinging to the tangible, they light lamps 
              of 
              everyday vegetable oil and think that by illuminating the interiors of 
              buildings 
              they’re following the Buddha’s teaching. How foolish! The light released
               by a 
              Buddha from one curl between his brows can illuminate countless worlds. 
              An oil 
              lamp is no help. Or do you think otherwise?</p>
              <p>Practicing all six periods of the day and night means constantly 
              cultivating 
              enlightenment among the six senses and persevering in every form of 
              awareness. 
              Never relaxing control over the six senses is what’s meant by all six 
              periods. 
              As for walking around stupas, the stupa is your body and mind. When your
               
              awareness circles your body and mind without stopping, this is called 
              walking 
              around a stupa. The sages of long ago followed this path to nirvana. But
               people 
              today don’t understand what this means. Instead of looking inside they 
              insist on 
              looking outside. They use their material bodies to walk around material 
              stupas. 
              And they keep at it day and night, wearing themselves out in vain and 
              coming no 
              closer to their real self.</p>
              <p>The same holds true for observing a fast. It’s useless unless you 
              understand 
              what this really means. To fast means to regulate, to regulate your body
               and 
              mind so that they’re not distracted or disturbed. And to observe means 
              to 
              uphold, to uphold the rules of discipline according to the Dharma. 
              Fasting means 
              guarding against the six attractions on the outside and the three 
              poisons on the 
              inside and striving through contemplation to purify your body and mind.</p>
              <p>Fasting also includes five kinds of food. First there’s delight in 
              the 
              Dharma. This is the delight that comes from acting in accordance with 
              the 
              Dharma. Second is harmony in meditation. This is the harmony of body and
               mind 
              that comes from seeing through subject and object. Third is invocation, 
              the 
              invocation of Buddhas with both your month and your mind. Fourth is 
              resolution, 
              the resolution to pursue virtue whether walking, standing, sitting, or 
              lying 
              down. And fifth is liberation, the liberation of your mind from worldly 
              contamination. These five are the foods of fasting. Unless a person eats
               these 
              five pure foods, he’s wrong to think he’s fasting.</p>
              <p>Also, once you stop eating the food of delusion, if you touch it 
              again you 
              break your fast. And once you break it, you reap no blessing from it. 
              The world 
              is full of deluded people who don’t see this. They indulge their body 
              and mind 
              in all manner of evil. They give free rein to their passions and have no
               shame. 
              And when they stop eating ordinary food, they call it fasting. How 
              absurd!</p>
              <p>It’s the same with worshipping. You have to understand the meaning 
              and adapt 
              to conditions. Meaning includes action and nonaction. Whoever 
              understands this 
              follows the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Worship means reverence and humility it means revering your real self
               and 
              humbling delusions. If you can wipe out evil desires and harbor good 
              thoughts, 
              even if nothing shows its worship. Such form is its real form. The Lord 
              wanted 
              worldly people to think of worship as expressing humility and subduing 
              the mind. 
              So he told them to prostrate their bodies to show their reverence, to 
              let the 
              external express the internal, to harmonize essence and form. Those who 
              fail to 
              cultivate the inner meaning and concentrate instead on the outward 
              expression 
              never stop indulging in ignorance, hatred, and evil while exhausting 
              themselves 
              to no avail. They can deceive others with postures, remain shameless 
              before 
              sages and vain before mortals, but they’ll never escape the Wheel, much 
              less 
              achieve any merit.</p>
              <p>But the Bathhouse Sutra says, "By contributing to the bathing of 
              monks, 
              people receive limitless blessings." This would appear to be an instance
               of 
              external practice achieving merit. How does this relate to beholding the
               mind? 
              Here, the bathing of monks doesn’t refer to the washing of anything 
              tangible.</p>
              <p>When the Lord preached the Bathhouse Sutra, he wanted his disciples 
              to 
              remember the Dharma of washing. So he used an everyday concern to convey
               his 
              real meaning, which he couched in his explanation of merit from seven 
              offerings. 
              Of these seven, the first is clear water, the second fire, the third 
              soap, the 
              fourth willow catkins, the fifth pure ashes, the sixth ointment, and the
               seventh 
              the inner garment He used these seven to represent seven other things 
              that 
              cleanse and enhance a person by eliminating the delusion and filth of a 
              poisoned 
              mind. The first of these seven is morality, which washes away excess 
              just as r 
              water washes away dirt. Second is wisdom, which penetrates subject and 
              object, 
              just as fire warms water. Third is discrimination, w1udi gets rid Of 
              evil 
              practices, just as soap gets rid of grime. Fourth is honesty, which 
              purges 
              delusions, just as chewing willow catkins purifies the breath. Fifth is 
              true 
              faith, which resolves all doubts, just as rubbing pure ashes on the body
               
              prevents illnesses. Sixth is patience, which overcomes resistance and 
              disgrace, 
              just as ointment softens the skin. And seventh is shame, which redresses
               evil 
              deeds, just as the inner garment covers up an ugly body. These seven 
              represent 
              the real meaning of the sutra. When he spoke this sutra, the Tathagata 
              was 
              talking to farsighted followers of the Mahayana, not to narrow-minded 
              people of 
              dim vision. It’s not surprising that people nowadays don’t understand.</p>
              <p>The bathhouse is the body. When you light the fire of wisdom, you 
              warm the 
              pure water of the precepts and bathe the true Buddha nature within you. 
              By 
              upholding these seven practices you add to your virtue. The monks of 
              that age 
              were perceptive. They understood the Buddha’s meaning. They followed his
               
              reaching, perfected their virtue, and tasted the fruit of Buddhahood. 
              But people 
              nowadays can’t fathom these things. They use ordinary water to wash a 
              physical 
              body and think they’re following the sutra. But they’re mistaken. Our 
              true 
              buddha-nature has no shape. And the dust of affliction has no form. How 
              can 
              people use ordinary water to wash an intangible body? It won’t work. 
              When will 
              they wake up? To clean such a body you have to behold it. Once 
              impurities and 
              filth arise from desire, they multiply until they cover you inside and 
              out. But 
              if you try to wash this body of yours, you have to scrub until it’s 
              nearly gone 
              before it’s clean. From this you should realize that washing something 
              external 
              isn’t What the Buddha meant.</p>
              <p>The sutras say that someone who wholeheartedly invokes the Buddha is 
              sure to 
              be reborn in the Western Paradise. Since is door leads to Buddhahood, 
              why seek 
              liberation in beholding the mind?</p>
              <p>If you’re going to invoke the Buddha, you have to do it right. Unless
               you 
              understand what invoking means, you’ll do it wrong. And if you do it 
              wrong, 
              you’ll never go anywhere.</p>
              <p>Buddha means awareness, the awareness of body and mind that prevents 
              evil 
              from arising in either. And to invoke means to call to mind, to call 
              constantly 
              to mind the rules of discipline and to follow them with all your might. 
              This is 
              what’s meant by invoking. Invoking has to do with thought and not with 
              language. 
              If you use a trap to catch fish, once you succeed you can forget the 
              trap. And 
              if you use language to find meaning, once you find it you can forget 
              language. 
              To invoke the Buddha’s name you have to understand the Dharma of 
              invoking. If 
              it’s not present in your mind, your mouth chants an empty name. As long 
              as 
              you’re troubled by the three poisons or by thoughts of yourself, your 
              deluded 
              mind will keep you from seeing the Buddha and you’ll only waste your 
              effort. 
              Chanting and invoking are worlds apart, Chanting is done with the mouth.
               
              Invoking is done with the mind. And because invoking comes from the 
              mind, it’s 
              called the door to awareness. Chanting is centered in the mouth and 
              appears as 
              sound. If you cling to appearances while searching for meaning, you 
              won’t find a 
              thing. Thus, sages of the past cultivated introspection and not speech. 
              This 
              mind is the source of all virtues. And this mind is the chief of all 
              powers, The 
              eternal bliss of nirvana comes from the mind at rest. Rebirth in the 
              three 
              realms also comes from the mind. The mind is the door to every world and
               the 
              mind is the ford to the other shore. Those who know where the door is 
              don’t 
              worry about reaching it. Those who know where the ford is don’t worry 
              about 
              crossing it.</p>
              <p>The people I meet nowadays are superficial. They think of merit as 
              something 
              that has form. They squander their wealth and butcher creatures of land 
              and sea. 
              They foolishly concern themselves with erecting statues and stupas, 
              telling 
              people to pile up lumber and bricks, to paint this blue and that green. 
              They 
              strain body and mind, injure themselves and mislead others. And they 
              don’t know 
              enough to be ashamed. How will they ever become enlightened?</p>
              <p>They see something tangible and instantly become attached. If you 
              talk to 
              them about formlessness, they sit there dumb and confused. Greedy for 
              the small 
              mercies of this world, they remain blind to the great suffering to come.
               Such 
              disciples wear themselves out in vain. Turning from the true to the 
              false, they 
              talk about nothing but future blessings.</p>
              <p>If you can simply concentrate your mind’s Inner Light and behold its 
              outer 
              illumination, you’ll dispel the three poisons and drive away the six 
              thieves 
              once and for all. And without effort gain possession of an infinite 
              number of 
              virtues, perfections, and doors to the truth, Seeing through the mundane
               and 
              witnessing the sublime is less than an eye-blink away, Realization is 
              now. Why 
              worry about gray hair? But the true door is hidden and can’t be 
              revealed. I have 
              only touched upon beholding the mind.</p>
