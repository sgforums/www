              <p><br> Here's a link to my e-book/e-journal, which is not just a 
              'journal' but also contains pointers/instructions (including the 
              practice of self-inquiry and the method of contemplation that leads to 
              insights of non-duality and anatta). These pointers and instructions are
               designed to quickly lead readers to the realisation of their true 
              nature without delays or side-tracks – in fact I’d put it this way: you 
              can never find a more direct path to realization than the approach I 
              have presented, this is The Direct Path so to speak. If you find it 
              helpful, pass the link along to a friend <img src="http://now-for-you.com/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" border="0" alt="lachen"></p>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><br> <span style="font-size: small; line-height: 150%;">I have compiled some 
                  of my recent posts (slightly edited) on Self-Knowledge based on my 
                  recent insights and experiences into a .docx file for keeping but later 
                  also shared it with others. I will continue to update this document. I 
                  would also like to thank my friend Michael Zaurov for helping me in the 
                  editing of this document.</span></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: small; line-height: 150%;">This
                   document contains journal entries of my insights and experiences. In 
                  short, I have progressed from the direct realization of I AMness, to the
                   refinement of the I AM insight through the four aspects: 1)</span><span style="color: black; font-size: small; line-height: 150%;"> the aspect of impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of luminosity,
                   3) the aspect of dissolving the need to re-confirm and abide in I 
                  AMness and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the aspect of
                   experiencing effortlessness, followed by the arising insights of 
                  non-duality, and then penetrating into the insight of Anatta, all within
                   a short year. Readers may be confused and surprised to see a sharp 
                  progression of my view and insights and great difference in content 
                  depending on the date the post/article is written, as they read through 
                  my writings in this document. In a way, my path is very similar to the 
                  path followed by Thusness - </span><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html"><span style="line-height: 150%;">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</span></a></span><span style="color: black; font-size: small; line-height: 150%;"> and everyone should read his article to have a better understanding of 
                  the progression of insight (however note that there is no fixed linear 
                  path of progression and each person may differ somewhat). However, I 
                  cannot say I have finished my path as of yet – my insights continue to 
                  be refined and by documenting them I hope there are useful pointers to 
                  all sincere practitioners out there. Feel free to discuss any related 
                  issues with me whether by e-mail or forum discussions.</span></div>

                   don’t just read blindly but investigate yourself to find out what is

                   intellectual pursuit. The investigation into the nature of experience 
                  must be undertaken very seriously with a deep desire to find out what 
                  exactly is the truth of your Being (not just going through the motions  
                  of reading them without contemplation), in order for there to be any 
                  success and results.</span></div>

              <p>I think got to emphasize (to the Readers) that realisation is more about discover the incorrect or wrong assumption AND not about discovering a new information or fact.</p>
              <p>For example, one cannot really say what is Non-duality. It is not even 'no-subject-object' division . We can only point out what existence has been assumed to be .. and thus break the assumption.. but we cannot define what it really is.</p>
              <p>Knowldege like Non-duality, emptiness cannot be grasped at, because they will immediately be defined (by the mind) and be turned into another concept for grasping.</p>
              <p>The tendency of the mind is to always find some reference point and unconsciously define it. 'What is' simply cannot be defined, but can only be known by 'what it is not.'</p>

              <p>Nicely said... thanks. :) Ultimately there is no 'non-duality' or 'emptiness'... non-duality and emptiness are merely pointers to break the false assumptions we have about reality... but even 'non duality', 'no self', 'emptiness' cannot be established. As they said, even emptiness is empty!</p>

              <p><em>There are 
                  different types of contemplation being discussed in the book itself.

                  experienced in I AM can then be seen as being no different than the 
                  arising manifestation - non-dual, no subject-object dichotomy.</em> <em><br><br> The method that led me to the insight of Anatta was the contemplation on Bahiya Sutta, which I also mentioned in that e-book. </em> <em><a class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html">http://awakeningtore...hiya-sutta.html</a><br><br> Other than the method, having 'right view' is also important for subtler insights like Anatta and Emptiness to arise. </em></p>
