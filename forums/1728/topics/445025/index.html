              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"></div>
              Excerpt:<br> <br>
              <div class="MsoNormal">In our practice we just sit with our bodies and minds in the
              zendo, and we aim to practice the Buddha Way in our activities outside the
              zendo as well. In practicing the Buddha Way there is no separation between the
              self that is studying the self and the self that is studied by the self; self
              is studying the self, and the act of studying is also the self. There is no
              such thing as a self that is separate from our activity. Dogen Zenji defined
              this self as jijuyu-zanmai, a term that Sawaki Kodo Roshi described as “self
              ‘selfing’ the self.'”</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">To illustrate this point we can think of the relationship
              between a runner and the act of running. When we think of this, we realize that
              no runner is separate from the act of running; a runner and running are the
              same thing. if the runner becomes separate from running, then the runner is not
              running. If this is the case, the runner can no longer be called a runner since
              a runner is defined as “one who runs.” The great ancient Indian master
              Nagarjuna presented this example as part of his illustration of emptiness and
              the negation of a fixed, permanent, fundamental essence that “owns” the body
              and mind.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">Running as well as sitting, eating, drinking, and breathing
              are very ordinary things. But when we say, “There is no ‘I’ other than running”
              or “running without a runner,” we think we are discussing something mysterious.
              but this view of the teachings of people such as Nagarjuna or Dogen is
              mistaken. These teachers are trying to express a very ordinary thing in a truly
              realistic way without fabrication. To do this they use words that negate
              themselves in a way that reveals the reality beyond our thoughts.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">When we practice the Buddha Way, there is no self, no Buddha
              Way, no others. This is because self, Buddha Way, and others work together as
              one. What we call “our actions” are actually the work done by both self and
              other beings and objects. For example, when a person drives a car, the person
              thinks “he” as subject drives “the car” as object. But in reality we cannot
              drive without the car; we can only become a driver or be driven with the aid of
              the car, and the car can only express its full function as a vehicle of
              transportation when someone drives it. Our cars affect us both psychologically
              and materially as well. We will drive different cars in different ways, for
              example, depending upon the style or quality of the car. The feelings and
              attitude of a person driving a cheap old truck carrying a load of junk will
              likely be totally different from the feelings and attitude that person will
              have driving a luxurious new car carrying a VIP. A car can also provide us with
              the ability to travel quickly and conveniently, yet if it breaks down, we may
              have to make more effort than usual to get where we need to go repair, fuel,
              and insurance costs can exert an added financial stress on our lives and can
              even feel burdensome. So in a sense the car own us and shapes us as much as we
              own and control it, and the action of driving can actually be manifested only
              by a person and a car working together. This reality of mutual influence and
              interconnectedness is true not only for a “special” practice done by a group of
              people called “Buddhists”; in truth this is the way all beings are working
              within the circle of interdependent origination.</div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal">The Buddha Way includes both self and objects. The Buddha
              Way includes both people sitting and the sitting they do. They are actually one
              thing. This is very difficult to explain, yet it is an obvious reality of our
              lives. This reality is not some special state or condition that is only accomplished
              by so-called “enlightened” people. Even when we don’t realize it, self, action,
              and object are working together as one reality, so we don’t need to train
              ourselves to make them into one thing in our minds. If self, action, and object
              were really three separate things, they could not become one. The truth is that
              they are always one reality, regardless of what we do or think.</div>

              <p>Forgot to mention... the above is a very good description of the Maha insight and experience.</p>
              <p>Had an interesting meeting with Thusness a couple of days ago, and he brought up a point which accords with my own understanding and experience as well.<br>There are two insights and experiences pertaining to anatta, dependent origination and emptiness - the Maha experience (integrating anatta with dependent origination) described above, which Zen and Zen Master Dogen emphasizes, and the 'dependently originated is empty of a locatable core and thus illusory, dream-like' which Mahamudra and Dzogchen emphasizes.</p>
              <p><br>We should integrate these two insights, then we will understand these two traditions. A  pure Zennist may not understand Mahamudra, and Mahamudra person may not understand a Zennist because their emphasis and practice is different. Thusness also emphasized to me not to confuse these two distinct realization and experience, don’t mix them up. It is important to have clarity about them. He said he had the Maha sort of experience for about a decade, but the ‘empty, illusory and thus self-liberating’ nature only becameclear to him after he started reading Mahamudra texts in 2008. However it should be understood that it does not mean one insight is less valuable than another, therefore we should integrate them.<br>In two SMSes I wrote to Thusness:</p>
              <p><br>“I am at the KMSPKS library. Their library is very big, all kinds of dharma books, awesome place. I meditated there also, haha. I realized even the thought to remove defilements is delusional since defilements are also empty. The mere recognition of appearance-emptiness liberates all trace of clinging.”</p>
              <p><br>“I used to sit meditation with a goal and direction. Now, sitting itself is enlightenment. Sitting is just sitting. Sitting is just the activity of sitting, air con humming, breathing. Walking itself is enlightenment. Practice is not done for enlightenment but all activity is itself the perfect expression of enlightenment/buddha-nature. There is nowhere to go. Defilements can arise due to latent tendencies but without a slightest delusion of a true existent whatsoever, there is no clinging at anything. So, there is no trace.”</p>
              <p><br>Thusness replied, “This is Dogen’s state and the essence of Zen, but it is different from what you previously SMS-ed me. They are of different insights.”</p>
