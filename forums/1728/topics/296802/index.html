            <div class='col-md body'>What is the origin of the moktak?<br><br>Zen Master: "Mok" means wood; "tak" means hit. But the original word is "mok o." The Japanese call it "mokugyo." "Moku" means wood, "gyo" means fish; this instrument is shaped like a fish with its mouth open.<br><br>There is a story about the origin of this instrument. A long time ago, in China, there was a monk called Chung San Poep Sa. He lived near a big city and a big lake. One day a high government official came to the lake with his family for a picnic. They had a small baby, only a few months old. By chance, when they were on the boat, the baby fell overboard. The official engaged local fishermen to swim into the waters and find the body of his baby, but they couldn't find the body. So he went to Chung San Poep Sa and said he would like to do a ceremony for his dead baby, but could not find the body. Chung San Poep Sa went into deep meditation and perceived what had happened. He told the government official they must go to the fish market very early the next morning and buy some fish. So they went to the fish market and Chung San Poep Sa selected a very big fish. They cut open the stomach and found the baby inside. To the surprise of the family, the baby was still alive. They were all very happy. Then the official wanted to help all fish for saving the life of his baby. So this moktak is shaped like a fish, with an open mouth and a hollow stomach. When you hit the moktak, a good sound appears. The meaning of the moktak sound is that the baby is still here; all fish can hear the sound and get enlightenment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the meaning of the morning bell chant? Please explain some of the lines.<br><br>Zen Master: The morning bell chant comes from the Avatamsaka Sutra. This sutra talks about the interdependence of all beings. So all animals, birds, human beings, demons, and beings in hell hear the sound of the bell, wake up, get enlightenment, and become Buddha. So, this sound penetrates all six realms of existence - heaven, astral, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts, hell - and takes away your ignorance; wisdom grows up, you get enlightenment, and save all beings. Together, we all become Buddha.<br><br>There is a line in the chant that says, "Everywhere everything is equal." This means in universal nature, everything is equal; there is no form, no name. So at the time when you just hear the sound of the bell, universal nature appears, name and form disappear, and everything becomes equal.<br><br>Another line says, "Together you and I simultaneously attain the way of the Buddha." This means we are all equal - all animals, all birds, and all human beings are all equal - and all attain enlightenment at the same time through hearing the sound of the bell. When you hear the sound of the bell, it means you wake up; wake up means going beyond time and space. Time and space are a hindrance caused by thinking; so hearing the sound of the bell makes this thinking disappear, makes time and space disappear, and all become Buddha at the same time.<br><br>At another point, it talks about "great love, great sadness, our great teacher." Great love is substance, and great sadness is compassion. If other people are suffering, I am sad and compassionate. If everyone is happy, I am happy. "Our great teacher" means we are connected to everything else in the universe, and everything is teaching us the lesson of great compassion and great love.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Great Dharani, which we chant, is a long mantra and has no translation. What is the origin of this dharani and what is its meaning?<br><br>Zen Master: In Buddha's lifetime, one monk broke the precepts and was very unhappy. So the Buddha taught him that karma comes from your mind; if mind disappears, karma also disappears. If you hold your mistake, your karma will never go away. Then the Buddha gave this monk the Great Dharani mantra in order to take away his holding and thinking mind.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people don't like any kind of form, especially chanting. How should we approach them?<br><br>Zen master: This is Western mind, always strong like and dislike. But there are many people who like chanting very much. Chanting means doing together action with other people; then this together action takes away your opinion, your condition, and your situation very easily. That's the teaching of chanting meditation. If people don't like Korean chanting, then maybe some time in the future we will chant everything in English. But remember that our school is not only in America, but also in Poland, Germany, Spain, and other parts of Europe. So if someone from America goes to Poland, it's the same form, same chanting; then you have the feeling of being part of a large international family. Then your mind becomes bigger and you are at one with the world; you "become world peace."<br><br>Could you talk a bit more about chanting as meditation?<br><br>Zen Master: Meditation means not-moving mind. As I said before, old style meditation means body sitting, but mind sitting is more important than body sitting. When you chant you first have one mind, not-moving mind; that's mind sitting, chanting samadhi. You keep chanting "Kwan Seum Bosal, Kwan Seum Bosal, Kwan Seum Bosal," then you perceive sound; that's clear mind. Clear mind is wake-up mind; wake-up mind is enlightenment. So in chanting, samadhi mind is the first step; this is one mind. The next step is perceive sound; this is clear mind, enlightenment. If you attach to samadhi, then you have a problem. That's a very important point.<br><br>ok i find what he had said above.. quite interesting..<br><br>Pls refer to this link: <a href="http://www.kwanumzen.com/primarypoint/v06n2-1989-fall-dssn-wearingakasacarryingtheworld.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwanumzen.com/primarypoint/v06n2-1989-fall-dssn-wearingakasacarryingtheworld.html</a><br><br>(AEN: link corrected)</div>
