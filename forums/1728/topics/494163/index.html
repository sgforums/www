              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">The Buddhist World lacks
              an effective mechanism to help save a Buddhist Nation in Danger</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Lankaweb June 1st, 2017 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> Colombo,
              Sri Lanka — The crisis facing the Buddhist world is neither a decline in
              religious conviction nor an apprehension that truth underpinned by rational
              argument and new scientific discoveries will one day overtake and outstrip the
              core teachings of its founder which is a perennial fear bordering on
              despondency that characterizes several other competing religions, but the lack
              of an effective institutional mechanism that can lend support when a Buddhist
              institution, Buddhist community or even a pre-dominant Buddhist nation is in
              danger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              see the lack of substantial networks of support driving threatened Buddhist
              nations or Buddhist communities into a sense of despair and hopelessness at
              times of an emergency. Traditional Buddhist countries such as Thailand,
              Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Laos are now under severe pressure to distance
              themselves from extending state patronage to Buddhism and erase their Buddhist
              country identity and embrace a secular identity with no such pressure being
              applied to countries in other parts of the world such as the Middle East or the
              Catholic belt of Europe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              a 2500 year old history that makes Buddhism one of the oldest religions in the
              world, a worldwide presence that makes it a global religion, and a way of life
              grounded in wisdom and compassion that attracts the envy of other
              civilizations, Buddhism still retains its biggest constraint i.e. lack of
              effective protections. It is a historical fact that Buddhism has lost more
              territory and space in Asia, its traditional homeland, in the last one thousand
              years than any other religion. It is also a hard fact that this process is on
              going with no sign of abatement and no effective measures developed to counter
              it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism’s
              biggest appeal of being an eternally passive, non – confrontational, peace
              loving religion that lacks a central place to direct its affairs in the
              international arena unlike in the case of say the Vatican (sovereign state
              enjoying both temporal and spiritual power) or the World Council of Churches (
              powerful and well – funded with influence reaching to four corners of the
              world) or the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (promoting Muslim solidarity
              in economic, social, and political affairs), has become Buddhism’s Achilles’
              heel. Its organizational bases are relatively powerless when compared to the
              aforesaid entities. For example, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)
              is the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations
              which has a membership of 57 states spread over four continents. The
              Organization is the collective voice of the Muslim world and committed to
              safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world. It has its headquarters
              in Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Rising Challenges to Buddhism</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              issue of rising challenges to Buddhism to the extent of undermining its very
              existence as the pre-dominant religion of a nation, hardly merits much
              attention in discussions of International Buddhist Organisations, International
              Buddhist Conferences, or among National Governments in countries with
              predominant Buddhist populations and corresponding state and constitutional
              obligations to protect and foster Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Traditional
              Buddhist countries now find themselves force fed with ideas that are foreign to
              Asia, that had been given birth primarily in a Western setting and related to
              the interplay of dynamics of European societies but are nevertheless required
              to be uncritically accepted and transplanted in Asian societies without due
              consideration being given to the social tensions that would be generated in
              transplanting such ideas. To de-link state patronage to Buddhism is one such
              pressure brought on by various religious interests that during the heyday of
              colonialism enjoyed exclusive patronage from colonial rulers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              solidarity that countries in Buddhist Asia showed towards each other in the
              distant past i.e. pre – colonial era, has greatly evaporated or become non –
              existent. The sense of kinship of being fellow travelers in a spiritual journey
              overarched by Buddhist precepts and bonded by common religious beliefs and
              foundations no longer act as a reference point to summon or render assistance
              even between Buddhist peoples based in neighbouring countries at times of need.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recent
              events, for example, attacks on Buddhist Temples in Bangladesh or the crisis in
              Myanmar hardly drew concerted attention or action in other Buddhist countries
              in the form of assisting our co – religionists facing an existential plight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Areas of growing concern</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1) Religious conversions</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Countries
              preserving Indian Civilizational religions e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism
              etc. are seen as soft and easy targets for manipulation and religious
              conversion of their people, and in turn replacement of centuries old
              traditional culture with new cultures subservient to foreign interests. The
              resulting change in religious demography brings pressure on the State to
              disassociate itself with Buddhist values that underpin the stability of the
              society, legal framework and moral direction of the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">2) Mass Media</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mainstream Mass Media in the English language in pre-dominant Buddhist
              countries which act as the window to the world hardly makes any contribution
              towards creating any Buddhist public opinion or provide a voice reflecting
              Buddhist concerns. Instead it acts as a group largely hostile to the creation
              of any such Buddhist opinion and thereby sacrificing the interests of the wider
              majority of the country’s people. One hardly reads newspaper editorials in
              support of a Buddhist cause. Instead Buddhists find themselves repeatedly fed
              with a regular and steady diet of lectures on ‘human rights’, ‘rule of law’
              ‘democracy’ non – violence’ ‘peace and reconciliation’ despite no such intransigence
              on their part at a major level.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              appears to be a calculated move to place Buddhists, metaphorically speaking, in
              the ‘dock’, make Buddhists feel guilty of alleged crimes or misconduct and then
              extract more and more concessions totally out of proportion to what Buddhists
              enjoy as a religious minority in non – Buddhist countries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">3) Status of Buddhism as an official
              religion</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Reciprocity
              is the norm that governs diplomacy or grant of religious concessions. Buddhism
              hardly enjoys official status as a religion in Europe or in the Middle East.
              Freedom of religion is honoured in the breach when it comes to acceptance of
              Buddhism as an official religion in these parts of the world. In Europe only
              Russia and Austria recognize Buddhism as an official religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">4) Hidden Agenda of ‘Secularism’</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              proponents of secularism in Sri Lanka like in India are those clearly bent on
              repudiating the civilisational ethos of this country. Their main objective is
              to marginalize Buddhism from the public – political and social – life. In the
              West we find that secularism had stood for rationalism, universalism and
              humanism. In Asia, secularism is being used as a smokescreen and a shield to
              push Indian civilizational religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism away from
              the centre stage and replace them with religions and ideologies that were
              introduced much later in time to these lands.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              pre-colonial Sri Lanka there was never any conflict between the State and
              organized religion. It is essentially a European phenomenon. What we are now
              faced with is an increasing challenge to an ancient, indigenous Buddhist
              civilisation which is gentle, accommodative and pacifist by later introduced
              religious cultures that have a track record of intolerance and violence and
              close association with colonialism and a self-declared objective of world
              conquest. They use the language of human rights and freedom of religion but
              their goals are very much political and predatory. They support the country’s
              adversaries in the international arena to engage in the game of finger –
              pointing, naming and shaming our leaders and people. It is also a battle for
              the moral conscience of Sri Lanka which our people and rulers have worked so
              hard relentlessly to keep over many centuries as an expression of our indigenous
              religious beliefs and outlook.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">League of Buddhist Nations</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During
              the last five hundred years or so, since the beginning of the western colonial
              era, the governance and steering of the world was very much in the hands of
              powerful western nations using their mono religio- cultural framework as terms
              of reference in policy making and implementation of policy. That era is now
              drawing to a close. Sino – Indic civilizations will take over from euro-centric
              civilizations. The question is not whether but when. The old world will give
              rise to a new world and revert to Asia its traditional leadership role of the
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is well – integrated and deep seated in both the Chinese and Indian cultures.
              To the Buddhists in Asia the challenge is to develop new structures and
              institutions that reflect current realities. It would be feasible for countries
              with pre-dominant Buddhist populations to consider developing closer ties with
              each other in the spheres of economic, cultural, and trade and investment. The
              Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) provides a role model for the
              Buddhist world to adopt and establish at summit level an equivalent body to
              give voice and make representations on behalf of the Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              heritage countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam,
              Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka among others should engage
              in increasing close cooperation in international affairs and regularly meet
              like the European Union or the OIC in the form of a League of Buddhist Nations.
              Sri Lanka as a traditional Buddhist country with the longest continuing
              Buddhist history in the world is eminently well qualified to take an initiative
              in this direction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist Television Channel on par with
              BBC, CNN and Al – Jazeera</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddhist voice is relatively speaking largely unheard in the international
              arena. Buddhist nations which are embattled or threatened by more powerful
              vested interests have to rely on International news agencies or foreign
              Television Channels such as BBC, CNN or Al – Jazeera which have different
              policy objectives and are largely unsympathetic or sometimes even prejudiced
              towards the Buddhist cause, to air their position. This is an unsatisfactory
              situation. The time has come for the Buddhist world to seriously consider the
              inauguration of a Buddhist Television Channel on par with the aforesaid major
              TV Channels.</span></p>
