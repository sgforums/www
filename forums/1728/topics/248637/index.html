Oh, Taro is a toy fox terrier.

I'm just sentimental lah, don't feel sad ok? Owners and their pets have karmic affinity, so we should take good care of them when they're with us, then when they die we would hv no regrets. We will meet again.<br>The same to all our loved ones or ppl we know, be good to them whenever we can, life is impermanent. The important thing is that when the time is up, we know we hv done our best, don't be distraught as we still hv things to do, to do good, and we can pass all merits to them.  Don't be sad, becos we will meet again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Death is a temporary end<br>of a temporary phenomenon ( life ).<br>Everyone dies, but no one is dead.<br><br>~ Buddhist Saying</span></div>

This need for possible deniability leads them to be irresponsible pet owners. If cat ownership is permitted ---<br><br>The Chairman: A clarification, Mr Siew, not a speech.<br><br>Mr Siew Kum Hong: Yes, Madam. I would like to clarify with the Parliamentary Secretary whether he agrees that if pet ownership is permitted, subject to sterilisation and the need to keep the cats within the flats, then many problems attributed to stray cats will be resolved.<br><br>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman: Madam, this issue of pet ownership, cats especially, in housing estates has been discussed several times. There are two groups effectively - one, the pet lovers who feel that it is okay for pets to be in housing estates. As long as they are sterilised, they will be able to manage and live among HDB dwellers. However, there is also the other group off HDB dwellers who are very particular about the nuisance created by pets of this kind.<br><br>The policy of HDB has been that we do not allow cats to be kept in HDB flats because cats are nomadic in nature and are difficult to be confined within the flat. They have also given rise to problems such as defecation, noise and shedding of fur, which will affect the living environment of our housing estates. Having said that, I think we continue to try to engage the pet lovers group to try to bring both parties together. I think what is important is a sense of appreciation of each other's side and to see if, at some point in time later, they will come to an agreed position.<br><br>As of now, I think we receive a<strong> significant number of complaints </strong>from HDB dwellers with regard to nuisance created by cats. Therefore, at this point in time, the position of the HDB remains the same - cats will not be allowed in HDB flats.</blockquote>Actually, according to the Cats Welfare Society, there has been 3000 signatures that petition for a change in HDB regulation but even that was dismissed...</div>

He lied there n appeared to be resting so I let him be as he was resting this way n half- slept throughout the last 2 days.<br><br>He was still resting there when I came out of my shower so I thought he must be very tired n left him there for a while. Then I checked on him 2 minutes later n he was breathing hard this time with his mouth slightly opened. I was thinking his time might be up so I quickly sat down beside him and started chanting the name of Buddha.<br><br>He wanted to get up 20 minutes later, this time gasping heavily. I asked him not to be afraid n asked where he wanted to go? Of cos he couldn't ans me... then I suddendly realised that he might want to lie down in his usual spot - his bed. So I gentlely picked his soft body up n carried him to his bed.<br>His breathing immediately slow down as I could see his chest rising up  n down from fast to slow, and then finally it rises no more.<br><br>You are a good boy, Taro; right to the end.<br><br>I hope I was  good enough as your friend too.<br><br>Sayonara, Taro.
