              Brahmin Supremacist</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Krishnan Venkatesh FEB 09,
              2017 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">How a Buddhist teaching on dismantling the superiority of the
              brahmin class can help us take on racism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              belief that a group of people can be born superior to all other groups has been
              around for a very long time, and even existed during the time of the Buddha.
              For 3,000 years, society in South Asia has been dominated by the caste system,
              according to which a person is born into one of four major castes (varna), or
              social stations: laborers, merchants, warriors, and brahmins. According to the
              earliest Hindu scriptures, brahmins—scholars and priests—were the highest caste
              and viewed as morally and spiritually superior to the others; indeed, they are
              called “brahmins” because according to one of the hymns of the Rg Veda, they
              were born from the mouth of Brahman [God].</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              the Pali Canon, the Buddha has many conversations with brahmins who, clearly
              provoked by his ideas of radical equality, routinely approached him to argue
              and learn. Late in the Middle Length Discourses, we meet a group of 500
              brahmins who live in the town of Savatthi, where the Buddha is staying at the
              time. When they hear that the Buddha has been teaching that all the castes are
              equally “pure,” they are outraged, and decide to send a smart young brahmin to
              go and debate him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              the following conversation between the Buddha and the proud brahmin Assalayana
              (after whom the Assalayana Sutta is named), the Buddha offers some ways to
              address the obdurate belief in superiority of caste, race, or any other birth
              group.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Master
              Gotama, the brahmins say, ‘Brahmins are the superior caste; any other caste is
              inferior. Only brahmins are the fair caste; any other caste is dark. Only
              brahmins are pure, not non-brahmins. Only brahmins are the sons and offspring
              of Brahma: born of his mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of
              Brahma.’ What does Master Gotama have to say with regard to that?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddha begins to dismantle Assalayana’s notions of superiority by noting that
              we all enter the world the same way:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But,
              Assalayana, the brahmins’ brahmin-women are plainly seen having their periods,
              becoming pregnant, giving birth, and nursing [their children]. And yet the
              brahmins, being born through the birth canal, say, “Brahmins are the superior
              caste . . .”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddha grounds this initial discussion in physical reality, as it is difficult
              to argue that people who give birth the same way are fundamentally different.
              Besides, how delightful is it that a creature who emerges from the nether end
              of its mother can entertain fantasies about its own transcendent superiority!
              We see from this exchange that the Buddha has a wry sense of humor as well as a
              comedian’s gift for drawing out the absurd.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddha then proceeds to ask questions that he already knows Assalayana’s
              answers to. First, whether a person is a brahmin, a warrior, a merchant, or a
              laborer, if he does bad things, can he expect to suffer bad consequences? And
              if he does good things, can he expect to be rewarded with good consequences?
              Surely, replies Assalayana. Good people are good people, and bad people are bad
              people, no matter what they come from, and all can be expected to suffer the
              appropriate consequences. Even a brahmin supremacist has to admit to knowing
              some brahmins who are terrible people and some farm laborers who are wise and
              noble.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Next,
              the Buddha asks whether brahmins, warriors, merchants, and workers have the
              same relationship to their bodies and to the physical world. When anybody from
              any caste goes down to the river to bathe, do they not all scrub their skin and
              then rinse with water? And when they start a fire using logs, kindling, and a
              lighter, do they not all produce fire and heat, and smoke that makes everyone
              cough? Using the same materials and techniques, every human being will produce
              the same fire; thus notions of caste superiority have no basis whatsoever in
              the physical nature of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At
              this point, in case Assalayana doesn’t believe that the laws of physics,
              chemistry, and biology have any bearing on the issue of ethical supremacy, the
              Buddha swerves back to the question of merit within the same caste. Between two
              brahmin brothers, is it possible for one to be worthier than the other—for
              example, the hard-working, respectful brother, versus the lazy, slanderous one?
              That is, when we’re dealing only with brahmins, it is clear that merit has
              nothing to do with birth; at least, we behave as if the more virtuous brother
              has deserved more respect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              his credit, at this point in the conversation Assalayana has already understood
              the weakness of his prejudices. The brahmin student Assalayana sat silent,
              abashed, his shoulders drooping, his head down, brooding, at a loss for words.
              He is too intelligent not to see that when he thinks about it, the supremacist
              posture turns out to be an embarrassment to the intelligence. The Buddha then
              delivers an amusing coup de grâce by retelling the legend of the ancient Hindu
              sage Devala the Dark’s challenge to seven arrogant brahmins:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              do you know, masters, if the mother who bore you went only with a brahmin, and
              not with a non-brahmin?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No,
              master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
              do you know if the mothers of the mother who bore you—back seven generations of
              mothers—went only with brahmins, and not with non-brahmins?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No,
              master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
              do you know if the father who sired you went only with a brahmin woman, and not
              with a non-brahmin woman?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No,
              master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And
              do you know if the fathers of the father who bore you—back seven generations of
              fathers—went only with brahmin women, and not with non-brahmin women?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No,
              master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              know next to nothing about the sexual behavior of our parents, let alone our
              ancestors; about some things there is just no knowing. If we do not know the
              circumstances of our conception and the conceptions of those who conceived us,
              we have no right to claim superiority because of birth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That
              being the case, do you know who you are? the Buddha asks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That
              being the case, master, we don’t know who we are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Assalayana
              has learned something, as have we: how a Buddha dispels an inveterate,
              vehemently held prejudice by calmly asking what it is based on. Throughout all
              of this, the Buddha has expressed no irritation, anger, or indignation. He is
              engaging with Assalayana on Assalayana’s own terms, using images and vocabulary
              from ordinary life. He treats Assalayana with respect, trusting his
              intelligence and knowing that the young man is smart enough to put two and two
              together for himself. If the Buddha had asked leading questions, Assalayana
              would have been put on the defensive and potentially found ways to argue back.
              Instead, the Buddha appears to be genuinely interested in what Assalayana will
              say, but he also knows what a reasonable response to the questions will be
              because the Buddha himself—having been born in the warrior caste—has thought
              them through.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Did
              the Assalayana Sutta shake the caste system to its foundations and transform
              Indian society? No. Even today, the matrimonial pages of South Asian newspapers
              will specify not only castes but sub-castes and sub-sub-castes, and fairness of
              complexion is still explicitly preferred.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              still, for today’s practitioners, this Buddhist sutta illustrates a tactic we
              might use against racist sentiment: it demonstrates a method of unraveling
              deep-rooted prejudice by asking questions that activate intelligent reflection.
              In these times in which racism is openly espoused both in-person and online,
              this persistent form of questioning might serve as one of the more trustworthy
              tools we can use against it.</span></p>
