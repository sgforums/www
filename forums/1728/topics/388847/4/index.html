              Scientific proof of rebirth is actually published in well known scientific journals, and the scientist would be delusional to reject it.
              
              In fact I don't think scientists would reject it unless they have some non-Buddhist religious dogmas they follow.
              
              Some scientists just don't care because they haven't read about the journals or aren't interested.
