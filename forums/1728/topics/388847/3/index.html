              <p><br>Is that what they called "Sum Sai Shu" in Cantonese?</p>
              <p>Accurate or not.</p>
              <p>One relative went to consult about "Sum Sai Shu" for her daughter and told that her daughter will marry a man whose family owns a goldsmith shop in this life.    But her daughter married a man from the army, family does not own any goldsmith shop.</p>

              <p><br>I hope it is like what you said, when we die, it is eternal nothingness but the problem is : it is not like that. I have some personal experiences, there is afterlife and I hate the fact that there is afterlife but cannot deny it.</p>

                  rebirth a

                  dictionary 
                        defines superstition as a belief which is not based on reason or 
                  fact but 
                        on an association of ideas, as in magic. If you can show me a 
                  careful study 
                        of the existence of devils written by a scientist I will concede 
                  that belief 
                        in devils is not superstition. But I have never heard of any 
                  research into 
                        devils; scientists simply wouldn’t bother to study such things, so
                   
                        I say there is no evidence for the existence of devils. But as we 
                  have just 
                        seen, there is evidence which seems to suggest that rebirth does 
                  take place. 
                        So if belief in rebirth is based on at least some facts, it cannot
                   be a 
                        superstition. </span></dd><dt><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><strong>You

                        when we die? </strong></span></strong></span></dt><dd> </dd><dd><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Not only is 
                        there scientific evidence to support Buddhist belief in rebirth, 
                  it is the 
                        only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it. There 
                  is not 
                        a scrap of evidence to prove the existence of heaven and of course
                   evidence 
                        of annihilation at death must be lacking. But during the last 30 
                  years parapsychologists 
                        have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of
                   their 
                        former lives. For example, in England, a 5 year old girl said she 
                  could 
                        remember her other mother and father and she talked vividly about 
                  what sounded 
                        like the events in the life of another person. Parapsychologists 
                  were called 
                        in and asked her hundreds of questions to which she gave answers. 
                  She spoke 
                        of living in a particular village, in what appeared to be Spain. 
                  She gave 
                        the name of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her 
                  neighbours’ 
                        names and details about her everyday life there. she also 
                  tearfully spoke 
                        of how she had been struck by a car and died of her injuries two 
                  days later. 
                        When these details were checked, they were found to be accurate. 
                  There was 
                        a village in Spain with the name the child had given. There was a 
                  house 
                        of the type she had described in the street she had named. What is
                   more, 
                        it was found that a 23 year old woman living in the house had been
                   killed 
                        in a car accident five years before.</span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Now how is 
                          it possible for a five year old living in England who had never 
                  been to 
                          Spain to know all these details? And of course, this is not the 
                  only case 
                          of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of 
                  Virginia’s 
                          Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this 
                  type in 
                          his books. He is an accredited scientist whose 25 year study of 
                  people 
                          who remember former lives is very strong evidence for the 
                  Buddhist teaching 
                          of rebirth. </span></p>

                        Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced into the
                   19th 
                        century British school system and who was the first scientist to 
                  defend 
                        Darwin’s theories, believed that reincarnation was a very 
                  plausible 
                        idea. In his famous book "Evolution and Ethics and other Essays", 
                        he says: </span>

                          doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical and
                   Buddhist 
                          speculation found, ready to hand, the means of constructing a 
                  plausible 
                          vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man....yet this plea of
                   justification 
                          is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty 
                  thinkers will 
                          reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine
                   of evolution 
                          itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of 
                  reality; 
                          and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy

                          differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or 
                  not. In 
                          1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and 
                  reported 
                          by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from
                   Deli) 
                          could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five 
                  hundred miles 
                          from Deli) which ended about a year before her 'second birth'. 
                  She gave 
                          the name of her husband and child and described her home and 
                  life history. 
                          The investigating commission brought her to her former 
                  relatives, who 
                          verified all her statements. Among the people of India 
                  reincarnations 
                          are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in 
                  this case 
                          was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and 
                  similar cases 
                          can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory of the 
                  indestructibility 
                          of memory". </span></p>

                  being 
                          in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message 
                  is given 
                          off by a sending apparatus working in a particular ways. But it 
                  must be 
                          remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message 
                  again when 
                          it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the

                  men and 
                          women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus for

                          and down-to-earth people like the American industrialist Henry 
                  Ford found 
                          the idea of rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted to the idea 
                  of rebirth 
                          because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea, 
                  rebirth gives 
                          you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"I adopted 
                          the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty six. Religion 
                  offered nothing 
                          to the point. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction.
                   Work 
                          is futile if we cannot utilise the experience we collect in one 
                  life in 
                          the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had 
                  found a universal 
                          plan I realised that there was a chance to work out my ideas. 
                  Time was 
                          no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the 
                  clock. 
                          Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or 
                  talent, 
                          but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are 
                  older souls 
                          than others, and so they know more. The discovery of 
                  Reincarnation put 
                          my mind at ease. If you preserve a record of this conversation, 
                  write 
                          it so that it puts men’s minds at ease. I would like to 
                  communicate 
                          to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">So the 
                  Buddhist 
                          teachings of rebirth does have some scientific evidence to 
                  support it. 
                          It is logically consistent and it goes a long way in answering 
                  questions 
                          what the theistic and the materialistic theories fail to . It is
                   also 
                          very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that 
                  gives you 
                          no second chance, no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have 
                  made in 
                          this life and no time to further develop the skills and 
                  abilities you 
                          have nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you 
                  fail to 
                          attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to

                          next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be 
                  able to 
                          correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to 
                  learn from 
                          your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or achieve in this 
                  life may 
                          well become possible in the next life. What a wonderful 
                  teaching! </span></p>

But it must be remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the receiver. So with our possible spirit-emanation. It would never think or feel unless again "embodied" in some way. our personalities are so based on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in any true sense personal without a body of sorts. I can think of something being given off which could bear the same relation to men and women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus for mind".</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am leaning towards this theory, and and "message" is not soul or spirit, but cling conciousness, with your characteristics, that is received by the pineal gland at birth and released at death. Sort of a "spark"  or first/last burst of energy release. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hauntings are also probably images or sensations of residual cling conciousness trapped by abnormal magnetic fields.</p>

              <p>Unlike other religion, Buddhism is not just about doing good deeds. It teaches you how to deal with and lesson sufferings in life. Most importantly, not to be reborn again in the 6 realm.</p>
