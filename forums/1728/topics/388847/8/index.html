              <p><br>Hi EN,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry to side track...I heard that when one die, his soul will leave his/her body.</p>
              <p>And he/she can see himself on the bed with children crying  etc...</p>
              <p>Then there will be some spirit (be it a evil or god) in a form of his/her relatives (or maybe his late father or mother), and not them, there will be others wanting to take his hand. He will be confused (due to his children crying) and see so many spirits (good and bad). If he do many good things in his life, the god will take his hand and bring him to another world.</p>
              <p>If he do many bad things, the evil will take his hand and bring him to hell.</p>
              <p>That is what I heard from old pple saying.</p>
              <p>How true is that?</p>
              <p>Thanks alot.</p>

              <p>Buddhists were told not to cry in front of the deceased as it will cause the deceased to have attachments or the deceased will have no peace (confused). If you really want to cry, go to one side, away from the deceased.</p>

              <p>to go further, the Buddha has taught that all conditioned phenomenon, like our bodies (the 5 aggregates), will one day, grow old and die. it is nature's way. knowing thus, one should not grieve or feel sad for the departed. the departed will then be reborn according to his/her karma and his/her last thought moment.</p>

              <p>there are no soul in Buddhism. the concept of anatta, or no self or soul, is alien to many religions. Buddhism is probably the first who teaches no self or soul.</p>

              <p>how would I know, I am not dead yet lol. it just happen so fast that you wouldnt even know it what was your last thought moment.</p>
              <p>if your last thought is wholesome, then good for you. if your last thought moment is bad or unwholesome, woe for you. thats why its better to be left alone to die, than have your family there crying and wailing in your presence cos you will surely cant bear to leave them. if you still miss them when you die, then most likely you will be reborn as a ghost cos of your strong attachment.</p>

              <p>Their crying can cause attachment to the deceased.</p>
              <p>If a person is too attached to family, posessions, and his old life, he may have difficulty being reborn.</p>
              <p>After the 49 day period of opportunity to reborn is over, if he is still not reborn due to his attachments, he will fall into the ghost realm who guards over his family, posessions, and so on. It is pitiful. That is why it is very important to let go when dying.</p>

              <p>This one is definitely a reincarnate of a well practiced yogi. He has been meditating without food, water, or rest for many years by now, which many people see as miraculous. (Discovery channel has also video recorded him for many many days even through the night, and it is true he did not even moved an inch from his meditation position) Some people thinks he is a Buddha, but he himself said he is only at the level of a teacher (lama) but is not a Buddha. He intends to stop meditating only at the 6th year.</p>

              <p>That is Taoist practice. I guess the family members are hoping that by doing so the deceased will have food to eat or have a good rebirth.</p>

              <p>That is not silly. Your father would be very touch if he knew you are chanting to shorten your life span for him. Your father was considered lucky enough to die of old age and have a filial daughter like you. Your chanting would not go to waste, it would help him in other ways.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, not many people die of old age. I have seen many are dying young.</p>

              <p>Pardon me but i don't think chanting will cancel 10 years of your life-span and transfer 10 years of life span to him. But chanting definitely has its own benefits and can help people. For example, after every chanting, you dedicate the merits to your father.</p>
              <p>I have heard of cases where people who had serious illness like cancer were cured when they sincerely chant Amitabha. I also heard of cases where people cured their cancer by practising meditation. There is a book by Mahasi Sayadaw - Dhamma therapy which recorded how their students cured their own illness by meditation.</p>
              <p>And of course if one is ill, one should seek treatment for their sickness through the normal proper way.</p>
