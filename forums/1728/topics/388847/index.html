              <p>Rebirth is just as important as anything in your life.</p>

              <p>This is a valid concern.</p>
              <p>However, if you are to study Buddhism and understand Buddhism thoroughly and practice it in your life, then the seeds of Buddhism will be deeply imprinted in your consciousness.</p>
              <p>In your next life, you will not be satisfied with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc. Even if you are born in a non-Buddhist family, you will eventually grow out of it due to dissatisfaction. When your karmic seeds ripen and you meet the dharma again, something immediately resonates with your consciousness. That is because of the seeds you have planted in your past life. It just makes sense to you and you will be naturally drawn to it.</p>
              <p>However, I think it is still best not to count on future life. Aim to attain enlightenment in this very life. We can never truly be sure of what is to come in the next life. Will we even be reborn as a human, let alone a Buddhist? It is actually a rare opportunity to be even reborn as a human, the chances of which the Buddha compared to a tortoise hitting a particular spot on the water surface once every 100 years, or the amount of sand in one's fingers compared to the rest of the beach.</p>

              <p>Even the highest states of mundane samadhi like the 8th jhana of neither perception nor non-perception is still a state of samsara.</p>
              <p>Samsara is any temporary states that are still not freed from the afflictions of ignorance, the mind's affliction, desires, clinging and attachment, and so on.</p>
              <p>The jhanas are very profound meditative states, but beings who mastered such states without attaining enlightenment will only at best gain rebirth as one of these meditation gods. They will still die eventually after millions or billions of years, and take birth again in another realm, possibly in the 3 lower realms if they have past bad karma. Therefore heaven is not safe and secure according to Buddhism. Nothing is secure because you eventually die and get reborn. They are still a realm of samsara, and samsara means the world of suffering. The world of cyclic existence and rebirth, which means one keeps cycling from one birth to another, from one plane/realm of existence to another, continuously and uninterruptedly, according to one's karma. And Buddhism aims to end all sufferings even in this very lifetime (and thus in the future lifetimes, since one cuts off the causes for uncontrolled rebirth).</p>
              <p>The 8 jhanas are made of 4 form jhanas and 4 formless jhanas. The first four jhanas have corresponding heavens where the Brahmas live in a world of forms. This is contrasted to the lower heavens, which is below the 8 jhanas heaven. The lower 6 heavens belong to the plane of sensual desires. In these 6 heavens, devas still have sex and enjoy other pleasures and enjoyment of their senses.</p>
              <p>In the 4 form brahma realm, those beings do not have sex, and do not enjoy pleasures of senses. Rather their bliss is of a subtle kind that is not born of sensual pleasures.</p>
              <p>For example the Buddha described the first level Jhana as follows:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><br>  “he enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure 
                              born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. 
                              He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with 
                              the rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. Just as if a skilled 
                              bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass 
                              basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water,
                               so that his ball of bath powder — saturated, moisture-laden, permeated 
                              within &amp; without — would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk 
                              permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of 
                              withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture 
                              &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>pleasure born from withdrawal.</strong></span>”</em></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: pleasure born from withdrawal. It is not a pleasure born from sensual experiences. But from detachment and absorption into a state of bliss that suffuses the whole body but is not born from sensual experiences, not from outer stimulus. This is actually a state that can be experienced in meditation and I also have some prior experience of this. This type of bliss is actually much more profound, subtle, beautiful and more powerful bliss than any kind of sensual bliss, including orgasm, drugs, etc. It does not derive from outside stimulus.</p>
              <p>Now, the 8 jhanas get subtler and subtler as you enter into higher states of jhanas, from the 1st, to the 2nd, to 3rd and so on.</p>
              <p>The first four jhanas are form jhanas, where beings in these 4 jhana planes still have attachment to corporeal form and body, even though they do not experience sensual desires. However in the 4 formless jhanas, it is totally formless, i.e. infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception. Such beings do not have a body or form, they do not have attachment to any forms, their only state of existence is this formless space, consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. It is a much subtler state of bliss and they can stay there for millions or billions of years until their karma and absorption runs its own course and they will again cycle through the various samsara realms.</p>
              <p>Now, attaining enlightenment is a different matter from attaining these subtler states of meditative absorption.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment concerns about insights into the nature of reality where one penetrates and realises the impermanent, empty, dissatisfactory, no-self, dependently originated nature of all experience. It is through these insights that one progressively breaks subtler and subtler clingings and attachment (known as the ten fetters) until eventually one becomes entirely free from the cycle of rebirth in samsara.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that there are two types of meditation: samatha meditation is one-pointedness, concentration meditation that leads to jhana experience but not liberation or enlightenment. There is also vipassana meditation which means investigating and being aware of the true nature of all sensations and experiences in our direct present sensate reality. This will lead to enlightenment and liberation. Some people practice samatha meditation first to build a strong concentration foundation for futher vipassana practice, while some people go straight into vipassana (insight meditation) from the beginning.</p>
              <p>In the Hinayana path, there are 4 stages of enlightenment, called the stream enterer, the once returner, the non returner, and the Arhant.</p>
              <p>The stream enterer had a sudden glimpse of Nirvana and had some experiential, but not full, realisation of no-self. He will as a result give up the 3 lower fetters of false views of personality-self, the clinging to useless rituals and superstitions, and any skeptical doubts about the triple gems (because he already has a direct experience of what is being spoken). A stream enterer is guaranteed to attain full liberation (Arhantship) in no more than 7 lifetimes even if he dies before he could complete his journey. He is also assured that he will no longer fall into the 3 lower realms of hell, ghosts and animals, and could only be reborn either in the human or the deva (heaven) realm.  However if he practices hard, he can ascend all the way to complete 
                      liberation in his very life before dying, so it is not necessary to wait for his next life.</p>
              <p>The non-returner, second stage, has a higher level of experience and realisation and as a result removed sensual craving and ill will, the next 2 fetters, to a high degree. However he has not completely removed those 2 fetters. As a result, he is guaranteed to attain full liberation either in the human realm or the deva realm in the next life, even if he dies before he could complete his journey.  However if he practices hard, he can ascend all the way to complete 
                      liberation in his very life before dying.</p>
              <p>The non-returner, third stage, has  has a higher level of experience and realisation and as a result has completely
                              removed sensual craving and ill will, the next 2 fetters. And because he has cut off all sensual clinging, and removed such a fetter, it implies that he has cut off the root cause of rebirth in the Sensual realm of existence, which is the realms before the jhana realm. However at this stage, the anagami has not cut off the 5 higher fetters, which include clinging to form and formless states of jhana. He has not cut off craving and clinging to corporeal form, and also attachment to jhanic states. That is why as a result, if he dies before he attains full Arhatship, he will be reborn in the 4th Jhana plane and attain Arhatship from there, even though he will no longer return to the sensual realm or the human realm.</p>
              <p>The Arhant, has basically cut off all of the 10 fetters and as a result has completely freed himself from being bound to the 3 states of existence, the sensual plane, the form jhana plane, and the formless jhana plane of samsaric rebirth.</p>
              <p> The ten fetters are in total:</p>
