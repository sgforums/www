              <p>And what do you mean by 'more than just intellectual texts'.
              What do you mean by experienced? Gaining powers?</p>
              <p>The only 'experience' that truly matters in Buddhism, is to
              realise one's true nature. That is the only experience worth
              having, and it is not an experience, but an experiential
              Recognition of what is already always the case. This recognition is
              nothing close to intellectual, it cannot be accessed by thinking
              about it.</p>
              <p>Anything else is a detour, a distraction, and leads away from
              enlightenment. Anything else is just more mundane, transient
              experiences that comes and goes, that becomes the cause of rebirth
              and sufferings if we are attracted to or attached to or identified
              with. That is why Buddhists must 'kill the Buddha when they see the
              Buddha'. All such visions and states are delusional and comes from
              maras and demons.</p>
              <p>Anyway do read this and contemplate on this to realise this in
              your experience: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html">Some Writings on Non-duality by Ken Wilber</a></p>
              <p>And honestly speaking, I find that most channeled information
              has very confused understanding about our true nature and does not
              even lead people in that direction (the only exception we've found
              so far being <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deepspring.org/">Aaron</a>, who is deceased and his last life was a
              15th century Thai meditation master, and clearly knows and
              experiences what he's talking about. most other
              channelers/channeled beings have very dualistic knowledge and
              clearly doesnt know their true nature). It goes right off course
              the path of enlightenment. These channeled information comes from
              spirits, but are these spirits enlightened? Definitely no (for most
              I've seen).</p>
              </div>

              <p>Yes, <a href="http://www.deepspring.org/home_page_links/Aaron%27s_biography_link.htm">Aaron</a> is the only Being who channel teachings that is very helpful and useful. For that  I am grateful. As a meditator and practitioner myself, I can deeply resonate with Aaron's word.</p>
              <p>Additionally, his channeled teachings also gave me added confidence in Buddhism. This is because the last life where he gain Enlightenment and become an Arhat was through following the Buddhist Path.  His last life was as a Meditation Master of the Theravada Tradition.</p>
              <p>BUT, do notice something here. He did not gain Enlightenment by listening to channelled messages. He gained Enlightenment by following a strict Buddhist Path of cultivation.</p>

              <p><br>Based on that premise, forever, one will have doubts and fear, and that will never reduce, no matter how much one learns. Then what have we truly learnt?</p>
              <p>When one is on the right track, things will feel just right, and at equilibrium, at balance. Knowing how to clear obstacles in your path will come naturally to you, as you'll just know what to do, from all that you've learnt. If fear and doubts still keep setting in, then one should probe further into the questions that truly bother him/her and seek the answers that can permanently resolve these doubts. If that can be achieved, the lesson can then finally be said to have been learnt.</p>

              <p>Usually these spirits come from many lifes ago.</p>
              <p>Many people encountered spirits who take revenge on them, not because they were evil while they were alive, but they offended them in a past life which they cannot remember now.</p>
              <p>And this has been the experience of many people, so I know it is definitely true. Even my dharma teacher has once encountered such spirits who look like a Tang dynasty warrior with a long sword trying to harm him because he used to be some warrior lifetimes ago and killed some people, but because of his level of practice and insight the ghost failed to harm him.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree with you. What you said was exactly what the monks told us. If one recites Amitabha, at one's deathbed, one sees Amitabha, Guanyin or Dashizhi or three coming, one can follow them. However, if one sees other Buddhas, we also have to respect them (regardless real or not) and tell them we cannot follow them because we only want to follow Amitabha, Guanyin or Dashizhi.</p>

              <p>ya. as they said ç¤¼æ•¬è¯¸ä½›ï¼Œ ç§°èµžå¦‚æ�¥ã€‚we can <em>First, Pay homage and respect to all Buddha’s</em> (including an ant is also a Buddha, Mara and all beings also have Buddhanature ). <em>Second, Praise all the Buddha’s tathagatagarbha.</em> Praise can only Praise the tathagatagarbha, the inner pureness or "goodness"; can't Praise mara or an ant etc that are not enlightened.</p>
              <p>there's a story in the record of purelanders achieving pureland, where this practix who practice very well, first saw Guanyin coming with a silver lotus "seat", but he refuse to go, thinking he should work harden to see Amitabha instead. Indeed, Amitabha arived with a GOLDen  lotus "seat".</p>
              <p>for me, i'd have go humbly with Guanyin. :) Guanyin is also good here.</p>

              not knowing what to do or where to go.</p>

              <p>When in Bardo, you can chant Amitabha Buddha and seek rebirth in pure land.</p>
              <p>If you know how to recognise your primordial essence or the Clear Light of Reality, your ever present awareness, just abide in that recognition and be liberated.</p>
              <p>You have to practice that in your life otherwise it is very difficult to do that when you're dead.</p>

                                      She<br> imitated Paltrül Rinpoche’s thick Golok accent, and said, “Don’t
                                      entertain<br> thoughts about what has passed, don’t anticipate or plan what will
                                      happen<br> in the future. Leave your present wakefulness unaltered, utterly

                                      What he<br> meant was, don’t sit and think about what has happened in the past,
                                      and<br> don’t speculate on what will appear in the future, or even a few

              <p>When I talk about Insight, I am saying the insight into the nature of mind and reality. Insight into your true primordial essence. Resting in meditation, my teacher saw a spirit in Tang dynasty costume taking a very long sword and slashed him. Because of his samadhi and wisdom, the slashing could not harm him, and after he rose out of meditation the only difference he could see is a bit of swelling on his neck, resembling the slash he got from the spirit.</p>
              <p>It also reminded me of Shariputra, resting in Vajra (diamond) Samadhi, could not be harmed by a powerful spirit trying to kill him.</p>

              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time <a name="sariputta">Ven.
                    Sariputta</a> and <a name="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallana</a> were staying in <a name="pigeon">Pigeon Cave</a>. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sariputta -- his head newly
                    shaven -- was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.</p>
              <p>It so happened that two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on
                    some business or other. They saw Ven. Sariputta -- his head newly shaven -- sitting in the
                    open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this
                    contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
              <p>When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good
                    friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great
                    power and great might."</p>
              <p>A second time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this
                    contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
              <p>A second time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good
                    friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great
                    power and great might."</p>
              <p>A third time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this
                    contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
              <p>A third time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good
                    friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great
                    power and great might."</p>
              <p>Then the first yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. Sariputta a blow on the
                    head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits
                    tall, or split a rocky crag. But right there the yakkha -- yelling, "I'm
                    burning!" -- fell into the Great Hell.</p>
              <p>Now, Ven. Moggallana -- with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human -- saw the
                    yakkha give Ven. Sariputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he went to Ven. Sariputta and,
                    on arrival, said to him, "I hope you are well, friend Sariputta. I hope you are
                    comfortable. I hope you are feeling no pain."</p>
              <p>"I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight
                    headache."</p>
              <p>"How amazing, friend Sariputta! How awesome! How great your power and might! Just
                    now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that blow that he might have
                    knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But all you
                    say is this: 'I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight
                    headache'!"</p>
              <p>"How amazing, friend Moggallana! How awesome! How great your power and might!
                    Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn't even see a dust devil!"</p>
              <p>The Blessed One -- with his divine ear, pure and surpassing the human -- heard those
                    two great beings speak in praise of one another in this way. Then, on realizing the
                    significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Whose mind is like rock,<br>     steady,<br>     unmoved,<br> dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br> unangered by things that spark anger:<br>     When one's mind is developed like this,<br>     from where can there come<br>     suffering &amp; stress?</p>

              <p><em>(1) The <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chikai Bardo</span></strong> (or hChi-kha Bar-do - a number of Tibetan letters are silent) or
                                      Intermediate period of the moment of death.   This includes the process of
                                      dying; and the dissolution of <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/cosmology/elements.html">the elements</a> (earth, water, fire, and air)
                                      that make up the physical body.   During this period one experiences the
                                      "Clear Light", one's own innate Buddha-nature.   This is therefore
                                      a very favourable moment for the attainment of Enlightenment and liberation
                                      from the wheel of rebirth.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, in lay man terms it means this:</p>
              <p>Usually in our ordinary lives, our attention is totally fixated and focused on our thoughts and feelings that we are totally identified with them. We think that we are just our thoughts and feelings, and we are totally attached to them.</p>
              <p>But at the time of death, the gross elements, the thoughts, feelings, everything that we usually experience dissolves. This is where we can discover we are not just mere thoughts and feelings. We discover we are more than just our body or our mind.</p>
              <p>In that moment, there is a gap of no-thing, but it is not nothing, it is actually an all-pervading, infinite Presence and Awareness... that is the innate fundamental essence of each being. At this point, if we recognise that this is what our true nature is, then we can abide in that recognition.</p>
              <p>Most people don't even notice it, because if they never practiced in their daily lives, this short moment or gap where the Clear Light of reality dawns, just pass by without them even noticing it, as they transition into the next phase of the bardo.</p>
              <p>However trained practitioners immediately recognise the Clear Light for what it is. In their daily lives, they do not get fixated on the finite thoughts and feelings, but are aware of/aware AS that infinite, sky-like, open spacious awareness where thoughts and feelings simply float by without being grasped on. The thoughts and feelings are not separate from Awareness but are actually itself the self-luminous expression of Awareness.</p>
              <p>If you can abide in that recognition even in daily lives, then in death, no problem.</p>
              <p>However, what I just described is just one aspect, the relative aspect of Mind. There are deeper aspects that I have not discussed here, for more info see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/07/happiness-karma-and-mind.html">Happiness, Karma and Mind</a> by Dalai Lama</p>

              <p>yes, they are all false because they take the form of a concept labeled as "religion".  human beings in this realm need all types of "forms" and "concepts" in order to feel comfortable with their experiences, to make things meaningful to them, this crave is the source of all sufferings</p>
              <p>the only thing that would liberate us from sufferings is to treat everything as just is, removed from reacting either positively or negatively to it. It is just is - they happen and unhappen due to circumstances falling into place at the right moment</p>
              <p>next time your stock price goes down, you celebrate it with the same degree as if it went up, only then you embark on the path of total liberation</p>
              <p>this life or next life? I smell fear and anxiety. another crave of the human weakness. does it matter if you dont validate it for yourself? </p>

              <p>That is what I heard from old pple saying.</p>

              <p><br>Larry, since you gave up for reason same as mine.   Just be open and give other religions a chance.      At least, I encounter so many more good buddhists than christians.   </p>
              <p>Christianity is worst of all not worser.   Basically the problem with it is it preaches grace and ignores good deeds to mankind.    So through grace they are saved and so not on good deeds they are saved.  Crap. That is why so many evil christians around. </p>

              <p>First of all: in Buddhism, there is no soul. There is only a stream of consciousness that is insubstantial, impermanent, everchanging, arising due to karmic and mental factors and conditions.</p>
              <p>In other words, there is no permanent Self -</p>
              <p>Thusness:</p>
              <p><em><br> Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now
                                                      Moment.<br> The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely
                                                      ceased<br> and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br> Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4,
                                                      Self5, Self6...etc<br> A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a
                                                      momentary Self.<br> Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic
                                                      and mental factors from moment to moment,<br> it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and
                                                      life and life but not a fixed entity.<br> When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The
                                                      True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light
                                                      (Itself)".</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next is: if your relative has already taken rebirth in Heaven, he or she will resemble nothing you recognise. He or she will not look like your old relative. Why? Because beings in heaven have very majestic and beautiful looks, far more beautiful than anything Earthly, far beyond your imaginations. All those who actually saw devas made the same statements. Those beings resemble nothing of earthly beauty. They are heavenly.</p>
              <p>So if you saw a relative that resembles what you saw in your earthly life, you can confirm that that is not a heavenly being. Heavenly beings don't look like human. Most likely, it is a ghost realm spirit projecting in the form of a relative. Do not follow them. It is likely as Master Chin Kung said, that they are spirits who are tricking you into following them because they want revenge.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to devas and heavenly beings, even if heavenly beings appear to you, in Buddhism we should not follow them. Because in Buddhism we do not aim to go the samsaric realm of heaven. Being reborn in heaven is still temporary, and subject to karma, death, rebirth. The enjoyment is temporary and one will still eventually suffer.</p>
              <p>Alternatively it could be that your relative have fallen into the ghost realm. One should avoid being reborn in that realm, which is one of the three lower realms of immense sufferings (along with hell and animal realm).</p>
              <p>It is far better to be reborn in Amitabha's pure land, or attain enlightenment and be liberated from the cycle of rebirth. It is in fact, better to be reborn as a human to continue one's path to enlightenment, than to be reborn as a deva in heaven because it is easy to be lost and forget about one's cultivation in heaven since it is too enjoyable.</p>

              <p>When you become enlightened to your true nature of reality, there is no more grasping, no more samsaric delusion. Everything self-liberates as it arises. When this is realised, then one does not need to rely on anything else, like chanting, nor does one need to wait for Amitabha to appear, since one is automatically liberated. One will no longer be deluded by and cling to anything. One realised there is no self and no dharmas (all phenomena are empty) and no longer attaches to anything. But before that, if there is any attachment at all, it will surely be the cause of rebirth. In such cases, chanting is important, and guidance is helpful, and one can rely on the power and vows of Amitabha and aspire for rebirth in pure land.</p>
              <p>Regarding liberation, as Dudjom Rinpoche says,</p>
              <p><em> If I put my finger on the concise essential meaning,
                                      it is this: in the gap between the last thought’s cessation and the
                                      next’s arising, isn’t there a fresh, present knowing, that has not been
                                      modified even in the slightest—luminous, naked awareness? That itself
                                      is awareness’ abiding state! </em></p>
              <p><em>But one does not permanently abide within the nature of reality.
                                      Doesn’t a thought suddenly arise? That is the natural display of
                                      awareness. However, if you do not recognize thoughts as soon as they
                                      arise, they will naturally spread. This is called “the chain of
                                      delusion,” the root of samsara. Mere recognition of thoughts as they
                                      arise breaks their flow. Release thoughts within that recognition. When
                                      you remain in that state, arising thoughts will all be liberated
                                      equally within awareness, the expanse of dharmakaya. This is the main
                                      practice in which the view and meditation of Cutting Through Solidity, </em><em>Trekchö, are cultivated as one. </em></p>
