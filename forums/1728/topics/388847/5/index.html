              <p>there is also absolutely no evidence that the body has some form

              by the chemicals in the mind. There is no such thing as a spirit in
              the body. It is just man's answer as to where the person will go

              <p>The general trend of decline in Buddhism, predicted by the Buddha to last from 500 years to 5000 years depending on the morality of the humans.</p>
              <p>We might become human in our next life, but might not meet the Dhamma due to the following reasons;</p>
              <p>1. being born into a different religion</p>
              <p>2. being born far away from practicing buddhists (bhikkhus and lay buddhists)</p>
              <p>3. being born at the time when the Dhamma has disappeared</p>
              <p>4. being born with incomplete faculties (blind, deaf, etc)</p>

              <p>Hi, it is certainly not the case that Buddhism is the same as all other religions. Only Buddhism leads to liberation and enlightenment. Other religions only teach good and becoming reborn in better worldly states of existence, but are still part of samsara and still have not broken out of the cycle of suffering and rebirth.</p>
              <p>As Daniel Ingram said:</p>
              <p><em>While I can see arguments for all religions sharing the same goal in
              some broad, fundamental, abstract sense, functionally, practically and
              in terms of how the wide range of followers interpret and practice and
              strive in those religions, the answer is a clear "no". The primitive
              Baptists that live near me are not striving for enlightenment, strong
              jhanic abilities, or even the same morals I did. I am not striving for
              my own planet like I hear some Mormons are. At no time have I worshiped
              my ancestors so they will intervene for me. The list goes on and on.</em></p>

              <p>Why worries about your reborn, live your current life well, be
                                              sincere and honest. Leave the rest to the Gods.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>No, gods cannot control your karma. Your karma is entirely your own making. Even gods themselves cannot escape the law of karma, and gods themselves born and die and reborn according to their karma.</p>
              <p>Only enlightened beings become liberated from the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth, but even they cannot interfere or control other people's karma. They can only advice and teach. It's up to us to practice what they teach, to cease bad karma, perform all that is good, and most importantly to attain enlightenment and be liberated from the cycle of samsara. And even higher than that, is to not stop at one's own enlightenment and liberation, but to give rise to great compassion to help all other sentient beings attain enlightenment and liberation, which is to enter the path of Bodhisattva and Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>Also, some amount of worrying about the afterlife is important for a beginner. For example, a murderer, thief, etc, better start reflecting on their actions and their circumstance in their afterlife: rebirth in the lower realms of hell, hungry ghost, and animal. If they continue creating bad karma for themselves, that is certainly where they will land in. If you tell these people "why worry about future, just live your lives as it is", that is deluding them because it is a fact that they will suffer tremendously in their after life and that is what they must be aware of.</p>
              <p>As I was saying earlier on: if I apply the logic of 'why bother about the future', then applying this logic, you will start telling hardworking students 'why bother about your career, just be good boys and girls and enjoy life'. Just doesn't make sense, you will surely not advice recklessly in this way or discourage them from pursuing their academic or career goals. Similarly, when you want to plan for your future, you must be far sighted, career and immediate life is just short range even though not unimportant, but what is even more important is your lifetimes to follow.</p>
              <p>Of course, even that is still low level Buddhism, because the goal of Buddhism is not just to stop creating bad karma (although important) but more important to attain enlightenment and liberation from all sufferings and the cycle of samsara.</p>
              <p>But being concerned about one's afterlife is already one step higher than the narrow concerns of most human beings, which is only on the betterment of their current life.</p>
              <p><strong>It should be noted that the narrow worldly concerns focused to improve this present life is not even considered level 1 of Buddhism, it is not even at the doorstep of Buddhism, it is non-Buddhism.</strong></p>
              <p>That is why there are different levels of aspiration to enter Buddhism:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong>Worldly scope</strong> is taking refuge to improve this life (not Buddhist) </li>
              <li> <strong>Lowest Buddhist scope</strong> is taking refuge to gain high rebirth and avoid the low realms </li>
              <li> <strong>Middle Buddhist scope</strong> is taking refuge to achieve  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Nirvana.htm">Nirvana</a> </li>
              <li> <strong>High Buddhist scope</strong> is taking refuge to become a Buddha </li>
              <li> <strong>Highest Buddhist scope</strong> is also sometimes included, which is taking refuge to achieve Buddhahood in this life (using Buddhist  <a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Tantra.htm">Tantra</a> techniques) </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore as Loppon Namdrol said:</p>
              <p><strong><em><br> Whoever is attached to a result for this life, is not a Dharma
                                                      person.<br> <br> The purpose of Dharma is liberation, not feeling better in this
                                                      life. The purpose of Dharma is not the cultivation of mundane
                                                      compassion, and so on.<br> <br> The purpose of Dharma is to control afflictions, then overcome
                                                      them, and finally, to attain a state of total omniscience and
                                                      freedom.</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, of course Buddhism will produce results in your life: the total end of suffering. But it is not through changing the worldly conditions of your life, rather, it is found in Nirvana, enlightenment, liberation, which can certainly be attained in our present life and many had, including even people in this forum.</p>

              <p>These beings and people are certainly worthy of utmost respect and reverence, though of course, they are not Gods because we don't worship them or take them as objects of refuge. Particularly if you are Buddhist, your only object of refuge is the triple gems: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Taking refuge however is also not 'worship', but that we rely and return to the triple gems to guide us to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>But I certainly agree that great people and men come from within us, and not necessarily far and distant away 'out there'.</p>

              <p>in times of wars...we can go to every temple or church to pray
              for help from brutal soldiers........but these "Gods" come from
              someone or people who save millions...it can happen to some once in
              their lifetime and they became wartime heroes....</p>
              <p>one good example is our wartime hero Lim Bo Seng...who knows
              what is to be done and risk himself against the japanese...he took
              over the role as a God to save people as best he could with very
              limited powers and resources but with great spirit and
              endurance....</p>
              <p>there are still many to list but i will not do here....</p>
              <p>So what is God? Is it a memory that is imprinted in our hearts
              so that we, in our human capacity, to continue his great works for
              all? </p>
              <p>God comes from one of us.</p>
