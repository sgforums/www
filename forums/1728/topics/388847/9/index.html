              <p>That is not silly. Your father would be very touch if he knew you are chanting to shorten your life span for him. Your father was considered lucky enough to die of old age and have a filial daughter like you. Your chanting would not go to waste, it would help him in other ways.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, not many people die of old age. I have seen many are dying young.</p>

              <p>if you believe in reincarnation, one will have many sets of parents over the course of lifetimes. Of course, one should treasure one's parents in whichever lifetime he/she is in. I can feel you love and miss your dad dearly.</p>
              <p>Instead of focusing on the lack of your dad's love, why not channel these feelings of yours to love for others around you who are still alive? Show your love and concern for others who are themselves lacking in care. With time, your personal strength and capacity for love will grow, and you'll find more meaning in your life.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, your dad's early departure could be the trigger point in your life to raise yourself to a higher level, and make a difference to more people in this life. Everyone of us has a role to play with relation to the lessons of the people around us, especially the key people around us.</p>

              <p>I disagree, from birth I know that all humans must die. Sooner or later our parents must leave us. However in this short time together, we can only be filial to our parents within our human limitations. Even if our parents leave us, their will still exist with us as we try and create a better world in our vision.</p>
