              sacred waters of Yamdrok Lake in Tibet shine a brilliant blue green that
              attracts pilgrims and tourists alike. But earlier this week the focus shifted
              from the turquoise waters to a semi-naked woman who was photographed by the
              lakeshore. Images of the scantily clad model were posted — and reposted — on
              Chinese social media earlier this week, catalyzing debate about whether the
              nude photo shoot constituted a cultural sin, akin to, say, images of undress in
              the heart of the Vatican. The lake is believed by locals to be a kind of female
              Buddhist guardian, and its waters are used to sanctify souls.</span></p>

              Chinese Communist Party, tweeted in English that the photographer “got 10 days’
              detention for taking photos of unclad female tourist at sacred Tibetan lake.”
              The website of Xinhua, China’s official news service, carried a similar report,
              with an article noting that the model was being accused of “conduct that did
              not respect Tibetan culture.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>But
              details about the model and the detention are murky: a journalist from the</span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Legal Evening News</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>, based in Beijing,
              reported that a local Public Security Bureau official denied on Thursday
              morning that any such punishment had been meted out to the photographer or
              anyone else involved. According to his social-media accounts, the photographer
              is a professional cameraman nicknamed Yu Feixiong who lives in Lhasa, the
              Tibetan capital. On his Weibo account, he said that he took the photos because
              the model wanted “to have some memory of this sacred land” while she was at an
              age that she considered her optimum (“The girl told me it’s her best age when
              she travels to Tibet … [Her] youth is leaving.”)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Calls
              to his cell-phone number trigger a recording that says “unable to connect.” Can
              Can, a professional model and Yu’s high school classmate, tells TIME: “I can’t
              contact him, either. He is always a kind and normal person. Before he moved to
              Tibet, he was based in Hangzhou. He’s atheist. It’s hard to say whether he’s
              right or wrong this time. I seldom see him taking other naked photos.”</span></p>

              Thursday afternoon, an official at the local public security bureau from
              Nagarze county, where Yamdrok Lake is located, told TIME: “We do not know
              anything.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>One
              of the first people to repost the images of the unknown model was Jiang Qiang,
              a tour-guide operator from the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu who leads
              trips to Tibet. Jiang, who is from China’s ethnic Han majority, says he has led
              tours to Yamdrok Lake many times before. “I was shocked when I saw the
              pictures,” he tells TIME. “Before every trip, I tell my clients to respect
              Tibetan culture. No spitting, no littering.” He adds that he never bothered to
              remind tourists to keep their clothes on “because it’s common knowledge.” Jiang
              thinks the photographer deserves some kind of reprimand. “Without punishment,
              some people don’t know right from wrong,” he says. “I am Han, but I think
              everybody should respect Tibetan culture.”</span></p>

              on April 11, Jiang’s post was reposted by a woman whose social-media account
              name is Youchum Dolkar, a Tibetan name. (Many of her previous posts are in
              Tibetan.) It was from her post that the controversial photos went viral in
              China. “Such an awesome photographer and an awesome model — it shows there is
              no bottom line for culture and morality,” she wrote in a critical note
              accompanying her repost of the offending images. In a brief online chat with
              TIME, she wrote: “I just want to protect culture. I just wish more people could
              respect Tibetan culture.”</span></p>

              if foreigners are periodically prohibited from visiting Tibet, local tourists
              have flocked to the high plateau. Last year, around 20 million tourists
              traveled to Tibet to breathe in the fresh air and explore Tibetan Buddhism,
              according to the local tourism-development committee. The vast majority of
              these travelers are ethnic Han. Yet some Tibetans complain that these visitors
              know little about the cultural and political tensions that have riven the roof
              of the world.</span></p>

              impact of local tourism on China’s most remote reaches has provoked controversy
              before. After hordes of Chinese tourists clambered up — and damaged — glaciers
              in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, provincial officials banned glacier
              tourism earlier this year. A previous plan to deploy tour boats on Yamdrok Lake
              was scuppered after local protests. Meanwhile, perceived<span> </span></span><a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/10/02/beijing-to-chinese-tourists-smarten-up/?iid=sr-link5"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0c97d2;'>bad behavior by Chinese tourists</span></a><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>overseas has prompted
              the occasional ban. One temple in Thailand, for instance, barred mainland
              Chinese tour groups outright, even though these tourists are a boon to the
              national economy. There’s little chance Yamdrok would be subject to such a
              prohibition. Official tourism revenue for Lhasa, some 200 km from Yamdrok, has
              tripled over the past five years, to $2.42 billion last year.</span></p>

                  Sadly, we must conform to conventionality. We dress up or dress down to conform.
                  Naked women in the Amazon jungles are called documentaries, watching modern women (and men) in nude borders porn and is suppose to invite the sense of discomfort and shame.
              I respect your free spiritedness, though.
