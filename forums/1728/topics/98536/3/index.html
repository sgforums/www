            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is more concerned of your mental developement and well-being rather than physical.<br><br>Of course, abiding by the 5 precepts, in addition to practicing the 10 Virtuous Deeds and Generiosity, you can be certain that your blessings are safeguarded and will only multiply.<br><br>In regards to the 6 realms and rebirth (reincarnation is in hinduism, rebirth is buddhism), I have posted about this...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">I do believe that the level of state of mind will result in bringing you to the real place. However, you will be surprised, that some Buddhists, especially those in the U.S which are real sceptics, do not really believe in Rebirth. I'm sure however, one day, they will come to the conclusion that rebirth is true...<br><br>Not only is rebirth true, many people going for deep meditation retreats come back with certain memories of the previous life. So more are monks and masters, who constantly cultivate, I'm sure many of them have memories of previous life too. Or... there are some kinda hypothesis that could bring memories from past life back to you... and those experiences are compiled into a book, but I can't remember which book it was. Also, we bring along from the past life, deep habitual thoughts... influencing the way we life now.<br><br>Interestingly, you all can read about this website... a list of very insteresting accounts of children who could remember their past life. <a href="http://www.childpastlives.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childpastlives.org/</a><br><a href="http://science.krishna.org/Articles/2002/10/025.html" rel="nofollow">http://science.krishna.org/Articles/2002/10/025.html</a> - Forensic Evidence of Reincarnation<br><a href="http://www.near-death.com/experiences/reincarnation01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.near-death.com/experiences/reincarnation01.html</a> - Dr Ian Stevensons, Reincarnation Research<br><a href="http://www.quangduc.com/English/science/15buddhismscience.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quangduc.com/English/science/15buddhismscience.html</a> -<br>Reincarnation is Now a Scientifically Acceptable Phenomenon<br><br>When someone is about to die, monks will always tell the person to calm down, and will say dharmas on impermanence and liberate them from their attachments, so that the person can die peacefully without sufferings. Why is this so? Because an unfocused, confused mind, will have all sorts of wandering thoughts appearing... these wandering thoughts will be influencing their rebirth. The Mind comes first.<br><br>Chanting "Namo Amitabha" has the same effect. When we chant "Namo Amitabha", and have faith in him, we do not pursue our worldly belongings, but set our targets to a much more wonderful Pure Land. This is how someone attains peace of mind through the Pure Land method..<br><br>Not only the dying one becomes much more peaceful, we also become much more peaceful. We wholeheartedly chant "Namo Amitabha", focused, so that wandering thoughts may not arise to bring one to Samsara. It also works the same way in life, and through the practice of chanting, one attains Samadhi*. But Samadhi is not ultimate, enlightenment is.<br><br>Oh yes... from the 31 existences, the top 8 existences are "Jhanic heavens", 4 in the formless state, 4 in the form state. What are <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/6774/jhanafac.htm" rel="nofollow">Jhanas</a>? Jhana is sort of like a mind state... Sorry I'm very bad at explaining this. Jhanas can be developed through meditation practices, there are 8 Jhanas altogether, and each jhana can result in one to reborn in differing jhanic heavens. But of course most people attain Jhanas not because of the future lives... in the Theravadin tradition, they practice Samantha meditation to achieve the Jhanas and from the 4th Jhana, achieve Arhatship (sainthood), Nirvana.<br><br>Buddha, before attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree, searched with effort for different practices, hoping that one of them could bring him his enlightenment. However, none of them could. The greatest, and the second greatest spiritual teacher, died before the enlightened Buddha could teach them any of the dharmas he realised. His greatest teacher attained rebirth in the realm of the 8th jhana, neither perception nor non-perception, while the second greatest teacher have already been reborned in the 7th Jhanic heaven. Note, these places are not like anything we could imagine, it exists probably only as a consciousness and a mind state, but there is no forms whatsoever. So from this story, we know that the mind leads one to be reborned, we know that Jhana is still not the ultimate. Nirvana is the ultimate...<br><br>Lastly, I agree this statement from a friend, who probably quoted from somewhere else but I do not know the source.<br><br>"Buddhism is not a religion even though it addresses issues like afterlife and reincarnation. There is no strong recognition in any spiritual beliefs. Buddhism can be regarded as a form of lifestyle or teaching."<br><br>* Samadhi: Concentrated, one-pointedly; gradually calmed until only the object is known<br></div></blockquote>Of course, there are lots of people, even many sceptical buddhists, who couldn't accept rebirth. I personally have seen many examples and happenings, some of which i would rather not speak here. There are even monks from a monastery in Japan who went to Taiwan to look for one of my dharma teacher... because they have seen that he was their master in prv life in the monastery. In fact they even had a picture of his previous life, and it looked almost alike. Of course, my Buddhist sect isn't Tibetan or Lama-style, where the same person, or someone else, will take over his role to continue the lineage. So, he rejected the offer to go back to Japan.</div>

There is a movie about reincarnation coming soon. I think the actress is Nicole Kidman and the title is Birth or something.<br><br>Anyway, reincarnation is part of Buddhism. It is part of life whether we believe it or not.<br><br>Tibetan lamas have a way to determine the rebirth of a high lama. These reincarnate lamas are called tulkus. Usually when the time is right, the lamas specifically in charge of looking for tulkus will recieve a sign, either by dreams or visions. They see the place of birth of the reincarnated lama.<br><br>They then search for the lama as seen thru the dreams or visions by divination or study of the geographical layout as seen by them. It is recorded that whenever a high lama is reborn, the place where they are born will have drums and music playing and rainbows will appear.<br><br>When the lamas find the tulku, they will go thru a series of tests to determine if he is really a tulku. They will place similar objects belong to the previous life in front of the child. The tulku will always pick the correct one. One stunning aspect is how these children behave even at the age of 2. They like to sit in lotus position and act like a lama even though they have nvr seen one. They know how to prostrate to Buddha statues and have an air of wisdom. It takes seeing to believe.<br><br>All these are not supernatural or luck. Just like God, who has seen him? Yet we believe His existence.</div>

The radio waves, which are not made up of words and music but energy at different frequencies, are transmitted, travel through space, are attracted to and picked up by the receiver from where they are broadcast as words and music. It is the same with the mind. At death, mental energy travels through space, is attracted to and picked up by the fertilized egg.

The radio waves, which are not made up of words and music but energy at different frequencies, are transmitted, travel through space, are attracted to and picked up by the receiver from where they are broadcast as words and music. It is the same with the mind. At death, mental energy travels through space, is attracted to and picked up by the fertilized egg. As the embryo grows, it centers itself in the brain from where it later "broadcasts" itself as the new personality.[/b]</blockquote>If this is the explanation, then I can believe this (since I mention I can believe in thought waves). However, this does also means that the conscience of self do not exist in the new form and hence is not really me. Of course, then the other article would talk about what is self and identity. But for me, since it has no recollection of the past, it is not me. And hence is not something I should worry about.</div>

"THE PERSISTENCE OF PROPHECY, THE REBIRTH OF ORACLES: A CELEBRATION OF THE END OF TIME"<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I camped for a week in a tiny tent with a small party of fellow Western monks. For two days prior to the initiation I noticed the famous Â“weather yogiÂ”, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje, walking in a wide circle around the precincts of initiation, blowing his human thighbone trumpet at the sky and reciting mantras. I knew he was famous for having the ability to stop rain or hailstorms, but I was surprised to see him working as it almost never rains in Ladakh.<br><br>On the morning of the opening ceremonies it rained steadily, exactly and only in the area that Ngakpa Rinpoche had patrolled, and all of us were thoroughly soaked, as there was no shelter. At the close of the ceremonies that day I approached Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and asked him what had gone wrong. I said, Â“I thought you were supposed to keep rain away; what happened? Did you recite something backwards?Â” He laughed, winked at me, then informed me that His Holiness the Dalai Lama had requested him to bring rain to test the resolve of all those who were attending the initiation.</span><br><br>Anyway, I've seen some Tibetan galleries where they post pictures of multiple rainbows after some kind of service.. initiation or something. Now I understand why  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
