              <p>Self-Release</p>
              <p>By 'self-release', I'm not talking about a 'self' that is experiencing 
                      its own 'release'. On a conventional level we can talk about that -- for
                       example, a Buddha or an arahant is one who experiences his own release.
                       But at the same time a Buddha or an arahant already realizes that there
                       is in fact no actually existing self behind anything. So what is 
                      release in that case? It is really just the release of clinging, of the 
                      sense of self, of mental afflictions (passion, aggression, delusion), 
                      and all thoughts, perceptions, experiences are released on the spot 
                      through lack of reification. Therefore it should be noted that 
                      'self-release' is used here in that sense, not in the sense that there 
                      is a 'you' becoming liberated.</p>
              <p>This 'release' is actually felt in
                       every cell of the body so to speak - for example, having walked 24km or
                       72km with a 20kg load on one's back and finally putting it down 
                      (perhaps only people who went through army like me knows how that feels 
                      but anyway...), what release! Just because there is no self doesn't deny
                       the experience of release (even though that too is empty), it just 
                      means there is no self who is experiencing or doing the release.</p>
              <p>Now, just like the example above, the Dharma as taught by the Buddha is 
                      meant for release, but in this case the release of the mind. In the 
                      MN30, the Culasaropama Sutta, The Buddha states: "So this holy life, 
                      brahmin, does not have gain, honour, and renown for its benefit, or the 
                      attainment of virtue for its benefit, or the attainment of concentration
                       for its benefit, or knowledge and vision for its benefit. But it is 
                      this unshakeable deliverance of mind that is the goal of this holy life,
                       it heartwood, and its end." Ven. Thanissaro translates 'deliverance of 
                      mind' as 'awareness-release'.</p>
              <p>The big question then is, how does mind releases?</p>
              <p>As a method of practice, many teachings/teachers teaches us to just let
                       thoughts and perceptions come and go without grasping them. As a 
                      practice that is OK -- but that is not the fundamental, definitive path 
                      of releasing thoughts and perceptions, and the sense of self. Usually, 
                      because of our strong dualistic tendencies, at the beginning it would be
                       impossible not to fall into a situation where we feel ourselves to be 
                      the perceiver of our thoughts, and so the practice here is still 
                      somewhat dissociative - there is someone who can watch thoughts come and
                       go or let go of thoughts or remain unaffected by them. When we become 
                      'aware' or 'mindful', we feel ourselves to be on the alert as the aware 
                      watcher. But all these are really just forms of clinging in disguise of 
                      letting go. There is dualistic action involved - either I try to 
                      dissociate or get rid of thoughts - which is a subtler form of dualistic
                       aggression appearing as 'letting go', or I grab onto them, which is a 
                      form of craving, or I remain as some unattached observer unaffected by 
                      thoughts or ignoring the comings and goings of thoughts, which is a form
                       of dualistic ignorance and is also by definition 'dissociation'.</p>
              <p>But it is ok for one's practice to be dualistic at first, because there
                       is no way we can be 'non-dual' at the beginning of our practice. 
                      Telling someone about emptiness and nondual at the beginning of one's 
                      path may help direct one towards wisdom at least on an intellectual 
                      level, but not so much experientially, because karmic propensities are 
                      strong. So at first we have no choice but to practice dualistically. No 
                      choice because our karmic propensities which manifest this dualistic 
                      situation is driven by afflictive dependencies and ignorance, and is not
                       a matter of free will - like anything really, everything manifests 
                      dependently and not through agency or control.</p>
              <p>However, although
                       one may practice mindfulness this way, if at the same time we have the 
                      right pointers and right view -- no-self, emptiness, D.O., and through 
                      one's own contemplations, eventually when the conditions ripen we will 
                      experience a breakthrough into the definitive path of release. 
                      Otherwise, if we merely have a practice but lack the right view, even 
                      when we awaken to a non-conceptual direct taste of Presence or 
                      Aware-clarity, it is often moulded into an Eternal Witness or an 
                      ultimate source and substratum expressing itself in all forms, which are
                       subtler forms of 'spiritual bondage' or sense of self, which is not the
                       definitive sort of awakening or liberation in Buddhadharma. This is why
                       in Buddhadharma, the Buddha says that Right View is the forerunner of 
                      the noble eightfold path, it is in some ways even more important than 
                      all the other practices.</p>
              <p>The definitive path of release starts with the realization that a seer, perceiver, controller or even a seeing, awareness etc has never existed as a self residing as the background of perception. Then one sees the true face of awareness has always been just manifestation empty of being some hidden unmanifest hidden ghostly unchanging independent self existing in and of itself, that in seeing theres just the seen without seer, there is no consciousness or seeing besides manifestation, perception naturally reveals itself in a nondual, self-luminous, direct fashion via the release of a center/agent vantagepoint. The imputation of a self or subject or inherent awareness dissolves into direct taste of transient manifestation. One can have peak experiences of no mind even before realization of anatta as an always already so dharma seal, but it will not be effortless and perpetual until after realization. Practice turns from dissociation with thoughts and perception to endless opening and letting sound/sight/etc 'kill you', and this is bliss.</p>
              <p>Then after anatta we look at the 
                      thought itself or sensation or sound and realize that like a reflection 
                      that dependently originates in fact never arose, never came into 
                      existence. Then presence/reflection is experienced as illusory uncreated
                       and deathless via its lack of inherency. Then thought self releases as 
                      there is no chaining and no identity that succeeds from moment to 
                      moment. Everything self liberates from tasting all phenomena as unborn.</p>
              <p>As I paraphrased Thusness many years ago, “On the most direct path, 
                      there is no one to let go and no-thing to be let go of and hence no 'how
                       to let go'. Reality is 'letting go' at all moments. There is only what 
                      arises and subsides (self-liberates) every moment according to 
                      conditions, luminous-empty phenomena roll on with no one at the center 
                      that can seek nor distant himself (since there is no 'self') from the 
                      self-knowing transience.” This direct path of self-release via 
                      non-action is only suitable for those actualizing twofold emptiness in 
                      all perceptions, otherwise it becomes the path of self-deluded slackers 
                      wallowing in deluded thoughts thinking it is liberation, the worst 
                      possible path. This is where Longchenpa warned, “In Ati these days, 
                      conceited elephants [claim] the mass of discursive concepts is awakened 
                      mind (bodhicitta); this confusion is a dimension of complete darkness, a
                       hindrance to the meaning of the natural great perfection.”</p>
              <p>But 
                      the key to release is not via resting in a state of clarity. Nor is it 
                      by subsuming object into subject or subject into object, one may 
                      experience non-division of subject and object in this way but it is not 
                      the same as releasing the reification of inherency of subject and 
                      inherency of object through emptiness and non-subsuming. Therefore when 
                      we talk about the non-duality of subject and object, we should be 
                      mindful that there is a difference between non-division and noninherency
                       of those poles, they are different insights and have different impacts 
                      in one's experience.</p>
              <p>Clarity/manifestation self liberates through
                       discerning empty nature otherwise one resorts to dissociation and 
                      attempting to abide in a deemed purest state due to view of inherency. 
                      Worse still some book I read mistook self liberation as residing as an 
                      unaffected background of awareness while waves of thoughts arise and 
                      subside back to the sea. That is bondage in disguise of liberation. In 
                      truth anatta liberates background (releases the sense of a self residing
                       as the background of experience) and twofold emptiness liberates 
                      foreground (even our non-conceptual pure sensory experiences, and all 
                      other experiences). Otherwise what liberation is there?</p>
              <p>Actually 
                      this is really just a beginning. And I have merely summarized very 
                      shortly what is actually much more subtle. When we say "emptiness that 
                      releases"... we should not just limit our application of emptiness just 
                      to self, or to a particular aspect of phenomena.</p>
              <p>For example, we
                       can apply emptiness even in economics. As Thusness just wrote, "Money 
                      is dependent on its parts -- coins and paper and in the broader 
                      definition of money, visas and cheques.</p>
              <p>Money is dependent on relations when extending beyond national boundaries in exchanges rates and interest rates.</p>
              <p>Money is dependent on time, the time value of money.</p>
              <p>Money is dependent on its functionality as medium of exchange, purge of
                       this functionality; it is just paper can serve as a “pretty paper 
                      boat”.<br> Therefore money is empty!"</p>

              <p>Well written and clear.</p>
              <p>According to the Pali Canon, the practice of samadhi (concentration) has benefits. One of these is mindfulness and clear comprehension (sati sampajanna). That is merely seeing the arising and passing of phenomena (sankharas). This still leaves a sense of "I am" conceit or the witness/knower. But there is cannot be a subject without an object. They arise and ceased together. Without perception of impermanence, this cannot be seen.</p>
              <p>The proper release comes from seeing causality (dependent coarising). The term used is - "such is ...."</p>
              <p>That is what Ven. Khemaka did to remove conceit I am.</p>

It is really just the experience itself dawning in its

                                      self-revealed, self-aware, by being itself. The eye of wisdom knows 
                                      impermanence by being-realizing impermanence, it is not a separate

Anything else is nothing direct, it cannot be called a realization. For example, 'noting' things as impermanent is not direct realization -- as there is still a sense of standing back and acknowledging things are impermanence.<br><br>When we realize anatta, even at the level of stream entry, there is no more view of a witness/knower. Why? Because the sense of a Subject, witness, knower lies with a view of self.<br><br>As I wrote in http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/10/anatta-not-self-or-no-self.html<br></span></span></span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span><span><br> <span style="font-size: small;">This is the false View no. 4 described 
                                      in Sabbasava Sutta: "...As he attends inappropriately in this way, one 
                                      of six kinds of view arises in him: The view <em>I have a self</em> arises in him as true &amp; established, or the view <em>I have no self</em>... or the view <em>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</em>... or the view <strong><em>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</em>...</strong> or the view <em>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</em> arises in him as true &amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <em>This
                                        very self of mine — the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to  
                                      the ripening of good &amp; bad actions — is the self of mine that is  
                                      constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay  
                                      just as it is for eternity.</em> This is called a thicket of views, a  
                                      wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a  
                                      fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed  
                                      run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, &amp; death, from
                                        sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He is not freed, I
                                        tell you, from suffering &amp; stress." - the commentary of 'Middle  
                                      Length Discourses' book explains, <em>"of these six views, the first two 
                                       represent the simple antinomy of eternalism and annihilationism; the  
                                      view that ‘no self exists for me’ is not the non-self doctrine of the  
                                      Buddha, but the materialist view that identifies the individual with the
                                        body and thus holds that there is no personal continuity beyond death.
                                        The next three views may be understood to arise out of the  
                                      philosophically more sophisticated observation that experience has a  
                                      built-in reflexive structure that allows for self-consciousness, the  
                                      capacity of the mind to become cognizant of itself, its contents, and  
                                      the body with which it is inter-connected. Engaged in a search for his  
                                      'true nature,' the untaught ordinary person will identify self either  
                                      with both aspects of the experience (view 3),<strong> or with the observer alone  (view 4),</strong> or with the observed alone (view 5). The last  view is a  full-blown 
                                      version of eternalism in which all reservations have been  discarded."</em></span><br></span></span></span></span></span><br><br>So it is in fact, the sense of a background agent, Witness, Knower, that is the first to go in stream entry. The 'Witness/Knower' is not the last to go, it is a self-view that is terminated at stream entry. I can tell you from my experience that the sense of a Witness or Knower has been terminated for 4 years -- not a single moment have I felt for all these years that there is a Witness or Knower 'in here' or behind things that is seeing and controlling things, everything is just self-felt, self-seen, manifesting according to conditions on its own without agency or a someone inside my head looking outwards. Yet I do not see myself as an arahant, although a DhO community moderator has said that my experience is equivalent to arahantship in their terminology.<br><br>Unfortunately many people like Daniel Ingram sees realization of anatta as the end and disregard the fetter model -- I see it as just a beginning.<br><br>The remaining 'I am conceit' is not a kind of view, but any kind of remaining sense of ownership, possessiveness, attachments, identifications, cravings, attachments arising out of habitual karmic patterns. For example, one may no longer have any view that I am my body, or that I am consciousness, or that I am the 'witness', yet if someone is going to kill that person, fear may still arise due to karmic propensities due to a trace of possessiveness of the body. It is a kind of trace even though they have realized there is no self within or apart from the body in any forms including as a knower.</p>

Although after realization of anatta there is no longer the grasping at a "background I" or agency, it does not mean there is no grasping at other aspects like 'mine' or clinging to forms of thought patterns.<br><br>I remember Newbuddhist Richard said that his grasping is not so much about a transcendental Self but the pains he felt as a father caring for his son when his son got bullied etc.<br><br>As for me, although I have not faced such things yet (as I am not a father), I still think my anatta need to complement with shamatha and dispassion and letting go to overcome all thought patterns.

I am planning for my retirement.<br><br>I think after stabilizing non-dual experience and maturing the insight of anatta, practice must turn towards ‘self-releasing’ and ‘dispassion’ rather than intensifying ‘non-dual’ luminosity. Although being bare in attention or naked in awareness will help in dissolving the sense of ‘I’ and division, we must also look into dissolving the sense of ‘mine’. In my opinion, dissolving of the sense of ‘I’ does not equate to dissolving the sense of ‘mine’ and attachment to possessions can still be strong even after very stable non-dual experience. This is because the former realization only manages to eliminate the dualistic tendency while the latter requires us to embody and actualize the right view of ‘emptiness’. Very seldom do we realize it has a lot to do with our ‘view’ that we hold in our deep most consciousness. We must allow our luminous essence to meet differing conditions to realise the latent deep. All our body cells are imprinted and hardwired to ‘hold’. Not to under-estimate it.<br></p></div>

              <p> The subtle possessiveness is due to not seeing the true nature of sankharas (conditioned things). Ajahn Buddhadasa called us thieves because we take things that doesn't belong to anyone as ours. Without this sense of "I am", this cannot happen.</p>
