              <p> </p>
              <p>On the topic of Right View, it is said that one who realizes the nature of dharma is said to enter the stream, become a stream enterer, destined to attain Nirvana/Arhatship in no more than 7 lifetimes (or in this lifetime if he works hard for it). He will never again enter into the lower realms. He no longer has self-view (he realizes Anatta), he no longer has doubts about Dharma, he no longer pays attention to meaningless rituals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>However, much is also said about someone who has not attained stream entry, but simply a 'faith-follower' having the Right View of the nature of dharmas - as being Anicca, Dukkha, and Anatta - Impermanent, Unsatisfactory, and Non-self. </strong><strong class="bbc">And having the right view of Dependent Origination/Emptiness.</strong></p>
              <p>That is, if you understand, have conviction and belief that the nature of dharma is so... <strong>You will not die until you attain stream entry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, by simply having the right view you have already gone half the way of your path. This is why Right View is the 1st of the Noble 8 Fold Path.<br></strong></p>
              <p>By having the Right View, your stream entry, your awakening into the nature of dharma is assured this lifetime and thereby your Nirvana is assured to happen in no more than 7 lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the importance of having the right view.</p>
              <p>On another note... I have seen many (really, a lot) of very sincere practitioners who practice very hard... much harder than me. Unfortunately, because they do not have the right view, they get stuck at a certain stage of experience or realization.</p>
              <p>For example, they may get stuck at the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">'I AM' level of realization</a>. Why? Because there is no one to point them out the right view... So no matter how hard they practice, they cannot go pass that stage... even if they practice for decades or even after they pass away.</p>
              <p>Whereas, for me, and many others... who are not very diligent practitioners, but somehow due to having been instilled the right view, certain conditions arise and the nature of Dharma is seen very quickly. In a matter of few years, it can be done.</p>
              <p><strong>Never think you can skip 'right view' and just practice and hope that one day you will simply realize things by yourself (a very common mistake, I believe)... cuz, no matter how hard you practice, you still probably won't realize the right view by yourself. You need to understand and have conviction in the Buddha's teachings.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please... if there is any doubts or things you don't understand about the view of Dharma, please get it sorted out, please have the right view.</p>
              <p>If you don't understand Anatta (no-self), or Emptiness, please ask.</p>
              <p>There are experienced moderators... like Thusness and Simpo who can point them out to you..</p>
              <p>It is really not difficult to grasp this... so make the effort, it is definitely worthwhile.</p>
              <p>Don't you want to be assured enlightenment in this life? Yes, this assurance is possible. You just need to have the right view. (Of course, right practice, i.e. direct contemplation, is also important as a follow up to attain enlightenment, but even right view alone ensures your enlightenment within this life)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am especially indebted to Thusness who pointed out to me the 'right view'... otherwise I will probably get lost in certain phase in my practice like I mentioned earlier.</p>

              <p>In the Suttas, many people attain stream entry after listening to a single discourse by the Buddha (and often happens to be their FIRST discourse they hear from Buddha). This is how powerful 'right view' is... once it gets into you, a shift starts to happen. It can happen immediately... or maybe gradual... but by the end of this life, you will certainly realize the nature of dharma.</p>

              <p>Be happy for yourself as well.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you this. </p>
              <p>Are you confident (not asking if you're enlightened - asking if you have this view) that all phenomena in your experiential universe is arising and passing away every moment?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arising is without self, arising without an agent, experiencer, doer?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arising is inconstant and hence, unsatisfactory?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arise due to causes and conditions?</p>
              <p>If you answer 'Yes' to all, then congratulations, your enlightenment is assured this life and you will not fall into the lower realms. Start contemplating (look at) these facts in your own experience, and I can assure you your enlightenment is very near... it's not a matter of many decades spent meditating in caves, it's much closer than that. Months? A few years at most? Many people think enlightenment is distant but I can assure you, it is never this way, it is not as what most Buddhists and even masters and teachers made it to be, perhaps due to their failure and inability to transmit their enlightenment.</p>
              <p>It is not difficult and distant. The original suttas are a more accurate representation of how possible and common it is to be enlightened (that said, there are different degrees of enlightenment like stream entry to arhantship as well as bodhisattva bhumis)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if you answer 'No' to any of the above, then tell us what doubts you have and get this clarified. :)</p>

              <p>1) Yes indeed. Everything is instantaneously arising and subsiding... leaving no trace. Each moment becomes a condition for the next moment of arising, and yet all arisings are a fresh and complete reality of itself. In other words... it is not that 'Arising1' caused 'Arising2' or that 'Arising2' originated from 'Arising1' - they are different arisings and don't 'touch each other', but rather, 'Arising2' arises with 'Arising1' as a supporting condition. Arising 1 and Arising 2 are each a complete reality of itself.</p>
              <p>For example the thought/intention 'I need to get up now' arises, followed by a bodily action of standing up. The thought 'I need to get up now' serves as a condition for the bodily action... but the thought itself is not a self or doer/controller of action - it is merely an arising that serves as a condition for the action. The volition to stand up is mental, but what actually stands up is  the body. Each arising is a complete new reality arising with various supporting conditions.</p>
              <p>But what you said is right... each moment of arising becomes a condition for the next moment of arising.</p>
              <p>2) Not so clear based on what you said... are you saying is that there are some things beyond our control, and yet there is this notion that there is a 'self' that controls certain things? Is there a 'us the doer' to begin with?</p>
              <p>Look thoroughly... are there any things that can be controlled? Are thoughts being controlled? Is there a thinker of thoughts?</p>
              <p>If there is a thinker of thoughts, then you will have known what your next moment of thought will be. But do you know what your next moment of thought is? You don't. Thoughts actually spontaneously arise on its own accord (with various supporting conditions like latent imprints and so on).</p>
              <p>Look at this more thoroughly.. there is a sutta called Anattalakkhana Sutta - <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Suttas/Anattalakkhana/anattalakkhana.html">http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Suttas/Anattalakkhana/anattalakkhana.html</a> - Discourse on Not-self. In this discourse, the Buddha go through a list of constituents of experience and rejects them as non-self... look carefully... is there any experience in our control? Are thoughts, sensations, feelings, in our control? If they were in our control, we could have said 'I don't want bad thoughts/feelings to ever arise again', 'I only want good feelings to arise all the time' and they will be controlled in this way, but the fact of the matter is... even these thoughts/feelings arise due to various supporting conditions and there is no controller 'doing' them - bad feelings still occur and we can't stop them.</p>
              <p>Also, apart from 'no doership'... another aspect you should look into is 'no agent'. Is there an experiencer, a hearer, a seer?</p>
              <p>Look at a tree. In the ordinary unenlightened mode of viewing things, there is always this sense that there is an 'I' inside my body, viewing the 'tree out there' through 'my eyes'. Is this true?</p>
              <p>Is direct experience actually broken into 'I' the seer, and the 'seeing', and the 'being seen'? The fact of the matter is this... scenery is being seen, seeing is happening, but no seer is present doing the seeing! There is just pure seeing without seer. And there is no 'seeing and the scenery' - the seeing is precisely just the scenery...</p>
              <p>Music being heard, there is no hearer... just music playing vividly and intimately without any inside and outside separation... just sounds arising vividly, then vanishing without traces, all happening by itself without an agent/self.</p>
              <p>For the subtleties and different aspects of Anatta, do read the article by Thusness <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a></p>
              <p>3) Great!</p>
              <p>4) Good... all experiences, actions, thoughts arise due to causes and conditions. It is not a 'you' doing or experiencing things... rather, it is that actions, experiences arise with certain supporting conditions.</p>

              <p>Hmm... In my understanding, right view 
                  should be established even before one starts practicing the rest of the 
                  eightfold path. This is why Buddha put Right View at the top of the 
                  list. Right view has many aspects, for example, moral law of karma, the 
                  three characteristics, suffering. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view</a></p>
              <p>If
                   a person is not instilled right view of morality from the beginning, 
                  how else would he have properly practiced Sila? If a person is not 
                  instilled right view of the three characteristics, for example, how else
                   could he have practiced Right Mindfulness?</p>
              <p>That is why right 
                  view should be instilled right from the start and serves as a foundation
                   for all the other factors of the noble path.</p>
              <p>As the Buddha himself have said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote> Bhikkhus, just as the dawn is the forerunner and first indication of 
                  the rising of the sun, so is right view the forerunner and first 
                  indication of wholesome states.
              <p> </p>
              <p>For one of right view, bhikkhus, right intention springs up. For one 
                  of right intention, right speech springs up. For one of right speech, 
                  right action springs up. For one of right action, right livelihood 
                  springs up. For one of right livelihood, right effort springs up. For 
                  one of right effort, right mindfulness springs up. For one of right 
                  mindfulness, right concentration springs up. For one of right 
                  concentration, right knowledge springs up. For one of right knowledge, 
                  right deliverance springs up.</p>

              <p class="cite">This, btw, also explains why just having the right view alone can assure one's enlightenment. Because having right view will set off a chain effect and lead to the arising of the eightfold path.</p>
              <p>That said, it is true that
                   right mindfulness and concentration must be practiced as a follow up 
                  for right view to be 'actualized' and realized. As the wiki entry 
                  states: <em>Right view begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through
                   the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted 
                  into wisdom, which can eradicate the fetters of the mind.</em></p>

              <p>Let's say... a sound of bell ringing being heard.</p>
              <p>Does the sound originate from the ear? Does it originate from the bell? No! Actually... it is much more complex than that.</p>
              <p>The
                   sound of airplane being perceived actually has various supporting 
                  conditions... the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears, 
                  the hand hitting the stick, and so on. These supporting conditions all 
                  come together and in that instantaneous moment a completely new 
                  phenomenon/arising of sound-consciousness has arisen.</p>
              <p>Does 
                  sound-consciousness have an origin? It cannot be said to have a source,

                  come from the air, the stick, the bell, and so on.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is

              <p>Hmm... In my understanding, right view should be established even before one starts practicing the rest of the eightfold path. This is why Buddha put Right View at the top of the list. Right view has many aspects, for example, moral law of karma, the three characteristics, suffering. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view</a></p>
              <p>If a person is not instilled right view of morality from the beginning, how else would he have properly practiced Sila? If a person is not instilled right view of the three characteristics, for example, how else could he have practiced Right Mindfulness?</p>
              <p>That is why right view should be instilled right from the start and serves as a foundation for all the other factors of the noble path.</p>
              <p>As the Buddha himself have said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anguttara Nikaya 10:121</p>
              <p>This, btw, also explains why just having the right view alone can assure one's enlightenment. Because having right view will set off a chain effect and lead to the arising of the eightfold path.</p>
              <p>That said, it is true that right mindfulness and concentration must be practiced as a follow up for right view to be 'actualized' and realized. As the wiki entry states: <em>Right view begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the fetters of the mind.</em></p>
              <p>Let's say... a sound of bell ringing being heard.</p>
              <p>Does the sound originate from the ear? Does it originate from the bell? No! Actually... it is much more complex than that.</p>
              <p>The sound of airplane being perceived actually has various supporting conditions... the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears, the hand hitting the stick, and so on. These supporting conditions all come together and in that instantaneous moment a completely new phenomenon/arising of sound-consciousness has arisen.</p>
              <p>Does sound-consciousness have an origin? It cannot be said to have a source, cause, agent, or origin. It does not come from the ears, it does not come from the air, the stick, the bell, and so on.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is with the combination of these various supporting conditions, a new and complete phenomenon arises. This is thus called Interdependent Origination.</p>

              <p>There is always a very fine, subtle and stubborn trace of division despite the clear seeing.  This is due to the (dualistic and inherent) tendency that runs deep.  The lingering tendency prevents full and complete experience of whatever arises by way of very subtle reification and abstraction.  We must clearly 'detect' this trace and see what is its supporting conditions. </p>
              <p>Practice will reveal that clear seeing + constant reminding of letting go + lingering dualistic and inherent view cannot lead to thorough letting go.  The 'view' will always create a very thin layer of division.</p>
              <p>Therefore 'the dualistic and inherent view' needs to be replaced with right view for a practitioner to get over the most 'subtle trace'.  Experience will eventually turn fully direct, gapless, coreless and liberating.</p>
              <p>Seeing liberation as the direct realization of the 'empty nature' of arising and ceasing is different from seeing liberation as the space that is free from arising and ceasing.</p>
              <p>The former is gapless and full embracement of transience while the latter is disassociation from transient.</p>
              <p>If 'you' are clear, then welcoming of whatever arises is non-dual and letting go is non-dual; no more holding in disguise as letting go and coming and going turns librating. all appearances turn spontaneous, stainless, coreless and crystal present. :-)</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p><em>...."Form... Feeling... Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant, changeable, alterable.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"One who has conviction &amp; belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.</em></p>
              <p><em>"One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhamma-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.</em></p>
              <p><em>"One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening."...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the topic of Right View, it is said that one who realizes the nature of dharma is said to enter the stream, become a stream enterer, destined to attain Nirvana/Arhatship in no more than 7 lifetimes (or in this lifetime if he works hard for it). He will never again enter into the lower realms. He no longer has self-view (he realizes Anatta), he no longer has doubts about Dharma, he no longer pays attention to meaningless rituals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>However, much is also said about someone who has not attained stream entry, but simply a 'faith-follower' having the Right View of the nature of dharmas - as being Anicca, Dukkha, and Anatta - Impermanent, Unsatisfactory, and Non-self.</strong> <strong>And having the right view of Dependent Origination/Emptiness.</strong></p>
              <p>That is, if you understand, have conviction and belief that the nature of dharma is so... <strong>You will not die until you attain stream entry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, by simply having the right view you have already gone half the way of your path. This is why Right View is the 1st of the Noble 8 Fold Path.<br></strong></p>
              <p>By having the Right View, your stream entry, your awakening into the nature of dharma is assured this lifetime and thereby your Nirvana is assured to happen in no more than 7 lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the importance of having the right view.</p>
              <p>On another note... I have seen many (really, a lot) of very sincere practitioners who practice very hard... much harder than me. Unfortunately, because they do not have the right view, they get stuck at a certain stage of experience or realization.</p>
              <p>For example, they may get stuck at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">'I AM' level of realization</a>. Why? Because there is no one to point them out the right view... So no matter how hard they practice, they cannot go pass that stage... even if they practice for decades or even after they pass away.</p>
              <p>Whereas, for me, and many others... who are not very diligent practitioners, but somehow due to having been instilled the right view, certain conditions arise and the nature of Dharma is seen very quickly. In a matter of few years, it can be done.</p>
              <p><strong>Never think you can skip 'right view' and just practice and hope that one day you will simply realize things by yourself (a very common mistake, I believe)... cuz, no matter how hard you practice, you still probably won't realize the right view by yourself. You need to understand and have conviction in the Buddha's teachings.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please... if there is any doubts or things you don't understand about the view of Dharma, please get it sorted out, please have the right view.</p>
              <p>If you don't understand Anatta (no-self), or Emptiness, please ask.</p>
              <p>There are experienced moderators... like Thusness and Simpo who can point them out to you..</p>
              <p>It is really not difficult to grasp this... so make the effort, it is definitely worthwhile.</p>
              <p>Don't you want to be assured enlightenment in this life? Yes, this assurance is possible. You just need to have the right view. (Of course, right practice, i.e. direct contemplation, is also important as a follow up to attain enlightenment, but even right view alone ensures your enlightenment within this life)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am especially indebted to Thusness who pointed out to me the 'right view'... otherwise I will probably get lost in certain phase in my practice like I mentioned earlier.</p>

              <p><br>If you need seek some form of assurance regarding attaining your own Nirvana, then I can assure you that true Nirvana is actually very distant from you.</p>
              <p>And why would you specify Christians as an example for questioning your assurance to Nirvana?</p>
              <p>If you have such subjective opinions about Christians, then certainly your assurance to Nirvana is not truly assured.</p>
              <p>Buddha says "There is no opinions in this world, the world have no opinions of you and you do not have a real opinion of the world. Everything that has happened, will happen, and is happening is not part of the world. The world is neither in the past, present or future. The world is You, You formed part of the world. You will never leave the world and the world will never leave you."</p>
              <p>Amitatofu, there is no you or the world that you speaked of.</p>

              <p>Be happy for yourself as well.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you this. </p>
              <p>Are you confident (not asking if you're enlightened - asking if you have this view) that all phenomena in your experiential universe is arising and passing away every moment?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arising is without self, arising without an agent, experiencer, doer?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arising is inconstant and hence, unsatisfactory?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that all phenomena arise due to causes and conditions?</p>
              <p>If you answer 'Yes' to all, then congratulations, your enlightenment is assured this life and you will not fall into the lower realms. Start contemplating (look at) these facts in your own experience, and I can assure you your enlightenment is very near... it's not a matter of many decades spent meditating in caves, it's much closer than that. Months? A few years at most? Many people think enlightenment is distant but I can assure you, it is never this way, it is not as what most Buddhists and even masters and teachers made it to be, perhaps due to their failure and inability to transmit their enlightenment.</p>
              <p>It is not difficult and distant. The original suttas are a more accurate representation of how possible and common it is to be enlightened (that said, there are different degrees of enlightenment like stream entry to arhantship as well as bodhisattva bhumis)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if you answer 'No' to any of the above, then tell us what doubts you have and get this clarified. :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>To the second question <em>"Are you confident that all phenomena arising is without self,
                                                          arising without an agent, experiencer, doer?"</em></p>
              <p>Firstly, one must be open to the possibility that what we think we are is just an assumption that is formed by jumping into conclusion and all other 'sentient beings' jumping onto the same conclusion. This is described as Ignorance in the teaching.</p>
              <p>We will next investigate what we really are. This investigation CANNOT be conceptual or it will in the end be what we <strong>think</strong> it should be again with really touching on the raw experience/insight.</p>
              <p>Some people will think... we are the soul. No, this is not the answer. The answer goes beyond the concept of a soul which is really a more subtle level of 'self' or sense of indivduality. By the concept of the soul, the world will still be filled with multiple souls and individuals.</p>
              <p>By understanding no-self, one will not only understand  the nature of yourself, but also the basic fundamental property of the universe.</p>
              <p>Questions to ponder:</p>
              <p>1. Do you think that all along there are so many things and objects in the world?</p>
              <p>What if all the things that are being seen are not really physical objects but are the impressions form by the sense organs datas. What if the environment 'out there' that one see are mere appearance made by dots of colours? What if the sound that one hears are not out there?</p>
              <p>2. Do you think your<strong> awareness</strong> of being alive and living is different from that of other beings' ?</p>
              <p>What if every seemingly separate Being or individual are just different focus of attentions/awareness, that is all.</p>
              <p>The questions needs to be pondered upon slowly if you want to have some kind of further progress leading to the insight... of firstly non-duality, then maturing into the realisation of no-self.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hmm... In my understanding, right view should be established
              even before one starts practicing the rest of the eightfold path.
              This is why Buddha put Right View at the top of the list. Right
              view has many aspects, for example, moral law of karma, the three
              characteristics, suffering. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view</a></p>
              <p>If a person is not instilled right view of morality from the
              beginning, how else would he have properly practiced Sila? If a
              person is not instilled right view of the three characteristics,
              for example, how else could he have practiced Right
              Mindfulness?</p>
              <p>That is why right view should be instilled right from the start
              and serves as a foundation for all the other factors of the noble
              path.</p>
              <p>As the Buddha himself have said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anguttara Nikaya 10:121</p>
              <p>This, btw, also explains why just having the right view
              alone can assure one's enlightenment. Because having right view
              will set off a chain effect and lead to the arising of the
              eightfold path.</p>
              <p>That said, it is true that right mindfulness and concentration
              must be practiced as a follow up for right view to be 'actualized'
              and realized. As the wiki entry states: <em>Right view begins with
              concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of
              right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom,
              which can eradicate the fetters of the mind.</em></p>
              <p>Let's say... a sound of bell ringing being heard.</p>
              <p>Does the sound originate from the ear? Does it originate from
              the bell? No! Actually... it is much more complex than that.</p>
              <p>The sound of airplane being perceived actually has various
              supporting conditions... the stick, the bell, the vibration of the
              air, the ears, the hand hitting the stick, and so on. These
              supporting conditions all come together and in that instantaneous
              moment a completely new phenomenon/arising of sound-consciousness
              has arisen.</p>
              <p>Does sound-consciousness have an origin? It cannot be said to
              have a source, cause, agent, or origin. It does not come from the
              ears, it does not come from the air, the stick, the bell, and so
              on.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is with the combination of these various supporting
              conditions, a new and complete phenomenon arises. This is thus
              called Interdependent Origination.</p>

              <p>Thanks AEN for the clear explanation.</p>
              <p>in my experience, inititally when i start practice right view on morality and the three characteristic is based on readings and is dualistic and conditional in nature. then as one start to practice and experience some insights, right view is re-established and may differ slightly than what was initially thought. for e.g. the view on suffering when i first ever read the Four Noble truths is different from the view im seeing now. </p>
              <p>so that's why i say right view is established with practice, not meaning that it's not impt to learn about right view from the start before practicing the Eightfold Path, but that the view is refined along the way.</p>
