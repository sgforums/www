              <p>Hi Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>There are two kinds of Nirvana: Nirvana with remainder, Nirvana without remainder.</p>
              <p>An Arhant has achieved Nirvana with remainder while he is alive: he has experienced the cessation of suffering, attachments, and delusion. Why is it called 'with remainder'? Since he is still alive, his sense aggregates are still functioning and perceiving.</p>
              <p>Nirvana without remainder refers to an Arhant who has passed away - for him there is no further conditions perpetuating the chain of birth and death, he is freed from the cycle of rebirth, and enters into cessation without remainder. For an Arhant, there is no more further births: no more births even in the higher realms. Since even the sense aggregates have ceased to function and there is no more further arising/birth, it is said to be 'Cessation without remainder'. However, anyone before attaining Arhantship will still be 'recycled in the 6 realms'. That said, if you have right view, or you attain Sotapanna (1st out of 4 stages to Arhantship), you are already ensured no more births in lower realms and a straight path to Nirvana.</p>
              <p>As for your statement that <em>there were no sutras named
                                                              "How to attain Nirvana" and "How to attain Enlightenment" - </em>my reply would be that it would not be necessary to name it as such, because ALL sutras are about how to attain enlightenment. This is the purpose of Buddhism, after all. The purpose and intention of Buddha as stated by himself is clear: he states that the sole teaching he taught is the reality (and cause) of suffering and the end (and path/way towards the end) of suffering.</p>
              <p>What does this mean? This means <strong>all</strong> his teachings are centered on Nirvana and enlightenment - his intention and purpose is not simply for us to cultivate mundane qualities or become a better person, etc, which are commonplace among other teachings. Even teachings on morality by the Buddha is simply 'part of the package' of the path that leads to enlightenment - he did not teach morality just so that we become a better person, but that we can have the conditions to reach enlightenment (but morality is by no means the only factor - other factors include samadhi and wisdom/insight).</p>
              <p>Sorry for the late reply - was in Tekong doing high keys last weekend, couldn't bookout.</p>

              <p>It's ok to doubt anything else... but the truth (the 'right view') once realized cannot be doubted... investigate, see the truth for yourself, that is what matters. This is not about blind faith or faith in what someone said... but about ariving at an inner unshakeable conviction about the way things truly are.</p>

              <p>I think there's the Twelve-linked Chain of Dependent Origination

                          good or bad, the karma is all "stored" in consciousness and enters

              <p>Haha... there is nothing æ¬ æ‰“ about your question.</p>
              <p>8th Consciousness is also an insubstantial and momentary stream of consciousness... 8th consciousness is not a soul that reincarnates, don't be mistaken (though it is often mistaken to be a soul).</p>
              <p>As Thusness said before, we must get rid of the entire idea of there being a 'place' where seeds are being 'stored'. 'Storage' is simply spoken out of convention. </p>
              <p>There are always imprints and tendencies, nothing lost. It has always been like that. 'Stored' actually means an on going process to mean that the tendencies are there. But not to see it as a place keeping track of something.</p>
              <p>So 8th consciousness is an insubstantial and momentary process of tendencies and imprints and action interacting - there is no entity, place, or 'soul' involved.</p>

Early 
                          Buddhists taught about existence of six-fold consciousness, that is the 
                          conciousness of five types of perception (visual, audial, etc.) and of 
                          "mind" (<em>manovijnana</em>). The <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Vijnanavada.htm">Yogacarins</a> analysing the source of consciousness added two more kinds of consciousness. They are: <em>klistamanovijnana</em>, or <em>manas</em>, that is the ego-centre of an empirical personality, and <em>alaya-vijnana</em> which is the source of other kinds of consciousness. Alaya-vijnana is 
                          above subject-object opposition but it is not a kind of absolute mind: 
                          alaya-vijnana is momentary and non-substantial.  Every sentient being 
                          with the corresponding to this being "objective" world can be reduced to
                           its "own" alaya-vijnana. Therefore, classical Yogacara states the 
                          existence of many alayas.</p>
              <p>The Alaya-vijnana is a receptacle and container of the so-called "seeds" (<em>bija</em>), or elementary units of past experiences. These <em>bijas</em> project themselves as an illusionary world of empirical subjects and 
                          corresponding objects. All other seven types of consciousness are but 
                          transformations (<em>parinama</em>) of alaya-vijnana. In the course of its
                           yogic practice a Yogacarin must empty alaya-vijnana of its contents. 
                          Thus the Yogacarin puts an end to the tendency of external projections 
                          of alaya-vijnana changing it into <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/nonduality/index.html">non-dual</a> (<em>advaya</em>) wisdom (<em>jnana</em>) of Enlightened mind.</p>

              <p>How one is reborn and enters into the mother's womb is an
                      interesting topic. What I understand is as long as we do not have
                      these senses attachment as stated in the Heart Sutra (æ— çœ¼ no eyesï¼Œè€³

              <p>What you said is right - the seed must meet the condition to be manifested.</p>
              <p>Except I would want to correct the part on Heart Sutra:</p>
              <p>Heart Sutra is talking about Emptiness as the nature of all phenomena.</p>
              <p>It is not talking about emptying attachments to phenomena... it is saying that all phenomena, though appearing, is empty of an independent or permanent existence since they arise interdependent with conditions. Their interdependent origination means they are empty of substantial/inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is the nature of reality... it is not a state or experience (including a state of 'no attachments'). Emptiness requires 'realization'.</p>
              <p>Everything is by nature empty... as Thusness explained before in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html"> On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a>:</p>
              <p><em><br>If we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it 
              arise, what is ‘thought’ like.  'Thought' will reveal its nature is 
              empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very 
              important not to infer, think or conceptualise but feel with our entire 
              being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to reside 
              'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it.  It is just an impression 
              of somewhere "there" but never "there".   Similarly “here-ness” and 
              “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of 
              causes and conditions,  nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like 
              ‘selfness’.<br><br>This ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not 
              only peculiar to ‘thought’.  All experiences or sensations are like that
               -- vividly present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, 
              un-locatable.<br><br>If we were to observe a red flower that is so 
              vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness” only appears to 
              “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does 
              not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is 
              the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum 
              eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no 
              attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void with
               no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are dependently 
              arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed 
              attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, 
              mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.<br><br>Likewise 
              when standing in front of a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of 
              ‘fire’, the burning heat, the whole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so 
              vividly present and seem so real but when examined they are also not 
              inherently “there” -- merely dependently manifest whenever conditions 
              are there.  It is amazing how dualistic and inherent views have caged 
              seamless experience in a who-where-when construct.<br><br>All 
              experiences are empty. They are like sky flowers, like painting on the 
              surface of a pond.  There is no way to point to a moment of experience 
              and say this is ‘in’ and that is ‘out’. All ‘in’ are as ‘out’; to 
              awareness seamless experience is all there is.  It is not the mirror or 
              pond that is important but that process of illusion-like phenomenon of 
              the paint shimmering on the surface of the pond; like an illusion but 
              not an illusion, like a dream but not a dream.  This is the ground of 
              all experiences.<br><br>Yet this ‘ungraspability and unlocatabilty’ 
              nature is not all there is; there is also this Maha, this great without 
              boundaries feeling of 'interconnectedness'.  When someone hits a bell, 
              the person, the stick, the bell, the vibration of the air, the ears and 
              then the magically appearance of sound -- ’Tongsss…re-sounding…’ is all a
               seamless one happening, one experience.  When breathing, it is just 
              this one whole entire breath; it is all causes and conditions coming 
              together to give rise to this entire sensation of breath as if the whole
               of universe is doing this breathing.  The significance of this Maha 
              experience is not in words; in my opinion, without this experience, 
              there is no true experience of 'interconnectedness' and non-dual 
              presence is incomplete.<br><br>The experience of our empty nature is a 
              very different from that of non-dual oneness.  ‘Distance’ for example is
               overcome in non-dual oneness by seeing through the illusory aspect of 
              subject/object division and resulted in a one non-dual presence.  It is 
              seeing all as just ‘This’ but experiencing Emptiness breaks the boundary
               through its empty ungraspable and unlocatable nature.<br><br>There is 
              no need for a ‘where-place' or a ‘when-time' or a ‘who-I' when we 
              penetrate deeply into this nature.  When hearing sound, sound is neither
               ‘in here’ nor ‘out there’, it is where it is and gone!  All centers and
               reference points dissolve with the wisdom that manifestation 
              dependently originates and hence empty.  The experience creates an 
              "always right wherever and whenever is" sensation.  A sensation of home 
              everywhere though nowhere can be called home.  Experiencing the 
              emptiness nature of presence, a sincere practitioner becomes clear that 
              indeed the non-dual presence is leaving a subtle mark; seeing its nature
               as empty, the last mark that solidifies experiences dissolves.  It 
              feels cool because presence is made more present and effortless.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> We then move from "vivid non-dual presence" into "though vividly and non-dually present, it is nothing real, empty!"</span>.</em></p>

              <p>simpo_ is correct to say "will naturally understand why it is

              <p>By intention and design, everyone will lose the sense of
                                      seperation and the sense of " I " eventually. <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUFLpTNMK1s" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUFLpTNMK1s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUFLpTNMK1s</a><br> <br> But for the time being, it is better to just assume that there is a
                                      " I " so that you can learn whatever you need to
                                      learn/experience/do when there is a seperate "self". Once you have
                                      realised "no-self", you cannot reverse back to "self" anymore, it
                                      is a point of no return.</p>

              <p>Quite right... but actually, even when you think you are a separate self, there is actually already no self... it's not that you haven't 'reach' no-self... it's that you didn't realise that always already, there is no self.</p>
              <p>There is always ever just pure seeing, experiencing, action, happenings... no agent or self or experiencer or controller of these things can be found.</p>
              <p>No-self is a dharma seal... the nature of reality... it is not a state of experience.</p>
              <p><em>“Anything that is created must sooner or later die. Enlightenment is permanent because we have<br>not produced it; we have merely discovered it.”</em><br>- Chogyam Trungpa</p>
              <p>And as Thusness mentioned before:</p>
              <p><em>...First I do not see Anatta as merely a freeing from personality sort 
                              of experience as you mentioned; I see it as that a self/agent, a doer, a
                               thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found apart from the moment to 
                              moment flow of manifestation or as its commonly expressed as ‘the 
                              observer is the observed’; there is no self apart from arising and 
                              passing. A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma 
                              Seal, it is the nature of Reality all the time -- and not merely as a 
                              state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a stage to 
                              attain. <br><br>To put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html</a>)
                               that ‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing,
                               there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an illustration. When a person 
                              says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a 
                              stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a 
                              stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always is only 
                              sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing 
                              attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to a
                               non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary views of 
                              the sense of self and the split. Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, 
                              there will always be an unknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 
                              'presence'. This purest presence is the 'how' of a dualistic mind -- its
                               dualistic attempt to provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of 
                              the spontaneous nature of the unconditioned. It is critical to note here
                               that both the doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that are 
                              created for these doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the 
                              same cause -- our karmic propensities of ever seeing things 
                              dualistically...</em></p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>There are two kinds of Nirvana: Nirvana with remainder, Nirvana
              without remainder.</p>
              <p>An Arhant has achieved Nirvana with remainder while he is alive:
              he has experienced the cessation of suffering, attachments, and
              delusion. Why is it called 'with remainder'? Since he is still
              alive, his sense aggregates are still functioning and
              perceiving.</p>
              <p>Nirvana without remainder refers to an Arhant who has passed
              away - for him there is no further conditions perpetuating the
              chain of birth and death, he is freed from the cycle of rebirth,
              and enters into cessation without remainder. For an Arhant, there
              is no more further births: no more births even in the higher
              realms. Since even the sense aggregates have ceased to function and
              there is no more further arising/birth, it is said to be 'Cessation
              without remainder'. However, anyone before attaining Arhantship
              will still be 'recycled in the 6 realms'. That said, if you have
              right view, or you attain Sotapanna (1st out of 4 stages to
              Arhantship), you are already ensured no more births in lower realms
              and a straight path to Nirvana.</p>
              <p>As for your statement that <em>there were no sutras named "How
              to attain Nirvana" and "How to attain Enlightenment" -</em> my
              reply would be that it would not be necessary to name it as such,
              because ALL sutras are about how to attain enlightenment. This is
              the purpose of Buddhism, after all. The purpose and intention of
              Buddha as stated by himself is clear: he states that the sole
              teaching he taught is the reality (and cause) of suffering and the
              end (and path/way towards the end) of suffering.</p>
              <p>What does this mean? This means <strong>all</strong> his
              teachings are centered on Nirvana and enlightenment - his intention
              and purpose is not simply for us to cultivate mundane qualities or
              become a better person, etc, which are commonplace among other
              teachings. Even teachings on morality by the Buddha is simply 'part
              of the package' of the path that leads to enlightenment - he did
              not teach morality just so that we become a better person, but that
              we can have the conditions to reach enlightenment (but morality is
              by no means the only factor - other factors include samadhi and
              wisdom/insight).</p>
              <p>Sorry for the late reply - was in Tekong doing high keys last
              weekend, couldn't bookout.</p>

              <p>If I am able to attain Nirvana or enlightenment, I will enjoy eternity in perfect bliss. I always ask myself this question, why must I come back to spread the words of Buddhism, why can't I do it in this life instead. I won't say I'm teaching in this life because I'm still learning and not up to standard but I will try my best to spread Buddhism to others.</p>

              <p><br>think both. there's no one of the other. A fully Enlightened beings will attained the Trikaya, where the manifested bodies will benefit/teach all sentient beings; the reward body is for one's own benefit; and the truth body is for benefit of both.</p>
              <p>however Buddhas will teach without any effort. they will be like mirror reflecting any objects that come in front of the mirror. when u ask them, they reflect the answer without any effort. when u don't ask them, they are as still and peaceful as a mirror.</p>

              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika's</a> monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you noble right 
                  concentration with its supports and requisite conditions. Listen, and 
                  pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "Now what, monks, is noble right concentration 
                  with its supports &amp; requisite conditions? Any singleness of mind 
                  equipped with these seven factors — right view, right resolve, right 
                  speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, &amp; right 
                  mindfulness — is called noble right concentration with its supports 
                  &amp; requisite conditions.</p>
              <p><strong>[<a id="s1" name="s1">1</a>]</strong> "Of those, right view is the 
                  forerunner. And how is right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong 
                  view as wrong view, and right view as right view. This is one's right 
                  view. <a id="micchaditthi" name="micchaditthi">And what is</a> wrong 
                  view? 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. 
                  There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this 
                  world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn 
                  beings; no priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly &amp; 
                  practicing rightly, proclaim this world &amp; the next after having 
                  directly known &amp; realized it for themselves.' This is wrong view.</p>
              <p><a id="asava" name="asava">"And what</a> is right view? Right view, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right view with effluents <em>[asava],</em> siding with merit, resulting in the acquisitions [of becoming]; and 
                  there is noble right view, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of 
                  the path.</p>
              <p>"And what is the right view that has effluents, sides with merit, 
                  &amp; results in acquisitions? 'There is what is given, what is offered,
                   what is sacrificed. There are fruits &amp; results of good &amp; bad

              <p>the term used commonly, no-self, will be discerned differently.</p>
              <p>on the literal front, it points to the annihilation of the self; the non-existence of a person. this is the view of the logic mind, and the subjective view is the basis from which such an understanding arises. </p>
              <p>when the process is first seen, there is a sense of detachment from phenomena, in the form of a witness observing the arising and falling. </p>
              <p>onwards, it is observed that even the witness is just a mirage, dependently arisen from the different thoughts that arised, in turn arisen from the conditions that are present. there's a sense of freedom in knowing and allowing the sense of self to come and go. sometimes this sense stays longer, depending on what we're doing on hand, as well as the habitual tendencies. but generally the view can be 'accessed' with ease.</p>
              <p>in a sense, one can intuit that the sense of self is already no-self, in all aspects of the language.</p>

              <p>Yes, the Witness is simply a mirage!</p>
              <p>The sense of there being a 'Witness' of phenomena is simply a thought... in that thought, there is just a thought! There is no witness of thought... the witness of thought is simply a thought, a self-referencing thought. There is always just in thinking just thoughts. And in the hearing, just sound, there is no hearer of sound... just the self-luminous and self-accomplishing process of hearing. And so on... The sense of self is simply another sensation, a sensation that does not actually refer to anything: it is just a sensation without a sensor. A thought of self is also simply an empty thought, an empty label or story that does not refer to anything substantial. Everything is just like this... You do not come to see the mountain, the mountain simply 'sees'/'reveals' by itself without a seer... this has always been the case.</p>
              <p>When it's seen that thoughts and sensations that imply self are actually not self but is simply a pure sensation happening to nobody, then it's coming and going becomes self-liberating. (Like you said, the sense of self is already no-self!) Otherwise, thoughts and sensations that imply self are clung to, solidifed, reified, and leads to a chain of suffeirng.</p>
              <p>The annihilation of self is based on a false view of self: that it has existence to begin with, and is solid, real, etc.</p>
              <p>By seeing the absence of an agent, or a solid, separate, permanent, controlling/perceiving self, such a view is overthrown... what remains is the arising and subsiding of arisings according to conditions.</p>
              <p>How can there be a 'self' to annihilate when no 'self' is found to begin with?</p>
