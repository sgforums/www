              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hmm... In my understanding, right view should be established
                  even before one starts practicing the rest of the eightfold path.
                  This is why Buddha put Right View at the top of the list. Right
                  view has many aspects, for example, moral law of karma, the three
                  characteristics, suffering. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_view</a></p>
              <p>If a person is not instilled right view of morality from the
                  beginning, how else would he have properly practiced Sila? If a
                  person is not instilled right view of the three characteristics,
                  for example, how else could he have practiced Right
                  Mindfulness?</p>
              <p>That is why right view should be instilled right from the start
                  and serves as a foundation for all the other factors of the noble
                  path.</p>
              <p>As the Buddha himself have said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anguttara Nikaya 10:121</p>
              <p>This, btw, also explains why just having the right view
                  alone can assure one's enlightenment. Because having right view
                  will set off a chain effect and lead to the arising of the
                  eightfold path.</p>
              <p>That said, it is true that right mindfulness and concentration
                  must be practiced as a follow up for right view to be 'actualized'
                  and realized. As the wiki entry states: <em>Right view begins with
                  concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of
                  right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom,
                  which can eradicate the fetters of the mind.</em></p>
              <p>Let's say... a sound of bell ringing being heard.</p>
              <p>Does the sound originate from the ear? Does it originate from
                  the bell? No! Actually... it is much more complex than that.</p>
              <p>The sound of airplane being perceived actually has various
                  supporting conditions... the stick, the bell, the vibration of the
                  air, the ears, the hand hitting the stick, and so on. These
                  supporting conditions all come together and in that instantaneous
                  moment a completely new phenomenon/arising of sound-consciousness
                  has arisen.</p>
              <p>Does sound-consciousness have an origin? It cannot be said to
                  have a source, cause, agent, or origin. It does not come from the
                  ears, it does not come from the air, the stick, the bell, and so
                  on.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is with the combination of these various supporting
                  conditions, a new and complete phenomenon arises. This is thus
                  called Interdependent Origination.</p>

              <p>Repeat post, Admin pls remove. Thanks</p>
              <p>Thanks AEN for the clear explanation.</p>
              <p>in my experience, inititally when i start practice right view on morality and the three characteristic is based on readings and is dualistic and conditional in nature. then as one start to practice and experience some insights, right view is re-established and may differ slightly than what was initially thought. for e.g. the view on suffering when i first ever read the Four Noble truths is different from the view im seeing now. </p>

              <p><br>pureland Buddha recitation school practice some sort different from ch'an and mind school. yes we can understand the right view and 4NT.</p>
              <p>ch'an and mind school use the nature of Six Roots/Organs to experience the nature of Six Objects. that mean when the eye see all form object it is the nature of seeing experiencing the nature of all form è§�æ€§è§�è‰²æ€§. when the ear listen to sound, it is the nature of hearing listening to the nature of sound è€³æ€§é—»å£°æ€§ etcs. if u can do this u are Enlightened æ˜Žå¿ƒè§�æ€§, è§�æ€§æˆ�ä½›. Normal people only use dualistic Six Roots to experience the defiled Six Objects, hence the mind attached. Most are explain in Shurangama Sutra.</p>
              <p>pureland Buddha recitation method is simpler and equally effective if not more effective. how it work is when the eye see the external form, before the mind start to discriminate and attached to the form, u quickly change it to Amituofo. when the eye see, it's Amituofo. when the ear listen to sound, it's Amituofo. when the nose smell, it's Amituofo. when the tongue taste, it's also Amituofo. All is Amituofo!  this is the brillant method by Pureland. problem is whether u know how to recite or in other word whether u know how to convert. when thoughts start to arise, quickly convert to Amituofo. if u do not know how, the mind will still wonder off and think off something else when reciting. then it will not be useful.</p>
              <p>hope it's useful to know the idea behind Buddha recitation method. :-)</p>

Does pure land require an understanding of unsatisfactoriness? Yes, all samsaric existence and posessions are ultimately transient, illusory, unsatisfactory. Does pure land require an understanding of non-self? Yes, if we believe there were truly something 'me' or 'mine' it will be condusive to grasping and self-contraction rather than letting go. Is pure land practice conducive to dispassion and detachment? Yes, by leaving away the attachments to samsara is the only way we can be born in pure land.</p>
              <p>Right view aids and is essential to pure land practice. All practices be it zen, pure land, theravada, and so on have right view as foundation.</p>

              <p>Quite "steep" leh</p>
              <p>I drew references from Buddha's Four Foundation of Mindfulness... not sure whether is it applicable or not. For example,</p>
              <p>Material form- that one I know is impermanent, therefore it is not self. The Mindfulness of all Dharma explains that there is no "lasting identities"... everything is formed by many "different parts" to make up that particular "part". Lack of any "part" and this form or "part" will cease... and so there is no self</p>
              <p>Feelings- understand that feeling is also one of the Foundation of Mindfulness, and its impermance... this one ok... and so there is no self</p>
              <p>Perception- this one I understands... even social scientists says that perceptions stem from cultures and this world got so many different cultures... different yardstick. But because we are born in particular ethnic groups and therefore we tend to follow and think our ethnic group is "normal" and others is abnormal. Therefore perception is quite warped sometimes... When we are babies, there is no self... OK this one correct</p>
              <p>Mental formation- this one similar to what we call "thoughts"? Thoughts are always changing too. So there is no self... OK correct...</p>
              <p>Last one: Consciousness... this one deep leh... I thought we all got consciousness...? if there is no consciousness... how do we function? maybe the Mindfulness of Dharma has already explain this...</p>

              <p>In fact, all true bodhisattvas are enlightened. Bodhisattvas that have entered even the 1st bhumi level have realized emptiness. In terms of realization, 1st bhumi can roughly correspond to Sotapanna level, while 6th bhumi is roughly corresponded with Arhatship. You have to go through 10 bhumis to reach Buddhahood.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Whatever you said about four foundations of mindfulness is alright... however mindfulness is not a conceptualization process. Mindfulness means bare naked observation of reality... it is also what gives rise to direct experiential insight provided there is right view. Here's an article on mindfulness I consider a 'must-read' for everyone practicing Buddhism: <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;   "><strong><a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe13.html">Chapter 13</a></strong> ...(Mindfulness - Sati)</span></p>
              <p>About consciousness: in Buddhism, we do not say there is no consciousness. There is consciousness, but consciousness is not a Self. Consciousness is not an ultimate observer of objects... this is the ordinary being's thinking and even those with transcendental glimpses of the I AM Presence.</p>
              <p>So what is consciousness? In <a href="http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm">http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm</a></p>
              <p>The Buddha reprimanded a monk who thinks that consciousness '<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">is that which feels and experiences, that which reaps the results of good and evil actions done here and there' and that '</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'.</span></p>
              <p>Why is this monk reprimanded for holding such a view of consciousness? It is because he thinks that Consciousness is a soul, a Self that experiences and observes things and that this is ultimately that unchanging entity that transmigrates through different lifetimes.</p>
              <p>The Buddha furthermore states that </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">"Foolish man, to whom do you know me having taught the Dhamma like this. Haven’t I taught, in various ways that consciousness is dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet you, foolish man, on account of your wrong view, you misrepresent me, as well as destroy yourself and accumulate much demerit, for which you will suffer for a long time."'</span></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Note that the Buddha is saying two things here: 1) Consciousness is a manifestation that dependently originates. 2) By holding on to the wrong view, you create much demerits for yourself and prevent your own enlightenment.</p>
              <p>So it goes two ways: having right view ensures your enlightenment, while holding on to the wrong view prevents awakening and further to propagate these views as truth or worse as Buddha's words (called slandering) destroys yourself and accumulate a lot of demerits. This is why having this discussion in this forum is very important, it is my wish that everyone can attain Nirvana ASAP.</p>
              <p>Now back to the topic of consciousness... now we understand that Consciousness is not a self, but a manifestation that dependently originates. It is an Arising... it is not a Self or a Soul, or an Observer/Experiencer/Feeler.</p>
              <p>What kind of arising is called consciousness? The Buddha further explains:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><em>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the condition dependent upon which it arises. If consciousness arises on account of eye and forms, it is reckoned as eye consciousness. If on account of ear and sounds it arises, it is reckoned as ear consciousness. If on account of nose and smells it arises, it is reckoned as nose consciousness. If on account of tongue and tastes it arises, it is reckoned as tongue consciousness. If on account of body and touch it arises, it is reckoned as body consciousness. If on account of mind and mind-objects it arises, it is reckoned as mind consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as a fire is reckoned based on whatever that fire burns - fire ablaze on sticks is a stick fire, fire ablaze on twigs is a twig fire, fire ablaze on grass is a grass fire, fire ablaze on cowdung is a cowdung fire, fire ablaze on grain thrash is a grain thrash fire, fire ablaze on rubbish is a rubbish fire - so too is consciousness reckoned by the condition dependent upon which it arises. In the same manner consciousness arisen on account is eye and forms is eye consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of ear and sounds is ear consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of nose and smells is nose consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of tongue and tastes is taste consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of body and touch is body consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of mind and mind-objects is mind consciousness.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "><em>"Bhikkhus, do you see, This has arisen?" "Yes, venerable sir". "Do you see it arises supported by That?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Bhikkhus, Do you see if the support ceases, the arising too ceases?" "Yes, venerable sir."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">So we can see from here, there is no one single type of consciousness. There is actually six different types of consciousness, which arises due to interdependence and supporting conditions.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">The act of hearing music depends on many things: the ears, the air, the speakers, and so on... that act of cognizance is an arising with supporting conditions.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Consciousness is a pure cognizance manifestation. There is no 'self' involved... there is no 'self' hearing, seeing, there is pure seeing, pure hearing, everything happening without an experiencer. This is the nature of consciousness.

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">Consciousness is empty because it does not have an inherent, independent, permanent nature: consciousness is an act of cognizance that dependently originates with supporting conditions.</p>

              <p>On a related note:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">There are many people (even Buddhist masters and teachers) with some level of attainment or realization who continue to think of Consciousness as an ultimate Self/Absolute. They call it 'buddha-nature' but they have not realized Anatta yet... they have certain glimpses of the luminous essence of pure Awareness but they have not realized the empty nature. They will think that there is a permanent Absolute within which all impermanent manifestation of consciousness arise and subside. They do not see that what they have experienced (the I AM Presence/thoughtless beingness) is simply one manifestation of pure awareness relating to the mind-realm, that in actuality all manifestations (including seeing, hearing, etc) are equally a manifestation of pure cognizance arising due to supporting conditions. I have been through this stage before. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">They will say things like Buddha-nature is the ultimate and permanent Self beyond all five skandhas including impermanent consciousness. This is similar to the Hindus' view of Atman-Brahman. By propagating this view as Buddha's, they are in fact holding a position that will be put under the same scrutiny as Buddha did to Bhikkhu Sati, in other words these people are themselves 'destroying themselves and creating much demerits' by not teaching the right view and teaching it as if it is the Buddha's. Even though the intention may be sincere.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">I beg to differ from the eternalistic/Hindu view that Buddha-nature is the Pure Consciousnes that transcends the five skandhas by putting it this way: Five Skandhas IS the Buddha-Nature. (just as Zen Master Hui-neng and Dogen puts it: Impermanence IS Buddha-Nature)</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ">On this, I would like to quote from Lama Surya Das and Buddha himself:</p>

We are individual. We are each responsible for ourselves and our karma and our relations. Our individuality is comprised of these five aggregates or skandhas. We can work with that. It is actually an expression of the Buddha-nature.<br><br>Now, doesn't anybody want to say, "I didn't hear anything about Buddha-nature in the five skandhas. Where's the Buddha-nature? Who made that up?" That's the right question. What Buddha-nature? I never said anything about it. Who made that up? What enlightenment? What nirvana? Who made all that stuff up? Is it in us or elsewhere? How to get from "here" to "there"?<br><br>We're all looking for something to hang our hopes on, but when we really get down to the present moment, to our own experience, to clear seeing, we come to what Buddha said: "In hearing there is only hearing; no one hearing and nothing heard." There is just that moment, that hearing. You might think, "Oh, a beautiful bird." How do you know it's a bird? It might be a tape recorder. It might be bicycle brakes squeaking. In the first moment, there is just hearing, then we get busy, our minds and concepts get involved. The Buddha went through all the five senses. "In seeing there is just seeing; no one seeing and nothing seen." And so on, with tasting, touching, smelling, and thinking. Thoughts without a thinker. In thinking there is just thinking. There is just that momentary process. There is no thinker. The notion of an inner thinker is just a thought. We imagine that there is somebody thinking. It's like the Wizard of Oz. They thought there was this glorious wizard, but it was just a little man back there behind the screen, behind the veil. That's how it is with the ego. We think there's a great big monkey inside working the five windows, the five senses. Or maybe five monkeys, one for each sense; a whole chattering monkey house, which it sometimes feels like. But is there really a concrete individual or permanent soul inside at all? It seems more like that the lights are on, but no one is home!</em></span></p>

Thus it is throughout, up to the five skandhas and the six entrances, to the twelve places and the eighteen realms; the union and mixture of various causes and conditions account for their illusory and false existence, and the separation and dispersion of the causes and conditions result in their illusory and false extinction. Who would have thought that production and extinction, coming and going are fundamentally the eternal wonderful light of the Tathagata, the unmoving, all-pervading perfection, the wonderful nature of True Suchness! If within the true and eternal nature one seeks coming and going, confusion and enlightenment, or birth and death, one will never find them."</em></p>

              <p>There are intentions, but intentions are not the 'doer'.</p>
              <p>Intention is part of the 'being done'! Intention arises, which serves as a supporting condition for further arisings. There is no denying the importance of intentions in influencing and affecting our every moment of living. Intentions have an important role in life. But intention itself is not a doer: it is an arising with supporting conditions as well.</p>
              <p>If intention is a doer, then who is the doer of intention? You'll need an infinite regress of intentions... which is not the case.</p>
              <p>'No Self' does not mean no arisings... it just means all there is is arisings! Whatever you call 'your self' is really just these arisings... no self, no agent, doer, perceiver could be found could be found apart from this arising and passing phenomena. </p>
              <p>Reading this is happening right now without a doer and perceiver - it is simply pure perception without a perceiver.</p>
              <p>There is no 'you' in here reading the words 'over there'... you are the screen, the computer, the music playing, everything arising so to speak... though there is no 'you'.</p>
              <p>The universe is lifeless because it is purely spontaneous emergence (but it is spontaneity with supporting conditions) without 'doers' and 'perceivers' - but on the other hand Universe IS Consciousness and Life itself.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>Right View as taught by the Buddha is true. It is also the point whereby the liberation dynamics gets really started. When right view (no-self insight, etc) is established, 'you' will naturally understand why it is the truth and that it is the starting point of liberation dynamics.</p>
              <p>No, the Buddha's essential core teaching has not be distorted or misintepreted. It is deep... deeper than most people are willing to explore.</p>
              <p>Hope that you don't jump to a conclusion just yet...</p>

              learn/experience/do when there is a seperate "self". Once you have
              realised "no-self", you cannot reverse back to "self" anymore, it
              is a point of no return.</p>

              <p>Whatever you said about four foundations of mindfulness is alright... however mindfulness is not a conceptualization process. Mindfulness means bare naked observation of reality... it is also what gives rise to direct experiential insight provided there is right view. Here's an article on mindfulness I consider a 'must-read' for everyone practicing Buddhism: <span><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe13.html">Chapter 13</a></strong> ...(Mindfulness - Sati)</span></p>
              <p>About consciousness: in Buddhism, we do not say there is no consciousness. There is consciousness, but consciousness is not a Self. Consciousness is not an ultimate observer of objects... this is the ordinary being's thinking and even those with transcendental glimpses of the I AM Presence.</p>
              <p>So what is consciousness? In <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm">http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm</a></p>
              <p>The Buddha reprimanded a monk who thinks that consciousness '<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">is that which feels and experiences, that which reaps the results of good and evil actions done here and there' and that '</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'.</span></p>
              <p>Why is this monk reprimanded for holding such a view of consciousness? It is because he thinks that Consciousness is a soul, a Self that experiences and observes things and that this is ultimately that unchanging entity that transmigrates through different lifetimes.</p>
              <p>The Buddha furthermore states that </p>
              <p>Note that the Buddha is saying two things here: 1) Consciousness is a manifestation that dependently originates. 2) By holding on to the wrong view, you create much demerits for yourself and prevent your own enlightenment.</p>
              <p>So it goes two ways: having right view ensures your enlightenment, while holding on to the wrong view prevents awakening and further to propagate these views as truth or worse as Buddha's words (called slandering) destroys yourself and accumulate a lot of demerits. This is why having this discussion in this forum is very important, it is my wish that everyone can attain Nirvana ASAP.</p>
              <p>Now back to the topic of consciousness... now we understand that Consciousness is not a self, but a manifestation that dependently originates. It is an Arising... it is not a Self or a Soul, or an Observer/Experiencer/Feeler.</p>
              <p>What kind of arising is called consciousness? The Buddha further explains:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So we can see from here, there is no one single type of consciousness. There is actually six different types of consciousness, which arises due to interdependence and supporting conditions.</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The act of hearing music depends on many things: the ears, the air, the speakers, and so on... that act of cognizance is an arising with supporting conditions.</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Consciousness is a pure cognizance manifestation. There is no 'self' involved... there is no 'self' hearing, seeing, there is pure seeing, pure hearing, everything happening without an experiencer. This is the nature of consciousness. There is no 'you' in here watching the 'tree out there'... there is just the pure seeing of tree without a seer and external object being seen - there is no distance, only distantless pure visual consciousness.</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Lastly, I believe you hear from Heart Sutra that the five skandhas are empty and that forms, feelings, perception, volition and consciousness are all empty. What does 'empty' mean? Doesn't mean they don't exist, but that they interdependently originate, are impermanent, non-self, and thus are without an inherent, permanent essence. </p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Consciousness is empty because it does not have an inherent, independent, permanent nature: consciousness is an act of cognizance that dependently originates with supporting conditions.</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Everything we experience is an act of cognizance that appears to be solid, real, 'out there' but is actually just a dependently originated 'magic show'.</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Thus the Buddha says in Phena Sutta that consciousness is like a magic trick:</p>
              <p style="font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><em>Form is like a glob of foam; feeling, a bubble; perception, a mirage; fabrications, a banana tree; consciousness, a magic trick — this has been taught by the Kinsman of the Sun. However you observe them, appropriately examine them, they're empty, void to whoever sees them appropriately.</em></span></p>

              <p>How one is reborn and enters into the mother's womb is an interesting topic. What I understand is as long as we do not have these senses attachment as stated in the Heart Sutra (æ— çœ¼ no eyesï¼Œè€³ no earsï¼Œé¼» no noseï¼ŒèˆŒ no tongueï¼Œèº« no bodyï¼Œæ„� no feelings), with just the "stored" consciousness (é˜¿èµ–è€¶è¯†) alone is unable to be reborn as there is no attachment in "stored" consciousness.</p>
              <p>"Stored" consciousness (ç¬¬å…«é˜¿èµ–è€¶è¯†) has good and bad karma, so it is the cause. Effects will only happen if there is a right condition to make things happen.</p>
              <p>For example, just like you meet your enemy of your past life. Your "stored" consciousness will "throw out the seed", telling you to hate or do things to harm this enemy of your past life but if you are a Buddhist and have the right practice, you will change the situation.</p>
