            <div class='col-md body'>A series of courses design to meet your needs to become a 21 st century Buddhist! Whether as one who is curious to learn more about Buddhism or as someone who is eager to further nourish your seed of Buddhist understanding, we have the right course tailored just for you!<br><br>At Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, guiding you through every single step of your spiritual development to realize the ultimate meaning of happiness is our mission!<br><br><strong>Exploring Buddhism<br>Basic </strong><br><br>There are many people who consider themselves Buddhists but know little about the actual teachings of the Buddha. Some people also believe Buddhism to be out-of-date and full of superstitions. However, Buddhism is currently gaining much popularity in western countries as being non-dogmatic, practical and compatible with science. What does Buddhism offer? What is the attraction of this ancient teaching that has inspired many, including celebrities like Richard Gere, Keanu Reeves among others?<br><br>In this 12-session course, we will explore the main principles of Buddhism and let you discover for yourself how it can help you to find peace and satisfaction in your heart.<br><br><strong>Stages of the Path to Enlightenment<br>Intermediate course</strong><br><br>The Stages of the Path to Enlightenment is a comprehensive presentation of Buddhist philosophy in its practical application to the stages of mental development. It contains all the essential points of both the Theravada and the Mahayana, and reveals systematically the steps that we need to follow in order to proceed to the state of complete enlightenment, starting from where we are now. This course is designed as an intermediate Buddhist course and is meant mainly for those who already have a basic knowledge of Buddhism. It consists of three modules, each consisting of 12 sessions.<br><br><strong>Module 1: </strong><br><br>This human rebirth that you now have will not last forever. One day you will have to leave this body behind and move on to the next life. How can you ensure that you will have a good rebirth? The practices you need to undertake are subsumed under the small scope of the path to enlightenment.<br><br><strong>Module 2: </strong><br><br>Even though you may be reborn in a pleasant and comfortable situation by way of the practices of the small scope of the path to enlightenment, any kind of happiness you can possibly experience in cyclic existence is unstable and contaminated. The way to achieve pure everlasting peace is to be liberated from samsara completely. The methods for attaining nirvana are clearly outlined in the middle scope of the path to enlightenment.<br><br><strong>Module 3:</strong><br><br>Just like you, each and every living being wishes for happiness and does not want even the slightest suffering. By following the middle scope of the path to enlightenment you will be able to attain individual liberation for yourself, but you will not be equipped with the complete means to help others become free of suffering and attain true happiness. The way to train to attain full enlightenment or Buddhahood is described in the great scope of the path to enlightenment.<br><br><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">Enquiries:</span></span><br><a href="http://apmc@awarenessplace.com" rel="nofollow">apmc@awarenessplace.com</a><br><br>The course is conducted by Sister Sze Gee, who holds a BSc with honours in mathematics as well as a postgraduate diploma in education.Driven by her interest in the BuddhaÂ’s teachings, she left her job as a college teacher in 1997 to pursue studies in Buddhist philosophy covering subjects such as Abhidharma and Madhyamaka over 7 years.<br><br>Exposed to the West in her training, Sis Sze Gee is adept in teaching the dharma suited to the modern mind. Clarity and practicality in the presentation of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings is her trademark. She is currently a full-time staff of Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.<br><br></div>
