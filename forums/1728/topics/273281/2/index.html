It is what is presented as a conscious experience.<br><br>To TheGoodEarth:<br><br>I will define it in terms of practicality narrowing it within the context of pragmatism.  In pragmatic theory, Â‘rightÂ’ deals with behaving.  So here I will define Â‘right faithÂ’ as the correct way of behaving when adopting a particular faith.  The commandments defines the right faith in Christianity where as the precepts defines the right faith in Buddhism.  The Â‘TrueÂ’ of something in pragmatism refers to the effectiveness of an application in actuality.  I will define the Â‘true of faithÂ’ as the effectiveness of applying such a faith into actual living.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from the simile of the baby walking.<br>it had got from "testing faith" (somewhat blind) in taking the first steps to a more mature faith of walking.<br>why it begin with <span style="font-style: italic;">blind </span>is because there's a possiblity that it might take a fall. but no choice, it need to go thru the mistake before it can walk.<br>after less and less falls it gain confidence (in reality).  even so after it had grow up and are able to walk and run. can we say it has 100% confidence in walking? you may say it has "full" confidence/faith, BUT adults also take a fall sometimes.<br>can name me something u have "full" confidence where it cannot go wrong?<br><br>tis why, in Buddhism, <span style="font-style: italic;">faith </span>is said to be the <strong>root </strong>of all dharma/reality/nature, be it blind, or wrong or right or true etc.<br>faith is required. but i am refering to a <strong>neutral </strong>faith. Utimately, it must turn into Right faith or Confidence.<br>Yet that Confidence cannot become arrogance as arrogance oppose reality in the reality of cause and effect.<br>arrogance will not oppose reality unless you live alone by yourself. but we live as a whole. hence there's reality of cause and effect. if you act badly, people around will get affected. as people normally dislike arrogance. if you want to become a bad apple, you'll be outcast by people.<br><br>/\<br></div>

It's nature is love and bliss. In fact, from my experience that may be no distinction between love and bliss.<br><br>When it is seen/experienced, "you or self" must completely dissolve/disappear! This is the true meaning of surrendering one's will to God. That is also why in Buddhism there is 'no self'. But the 'Source' abide in all of us... We simply fail to see IT because our self/ego/I has not dissolved or surrendered enough.<br><br>Unfortunately, holy teachings have been misused and misinterpretation countless of times and countless of sequence by manipulative and unenlightenment leaders. Don't be a naive and trusting blind-follower!<br><br>Please do not believe in the honesty of mankind... however holy they may appear to be. Trust only in Direct Experience!<br><br>Seriously, I do not wish to recieve mental arguments... it really does not help at all.
