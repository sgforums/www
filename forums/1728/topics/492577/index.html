              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Emotions that provide us with unpleasant feelings have
              traditionally (and unfairly) been labelled “negative emotions.” People tend to
              want to avoid them, force them away, or silence them as soon as they emerge.
              They are the Rodney Dangerfield of emotions: they get no respect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The truth is, there is no such thing as a negative emotion,
              since each emotion has its own role and purpose. In fact, in the book, </span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #111111; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>The Upside of Your Dark Side</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">, authors Todd Kashdan, Ph.D., and Robert
              Biswas-Diener argue that in order to attain happiness, one has to welcome every
              emotion (pleasant or unpleasant) and learn how to make the best of them. It is
              not the emotion that is problematic but rather the way we deal with them that
              can be. Instead of pushing these emotions away, we should learn to welcome and
              listen to the important messages these feelings are trying to communicate to
              us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I have led emotion management programs for violent offenders
              for almost twenty years now, and I always cringe a little when I hear the term
              “negative emotions” spoken by therapists or speakers at conferences or events.
              The emotion I feel when this happens (disappointment) is triggered by my
              interpretation that either the person doesn’t really know what they are talking
              about or that they are infantilizing us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Human beings have the ability to experience a wide variety of
              emotions that span “feel good” to “uncomfortable.” Each emotion along this
              continuum has its function and provides important information about our
              environment. For instance, fear warns us about potential danger,</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #111111;"> </span></span><a href="http://psychcentral.com/disorders/anxiety/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #286ea0; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">anxiety</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #111111;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">can relate insecurities or
              unpreparedness, anger can signal that someone or something has transgressed us.
              It is not the emotion itself that is problematic. Rather, it is the way we deal
              with this information that can either help or hinder us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Learning to listen to the messages behind our emotions will
              help us learn more about our environment as well as ourselves. By harnessing
              our curiosity to understand the sources of our emotions, we are actually
              reducing their intensity and applying a very effective emotions management
              technique.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">For example, the disappointment I feel when I hear the term
              “negative emotions” dissipates as I try to question the reasons behind its use.
              Maybe it is just easier to divide the emotions into two categories in order to
              attribute relevant interventions to them. Maybe we are so used to hearing this
              term that it has naturally become part of our vocabulary. And thinking this way
              reduces the intensity of the unpleasantness associated with my disappointment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">You cannot avoid unpleasant emotions. They are part of the
              experience of being human (well, unless you are a psychopath). Trying to force
              them away might actually backfire. For example, try not to think about a pink
              poodle. I dare you. It’s impossible! Accept the image, accept that it was
              created by reading the words describing the image, and slowly the image will
              disappear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Pink poodle!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Okay, just kidding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But the point is, by merely describing the situation that is
              provoking the emotion, you risk reliving and intensifying it. Not a good idea
              if it is responsible for unpleasant feelings. I can’t tell you how many times
              I’ve had an inmate in my office get visibly upset just by describing something
              that happened to him ten or fifteen years ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">However, it is a recommended technique to describe the
              situation if the feeling you are experiencing is pleasant (gratitude,
              acceptance. love, etc.). In fact, reliving positive experiences is a great way
              to cultivate gratitude and increase your overall sense of</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #111111;"> </span></span><a href="http://blogs.psychcentral.com/dbt/2010/08/taking-responsibility-for-your-own-well-being/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #286ea0; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">well-being</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As a rule of thumb, try to analyze, question and be curious
              about the source of an emotion that is causing discomfort. This way, you will
              gain some sort of insight about what the emotion is trying to tell you.
              Furthermore, the more you understand the message it is trying to convey, the
              less intense the emotion will be. If it is associated to a conflict, problem
              solving will be that much easier thanks to your understanding of the situation,
              and your understanding will help keep you from acting impulsively due to
              intense unpleasant feelings.</span></p>

              Mindfulness teaches us to accept our emotions, be it good or bad. They are part of us, part of our emotions and part of what we are. Our thoughts too.
              
              I experienced Mindfulness before and i will say it certainly helped me get to grips with myself.
              
              Now, good things bad things happen i am not easily antagonized by them.
              
              Instead, i chose to select how i will react or behave, not react based on the emotions.
