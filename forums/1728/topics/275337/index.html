I guess I shld really keep that in mind.<br><br>I guess I had to be more mindful from now and and be more skillful and wise in my speech...<br><br>Update: something very wise from Thusness just now... "whatever it is, it has nothing to do with practice...so don't engage too much into such issues unncessary."<br><br>Here's a poem by my Master:<br><br><img src="http://xs74.xs.to/pics/06135/song1.GIF"></div>

They should be indifferent to others' merit or demerit, good or evil, for such an attitude accords with the 'imperturbability of the Essence of Mind'. Learned Audience, a man unenlightened may be unperturbed physically, but as soon as he opens his mouth he criticizes others and talks about their merits or demerits, ability or weakness, good or evil; thus he deviates from the right course.<br><br>--------<br><br>Thereupon Shen Hui asked the Patriarch, "In your meditation, Sir, do you see (your Essence of Mind) or not?" Striking him three blows with his staff, the Patriarch asked him whether he felt pain or not. "Painful and not painful," replied Shen Hui. "I see and I see not," retorted the Patriarch. "How is it that you see and see not?" asked Shen Hui. "What I see is my own faults," replied the Patriarch. "What I do not see is the good, the evil, the merit and the demerit of others. That is why I see and I see not. Now tell me what you mean by 'painful and not painful'. If you feel no pain, you would be as a piece of wood or stone. On the other hand, should you feel pain, and anger of hatred is thereby aroused, you would be in the same position as an ordinary man. "The 'seeing' and 'not-seeing' you referred to are a pair of opposites; while 'painful' and 'not painful' belong to conditioned Dharma which becomes and ceases.</span><br><br>~ 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My master always emphasize to us that meditation is very important and is a basic method to help the practice of all dharma door. During meditation, we are able to see more clearly all kind of thoughts that we normally can't even notice when our mind is not stable. Whether all these phenomeon is good or bad, we should remain untouched.<br>The truth of life is actually very simple, the reason why buddhism practice sounds so complicated is because our wrong perception is so deep rooted and complicated that it needs many different ways to eradicate them.<br><br>The challenge is there are so many ways of practice for different level of people, how do we know when to attach, when to grow dislike &amp; when to let go especially this is something that we probably never go through in the past. This is when faith &amp; trust to the teacher &amp; triples gems come useful. I have seen buddhist who is so attached to his own wrong perception, until any profound teaching and practice only become a subject of attachment. This is really a waste of dharma.<br><br>To them, if they have a good teacher to follow and a strong faith &amp; relationship between them, they will be back to the right track very soon.<br>This is when even blind faith come into useful. To those with wrong perception, their "non-blind" faith is associated with their own view that will always become an obstacle to practice.</div>

What for go and study other people from top to bottom, criticize their behavior, debate with them.<br>Other than ensuring the existence of self and increase your hatred and greed, you don't achieve anything at all. fyi, growing hatred over someone will create bad karma too.<br><br>When you notice other people's mistake, know it then let go, that's all, no need to attach to it, neither you need to detach from it.<br>A cup is empty in nature with or without you taking it away.

There is no bad or good person in reality. A bad person can be kind to his loved ones and mean to you. So is he a bad or good person?<br><br></div>
