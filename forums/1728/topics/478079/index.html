              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>This is a question that deserves extended treatment. While we could begin with discussions of modern-day theory and practice, my preference is to begin with the original texts, at least insofar as we can get a handle on them. Although they may eventually lead us astray, at least it’s worthwhile to have them under our belts. A good place to begin is with a quote from the eminent Buddhist scholar Richard Gombrich’s <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>TheravÄ�da Buddhism</span></em> (2nd Ed.), provided by <a href="http://secularbuddhism.org/forum/?mingleforumaction=profile&amp;id=370"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mufi</span></span></a> in the discussion:</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>Did the Buddha think it possible for a lay person to attain Enlightenment? Probably not. He measured spiritual progress in four stages. In the first, called “stream entry”, one was guaranteed that one would have at most seven more lives and would never be reborn in a station lower than human. (At first, most people who accepted his view of kamma were held to have attained this.) At the second stage, the “once-returner” faced only one more life on earth. The “non-returners” would not be reborn in this world but in a high heaven, from which their attainment of nibbÄ�na was guaranteed. Enlightenment was the fourth and final stage.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>When asked about the spiritual attainments of his followers, the Buddha said that many hundreds of lay followers, both male and female, had become “non-returners.” They had given up sexual activity. He did not explicitly say that no lay follower attained nirvana in this life, but that is the implication. Elsewhere there is a short list of names of lay disciples, all male, who are said to have reached nibbÄ�na, but it is a mere list and so placed that it could well be a late addition to the Canon. The tradition that the Buddha’s father attained Enlightenment as a layman is post-canonical. A post-canonical Pali text says that lay life is not livable for an Enlightened person, so if a layman becomes Enlightened he (or she) will either enter the Sangha or die within the day. On the other hand, there are plenty of canonical cases of laymen and laywomen who are said to have made spiritual progress. (pp. 75-6)</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>Gombrich’s conclusion, then, is that the Buddha probably didn’t think laypeople could attain nibbÄ�na; at best they could attain the stage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagami"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">anÄ�gÄ�mi</span></span></a> or “non-returner”.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>Indeed, <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Majjhima NikÄ�ya</span></em> 68 and 73 include mention of lay followers having reached various stages along the path, however the suttas do not include any mention of them having attained nibbÄ�na. Only bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were said to have got that far. However the Buddha never said explicitly that there were no such accomplished lay followers, nor did he say that it would be impossible for lay followers to achieve nibbÄ�na. There are at least plausible reasons why the Buddha might not have raised the issue of lay followers and nibbÄ�na in these contexts: in MN 68, the Buddha is in a somewhat contentious argument with his bhikkhus about making an apparently extravagant claim (an issue <a href="http://secularbuddhism.org/2012/11/09/at-na%C3%A1%C2%B8%C2%B7akapana-did-the-buddha-scheme-to-deceive/"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I discussed in a blog post</span></span></a>); and in MN 73, the discussion comes in the form of questions from Vacchagotta the wanderer, who may simply not have expected laypeople to have been capable of attaining nibbÄ�na.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>On the other hand, <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Sa</span></em></span><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;'>á¹ƒ</span></em><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>yutta NikÄ�ya</span></em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '> 55.37 suggests that laypeople may become “accomplished in wisdom” leading to “the complete destruction of suffering”, although admittedly this passage does not establish that any have done so, nor that they could explicitly have done so while remaining laypeople. The strongest evidence that the Buddha allowed for lay arahants is the list that appears in <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>A</span></em></span><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;'>á¹‡</span></em><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>guttara NikÄ�ya</span></em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '> 6.119-139: these are “householders” and “lay followers” each of whom is said to have “become a seer of the deathless, one who lives having realized the deathless.” These are phrases only used of arahants: those who have achieved nibbÄ�na.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>Gombrich minimizes this passage, above, by saying that “it is a mere list and so placed that it could well be a late addition to the Canon”. It’s true that this is “a mere list”, and it appears quite late in the Book of the Sixes, but it does not appear right at the end of that book, and at any rate without some independent evidence that it is a later addition, that sort of move is not sufficient to convince. On that criterion, very many passages indeed “could well be late additions”.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>One good place to look for answers to this question would be to look at Sanskrit and Chinese <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Ä€gamas</span></em>, in particular the <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Sa</span></em></span><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;'>á¹ƒ</span></em><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>yukta Ä€gama</span></em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>, parallel to the PÄ�li <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Sa</span></em></span><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;'>á¹ƒ</span></em><em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>yutta NikÄ�ya</span></em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>. If the list did not appear in the <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Ä€gamas</span></em>, that would be some evidence that it were a later addition. <a href="http://kongmu.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/new-english-samyukta-agama-translation/"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhikkhu AnÄ�layo is undertaking such a translation from the Chinese</span></span></a>, however I have no idea about the status of this section.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>It’s well to keep in mind, though, that often suttas appear in different <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Ä€gamas</span></em> than they do <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>NikÄ�yas</span></em>, so a full search for the relevant section would include other, related canonical texts as well.</span></p>

I can’t see why. Indeed, it’s more likely that such editors might work to suppress such lists. This of course proves nothing, it simply points up the thin nature of Gombrich’s claim.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>It is more convincing to note that the list of lay arahants is isolated in the Canon. Any <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>single</span></em> passage making an unusual claim, or any small selection thereof, should be looked at with greater scrutiny than passages that appear over and over again in the Canon. Isolated passages have a greater chance to be interpolations or mistakes of one kind or another. So let us look elsewhere for evidence.</span></p>

What if I, having shaved off my hair &amp; beard and putting on the ochre robe, were to go forth from the household life into homelessness?’ (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.036.than.html"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MN 36.12</span></span></a>)</span></p>

He could have made the stronger claim, and simply said that the living of a perfect life as a householder was impossible, yet he did not. The fact that he did not do so provides some evidence that he may have thought a householder could attain nibbÄ�na.</span></p>

There all we find is that one should develop ethical and meditative skills to the end of achieving wisdom and insight into the Four Noble Truths. There is nothing explicitly monastic about the Eightfold Path.</span></p>

This comes in the <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Milindapañha</span></em>, in a question asked by King Milinda of the Buddhist monk NÄ�gasena:</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>Venerable NÄ�gasena, your people say: “Whosoever has attained, as a layman, to Arahatship, one of two conditions are possible to him, and no other — either that very day he enters the Order, or he dies away, for beyond that day he cannot last.” 264-265 (IV.7.7-8).</span></p>

Further, NÄ�gasena’s discussion that follows provides questionable reasoning in its support. Basically he suggests that a householder is too weak to support arahantship without becoming ordained, just as “a tiny blade of grass when a heavy rock is placed upon it will, through its weakness, break off and give way …” There is no argument provided as to why ordination would provide strength that the <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>mere</span></em> achievement of nibbÄ�na could not.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #2e2e2e; font-size: 13pt;   '>It’s worth noting that the <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>canonical</span></em> passage cited above at SN 55.37 claims that certain of these householders and laypeople “live” having realized nibbÄ�na. This at least suggests that they were able to persist in that state for longer than a single day, and indeed that they might have been alive when the text was first composed.</span></p>

This amounts to solid, pedestrian advice such as preserving the five precepts, taking care of family, business, making good friends, and being generous to those in need, particularly ascetics.

On the surface level there are differences of ethics and outward behavior: one is to behave, for example, without spite, anger, or arrogance. But the deeper difference involves the sensual pleasures. The Buddha provided a number of similes illustrating the dangers of sensual pleasure, showing that they “they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in them is great.” As Justin Whitaker notes in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2008/07/sutta-meditations-mn-54-the-potaliya-sutta.html"><span style="color: #00395a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">his treatment of this sutta</span></span></a>, the Buddha stresses the importance of meditation.

That is, they would need to cease clinging to the household life, and be willing to live more or less the life of a monastic.</span></p>

Assuming there is such a state as the complete and (relatively) permanent cessation of dukkha described in the Third Noble Truth, is it something we can reasonably achieve without taking on robes? I don’t have a final answer to that question, but I think we can certainly do worse than by following the Buddha’s suggestions in the suttas that such a path is at the least very difficult.</span></p>

And then there’s the list of lay arahants in SN 55.37 that seems to seal the case, unless someone can come up with an independent reason for finding the passage to have been a later addition.</span></p>

The larger issue has to do with difficulty. Getting oneself to a place without clinging, without greed, hatred, or ill will, without egotism or arrogance, without delusion or ignorance about impermanence, dukkha, or not-self, seems a tall enough order for any person in a lifetime. And it’s even more so if we add that the householder (like myself for instance) has spouse, family, friends, and possessions to which we may wish to become less attached in certain healthy ways, but which we do not want to renounce completely. Thus the dilemma of modern, secularized practice.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">CHAPTER 10:<span>  </span>LAYMAN PANG </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Sometimes ordinary folks get the idea that the meaning of
              Chan is so profound that only men and women who've been ordained in the Dharma
              can possibly fathom it.<span>  </span>But that's just
              not so.<span>  </span>Actually, we priests often feel
              that we're in way over our heads.<span>  </span>And
              every now and then, while we splash about, trying to look good treading water
              in our nice uniforms, along comes a civilian who zips by us, swimming like an
              Olympic champion.<span>  </span>Such a civilian was
              Layman Pang.<span>  </span>He would have won Chan's
              gold medal.<span>  </span>He's been a hero not only to
              centuries worth of other laymen, but also, I confess, to every priest who's
              ever studied his winning style.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang lived during the latter half of the Eighth
              Century, a golden age for Chan.<span>  </span>He was
              an educated family man - he had a wife and a son and daughter - and was
              well-enough off financially to be able to devote his time to Buddhist
              studies.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>He got the idea that a person needed solitude in order to
              meditate and ponder the Dharma, so he built himself a little one-room monastery
              near his family home.<span>  </span>Every day he went
              there to study and practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>His wife, son and daughter studied the Dharma, too; but
              they stayed in the family house, conducting their business and doing their
              chores, incorporating Buddhism into their daily lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang had submerged himself in the sutras and one
              day he found that he, too, was in over his head.<span>  </span>He hadn't learned to swim yet.<span>  </span>On that day, he stormed out of his
              monastery-hut and, in abject frustration, complained to his wife,
              "Difficult!<span>  </span>Difficult!<span>  </span>Difficult!<span>  </span>Trying to grasp so many facts is like trying to store sesame seeds in
              the leaves of a tree top!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>His wife retorted, "Easy!<span>  </span>Easy!<span>  </span>Easy!<span>  </span>You've been studying words,
              but I study the grass and find the Buddha Self reflected in every drop of dew."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Now, Layman Pang's daughter, Ling Zhao, was listening to
              this verbal splashing, so she went swimming by.<span>  </span>"Two old people foolishly chattering!" she called.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Just a minute!" shouted Layman Pang.<span>  </span>"If you're so smart, tell us your
              method."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Ling Zhao returned to her parents and said gently,
              "It's not difficult, and it's not easy.<span>  </span>When I'm hungry, I eat.<span>  </span>When I'm
              tired, I sleep."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Ling Zhao had mastered Natural Chan.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang learned a lot that day.<span>  </span>He understood so much that he put away his
              books, locked his little monastery-hut, and decided to visit different Chan
              masters to test his understanding.<span>  </span>He
              still couldn't compete against his own daughter, but he was getting pretty
              good.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Eventually he wound up at Nan Yue Mountain where Master
              Shi Tou had a monastic retreat.<span>  </span>Layman
              Pang went directly to the master and asked, "Where can I find a man who's
              unattached to material things?" Master Shi Tou slowly raised his hand and
              closed Pang's mouth.<span>  </span>In that one
              gesture, Pang's Chan really deepened.<span>  </span>He
              stayed at Nan Yueh for many months.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>All the monks there watched him and became quite curious
              about his Natural Chan, his perfect equanimity.<span>  </span>Even Master Shi Tou was moved to ask him what his secret was.<span>  </span>"Everyone marvels at your methods,"
              said Shi Tou.<span>  </span>"Tell me.<span>  </span>Do you have any special powers?" </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang just smiled and said, "No, no special
              powers.<span>  </span>My day is filled with humble
              activities and I just keep my mind in harmony with my tasks.<span>  </span>I accept what comes without desire or
              aversion.<span>  </span>When encountering other
              people, I maintain an uncritical attitude, never admiring, never condemning.<span>  </span>To me, red is red and not crimson or
              scarlet.<span>  </span>So, what marvelous method do I
              use?<span>  </span>Well, when I chop wood, I chop
              wood; and when I carry water, I carry water." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Master Shi Tou was understandably impressed by this
              response.<span>  </span>He wanted Pang to join his
              Sangha.<span>  </span>"A fellow like you
              shouldn't remain a layman," said Shi Tou.<span>  </span>"Why don't you shave your head and become a monk?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>The proposition signaled the end of Pang's sojourn with
              Shi Tou.<span>  </span>Clearly, he could learn no more
              from this master.<span>  </span>Pang responded with a
              simple remark.<span>  </span>"I'll do what I'll
              do," and what he did was leave.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>He next showed up at the doorstep of the formidable
              Master Ma Zu.<span>  </span>Again he asked the master,
              "Where can I find a man who's unattached to material things?" Ma Tzu
              frowned and replied, "I'll tell you after you've swallowed West River in
              one gulp."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>In grasping that one remark, Pang was able to complete
              his enlightenment.<span>  </span>He saw that
              Uncritical Mind was not enough.<span>  </span>His mind
              had to become as immense as Buddha Mind; it had to encompass all Samsara and Nirvana,
              to expand into Infinity's Void.<span>  </span>Such a
              mind could swallow the Pacific.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang stayed with Master Ma Zu until he discovered
              one day that he had no more to learn from him, either.<span>  </span>On that particular occasion, Pang approached
              Ma Zu and, standing over him, said, "An enlightened fellow asks you to
              look up." Ma Zu deliberately looked straight down.<span>  </span>Layman Pang sighed, "How beautifully you
              play the stringless lute!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>At this point, Ma Zu had confirmed that there was no
              difference between human beings, that they were truly one and the same
              individual.<span>  </span>As Pang had looked down, Ma
              Zu would look down.<span>  </span>There was no one
              else to look up.<span>  </span>But then,
              unaccountably, Ma Zu looked straight up and broke the spell, so to speak.<span>  </span>So Layman Pang bowed low and remained in that
              obeisance of finality as Ma Zu rose and began to walk away.<span>  </span>As the Master brushed past him, the Layman
              whispered, "Bungled it, didn't you...<span>  </span>trying to be clever." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang had attained mastery and every master he
              encountered acknowledged this.<span>  </span>But what
              is evident to a master is not always evident to an ordinary monk.<span>  </span>One winter day, while Pang was leaving the
              monastery of Master Yao Shan, some young monks, who were disdainful of his
              status as a mere layman, accompanied him to the front door.<span>  </span>When Pang looked outside, he saw that it was
              snowing.<span>  </span>"Good snow!" he
              said.<span>  </span>"The flakes do not fall
              elsewhere." A monk named Quan, who was as impudent as he was stupid,
              completely missed the wit in Pang's remark.<span>  </span>He mocked the Layman, asking sarcastically, "Where did you expect
              the flakes to fall?" </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Now, Pang was good naturedly complimenting the snow for
              not falling in the kitchen or the meditation hall, that is to say, for falling
              where snow was supposed to fall - in the courtyard and fields, on the trees and
              roads.<span>  </span>Pang knew that he would have to
              walk a long distance in that bitterly cold snow, and he had accepted that fact
              without distress.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>But Pang not only had the wisdom of a master, he had the
              temper, too.<span>  </span>When he saw the sneer on
              the young monk's face, he struck him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"How dare you!" said the monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"And you're an ordained monk?" asked Pang
              incredulously.<span>  </span>"Why, you'd be
              rejected at Hell's gates!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Just what do you mean by that?" demanded the
              monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Pang struck him again.<span>  </span>"I mean that though you have eyes, ears and tongue, you're
              absolutely blind, deaf, and dumb." Then he calmly went out into the snow
              as if it were just so much sunshine.<span>  </span>He
              had given the monk quite a lesson.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>But usually he was extremely kind and patient with those
              he instructed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>One day, as he listened to a man who was trying to
              explain the Diamond Sutra, he noticed that the fellow was struggling with the
              meaning of a line that dealt with the nonexistence of the ego personality.<span>  </span>"Perhaps I can help you," Pang
              said.<span>  </span>"Do you understand that that
              which is conditional and changing is not real and that which is unconditional
              and immutable is real?" </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Yes," replied the commentator.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Then is it not true that egos are conditional and
              changing, that no ego is the same from one minute to the next?<span>  </span>Is it not true that with each passing minute,
              depending on circumstances and conditions, we acquire new information and new
              experiences just as we forget old information and experiences? <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Yes," agreed the commentator.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"But what is there about us that is unconditional
              and unchanging?<span>  </span>asked Pang.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>"Our common Buddha Nature!" replied the
              commentator, suddenly smiling, suddenly understanding.<span>  </span>"That alone is real!<span>  </span>The rest is mere illusion!" He was so
              happy that he inspired Pang to write him a poem: Since there is neither ego nor
              personality Who is distant and who is close?<span>  </span>Take my advice and quit talking about reality.<span>  </span>Experience it directly, for yourself.<span>  </span>The nature of the Diamond Wisdom Is truth in
              all its singular purity.<span>  </span>Fictitious egos
              can't divide or soil it.<span>  </span>The
              expressions, "I hear," "I believe," "I
              understand," Are simply expedient expressions Tools in the
              diamond-cutter's hands.<span>  </span>When the work's
              done, he puts them down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Layman Pang and his daughter Ling Zhao traveled around
              China meeting their expenses by selling bamboo articles they made.<span>  </span>They grew old together, becoming legends of
              enlightenment.<span>  </span>Their last residence was
              a mountain cave.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Pang knew that it was time for him to lay his burden
              down.<span>  </span>He was very tired and could not go
              on.<span>  </span>Inside the cave there was one
              particular rock that he always sat on when meditating; so he took his seat and,
              intending to pass away when the sun was directly overhead, he sent Ling Zhao
              outside to watch for the moment that noon had come.<span>  </span>In a few minutes, however, Ling Zhao returned
              to the cave breathless with excitement.<span>  </span>"Oh, Father," she shouted, "you must come outside and see
              this!<span>  </span>There's been an eclipse of the
              sun!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>Well, this was an extraordinary occurrence if ever there
              was one.<span>  </span>Pang could not resist having a
              look at it.<span>  </span>So he rose from his
              meditation rock and went outside.<span>  </span>He
              looked and looked but there was no eclipse.<span>  </span>Noon had come, that was all.<span>  </span>But
              where was Ling Zhao?<span>  </span>Pang returned to
              the cave and found her dead, her body sitting upright on his meditation
              rock.<span>  </span>"Oh, that girl!" cried
              Pang.<span>  </span>"She always was ahead of
              me."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>            </span>He buried her and then, a week later, he, too, entered
              Nirvana.<span>  </span>His body was cremated and the
              ashes scattered on the waters of a nearby lake.<span>  </span></span></p>
