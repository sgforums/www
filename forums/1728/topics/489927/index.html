              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When the Buddha says, “I know of no single thing more conducive to great
              harm than an unrestrained mind,” I think he is referring, in part, to the
              current penchant for multitasking. When the mind tries to do several things at
              once, it does not do any of them very well. This is an empirical fact proven by
              numerous experiments, and it is easy to test out for yourself: try texting a
              message while catching the latest baseball scores on the radio and discussing
              some recent relationship difficulty with your partner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is not that the mind is incapable of such feats of parallel
              processing—it’s just not a very healthy thing to do. One image in the Pali
              texts compares the flow of consciousness to a mountain stream flowing swiftly
              downhill. If there are several outlets through which the water is dispersed,
              when it reaches the plain it will be little more than a trickle. Mental energy
              is finite, and our mind is diminished in direct proportion to how much its
              attention is fractured. The problem is not so much attention deficit as it is
              attention dispersion, when the available attention is spread thin. Just like
              water spreading out to cover a surface, the wider the expanse the shallower the
              depth. By trying to do many things at once, we train the mind to process
              information in ways that may well be effective, but for a price: we can no
              longer be deeply aware of what we are doing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Of course, being deeply aware of what we are doing is the very crux of
              the Buddhist teachings, which is why the practice of meditation is so important
              for unifying and consolidating the mind. The Buddha said, “I know of no single
              thing more conducive to great welfare than a developed mind.” Concentration
              practice, known as <em>samadhi</em>, consists of gathering together and placing
              the mind upon an object of the senses, or upon a mental object. We do this
              reflexively all the time, but in Buddhist practice we are invited to do it with
              deliberate intention, with sustained energy, and with consistency over multiple
              mind moments.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is natural for the mind to resist such discipline and to wander off
              to any aspect of experience that is new, unusual, or apparently more
              interesting. Early humans did not survive in nature by ignoring incoming
              stimuli; like birds or chipmunks, we are more accustomed to glancing around
              constantly, attentive to both threat and opportunity. But most of us no longer
              live in a hostile natural environment, and the threats that confront us in the
              meditation hall are usually manufactured by our minds. Cultivating mental
              focus, consistently returning to a primary object, and settling into
              ever-deeper states of tranquility helps to gradually reign in the mind’s
              wandering in a way that consolidates the power of awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>According to the Buddhist way of looking at things, each moment of
              consciousness is a precious gift. Awareness itself is the primary currency of
              the human condition, and as such it deserves to be spent carefully. Sitting
              quietly in a serene environment, letting go of the various petty disturbances
              that roil and diminish consciousness, and experiencing as fully as possible the
              poignancy of this fleeting moment—this is an enterprise of deep intrinsic
              value, an aesthetic experience beyond words. The more unified, stable,
              luminous, and attentive the mind is at this moment, the more profound the
              experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Our contemporary view of consciousness is so different from this, so
              much less. It is as if the accomplishment of mere tasks is of primary value,
              while the quality of awareness with which these tasks are undertaken is
              irrelevant. One can hurtle through the day doing this, that, and the other
              thing—often simultaneously—with great busyness and pressure, only to relax in
              the evening by trying to keep up with images that flash across the television
              screen multiple times per second. For many of us, the deep states of tranquil
              alertness of which the mind is capable are entirely unknown.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Yes, the chattering, cavorting, cacophonous monkey mind is capable of
              clever deeds and great mischief, and these things are not entirely without
              value. But the mind is also capable of settling down, gathering its power, and
              turning its gaze upon itself, and in such instances it can come to know itself
              deeply. Buddhists call this gaining wisdom, and this too is a valuable thing to
              do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>More importantly, perhaps, it is a healthy thing to do. It is now well
              known that a restful body is healthier than a body in constant states of
              stress. It is becoming better known that a restful mind is healthier than a
              mind beset with anxiety, compulsion, addiction, and other agitating states. It
              may even turn out to be the case that a restful society is healthier than one
              beset with tension, prejudice, exploitation, and war. I hope we have a chance
              to find out someday.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Meanwhile, peace is accessible. This, too, is an empirically
              demonstrable fact: try turning off the radio, the phone, the computer, and the
              TV; sit comfortably in a quiet place, relaxing the body and mind; mindfully breathe
              in, mindfully breathe out, and abandon—just for now—any thought or response
              that tends to disperse and divide your awareness. As you do this successfully
              for several moments in a row, you will find the mind gradually becoming more
              tranquil, more focused, more clear, and more powerful. The Buddha might have
              said: “I know of no single thing healthier than doing one thing at a time.”</span></p>
