              <p class="tall"><em>David
              Loy is Besl Professor of Ethics/Religion and Society at Xavier
              University in Cincinnati. His work is primarily in comparative
              philosophy and religion, particularly comparing Buddhist with modern
              Western thought. His many books include </em>The Great Awakening: A Buddhist Social Theory,<em> and </em>Money, Sex, War, Karma: Notes for a Buddhist Revolution.<em> A Zen practitioner for many years, he is qualified as a teacher in the Sanbo Kyodan tradition of Japanese Buddhism.</em></p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">David Loy: </span>Is
              the current financial and economic crisis a good thing? I wouldn’t want
              to minimize the suffering it’s creating for many people, but the world
              economy is an unjust system, and absolutely unsustainable. If we don’t
              know how else to transform it, maybe it’s better that it collapse
              sooner rather than later so as to lessen the long-range impact both on
              people and on the biosphere. Our economic system is devastating the
              Earth. The financial losses from this collapse may amount to several
              trillions of dollars, but who can compute the value of the rain forests
              we have been cutting down? What price do you put on species extinction
              or global warming?</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">Inquiring Mind: </span>What do you see as a Buddhist approach to this current situation?</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">DL: </span>On
              some level, the Buddhist solution is always the same—awaken yourself
              and live in harmony with others. In our time, especially, that means
              learning how to live in harmony with the biosphere. Our economic system
              has to be ecologically sustainable, and it has to work to the mutual
              benefit of everyone, rather than to just a small percentage of the
              Earth’s population.</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">IM: </span>The Buddha and his followers chose a form of communalism or socialism: the Sangha.</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">DL: </span>That’s
              true. The Buddhist scholar Trevor Ling believed that the Buddha wasn’t
              just forming a small group of monastics to support their own
              realization, but that he was modeling a broader, transformative vision
              for how society should function. Did he perhaps see the Sangha as the
              example or “vanguard’ for a more egalitarian social order? And more
              recently, the great twentieth-century Thai reformer Buddhadasa proposed
              what he called “dhammic socialism.”</p>
              <p class="textIndent">But
              what is most distinctive about the Buddha’s social analysis is that the
              fundamental dichotomy is not between good and evil but between
              delusion/ignorance on one side and wisdom/enlightenment on the other.
              The challenge is to understand our economic system not primarily in
              terms of some people selfishly exploiting others but instead as a
              system of collective greed and delusion. Some suffer much more than
              others, of course, but even those at the top are trapped by their own
              ego-based cravings.</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">IM:</span> So the current economic breakdown may be a “heavenly messenger”—a great
              opportunity for collective insight—as people begin to see more clearly
              into the fundamental flaws of the system. You say that you would like
              to see Buddhists step forward more vigorously at this time to offer an
              alternative perspective to the world.</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">DL:</span> Yes. I’m encouraged by the “gross national happiness” movement inspired
              by Bhutan, for example. And recently there have been several Buddhist
              economics conferences, most notably in Thailand. Perhaps this is an
              idea whose time has come. Unfortunately, the people in politics who are
              closest to the Buddhist analysis—liberals, progressives and other
              left-of-center groups—often dismiss the Buddhist approach as simply
              “religious.” It’s Marxism’s old “opiate of the masses” critique. Maybe
              now, in the middle of our discontent, they will be encouraged to take a
              fresh look.</p>
              <p class="tall"><span class="textInterviewer">According to Legend,</span> Midas was a Lydian king who was offered any reward he wanted for
              helping the god Dionysus. Although already fabulously wealthy, he asked
              that whatever he touched might turn to gold. Midas enjoyed his new
              powers, transforming everything in sight—until it came to be
              dinnertime. He took a bite—cha-ching! The food in his mouth turned to
              gold. He took a sip of wine—cha-ching! It solidified into gold. He
              hugged his daughter—cha-ching! She hardened into a golden statue. In
              despair, Midas pleaded for Dionysus to deliver him from this hateful
              power. Fortunately, the god obliged; Dionysus sent Midas to wash in the
              river Pactolus, which cleansed him of what he now realized was a curse.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">We
              are all familiar with this story. Despite its simplicity it is one of
              the most profound of all Greek myths. So why do I retell it now?
              Because today it is more important than ever: it can help us understand
              the financial and economic crisis that has just begun and that is about
              to transform all of our lives.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">Obviously,
              the Midas story is about greed, the first of the “three poisons,” or
              three unwholesome roots, according to the Buddha (the others being ill
              will and delusion). But the moral of this tale is about much more than
              greed. Midas valued gold more than anything else, so the great irony is
              his realization that a golden touch makes everything else worthless. He
              couldn’t eat or drink gold, and he certainly couldn’t love it the way
              that he loved his daughter.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">By
              no coincidence, the same is true of our own currency: even a $100 bill
              has no value in itself. It’s just a piece of paper—in effect, nothing.
              We can’t eat it, drink it, live in it, ride on it, etc. When we treat
              money as the most valuable thing in the world, that’s simply because we
              have collectively agreed to make it so. We forget that money is a
              social construct—a kind of group fantasy. The anthropologist Weston
              LaBarre called it a psychosis that has become normal, “an
              institutionalized dream that everyone is having at once.” As long as we
              keep dreaming together, it continues to work as the socially
              agreed-upon means that enables us to convert something (a day’s work,
              for example) into something else (bags of groceries, perhaps).</p>
              <p class="textIndent">Yet
              as Midas reminds us, money can also become a curse. In more
              psychological terms, the danger is that means and ends become reversed,
              so that the means of life becomes the goal itself. As Arthur
              Schopenhauer put it, money is abstract happiness, so someone who is no
              longer capable of concrete happiness can set his heart on money. Money
              becomes “frozen desire”—not desire for anything in particular but a
              symbol for the satisfaction of desire in general. But what does the
              Buddha say about desire? Frozen or not, it remains the root cause of
              suffering.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">The news
              media have also been telling us that the financial crisis is due to
              desire—or, as they put it, the excessive greed of Wall Street
              speculators and the unbridled spending of Main Street borrowers. But
              the problem goes much deeper, and our predicament is much worse. Our
              financial and economic system has institutionalized the Midas touch. To
              use another metaphor, the “Midas problem” is not like a virus that has
              infected the economic hard drive; rather, it has become the software
              that runs our economy.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">The
              Buddha’s first noble truth identifies dukkha (“suffering,
              dissatisfaction”) as inherent to the human condition: it is the nature
              of an unawakened mind to be bothered by a feeling of lack. Our society
              conditions us to understand this sense of lack as lack of enough money,
              so that we always want more, like Midas. Our economic system
              institutionalizes this lack into a collective craving that can never be
              satisfied. Consumers never consume enough, corporations are never
              profitable enough, the GDP can never be big enough, etc. The goal of
              the system is to end up with more money than we started with, to turn
              whatever we touch to gold. Those who think like Midas rise to the top.
              Investors seek increasing returns in the form of dividends and higher
              share prices. This generalized expectation translates into an
              impersonal but constant demand for ever more profit and growth, a
              desire that can never be fully satisfied.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">But
              who is responsible for this unrelenting emphasis on profitability and
              growth? That’s the point: we all participate—as workers, employers,
              consumers, investors and pensioners. The ultimate irony—or rather,
              tragedy—of this process is that everything that gives life value is
              devalued into a means for maximizing something that has no value
              whatsoever in itself. Everything becomes a means to making more money.
              “Everything” in this case includes the biosphere (resources), human
              life (labor), and society itself (we must continually adapt to the
              changing requirements of the economy).</p>
              <p class="textIndent">It
              is becoming increasingly obvious that this system is unsustainable
              because it involves a growth obsession that, left to itself, will not
              cease until the whole of the biosphere has been converted into profit.
              Capitalism made more sense a couple centuries ago when the Earth seemed
              infinite and capital (money for investment) was relatively scarce.
              Today the obvious metaphor is cancer on a planetary scale. Cells become
              cancerous when they mutate into uncontrolled growth and spread
              throughout the body to disrupt its healthy functioning. That is not a
              bad description of what might be called Midas globalization.</p>
              <p class="textIndent">Midas
              could ask Dionysus to remove his self-imposed curse, but we cannot
              appeal to a god to remove ours. Individually, meditation practice
              reduces personal dukkha by reducing desire, but how are we to address
              the collective dukkha generated by institutionalized desire? Ultimately
              we must choose between this economic/financial system and the survival
              of the biosphere. Yet there really is no choice. Our current system is
              doomed no matter what in the same way that a cancer always ends up
              destroying its host. From that perspective, the financial meltdown is
              actually a wonderful opportunity to address a much deeper problem. Such
              a crisis would be a terrible thing to waste.</p>
