              <h1>Pilgrimage to The Immaculate Crystal Mountain of Tsari</h1>
              <p>Guru Rimpoche, who entered the mandala by way of the southern
                                      door, over the Jowo Them La pass from Jar, 
              meditated here for seven
                                      years, seven months and seven days in the 
              Zilchan Sangphuk, the
                                      Brilliant Secret Cave, where he hid many 
              treasure texts. A little
                                      later the Dzogchen teacher Vimalamitra came here
               by magical means
                                      and taught the gods and demons.<br> <br> The Immaculate Crystal Mountain of Tsari 
              provides the definitive
                                      Tibetan pilgrimage. It is the palace of the 
              buddha-deity Demchok,
                                      Supreme Bliss, and his mandala of deities. And 
              it is also a
                                      principal abode of the sky dancers, amongst whom
               Khandroma Dorje
                                      Phakmo is supreme. More than Kang Rimpoche and 
              Labchi, it is the
                                      tantric power place par excellence, a testing 
              place for yogis where
                                      the sky dancers dwell. It is a place of 
              breath-taking beauty, the
                                      snow mountain rising out of verdant pastures and
               forests, while in
                                      the valleys below is thick jungle.<br> <br> The Tsari mountain lies at the south-eastern end
               of the Great
                                      Himalayan range. It is one of the last peaks 
              (5,735 m) before the
                                      Yarlung Tsangpo river (Brahmaputra) cuts through
               the range in the
                                      world's deepest gorge. The mountain is 
              surrounded by the
                                      tributaries of the Subansiri River which drain 
              into the Brahmaputra
                                      in Arunachal Pradesh to the south of the 
              mountain. It is located in
                                      the old Tibetan region of Loyul<br> <br> Paramount, Dakpa Shelri, the Immaculate Crystal 
              Mountain, is a
                                      great chorten made of crystal. It is a 
              self-manifest, spontaneously
                                      arisen, chorten that is the buddha-mind. 
              Specifically, this chorten
                                      is perceived as an Auspicious Chorten of Many 
              Doors (Tashi gomang
                                      chorten) and the dome of the chorten contains 
              the divine mandala,
                                      the wheel of sublime bliss and perfect cognition
               that is Demchok's
                                      mind.<br> <br> he topographical features that are the keys to 
              this mandala are the
                                      four summit peaks in the four directions which 
              are the palaces of
                                      the four male and female buddha-deities in 
              union. The four doors
                                      into the mandala are marked by four passes, four
               ravines, four
                                      rivers with water of four different colours, 
              four stone thrones,
                                      four caves and four lakes. The entire mandala is
               surrounded by a
                                      wall of dorjes. The four doors are at Chikchar 
              in the north, the
                                      Parpa Rong ravine in the east, the Jowo Them La 
              pass in the south,
                                      and Domtsang Rong ravine in the west.<br> <br> Tsari is circumambulated on three levels. Yogis 
              traverse the peak
                                      path (tsekor), which encircles the four sacred 
              peaks and touches
                                      the caves sanctified by tantric meditation, and 
              takes two to four
                                      days. Laymen and monks traverse the central, 
              middle, path,
                                      (shungkor), which crosses seven passes over the 
              ridges that radiate
                                      from the peaks, and yet it is the easiest route,
               taking up to week.
                                      The ravine circuit (rongkor), the long arduous 
              passage through the
                                      deep valleys that flank the massif on three 
              sides, takes two weeks
                                      and is the course of the great pilgrimage every 
              twelve years. Which
                                      ever circuit the pilgrim takes here is fraught 
              with difficulty, and
                                      the Kagyu pilgrim recites this prayer:<br> <br> Glorious Tsaritra, Pure Power Place of the Sky 
              Dancers,<br> Masters of the Kagyu lineage, Buddha-deities<br> Sky Dancers, Dharma Protectors: we pray to you.<br> Purify sins and obscurations through your 
              blessings;<br> Pacify adversaries and dispel dangers;<br> Bestow upon us supreme realisation and magical

              <h1>Pilgrimage of Ayu Khandro</h1>
              <p>"When we were thirty-two, in 1870, we went to see Nala Perna
                                      Dundrub in Nyarong; we went with some disciples 
              of Dzongsar Khentse
                                      who were from Nyarong. Traveling slowly; we 
              eventually arrived in
                                      the region of Narlong in a town called Karko, 
              where Nala Perna
                                      Dundrub was giving the Longsal Dorje Nyingpo 
              initiation. We
                                      received the rest of this teaching and the 
              Yang-ti Nagpo. We were
                                      there more than three months."After this we went
               with Nala Perna
                                      Dundrub to Nying Lung to the area of Tsela 
              Wongdo, where he gave
                                      the Kha Khyab Rangdrol. When this teaching had 
              come to an end, he
                                      called for Perna Yangkyi and me. He had named my
               friend Osel
                                      Palkyi, 'Glorious Clear Light' and me, Dorje 
              Paldron, 'Glorious
                                      Indestructible Vajra' during this teaching, and 
              addressing us with
                                      these names, he said: 'Go to practice in 
              cemeteries and sacred
                                      places. Follow the method of Machig Lapdron and 
              overcome hope and
                                      fear. If you do this you will attain stable 
              realization. During
                                      your travel you will encounter two yogis who 
              will be important for
                                      you. One will be met in the country of Tsawa and
               the other in Loka,
                                      Southern Tibet. If you meet them, it will 
              definitely help your
                                      development. So go now and practice as I have 
              instructed.'<br> <br> "He presented us each with a Chod drum, and 
              after further advice
                                      and encouragement, we saw no reason to delay and
               set off like two
                                      beggar girls. Our only possessions were our drum
               and a stick.'We
                                      visited Kathog and Peyul monasteries and many 
              sacred places,
                                      encountering many teachers. Eventually we 
              arrived at the caves of
                                      Togden Rangrig, where I had lived as a girl. I 
              had been gone three
                                      years, and it certainly gave us a desolate 
              feeling. We found only
                                      an old disciple, Togden Pagpa, an old nun, and 
              Chang Chub, a
                                      younger nun that I'd known, and Kunzang 
              Longyang. It made me very
                                      sad to be there. When we said we were going to 
              Central Tibet,
                                      Kunzang Longyang said that he would like to come
               with us. So we
                                      stayed for two weeks. As he made his 
              preparations, we practiced
                                      Guru Yoga, made feast offerings, did practice of
               the guardians, and
                                      so on with the old disciples of Togden.<br> <br> "We were thirty-three in 1871, and it was the 
              third month on the
                                      tenth day of the Year of the Iron Sheep that we 
              made a fire puja
                                      and set off for Central Tibet. We traveled with 
              about twenty other
                                      people who were on their way to Central Tibet. 
              We followed them for
                                      about a month until we arrived in the region of 
              Tsawa."When we
                                      reached Tsawa, we slowed down and began our 
              pilgrimage, begging
                                      here and there. One day we arrived at a big 
              plateau called Curchen
                                      Thang. We approached a large encampment of 
              nomads to ask them for
                                      food. We stood at the edge of the camp and began
               to sing Chod. A
                                      young robust woman came toward us and as she 
              approached we could
                                      see she was crying."She rushed to us and said: 
              'Thank goodness you
                                      Chodpas have come! Please help me! The day 
              before yesterday my
                                      husband was killed for revenge in a feud. He is 
              still lying in the
                                      tent. It is not easy to find a Chodpa in this 
              part of the country.
                                      Please help me take care of his body.'<br> <br> "We were rather at a loss as none of us were 
              really experts at
                                      funerals, but she was so desperate, we agreed to
               do our best."We
                                      asked her: 'Is there a good cemetery around 
              here?'"She replied:
                                      'Toward the south, about half a day's journey 
              from here, there is
                                      an important cemetery. If that is too far, there
               are other, smaller
                                      ones closer.'<br> <br> "We decided to go to the larger one, and the 
              next day in the
                                      morning we set off with someone carrying the 
              corpse.As we were
                                      approaching the cemetery, we heard the sound of a
               drum and bell. As
                                      we got closer, we heard the sound of a beautiful
               voice singing the
                                      Chod. As we entered, we saw a Chodpa at the 
              center of the cemetery.
                                      He was quite young with a dark complexion and a 
              big turban of
                                      matted hair, wrapped around his head. He wore a 
              dark-red robe and
                                      was singing the feast offering of the Chod.<br> <br> "At that moment we were reminded of Nala Perna 
              Dundrub's prophecy
                                      that we would meet a Chodpa who would help us in
               Tsawa. When we
                                      arrived at the center of the cemetery with the 
              corpse, he stopped
                                      singing."He asked: 'Who among you is Dorje 
              Paldron? Where have you
                                      come from? What are you doing here?'"I said: 'I 
              am called Dorje
                                      Paldron. These are my friends, Osel Wongmo 
              (previously called Pema
                                      Yangkyi) and Kunzang Longyang. We are disciples 
              of Nala Pema
                                      Dundrub. We are going to Central Tibet 
              practicing the Chod in
                                      various charnel grounds on the way. We happened 
              upon this situation
                                      and the family requested that we take care of 
              this murdered man, so
                                      we brought him here. Who are you?'<br> <br> ."He replied: '1 am a disciple of Khentse Yeshe 
              Dorje, my name is
                                      Semnyi Dorje and I was born in Kungpo. I have no
               fixed abode. I
                                      have been practicing here for the last few days.
               Several days ago
                                      when I was between sleeping and waking, I 
              received a communication
                                      that someone called Dorje Paldron was coming. 
              Since then I have
                                      been waiting for you, and that's why I asked 
              which one of you is
                                      Dorje Paldron. Welcome! But a murdered corpse is
               not a simple
                                      matter to offer to the vultures. If you are not 
              sure how to do it,
                                      maybe we can do it together.'<br> <br> "We were very happy and set to work immediately 
              on the funeral. We
                                      practiced together for seven days, and the 
              relatives of the dead
                                      man brought us food. Togden Semnyi gave us 
              teachings on the Zinba
                                      Rangdrol Chod, and we became a party of four."We
               traveled at a
                                      relaxed pace begging on the way, stopping a few 
              days here and there
                                      to practice at special cemeteries, sometimes 
              stopping at length.
                                      After a few months we arrived at Ozayul, near 
              Assam, and went to
                                      Tsari, where there was a temple called Phagmo 
              Lhakang in the area
                                      of Chicha. We traveled up and down in that area 
              for a year and
                                      three months. We went to many important places 
              to practice.<br> <br> "Then in the sixth month of the Monkey Year, 
              1872, Kunzang Longyang
                                      fell ill with a terrible fever. We called 
              doctors and did many
                                      practices, but he did not get better and towards
               the end of the
                                      sixth month he left his body. He was fifty-six 
              years old. When we
                                      performed the funeral, there were many 
              interesting signs, like a
                                      huge rainbow so large everyone for miles around 
              saw it, and it
                                      remained for the whole funeral. The local people
               were convinced a
                                      Mahasiddha33 had died. They honored us very much
               and we stayed
                                      there more than three months doing practice for 
              Kunzang
                                      Longyang.<br> <br> "After this we went to jar and then on to Lodrag
               and visited all
                                      the sacred places there. This is the country of 
              Marpa the
                                      Translator, where Milarepa's trials took 
              place.""On the tenth day
                                      of the tenth month, we reached Pema Ling and did
               a feast offering.
                                      There is a huge lake at Pema Ling, and many 
              saints and yogis have
                                      lived around it, including Guru Chowang. That 
              night we decided each
                                      to practice separately in different places 
              around the lake."Pema
                                      Yangkyi went to a place called Rona, and when 
              she arrived she saw a
                                      yogi practicing there."He said to her: 'Three 
              months ago I was
                                      practicing in Ralung, the original seat of the 
              Drukpa Kagyu
                                      lineage, and I had a vision of Dorje Yudronma. 
              She gave me a little
                                      roll of paper about as long as my finger. I 
              quickly unrolled it and
                                      it said 'In the tenth month on the tenth day go 
              in practice at a
                                      place called Rona.''<br> <br> "She realized this was the yogi Nala Pema 
              Dundrub had predicted we
                                      would meet in Southern Tibet. After the evening 
              practice, he came
                                      back to the main temple with her and thus we 
              became four
                                      again."This yogis name was Gargyi Wanchug, but 
              he was called
                                      Trulzhi Carwang Rinpoche, and he was a disciple 
              of the famous woman
                                      Mindroling Jetsun Rinpoche who taught on the 
              Dzog Chen Terma of
                                      Mindroling. He had a large following around Pema
               Ling. His
                                      disciples requested Chod teachings, and so we 
              also became his
                                      disciples and stayed to hear his teachings."We 
              stayed there until
                                      the tenth of the third month practicing 
              intensively. We did 100,000
                                      feast offerings from the Chod practice, and 
              there were many patrons
                                      to help us.<br> <br> "Although we had previously planned to go to 
              Samye, we decided to
                                      go with Trulzhi Garwang to Western Tibet to see 
              Gang Rinpoche. So
                                      we traveled at a leisurely pace toward Yardro, 
              where there is a
                                      huge lake, and then on to Ralung. We stayed 
              there more than a month
                                      while he gave some of his disciples teaching in 
              the Ati Zadon in
                                      the tradition of Mindroling. We were happy to 
              receive such a
                                      precise explanation and were treated very 
              well."Then we set out for
                                      Gyaltse, Shigatse, Sralu, and Sakya, and all the
               principal places
                                      in Tsang. We did purification and Chod practice 
              in all these places
                                      and then in the summer arrived in Tingri where 
              Phadampa Sangye had
                                      lived. After staying there for a while, we went 
              to a place called
                                      Nyalam and then with great difficulty, we went 
              into Nepal.<br> <br> "We stayed at Maratika doing White Tara practice
               for long life and
                                      Pema NyingThig of Jamyang Khentse Wongpo. Togden
               Trulzhi asked Pema
                                      Yangkyi and me to give him the transmission of 
              this, and since we
                                      had it we did our best to give it to him."Then 
              we went on to
                                      Kathmandu and toured the Great Stupa and other 
              pilgrimage places in
                                      the Kathmandu valley for a month or so, 
              practicing and making
                                      offerings. Then we did another month of Chod, 
              which fascinated the
                                      people, and we began to receive many invitations
               and became a bit
                                      better off."Trulzhi Garwang Rinpoche said that 
              this fame was an
                                      obstacle to the practice, a demonic 
              interruption. So we left for
                                      Yanglesho and visited a VajraYogini temple in 
              nearby Parping. Next
                                      to this is the temple of Dakshinkali. down by 
              the river. Here there
                                      is an important Hindu temple, and we went to the
               nearby cemetery,
                                      which was an excellent one for Chod. But after a
               few days and
                                      nights we were disturbed by people, not spirits.<br> <br> "So we went back to Yanglesho and stayed there 
              near the cave and
                                      Todgen Semnyi gave Togden Trulzhi the 
              transmission of a particular
                                      Vajra Kilaya practice he had. We practiced it 
              for several days and
                                      then decided to leave Nepal."We headed for 
              Dolpo, and through
                                      Purang we arrived at Kyung Lung, where there was
               a cave in which
                                      Togden Trulzhi had stayed before. We stayed 
              there and in the first
                                      month of the first year, we received the Kadro 
              Nying Thig from
                                      Trulzhi Rinpoche. We received a very elaborate 
              complete version and
                                      stayed there for more than three months. It was a
               beautiful
                                      retreat. At Trulzhi Rinpoche's request we did 
              our best to give the
                                      transmission of the Khadro Sangdu we had 
              received from Jamyang
                                      Khentse Wongpo."At the beginning of the fifth 
              month, places around
                                      and on the mountain for over three years, always
               practicing
                                      everywhere."Then Trulzhi Pinpoche and Pema 
              Yangkyi decided to stay
                                      on there, and I decided to return to Central 
              Tibet with Togden
                                      Semnyi.<br> <br> "In the second month of the Year of the Fire 
              Bull, we said goodbye
                                      and we left, making our way slowly to Maryul 
              doing Chod at all the
                                      interesting places along the way. We stopped at 
              Jomo Nagpa, the
                                      former residence of Taranatha, and many other 
              places beneficial for
                                      practice."In the fourth month, we stopped at 
              Tanag and Ngang Cho,
                                      where there lived a great Dzog Chen master, 
              Gyurme Perna Tenzin46
                                      who was giving teaching on Dzog Chen Semde his 
              speciality. We
                                      stayed there more than nine months and received 
              complete teachings
                                      in the eighteen series of Dzog Chen, including 
              initiations and
                                      explanations."Then we met some pilgrims who had 
              come from Kham, and
                                      they told us that, several years before, Nala 
              Perna Dundrub had
                                      taken the Body of Light, and this had made him 
              very famous. We were
                                      both joyful and sad on receiving this news. When
               I was forty, in
                                      1878, Togden Semnyi and I left for Central 
              Tibet. We went through
                                      Ushang, where there is a famous shrine of the 
              Blue Vajra Sadhu,
                                      protector of Dzog Chen. We traveled all over 
              that area on
                                      pilgrimage practicing a bit everywhere. During 
              the fourth month, we
                                      sighted Lhasa. We visited all the holy places of
               Lhasa and met many
                                      famous people. Then we visited the nearby 
              monasteries of Sera,
                                      Drepung, and Trayepa, Gaden, Katsai, Zvalakang. 
              Then we went on to
                                      Yangri, Drigung, and Tigrom. We always did a bit
               of practice
                                      everywhere we went.<br> <br> "Then we returned to Lhasa, where I became 
              seriously ill. For
                                      nearly two months I was severely sick with a 
              very high fever which
                                      led to paralysis. The doctors succeeded in 
              lowering the fever but
                                      the paralysis continued to worsen. Togden Semnyi
               did special Chod
                                      practices to clear up the paralysis, and finally
               after two months I
                                      started to get better. It took another month to 
              start moving and
                                      recuperate. In the eleventh month, we decided to
               go to Samye for
                                      the New Year celebration. We did many days of 
              feast offering of the
                                      Ringdzin Drupa.'In the first month, we left for 
              Zurang and visited
                                      Gamalung, a Padma Sambhava spot, and Wongyul, 
              and then we sighted
                                      the Red we were guided to Mount Kailash by 
              Trulzhi Rinpoche. We
                                      stayed in many caves and sacred House at the 
              Copper Mountain, and
                                      stayed in the cemetery there. This was the 
              former residence of
                                      Machig Lapdron. We stayed there for three months
               practicing the
                                      Chod.<br> <br> "After this, we went to Tsethang and Tradru, and
               from there we went
                                      to Yarlung Shedra, another place that Padma 
              Sambhava empowered.
                                      Then we went on to Tsering Jung, where Jigme 
              Lingpa had had his
                                      residence. We went on up and down for more than 
              eight months."When
                                      I was forty-two, in 1880, in the second month, 
              we arrived at
                                      Mindroling. We visited Zurkar and Drayang Dzong,
               and the Nyingma
                                      monastery Dorje Deal as well as Ushang Do and 
              Nyethang and Talung,
                                      and also Tsurpu, where the Karmapas resided. We 
              met many teachers
                                      and received many teachings during our 
              travels."In the fourth month
                                      of 1880, we arrived at Payul and Nalandara and 
              LangThang, one of
                                      the residences of the Khadampa school. Then we 
              arrived at Na Chu Ka
                                      and headed towards Eastem Tibet.<br> <br> "In the seventh month, we arrived at Kungpo, 
              where Togden Semnyi
                                      had been in retreat in the region of Kari at 
              Deyang. In those caves
                                      there was another yogi, a monk and some nuns. 
              When they saw Togden
                                      Semnyi, they were very happy. I stayed there for
               more than a year
                                      practicing and deepened my understanding of the 
              Zinba Rangdrol
                                      Chod. Togden Semnyi gave me teachings in the 
              Yang Sang Tug Thig,
                                      the most secret Dzog Chen gongter.<br> <br> "In the Year of the Iron Serpent, 1881, I 
              decided to travel on to
                                      my home country. I met some traders on their way
               to China who were
                                      to pass through my country, so I decided to 
              travel with them."When
                                      we got to the place I had lived when I was 
              married, I said my
                                      farewells to the traders and did some 
              invocations to protect them
                                      on their ventures and set out in the direction 
              of Togden Rangrig's
                                      retreat center. When I approached the spot, I 
              made some inquiries
                                      as to what had happened there, but most people 
              had never heard of
                                      the place. A few remembered that a yogi had 
              lived there years
                                      before, but, they said, he had died and the few 
              who remained had
                                      either left or died."I decided to go there 
              anyway. The place was in
                                      ruins. The wooden doors and window sills had 
              been pulled out by the
                                      local people to be used elsewhere and I could 
              not even recognize
                                      the caves of my aunt and Togden Rangrig.<br> <br> "I stayed the night there. I felt very sad and 
              did some practice.
                                      The next day I went down the mountain a bit to 
              the cemetery to stay
                                      and do Chod. The following .morning, 1 had a 
              vision when I was
                                      between sleeping and waking of an egg-shaped 
              rock in Dzongtsa,
                                      which I could enter through a cave. When I got 
              inside, there was a
                                      very intense darkness which suddenly was 
              illuminated by
                                      multi-colored light streaming out of it. This 
              illuminated the cave
                                      and pierced the walls so that I could see 
              through to the
                                      outside."Then I awoke, and seeing this as a good
               indication and
                                      (since I'd heard there was in fact such a 
              place), I left for
                                      Dzongtsa. When I arrived I found the place. It 
              was near Dzongtsa,
                                      but was on the opposite side of the river from 
              where I was. I
                                      decided to camp on a nearby hill and wait for 
              some help or for the
                                      river to go down so I could cross. But it was 
              autumn and the river
                                      was very high.<br> <br> "I practiced day and night, and during the third
               night, after
                                      midnight, something inexplicable happened to me.
               I had fallen
                                      asleep and a long bridge appeared. It was white 
              and reached the
                                      other shore near the rock I had dreamed of. I 
              thought, 'Good,
                                      finally I can cross the river: So I crossed, and
               when I awoke I was
                                      actually on the other side of the river."I had 
              arrived but I did
                                      not know how."I put my tent on the spot where I 
              had landed and
                                      stayed there practicing Chod for more than a 
              month. I was assisted
                                      by a nomad, Palden, who lived nearby. He 
              supplied me with cheese
                                      and yogurt, etc., and from time to time people 
              came by. But even if
                                      they had known me before, they did not recognize
               me."In late
                                      autumn, an epidemic broke out among the nomad's 
              animals. I was
                                      asked to intervene, which I did with the Chod 
              and fire practice.
                                      The epidemic stopped and everyone began to say I
               was a great
                                      practitioner. As they began to honor me, I was 
              worried remembering
                                      that Trulzhi Rinpoche had said this was a 
              demonic interruption. So
                                      I entered a stricter retreat. After a month or 
              so, my former
                                      husband arrived with his second wife and 
              daughter. He had heard of
                                      my arrival and brought me many supplies. We had a
               very good
                                      rapport; I gave him teachings, and he asked if 
              he might build me a
                                      house.<br> <br> 'I told him I would like it to be right on the 
              same spot and
                                      explained to him how I wanted it built. They 
              invited me to their
                                      house for the winter. As it was very cold that 
              year and his parents
                                      had died, I went to their house and meditated 
              for the benefit of
                                      the deceased for about three months. My father 
              and siblings with
                                      many nieces and nephews came to see me and I 
              helped them as much as
                                      possible by teaching them."When I was 
              forty-four, in the Year of
                                      the Water Horse, 1882, in the third month, my 
              husband and others
                                      began my hut. I decided to go to see my master 
              Khentse Rinpoche. I
                                      arrived on the tenth day of the fourth month and
               received many
                                      teachings and he clarified all my doubts."Then I
               left for Adzom Gar
                                      and met Adzom Drukpa and Drodul Pawn Dorje. I 
              received his gongter,
                                      and all the NyingThig transmissions. Adzom 
              Drukpa asked me to stay
                                      and do a retreat at Puntsom Gatsal near Adzom 
              Gar where he had been
                                      in retreat, which I did.<br> <br> "In the second month of the Year of the Wood 
              Monkey, 1884, Adzom
                                      Drukpa and his disciples went to see Jamyang 
              Khentse Wongpo at
                                      Dzongsar and I went with them. Because Adzom 
              Drukpa had requested
                                      it, he gave us the Gongpa Zangthal. Both Adzom 
              Drukpa and Khentse
                                      Wongpo told me to return to Tagzi, where I had 
              landed after
                                      crossing the river in my dream."So 1 left 
              immediately, stopping
                                      only to see Kongtrul Rinpoche and receive 
              teachings on the Six
                                      Yogas of Naropa and to learn from the others who
               were there taking
                                      teachings. On the eighth, I returned to Tagzi, 
              and my former
                                      husband and other faithful people had built me a
               hut precisely
                                      according to my instructions."At this point I 
              lacked nothing and
                                      decided to go into retreat. My eldest sister's 
              daughter had become
                                      a nun a few years before and she wished to act 
              as my assistant. As
                                      she was also very committed to practice, I 
              accepted her
                                      offer.<br> <br> "So in the Year of the Wood Bird, 1885, in the 
              first month on the
                                      day of the dakini I began a seven-year retreat. 
              From the beginning
                                      I spent most of my time doing the practice in 
              the dark. At first
                                      this was sometimes difficult so I alternated the
               dark and light,*
                                      but the majority of the time was spent in 
              complete darkness."When I
                                      was fifty-three, in the Year of the Iron Rabbit,
               1891, in the fifth
                                      month on the day of Padma Sambhava, when I was 
              doing practice in
                                      the dark, I had a vision. I saw a very clear 
              sphere; inside it were
                                      many dakinis carrying another sphere with the 
              form of Jamyang
                                      Khentse Wongpo inside. I was sure this meant 
              that he had been
                                      invited by the dakinis to leave this world of 
              suffering."Although I
                                      still had seven months before the end of the 
              seven years I had
                                      promised myself to complete, I decided it was 
              more important to see
                                      him before he left his body. So I left my hut 
              and a few days later
                                      went directly to him in Dzongsar, accompanied by
               my niece.<br> <br> "We reached him without obstacles, and he was 
              very kind and taught
                                      me a lot; most importantly, he clarified my 
              practice by answering
                                      all of my questions. When I told him the vision I
               had had of him
                                      being carried away, I requested that he remain 
              longer. He said that
                                      all that is born must die and that his death 
              could not be delayed.
                                      He told me it would be best for me to return to 
              my retreat but and
                                      continue my practice in the dark.<br> <br> "With great sadness I left him and returned to 
              my hut. When I was
                                      fifty-four, in the Year of the Water Serpent, 
              1892, I received the
                                      news of his death. At that moment I decided to 
              stay in retreat for
                                      the rest of my life. So I alternated the 
              practice in the dark with
                                      the practice in the light. When I was fifty-six,
               in the Year of the
                                      Wood Horse, 1894, both my mother and the wife of
               the nomad Palden
                                      who had been serving me died. I did the practice
               of the Korwa
                                      Dongtru for them for several months. Then Palden
               came to serve me
                                      here."When I was sixty in the Year of the Earth 
              Dog, 1897, my
                                      husband Apho Wangdo died, so I did purification 
              for him and his
                                      family for an extended period of time.<br> <br> "At the end of autumn in the Year of the Iron 
              Mouse, 1900, my old
                                      friend Pema Yangkyi appeared unexpectedly. She 
              brought the news
                                      that in the third month of the previous year, 
              1899, Trulzhi
                                      Rinpoche, at the age of eighty-three, had passed
               away taking the
                                      body of light and leaving no corpse. She told me
               the whole story of
                                      how this had happened in his cave on Mount 
              Kailash."She stayed in
                                      my tiny hut with me for a year and we did 
              retreat together. This
                                      was a big boon for me; it really helped the 
              development of my
                                      practices.<br> <br> "After a year she left for Kawa Karpo, a 
              mountain in Southern Tibet
                                      which had been indicated by Trulzhi Rinpoche as 
              the place she
                                      should go to. I later heard that she lived there
               for many years and
                                      had many students. Then in the Year of the Iron 
              Boar, 1911, she
                                      took the body of light at the age of 
              seventy-four."After her
                                      departure her students came to me for teachings 
              and told me stories
                                      from her life and about her death. Then in the 
              Year of the Wood
                                      Tiger at the end of summer, some disciples of 
              Togden Semnyi came
                                      and told me he had sent them to me specifically.
               They told me that
                                      he had not remained in Chumbo but had traveled 
              toward Amdo on
                                      pilgrimage, practicing everywhere.<br> <br> "At the end of his life they went towards china 
              to Ribotse Na. He
                                      stayed there teaching for three years and had 
              many disciples, both
                                      chinese and Tibetan. At the age of eighty-five 
              he passed away and
                                      there were many auspicious signs and many 
              ringsel in his
                                      ashes."Realizing that all of my friends had left
               the world made me
                                      very conscious of impermanence, and I was 
              inspired to practice as
                                      much as possible with the time I had left. I 
              taught Togden Semnyi's
                                      disciples for several months and then sent them 
              off to various
                                      places to practice meditation."<br> <br> In the Year of the Water Dragon, 1952, in the 
              eighth month, I went
                                      to Sengchen Namdrag, where my uncle had been in 
              retreat. I did a
                                      Simhamukha retreat and various other practices 
              there.I had a dream
                                      while I was there of a brilliant crystal stupa 
              which appeared to be
                                      being pushed toward the West. Slowly it 
              disappeared in space and at
                                      that moment I heard a voice saying: "This is the
               tomb of Dorje
                                      Paldron."The voice woke me up and I felt really 
              very empty inside,
                                      and even doing some breathing practices did not 
              make me feel
                                      better. I felt I had lost something very 
              important inside
                                      myself.<br> <br> A few days later the son of Adzom Drukpa came by
               on his way back
                                      from Central Tibet. I told him about this dream,
               and he said that,
                                      in fact, he had stopped to see her on his way 
              and she had indicated
                                      by the way she spoke of time and so on that she 
              would not live much
                                      longer. He thought probably my dream indicated 
              that she would die
                                      soon. So we did some Khadro Sangdu practice for 
              three days to try
                                      to extend her life.In the Year of the Water 
              Serpent, 1953, I was
                                      with my uncle on the mountain and taking 
              NyingThig teachings when I
                                      received word she had left her body. I said a 
              few prayers, as I did
                                      not know what else to do.In the sixth month, I 
              went to Dzongtsa,
                                      where she had died in her hut, and discovered 
              that the servant
                                      Palden had died the same year. They said there 
              were many auspicious
                                      signs at the time of his death.<br> <br> I met the Khenpo and the nun Zangmo who had 
              served her, and Zangmo
                                      told me this story of her death:'In the Year of 
              the Water Serpent,
                                      Khadro said to us: 'Now I feel really old. I 
              think in a little
                                      while I shall go!' She was 115 at the time."We 
              begged her not to
                                      go, but she said: 'Now bad times are coming and 
              everything is going
                                      to change. There will be terrible problems and 
              it's better I go
                                      now. In about three weeks I won't be here 
              anymore. Start preparing
                                      for the funeral.<br> <br> "She instructed us precisely on how to conduct 
              ourselves during the
                                      funeral and in preparation for it. She had an 
              important statue of
                                      Padma Sambhava which she sent to Gyur Rinpoche, 
              son of Adzom
                                      Drukpa. She left a little statue of Jamyang 
              Khentse for Namkhai
                                      Norbu and various other things for Khenpo and 
              her other
                                      disciples."At the end, she opened herself 
              completely to everyone
                                      who wanted to see her. During the last twenty 
              days she stopped
                                      doing regular meditation periods and just saw 
              people, giving advice
                                      and counsel to anyone who wanted it."Near the 
              twenty-fifth, without
                                      any sign of illness, we found that she had left 
              her body at the
                                      time she would normally be finishing her 
              meditation session. She
                                      remained in meditation posture for two weeks and
               when she had
                                      finished her tugdam, her body had become very 
              small. We put some
                                      ornaments on it and many many people came to 
              witness it.<br> <br> "In the second month on the tenth day, we 
              cremated her. There were
                                      many interesting signs at the time of her death.
               There was a sudden
                                      thaw and everything burst into bloom. It was the
