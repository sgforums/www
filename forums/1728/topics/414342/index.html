              <p>The inner chatter in our minds is something we are all familiar with. 
               While we may have good and sometimes bad experiences in our lives that 
              may move us to ponder life's deeper meanings or to seek out answers it 
              is this inner chatter, more-so out of it's insistent and consistent 
              barrage on our minds, that we are finally driven to seek out someway to 
              quieten it down.  <strong>It gets so unrelenting and so persistent that once 
              we have decided that we have had enough of it and we want to quieten it 
              down, there doesn't appear to be any way to stop it.  We can't even go 
              to sleep because the mind just keeps going and going!!  It's like 
              torture "Okay, I'm over this noise in my head now.  I think you should 
              stop now.  Okay, stop.  No no, I mean stop .... now!  Shhh!  I really 
              mean it.  Come on now, stop!!! STOP!!!"</strong><br> <br> We quickly realise as much as we <em>want </em>it to stop it just 
              seems to keep going.  We try frantically to find ways to quieten the 
              mind but none of it seems to make the slightest bit of difference. We'll
               typically at this point turn to all kinds of external means to find 
              some peace and we'll drown it out with social activities, making 
              ourselves busy, through entertainment media like TV, radio, music, x-box
               or even alcohol and drugs.  These only serves as a means of distracting
               us from the noise.  As soon as we remove the distraction the noise and 
              inner chatter is back as loud as ever.  Actually over time doing these 
              distraction techniques just make the inner chatter worse by perpetuating
               the cycle.  So how do we stop it?  Well really the secret is not to 
              stop it, I'll explain more as we go.<br> <a name="more"></a><br> If we are lucky, in our search for a solution, we may eventually stumble across meditation.  <strong>The
               common problem is people try it and think that meditation is about 
              stopping the thoughts.  It's a very common misconception and 
              unfortunately leads a lot of people to try it and then walk away 
              thinking it didn't yield any results.</strong>  This is why I'm writing this 
              article, to help bring some understanding to what is happening here. 
              People often read a few blogs, a website or two, a book maybe or chat to
               someone about the basics of meditation and then sit down to try 
              meditation only find it doesn't work.  Or so they think!<br> <br> In talking to people about meditation I find lots of people have tried 
              it. This is really heartening to see. You can see they too are seeking 
              some peace and along the way have tried meditation as a means of finding
               this peace.<strong>  One of the main recurring themes I hear is that people 
              say "Oh I tried meditation but it didn't work" or "I couldn't do it". 
               My immediate response is usually "This is like water saying, I just 
              don't know how to be wet". </strong> It's impossible for meditation not to 
              work!!  It has to work because it is by it's very fabric the nature of 
              all things, including ourselves, our minds and consciousness.  I'll 
              explain this below as we go.<br> <br> <strong>Momentum</strong><br></p>
              <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5WE3ZGOVI/AAAAAAAAA-8/PjVnx3VzZnc/s1600/train-4.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5WE3ZGOVI/AAAAAAAAA-8/PjVnx3VzZnc/s320/train-4.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="212"></a></div>
              <p><strong>It is important to take a step back and ask ourselves first 
              "What has lead me to have this mind and all this inner chatter?" and to 
              really evaluate what is going on.</strong>  It is through wanting, 
              conceptualising, grasping, categorising, judging, pushing away, and 
              thinking about everything we experience in life that our minds become 
              busy.  In our day to day we have a thought arise about <em>every</em> thing little, every teeny tiny thing and what we think <em>about </em>it, how we feel <em>about</em> it, what it means <em>to</em> us and how we can <em>get </em>more of it or <em>get away</em> from it. <strong>Through this there is a perpetuating cycle of mind busyness which over times results in a momentum all of it's own. </strong>It's
               like a freight train that's been gathering more carriages along its 
              journey.  The heavier it gets the harder it is to stop.  After a while 
              it has so much momentum that even when the train driver sticks on the 
              brakes the train will just keeping on skidding and take a long time to 
              come to a stop!!!  <strong>Our minds are just like this.  We stick on the brakes expecting it to stop and, "Holy crap! It's still going!"</strong><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>What is Meditation About?</strong></span></strong><br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><br></strong></span>So we have to be very clear, <em>meditation is not about stopping thoughts.</em></strong>  We cannot approach meditation with another "want", but often this is 
              exactly what we do.  "I want to do meditation to find some peace" or "I 
              want to do meditation to be happy" or "I want to do meditation to stop 
              this inner chatter in my mind".  Again however this is the same cycle we
               just stated above.  In doing so we've just approached meditation in the
               same way we've approached everything else in our lives, and in trying 
              it like this we continue to perpetuate the cycle of inner chatter.  So 
              of course we walk away thinking "Well that stinks, it doesn't work".  <strong>Meditation is not about getting what you want, meditation is about letting go.  As you do this thoughts stop by themselves!</strong><br> <br> Ajahn Chah's has a little book of quotes called <a href="http://www.dharmaweb.org/index.php/No_Ajahn_Chah:_Reflections">No Ajahn Chah: Reflections</a> in which he says:</p>
              <blockquote> <em>Remember you don’t meditate to "get" anything, but to get "rid" of 
              things. We do it not with desire but with letting go. If you "want" 
              anything, you won’t find it.</em></blockquote>
              <p>By this he doesn't mean to get rid of something we don't want or we 
              remove something that we want to get away from. He's not saying to get 
              rid of the inner chatter or noise. <br> <br> I'll explain exactly how that works in <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-2.html">Part 2</a> and then in Part 3 what we can do to quieten the inner chatter, the 
              common trap and how to apply this.  Check back tomorrow for <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-2.html">Part 2</a>.</p>

              Continuing on from yesterday's article <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-1.html">Quietening the Inner Chatter - Part 1</a>,
               we were saying that meditation is not about getting what we want but 
              out letting go of what it is that is supporting the existence of the 
              inner chatter. This is a very important point.<br> <br> <strong>The Builder and the House</strong><br> <br>
              <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5UNOa8OoI/AAAAAAAAA-4/Ydoy8C5BjWc/s1600/the+builder.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5UNOa8OoI/AAAAAAAAA-4/Ydoy8C5BjWc/s320/the+builder.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="235"></a></div>
              There is good metaphor which will help explain this. Our minds 
              are like little construction workers, always building building building.
               We build ideas and thoughts about everything, over time we construct 
              this big house called "me". At some point we start to not like the house
               we are in so we think "Okay, I'm not enjoying this any more, I want out
               of this house!!". So we immediately get to work on building another 
              house in hope that moving into it will somehow make us happier.  "I 
              can't stand this house any more, I want a new house"  or we think "If I 
              can just change this thing room here, add this modification on there, <em>then </em>I'll be happy". <strong>We mistakenly think happiness will be bought about by changing something external to us. </strong>So
               we get busy, thinking, building, analysing the past, thinking about our
               future, complaining about what we don't like about our current house, 
              thinking about how we want life to be, trying to think our way out of 
              our current situation and how we can get the house to be just like we 
              want it to be.  Then we focus desperately on how we can get into the new
               house.  <strong>So eventually we think we've found the answer, we abandon 
              the current house, move in and for a few days or weeks we think it's 
              perfect.  Then looking around we realise we moved all our crap into this
               house too and it's full of the same junk we had in the last house!!  It
               just moved with us!  </strong>Then after a while we begin looking at the new
               house and start thinking "You know, this house really could do with 
              ...." and it all starts again.<br> <a name="more"></a></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br> <strong>This clearly isn't the answer but interestingly we'll repeat this process in <em>all</em> areas of our life for many, many, many years in hope that it will eventually yield some results.</strong>  Holding onto hope keeps us stuck, we hold out hope that eventually it will work, in this way we stay stuck.<strong> </strong>We
               are like a car stuck in the mud, with our foot constantly on the 
              accelerator spinning our wheels getting more and more bogged.</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">So when approaching meditation we do the same "I want to stop these 
              thoughts that are driving me nuts", so we sit down but we can't get the 
              thoughts to stop.  <strong>Why is this?  <em>It's because life does not work like this.</em>  </strong>Just look at the clouds, can more wind make the clouds go away?  No, its just makes more clouds.<strong>  This
               isn't a metaphor, I'm talking directly and literally about the very 
              nature that drives the existence of things like wind and clouds </strong><strong>and rain</strong><strong> are the same forces that drive our minds and thoughts and pain. </strong>To break through the clouds the sun has to come out. Why is this? Let us go back to the house building metaphor for the answer.</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><strong>The Laws behind Inner Chatter</strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><strong><br></strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">Going back to our house building metaphor the answer isn't to move into 
              another house, the answer is to deconstruct the current house we live in
               .... completely. <strong>We need to stop building and let the current house get old and collapse.</strong>  If
               we stop building and improving on a house what happens?  It slowly 
              cracks, the wood rots, it gets weathered, things fall off and eventually
               it falls down. So, asking again, why is this?  This is very important 
              and the heart of this entire article.  <strong>It is because the conditions that support the survival of the house are removed, so eventually it dies.  <em>All </em>things in life are <em>exactly </em>like this.</strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5XOLIoogI/AAAAAAAAA_A/e740LJo-rmA/s1600/dying+flower.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ah8KwV89AXE/TL5XOLIoogI/AAAAAAAAA_A/e740LJo-rmA/s320/dying+flower.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="320"></a></div>
              <p>Clouds require a certain condition. Certain moisture content in the air 
              and certain temperature creates the conditions for them to exist. When 
              the sun comes out the conditions that supports the existence of the 
              clouds passes and so too do the clouds. When a flower doesn't get enough
               water, or gets too much sun, or gets uprooted from the soil it too 
              dies. It's conditions cease, so it ceases. If our body doesn't get food 
              or water eventually it will die. <strong>Look around you, everything, <em>absolutely everything</em> you can see or experience or think are exactly like this and all exist 
              due to the dependent conditions that support their existence. There is 
              not a single thing in the universe that does not obey this law. Not one!</strong> I'm not asking you to believe me, investigate yourself, look around. Is there anything you can find that doesn't obey this law?</p>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">Your mind and thoughts are exactly the same.  They require a certain 
              conditions to exist and certain conditions to keep them going.  The 
              cycle of inner chatter requires certain conditions too.  Through 
              repeating the same process we just perpetuate their existence and in 
              fact make them stronger.  This is why when we approach meditation and 
              want to stop the inner chatter it doesn't work. <strong>We don't realise, by 
              approaching it in this way, that we are just running the same old 
              patterns that creates and supports the very existence of the inner 
              chatter. </strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">The other thing to consider, like the momentum of the heavy freight train, is that it's going to take time to stop.  <strong>If
               you're 20, 30, or 40 years old how many years have you been supporting 
              the inner chatter? You can't just sit down to try meditation and expect 
              it to stop right away. Again, life just doesn't work like this.</strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><em>we</em> want it to be.  <strong>In doing this we ignore and don't respect 
              these laws that all things are bound by, and in doing so we create 
              conditions that support the perpetuation of inner noise.</strong> The process is so obvious, <em>so </em>inherent
               in our nature, that we simply just don't notice it. In reality you 
              could say it's so obvious that in growing up with it since a baby we 
              don't notice the obviousness of it any more.  But all it requires is us 
              to look around and observe the way everything works.  You can see it 
              right there in everything.<br> <br> So in <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-1.html">Part 1</a> I explained how inner chatter is a problem and what the effects are 
              like.  In Part 2 we talked how that problem functions and in <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-3.html">Part 3</a> I'll discuss what we can do to quieten the inner chatter, how that 
              healing process works, a common trap to look our for and how to apply 
              this.  Check back tomorrow for <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-3.html">Part 3</a>.</div>

               we were saying that meditation is not about getting what we want but 
              about letting go of what it is that is supporting the existence of the

This is a very important point.</span></strong><br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Continuing on from yesterday's article <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/10/quietening-inner-chatter-part-2.html">Quietening the Inner Chatter - Part 2</a>,
               we were saying that the inner chatter is reliant on certain conditions

              This is why I said earlier that meditation has to work, because it 
              inherently obeys and works on these same rules of nature that everything
               else works on.  <strong>When we sit and do meditation practice we focus the 
              mind on an object, typically the breath.  In doing this we remove the 
              conditions that support the perpetuation of inner chatter.</strong>  It's 
              like the flower suddenly not getting water any more, over time it slowly
               dies.  Our inner chatter is the same.  Don't think thought that just 
              because you've removed the conditions through meditation that the 
              chatter will cease straight away.  If we stop drinking water it takes a 
              few days before we really start to feel it, and a week or two before we 
              die.  Our inner chatter is the same.  In sitting meditation we aren't 
              stopping thought, we are removing certain conditions that support 
              the existence of problems in our lives.  In doing this things naturally 
              quieten down on their own and our life naturally feels more alive, more 
              radiant and vibrant.  So it's a constant process of letting go whatever 
              house or structure you have around you at that point in time and letting
               it naturally pass. <strong>Peace, happiness and silence therefore aren't 
              things we acquire, this is why we can't go out and seek after them and 
              acquire them, they are the natural properties of our existence when the 
              noise of our lives quietens down.</strong><br> <a name="more"></a><br> So if you want peace of mind, don't focus on getting peace. If you want 
              happiness, don't focus on getting happiness. You have to focus on 
              meditating diligently and letting go of the house you've build up around
               you. As the house decays and dies and collapses peace and happiness is 
              revealed.<br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br><strong>One Step Further Down the Rabbit Hole</strong></span></strong><br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><br></strong>While the above focuses on how meditation breaks down the structure, as we meditate we start to notice something interesting.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">The letting go happens all by itself.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">If
               we try to let go, it doesn't seem to happen.  "Okay, let go now.  No 
              no, I mean, I'm over this, you can let go!"  It doesn't work.Why is 
              this? Letting go isn't something we do, it's something that occurs when 
              there is mindful awareness.  As soon as there is awareness, letting go 
              occurs because we start to see clearly the very nature of things.  In 
              this awareness we see them for what they are, in doing so they freed 
              from the condition that kept it perpetuating and that kept us </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">bound
               to it.  Examine any regular life example you've had in which you later 
              let go of what bothered you and you'll discover this was the process. 
               This is because awareness itself is condition-less, is empty and has no
               enduring substance. It is the true nature of existence. Going back to 
              the above we said that in doing meditation we remove the conditions that
               supports the existence of the inner chatter. </span><span class="Apple-style-span">This is because awareness </span><em>itself </em><span class="Apple-style-span">is condition-less and
               in meditating and being aware the things in our lives (like inner 
              chatter) cease to have anything to interact with, that is, their 
              conditions for existence are removed</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">The awareness itself is like pulling the rug out from underneath everything.  </span>So
               all we need to do to reveal peace and happiness is return as often as 
              possible to this mindful awareness.  In doing that our life transforms 
              all by itself.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">  </span><em>Simply by placing awareness on anything it is eventually seen for what it truly is and it passes.  </em><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">It
               quite remarkable really.  Another way to say this is, in seeing 
              anything clearly it ceases to exist, it is let go, and to see things 
              clearly you need to be aware.</span></strong></div>

              <div style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">In 
              reading this the common fear that immediately arises is "This sounds 
              like I have to destroy or sacrifice who I am to find peace!", and fear 
              arises in us. We unnaturally feel that in approaching meditation we lose
               that sense of who we are.  While the process does require us to learn 
              to let go of the things in our lives that are unfruitful it doesn't mean
               we have to become zombies to find peace, and it also doesn't mean we 
              have to be completely boring either.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">We
               must remind ourselves it is actually the unfruitful things in our lives
               that creates our pains, it is these things that obscure our life and 
              stop us from <em>actually </em>understanding who we are.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">  It
               is these conditions that support the unfruitful results in our lives 
              that we seek to heal.  Admittedly doing meditation can be a tough 
              process at times but through it we actually open ourselves up to a <em>greater</em> sense of who we are, who we are without a big smelly dung heap piled on
               top.  So we uncover a new "me". This next section contains a metaphor 
              that explains why.</span></strong></div>

              <div style="margin: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Now typically after reading the above we'll go "Okay so if I do X <em style="font-weight: normal;">then </em>I'll
               get Y" and we'll race out and do  meditation with vigour in the hope 
              that doing it will result in the peace of mind we seek.  Again, this is a
               problem because we are just approaching meditation with a mutated 
              desire - "In doing this, I'll get that". The builder in us jumps out and
               wants to try and build another house.  It's the same problem that 
              supports the conditions of inner chatter.  This is not good, not bad, 
              it's just where you are at now.  It is better at least that you are 
              doing meditation because as I've described above in simply returning to 
              this awareness our lives change. Just be aware in yourself and know that
               eventually you are going to have to let go of this desire towards 
              meditation, you'll have to let go of this attachment to meditation being
               a tool to bring about change. Keep meditating and keeping letting go, 
              when the time is right you'll come to see it's time to let go. </span><strong> It
               therefore requires you to acknowledge what the current structure you've
               built up that you call "me", and it requires the willingness to let go 
              of it.  </strong>This takes courage and honesty.</div>

              <div style="margin: 0px;"><strong>At <em>every </em>stage in life what you are experiencing is 
              supported by a set of conditions. Even this one right now!  Even this 
              very consciousness and experience you are having as you read this.  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Once
               you've let go of one set of conditions, another more subtle set 
              becomes apparent through mindfulness.  It is therefore a constant 
              process of letting go, of seeing more clearly. You must constantly 
              remind yourself "This too shall pass" and sit and watch the next 
              structure pass away.  </span><span class="Apple-style-span">As you do peace and happiness reveal themselves on their own, kind of like the sun revealing itself from behind the clouds. </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"> It's not that the sun went away, it was just obscured by clouds.  Our lives are exactly like this.  </span></strong><strong><span class="Apple-style-span">Meditation in this way is about revealing the true nature of what we are and becoming the same as this very nature.</span></strong></div>

              <p>While all the above helps understand how we create the inner chatter, 
              what supports it and how to break it down, when it comes to our time on 
              the meditation mat, how do we apply this? After all this dialogue this 
              isn't going to be a long discourse because it's really quite simple. <strong>Go
               back to basics. When you sit meditation just focus on your breath and 
              be aware, and keep returning over and over to being mindfully aware. 
              That is all.</strong></p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If you notice a desire for something then acknowledge it and know it has
               a supporting set of conditions to it's existence. Don't act out the 
              desire, just simply notice it and return to the focus of the meditation.
               In doing this, without consciously knowing it at first, we remove the 
              underlying conditions of the desire itself. Over time the desire passes.
               We say "time heals" but really it's the awareness that heals, time just
               ticks over as the problem itself dissipates because it's conditions for
               survival are removed.<br> <br> If you are meditating and have inner chatter then notice the inner 
              chatter and acknowledge that there is a supporting set of conditions to 
              it's existence. Don't engage in the chatter no matter how convincing it 
              seems, just simply notice it and return to the meditation. Again, in 
              doing this we remove the underlying conditions of the chatter itself. 
              Over time the chatter quietens down.<br> <br>
              <div>This same process applies from the first day we sit on the meditation 
              mat through to the advance stages, and finally through to complete 
              enlightenment. We aren't gaining anything, we are letting go of the 
              conditions that support a false way of experiencing the world and we are
               ultimately returning to this very awareness that is condition-less.  <strong><em>The
               meditation technique itself therefore is incredibly simple - be aware, 
              that is all -  however it is all the false structures we've build up and
               the chatter about this process of letting go that is our challenge. 
              This is what makes up the path we travel through to eventual realisation
               and enlightenment.</em></strong><br> <br> I hope this article has helped to clarify why we have inner 
              chatter and helped to bring some understanding to the process of 
              quietening it down and how meditation helps.<br> <br> If you have any comments or questions please feel free to add them below.</div>
