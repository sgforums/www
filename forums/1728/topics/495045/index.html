              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">ALISON HORWOOD November 8 2017 Stuff.co.nz</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The story about the marauding Himalayan Black Bears didn't
              come out until they were well into the forest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Miranda Turner and Gavin Strang, were in Bhutan, a tiny
              country perched high in the Eastern Himalayan Mountains between its powerful
              neighbours, China and India. As the Wellington couple hiked through Phobjikha,
              a remote high-altitude valley of primeval forest, embraced on all sides by
              mountainous peaks, their guide casually mentioned the threat of bears to people
              and crops. "Bears," he explained philosophically, "will always
              go for your face".  He made a clawing motion across his mouth and
              jaw.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Bhutan is 75 per cent Buddhist – we knew he didn't
              have a knife in his sock or a rifle on his back because harming animals isn't
              allowed," says Gavin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"In Bhutan there's always another hill higher, so we
              kept trekking – but we began to feel uneasy and wondered about arming ourselves
              with a stick," says Miranda. "Our guide walked in silence for a
              while, then told us brightly, 'it's not the bears you have to worry about, it's
              the tigers'," before launching into a story about tigers so fierce they
              can toss a cow across a paddock.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It became obvious that Bhutan is no ordinary place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Steeped in magic and mystery, it's the world's last great
              Himalayan Kingdom – a picture-book landscape of snowy peaks, Jurassic Park
              forests, majestic fortress-like dzongs, and centuries-old monasteries. In Bhutan,
              the rice is red, and chilies are served as a vegetable - not a spice.  The
              kingdom boasts high-altitude hiking trails, beautiful textiles and crafts,
              spectacular tsechus (dance festivals) and traditional archery competitions that
              gather an almost medieval-looking audience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"We have done a lot of travelling in the last 20 years,
              but Bhutan is not like anywhere we've ever been before," says Gavin.
              "It is small and serene - and unlike other parts of Asia, there's no
              bustle, no tooting horns. We saw traditional archery competitions, monks
              praying and practicing their festival dances – and it's not for the tourists,
              it's active and it's real."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">ANCIENT WAYS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bhutan is a land lost in time; a deeply Buddhist nation that
              holds fast to its ancient ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The country coined the phrase 'Gross National Happiness' in
              the 1970s, and therefore aims for collective happiness, harmonising with nature
              and its traditional values. By law, at least 60 per cent of the country
              must remain forested, and not only is Bhutan carbon-neutral – it actually
              absorbs more carbon than it emits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To add to the intrigue, the tiny nation is ruled by one of
              the youngest monarchs in the world, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck - an Oxford
              University-educated king who is a regular fixture in the society pages of Hello
              magazine. He's fifth in the line of hereditary rulers who have ruled for the
              last 100 years – and unlike neighbouring Nepal where the King was deposed
              nearly ten years ago, monarchs are revered in Bhutan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Bhutan is known as the 'Land of Dragons', the king is
              the 'Dragon King' and the people are the 'Dragon People' – it's like something
              out of Game Of Thrones," says Gavin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tourism numbers are carefully monitored in Bhutan, and all
              foreigners pay an all-inclusive fee of at least US$250 ($362) a day, which
              covers food, accommodation, transport and an official guide, plus a portion
              that goes to the government.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Our style of travel has always been about doing the
              research, then getting off the bus and roaming with our backpacks until we find
              a place to stay," says Miranda. "We've stayed in some interesting
              places from unexpected luxury to mosquito-ridden dives. In Bhutan the
              accommodation was excellent – palaces, remote guest houses and four star
              hotels."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The experience of travelling with an assigned guide was
              completely different– but in a good way," adds Gavin. The couple spent
              most of the day with their guide, who chose their restaurants and
              accommodation. "If you were on your own you'd think Bhutan was beautiful,
              but this was more than that – it gave us an understanding of the country and
              how people live. We would tell him about New Zealand and for once we were the
              bigger country – more than six times bigger by population."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">'WE WORK TO TRAVEL'</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When Gavin and Miranda met 27 years ago they made a decision
              not to get married or have children – but instead spend as much time as they
              could travelling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"We work to travel," explains Gavin, a project
              manager. "We work for four or five years, then rent out the house and
              spend a year travelling."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The couple, who are regular clients at Adventure Travel on
              Willis Street in Wellington, estimate they've seen more than 50 countries
              together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"People often say 'you're lucky!', but it's not about
              luck, it's about planning and determination," says Miranda, who is in
              communications. "It's not an easy option and there are a million reasons
              to not travel – but you only need one reason to travel."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the 1990s they lived in London and travelled extensively
              in Europe. They repatriated home via Egypt, Israel, Jordan and India. In 2004,
              the couple took off for two years, attending a wedding in India, working in
              London, then travelled across Europe in a van. In 2010 they traversed Malaysia
              and China, took the Trans-Mongolian Railway across the Gobi desert to Russia,
              then went through Lithuania, Crete then to London, before heading to South
              America.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For both of them, the appeal is both exploration and
              experience. "For me, it's absolute freedom," says Miranda. "You
              are a stranger in town, an observer – and everything is new."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Five years ago however, Miranda and Gavin did something that
              put the brakes on most of their travel - they got their much-loved Border
              Collie-Lab cross, Remy. "The dog has seriously put the Kibosh on
              things," laughs Miranda. "So instead of taking off for a year at a
              time we're now doing shorter trips and bringing in the dog sitter!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To quell their travel bug when they're stuck at home, Miranda
              enjoys cooking international cuisine. "If I can't go to the world, I'll
              bring it to me." For three years she cooked a dish from every country in
              the world, working her way through alphabetically. Gavin would be handed a dish
              with, "Tonight we dine in Burkina Faso". Favourites included
              Equatorial Guinea fowl, and Chinese Peking duck," she says. One of her few
              purchases in Bhutan was a book of local recipes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">GOOD CALL</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The decision to head to Bhutan was made around Gavin's 50th
              birthday in September.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"We initially thought of Cuba, but it was hurricane
              season," says Miranda. Opting instead for Bhutan, they were on-route in
              Hong Kong and celebrating Gavin's birthday in a Michelin Star restaurant when
              Hurricane Irma hit Florida, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas. "It was a
              good call to head to Bhutan!" says Gavin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The couple flew in from Kathmandu to Paro, a beautiful valley
              2250m above sea level, which is home to the country's oldest monastery, 7th
              century Kyichu Lhakang. They ventured across the Vhilela Pass to the Haa Valley
              and to Punakha, an enthralling place tucked within a mountain realm, and once
              the capital of Bhutan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">They were driven through the rice terraces and village houses
              of Nyegngergang, then taken to the high altitude and isolated valley of
              Phobjikha, the winter habitat of the endangered black-necked cranes. The couple
              ventured into the capital of Thimphu, which lies in a steep valley at an
              altitude of 2350m, and watched one of the country's biggest religious
              festivals, Thimphu Tschechu – which begins on the 10th day of the 8th month on
              the lunar calendar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Both Miranda and Gavin agree however the highlight of their
              Bhutan trip was their climb to Paro Taktsang, or the Tiger's Nest Monastery,
              which hugs the side of the cliff at an elevation of over 3000m above sea level.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A sacred Buddhist site near Paro that was built in 1692,
              according to legend it is where Guru Rinopoche (the founder of Tibetan
              Buddhism) was carried from Tibet to the cliff top site on the back of a tiger –
              thus giving it its name. "If the Tiger's nest isn't in the top ten places
              in the world it must be number 11," says Gavin. It took the couple and
              their guide two hours to ascend, along the way they were passed by men carrying
              supplies up to the monks, and walked under fluttering rows of prayer flags.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Because Miranda and Gavin travelled to Bhutan at the start of
              the three-month window between monsoon season and winter, they escaped the
              crowds, but their view of the Himalayas from the monastery was shrouded in
              cloud.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When it was time to leave the country a few days later
              however, they looked out of the plane's window and saw Mt Everest rising out of
              the clouds.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Then I looked down," Gavin remembers, "the
              clouds magically parted and reflected in the evening sun was the vast expanse
              of the Bengal Delta, where the Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet. It was a
              fitting end to an amazing trip."</span></p>
