One of his principle teachers, Polop Khen Rimpoche (1898-1967), prophesied and encouraged him to spread world peace through Stupa building all over the Country.<br><br>As a symbol of his wish to fulfill his teacher’s prophecy, Chene Lhundrup Rimpoche himself traveled throughout many places and built more than thirty stupas all over Bhutan as of now. The vision of Chene lhendup could not met without a stupa in his own Monastery. Financial constraint was the only key factor that kept him behind so long. Now with the help of Khenpo Rigzin Wanghcuk  ( the newly appointed khenpo in Orgyen Chholing  Monastery, Rimpoche and khenpo Rigzin Wangchuk are in the process and plans of coming up with the Parinirvana Stupa for his last wish to fulfill his root teacher and all mother sentient beings  near the main temple in Tsheldang, Bhutan. The stupa is particularly good for overcoming the obstacles for all one to nine moles according to Chinese and Tibetan astrology.<br><br>As Late H.H Polop Khen Rimpoche he wrote, "Within the stupa, the blessings of the teacher remain unchanging. The Buddha said whoever sees the sight of it, feels the breeze near it will be liberated by its touch, and hears the tinkling of the small bells around it, would be liberated by the sound. Having seen a stupa, by reflecting in one’s experience of it, one is liberated by recollection. May these stupas become a supreme object of offering, liberating whoever sees, touches and remember".<br>There are eight different types of stupas that have been built according to Lord Buddha activities.<br><br>   1. The Lotus Blossom Stupa at Lumbini,Nepal.<br>   2. The Enlightenment Stupa at Bodhgaya,India.<br>   3. The Stupa Of Turning Wheel Of Dharma at Varanasi,India.<br>   4. The Stupa of the Descent From a Heavenly Realm at Shankasya,India.<br>   5. The Great Miracle Stupa at Sravasti, India.<br>   6. The Stupa of Reuniting the Sangha at Rajagriha, India.<br>   7. All-Victorious Stupa at Vaishali, India.<br>   8. The Parinirvana Stupa at Kushinagar, India.<br><br>The construction of this the Parinirvana stupa in Orgyen Choeling Monastery is a spiritual task dedicated to world peace. It measures 25 feet high and 12-feet width. The stupa will be made with hand-placed stone blocks with concrete from outside. Stone carvings adorn the bumpa vase in the center. Rimpoche himself, a specialist in stupa making, and the entire members of Orgyen Chholing Monastery and khenpo Rigzin Wangchuk<br><br>Read more at : http://rigzin.org/post/Stupa-Project<br><br>Chene Lhendrup Rimpoche has long held plans to build a retreat centre The centre will be constructed in an isolated area four hours walk from Orgyen Choling Monastery, at Lingtang. The retreat centre will be called Orgyen Kunzang Shedrup Choling. The practices of the Longchen and Pema Lingpa lineage will be lead by Rimpoche in the traditional three year, three month, three day retreat. Currently there is no retreat centre in the vicinity, therefore all monks must leave their monastery and teacher and go to another district.<br><br>Read more at : http://rigzin.org/post/Retreat-Centre<br><br>Orgyen Choling Monastery, PO Box Kheng Tsheldang, Nangkhor, Zhemgagng, Bhutan<br>Website : http://rigzin.org<br></p></div>
