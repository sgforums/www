              <p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">By John Sudworth</span><span class="byline" style="font-size: 22.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></span><span class="byline-title2" style="font-size: 22.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">BBC News, Shanghai </span></span><span class="date" style="font-size: 22.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">29 January
                  2015</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Could China be bringing Tibetan Buddhism in from the cold? There
                  are new signs that while a crackdown on Tibetan nationalism continues, the
                  atheist state may be softening its position towards the religion - and even the
                  Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>That a former senior Communist Party official would invite the
                  BBC into his home might, to most foreign journalists in China, seem an unlikely
                  prospect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Especially if that official was rumoured to have close links to
                  the Chinese leadership and to have worked closely with the country's security
                  services.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>But the idea that such an official would then invite the BBC to
                  witness him praying in front of a portrait of the Dalai Lama, would seem a
                  preposterous one. Laughable - insane even.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>That, though, is exactly what Xiao Wunan did.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Inside Xiao's luxury Beijing apartment, in pride of place atop
                  his own private Buddhist shrine, sits a portrait of the exiled Tibetan
                  spiritual leader, a man long reviled by the Chinese government as a dangerous
                  separatist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>For Tibetan monks even the possession of the Dalai Lama's
                  photograph is a risky proposition and the displaying of his portrait in
                  monasteries is prohibited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>But there, beneath that same image sat Xiao, with a Tibetan
                  Buddhist guru, Geshe Sonam, sitting beside him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>It's really no big deal, the 50-year-old Xiao explains.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"In regard to the political problems between the Dalai Lama
                  and China… we hardly pay any attention," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>"It's really hard
                  for us to judge him from that angle. As Buddhists, we only pay attention to him
                  as part of our Buddhist practice."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Xiao was introduced to
                  the BBC by a Chinese businessman, 36-year-old Sun Kejia - one of an unknown,
                  but <a href="http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/q-and-a-john-osburg-on-chinas-wealthy-turning-to-spiritualism/?_r=0">reportedly
                  growing number of wealthy Chinese</a>, drawn in recent years to the mysticism
                  of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The increasing
                  popularity of religion in general in China has been well documented and is
                  often explained in terms of China's rapid economic expansion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Millions of Chinese
                  today may now have the kind of wealth that previous generations could only
                  dream of, but economic growth has been accompanied by seismic social upheaval
                  and many of the old certainties have been swept away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>"I was once
                  confronted with great difficulties and problems in my business," Sun says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>"I felt they
                  couldn't be overcome by human effort and that only Buddha, ghosts and God could
                  help me."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>So Sun became a follower not of merchant bankers or money
                  managers, but monks - Tibetan monks in particular. And he has indeed since
                  earned his fortune, which he estimates at more than $100m.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>He now runs a chain of Buddhist clubs, and pays from his own
                  pocket for Tibetan gurus like Geshe Sonam to come and preach there, giving them
                  badly needed funds for their missions and monasteries back in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>But while Sun's invited guests - businessmen, party officials and
                  property owners - find comfort and spirituality, he finds something else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"What I want is influence," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"My friends who come here are attracted to this place. I
                  can use the resources they bring to do my other business. From that angle, it
                  is also my contribution for spreading Buddhism. This brings good karma and so I
                  get what I want."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>And it seems to be working.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Sun invites us to meet other well-connected individuals who use
                  his club.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Seated on the floor with Geshe Sonam is a woman who Sun says is
                  connected through family ties to the highest echelons of Chinese politics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>She and a man she introduces as a senior official at China's
                  National Development and Reform Commission, and who appears to be her driver,
                  are placing watches, prayer beads and necklaces into the centre of the circle
                  for Geshe Sonam to bless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>A luxury banquet follows the religious ceremony, and later the
                  monk admits to being a bit uncomfortable with the whole thing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"No matter how good the food is, it's still just
                  food," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"Sometimes it takes so long and I really feel I'm wasting
                  my time. I become a bit anxious. But this can also be a way to preach. If I
                  don't go here, or don't go there, would it be better for me to just stay in a
                  cave and never come out?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Buddhist monks need the money and dozens, perhaps hundreds, are
                  now prospecting for funds in China's big cities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Given that China is
                  still, officially, an atheist country, that may seem odd, especially because of
                  the links between Buddhism and political activism in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>China however is not
                  only allowing this Buddhist evangelism to take place but may now be actively
                  encouraging it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/29/us-china-politics-vacuum-idUSBRE98S0GS20130929">have
                  been reports</a> that President Xi Jinping is - relatively speaking - more
                  tolerant of religion than his predecessors, in the hope that it will help fill
                  China's moral vacuum and stem social unrest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>And there have also <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/01/china-tibet-xi-jinping-idINDEE88002I20120901">long
                  been rumours</a> that members of the Chinese elite have been interested in
                  Buddhism, including Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The president's father,
                  Xi Zhongxun, a Communist Party revolutionary and leader, is himself <a href="http://tibetpolicy.net/comments-briefs/will-xi-bring-a-meaningful-reform/">reported
                  to have had a good relationship</a> with the Dalai Lama before he fled China in
                  1959.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>And that's perhaps where
                  Xiao Wunan comes in, because <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130420000007&amp;cid=1101">another
                  unsubstantiated rumour has it</a> that his father was also close to the
                  president's father.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Much of this is
                  speculation, of course, but the important question is whether Xiao's permission
                  for the BBC to witness him worshipping at a Buddhist altar is meant to send a
                  signal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Xiao had yet another surprise up his sleeve, handing the BBC
                  some video footage of a meeting he had with the Dalai Lama in India - his place
                  of exile - in 2012.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Formal talks were last held in 2010 but even they were only
                  between representatives of the two sides.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Xiao's footage is rare evidence of face-to-face talks between
                  the Dalai Lama himself and someone close to the Chinese government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>There were at the time a few unconfirmed newspaper reports about
                  it in the Indian press, full of speculation about the significance, but there
                  was never any official confirmation that it took place - until the BBC received
                  the video.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>At one point in the conversation the Dalai Lama tells Xiao he is
                  concerned about the activities of fake monks in China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"I am also concerned about this," Xiao replies.
                  "Therefore, we are really in need of a Buddhist leader and that's why I
                  think your holiness can play such an important role."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama complains about China's whole approach
                  to Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"Let's be honest, the Chinese government has been thinking
                  like a crazy person on their Tibetan policy," he says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"They haven't been facing up to it. This tough policy is
                  not beneficial to China or to Tibetans and also gives China a very bad
                  international image." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Xiao Wunan's exact role when he was in government is unclear -
                  "just call me a former high official", he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>He also insists that he was not acting as a Chinese government
                  envoy when he met the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>He says he was in India in his capacity as the executive vice
                  chairman of an organisation called the Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation
                  Foundation (APECF).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>APECF is often described as being backed by the Chinese government
                  and is involved in some pretty substantial influence building, including a
                  multi-billion-dollar investment in developing a Buddhist site in Nepal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Either way, it seems unlikely that any former senior Chinese
                  official would be able to visit the Dalai Lama in India, or for that matter be
                  filmed worshipping in front of his picture, without some pretty powerful
                  backing in Beijing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>So what might it all mean? I put this question to Robbie
                  Barnett, a Tibet specialist at Columbia University in New York.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>Barnett advises against reading too much into Xiao Wunan's
                  meeting with the Dalai Lama, but says it is nonetheless symbolic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"I can detect no politically significant activities in that
                  meeting," he says, "but it is significant as a symbolic indicator, a
                  glimpse of a shift that might be under consideration in, or near, the
                  policy-making heights of the Chinese system."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>He suggests that Xiao's confidence in releasing the video does
                  not necessarily mean he has the backing of the whole of the Chinese leadership,
                  but that he probably has the backing of a powerful faction within it, at the
                  very least.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"We know it is meant to symbolise something," Barnett
                  says. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #333333;'>"They want us to see that something might be happening,
                  that a debate may be taking place."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There can be little
                  doubt that the ban on the portrait of the Dalai Lama and the tightening of
                  Chinese control over the past two decades have served to heighten tensions in
                  Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Throughout that period
                  there have been talks between the two sides, both formal and informal, but
                  little has changed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In recent months,
                  however, some reports suggest that the unofficial dialogue has become more
                  substantial, even raising the possibility of the Dalai Lama being allowed to
                  return from exile for a historic visit. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>So, should the release
                  of the video by Xiao Wunan be seen as evidence that Xi Jinping really is
                  changing China's approach to Tibetan Buddhism, or is it simply a smokescreen,
                  designed to give the appearance of a softening line, while the harsh crackdown
                  in Tibet continues?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 11.8pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>If nothing else, Xiao
                  Wunan and his Dalai Lama shrine appear to be proof that well-connected members
                  of the Chinese elite are now taking an active interest in Tibetan Buddhism -
                  and that monks are now being given license to encourage them.</span></p>

                  rituals."</span></p>
