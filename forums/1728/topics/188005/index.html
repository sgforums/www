            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Translator's note</strong>: Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddha's carte blanche for following one's own sense of right and wrong, it actually says something much more rigorous than that. Traditions are not to be followed simply because they are traditions. Reports (such as historical accounts or news) are not to be followed simply because the source seems reliable. One's own preferences are not to be followed simply because they seem logical or resonate with one's feelings. Instead, any view or belief must be tested by the results it yields when put into practice; and Â— to guard against the possibility of any bias or limitations in one's understanding of those results Â— they must further be checked against the experience of people who are wise. The ability to question and test one's beliefs in an appropriate way is called appropriate attention. The ability to recognize and chose wise people as mentors is called having admirable friends. According to Iti 16-17, these are, respectively, the most important internal and external factors for attaining the goal of the practice. For further thoughts on how to test a belief in practice, see MN 61, MN 95, AN VII.80, and AN VIII.53. For thoughts on how to judge whether another person is wise, see MN 110, AN IV.192, and AN VIII.54.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One, on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks, arrived at Kesaputta, a town of the Kalamas. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative Â— the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan Â— has arrived at Kesaputta. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known Â— having realized it through direct knowledge Â— this world with its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests, their rulers &amp; common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"<br><br>So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One. On arrival, some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name &amp; clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.<br><br>As they sat there, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Lord, there are some priests &amp; contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other priests &amp; contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us absolutely uncertain &amp; in doubt: Which of these venerable priests &amp; contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"<br><br>"Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' Â— then you should abandon them.<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this aversive person, overcome by aversion, his mind possessed by aversion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this deluded person, overcome by delusion, his mind possessed by delusion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"<br><br>"Unskillful, lord."<br><br>"Blameworthy or blameless?"<br><br>"Blameworthy, lord."<br><br>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"<br><br>"Criticized by the wise, lord."<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, do they lead to harm &amp; to suffering, or not?"<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, they lead to harm &amp; to suffering. That is how it appears to us."<br><br>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering" Â— then you should abandon them.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.<br><br>"Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness' Â— then you should enter &amp; remain in them.<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not possessed by greed, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this unaversive person, not overcome by aversion, his mind not possessed by aversion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this undeluded person, not overcome by delusion, his mind not possessed by delusion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."</div>

This is the first assurance he acquires.<br><br>"'But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of actions rightly &amp; wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease Â— free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble.' This is the second assurance he acquires.<br><br>"'If evil is done through acting, still I have willed no evil for anyone. Having done no evil action, from where will suffering touch me?' This is the third assurance he acquires.<br><br>"'But if no evil is done through acting, then I can assume myself pure in both respects.' This is the fourth assurance he acquires.<br><br>"One who is a disciple of the noble ones Â— his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, &amp; pure Â— acquires these four assurances in the here-&amp;-now."<br><br>"So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone.

Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One Â— through many lines of reasoning Â— made the Dhamma clear. We go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</div>

Both in his own practice and in his methods for teaching the disciples he was exemplary. The Buddha taught the standards of practice as skilful means for getting rid of conceit, he couldn't do the practice for us. Having heard that teaching we must further teach ourselves, practice for ourselves. The results will arise here, not at the teaching.<br><br>The Buddha's teaching can only enable us to get an initial understanding of the Dhamma, but that Dhamma is not yet within our hearts. Why not? Because we haven't yet practiced, we haven't yet taught ourselves. The Dhamma arises at the practice. If you know it, you know it through the practice. If you doubt it, you doubt it at the practice. Teachings from the Masters may be true, but simply listening to Dhamma is not yet enough to enable us to realize it. The teaching simply points out the way to realize. To realize the Dhamma we must take that teaching and bring it into our hearts. That part which is for the body we apply to the body, that part which is for the speech we apply to the speech, and that part which is for the mind we apply to the mind. This means that after hearing the teaching we must further teach ourselves to know that Dhamma, to be that Dhamma.<br><br>The Buddha said that those who simply believe others are not truly wise. A wise person practices until he is one with the Dhamma, until he can have confidence in himself, independent of others.<br><br>On one occasion, while Venerable Sariputta was sitting, listening respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, the Buddha turned to him and asked:<br><br>"Sariputta, do you believe this teaching?" Venerable Sariputta replied, "No, I don't yet believe it". Now this is a good illustration. Venerable Sariputta listened, and he took note. When he said he didn't yet believe he wasn't being careless, he was speaking the truth. He simply took note of that teaching, because he had not yet developed his own understanding of it, so he told the Buddha that he didn't yet believe, because he really didn't believe. These words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude, but actually he wasn't. He spoke the truth, and the Buddha praised him for it.<br><br>"Good, good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn't readily believe, he should consider first before believing."<br><br>Conviction in a belief can take various forms. One form reasons according to Dhamma, while another form is contrary to the Dhamma. This second way is heedless, it is a foolhardy understanding, micchaditthi, wrong view. One doesn't listen to anybody else.<br><br>Take the example of Dighanakha the Brahmin. This Brahmin only believed himself, he wouldn't believe others. At one time when the Buddha was resting at Rajagaha, Dighanakha went to listen to his teaching. Or you might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha, because he was intent on expounding his own views ...<br><br>"I am of the view that nothing suits me."<br>This was his view. The Buddha listened to DighanakhaÂ’s view and then answered,<br><br>"Brahmin, this view of yours doesn't suit you either." When the Buddha had answered in this way, Dighanakha was stumped. He didn't know what to say. The Buddha explained in many ways, till the Brahmin understood. He stopped to reflect and saw...<br><br>"Hmm, this view of mine isn't right."<br>On hearing the Buddha's answer the Brahmin abandoned his conceited views and immediately saw the truth. He changed right then and there, turning right around, just as one would invert one's hand. He praised the teaching of the Buddha thus:<br><br>"Listening to the Blessed One's teaching, my mind was illumined, just as one living in darkness might perceive light. My mind is like an overturned basin which has been up righted, like a man who has been lost and finds the way."<br><br>Now at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind, within that mind which had been up righted. Wrong view vanished and right view took its place. Darkness disappeared and light arose.<br><br>The Buddha declared that the Brahmin Dighanakha was one who had opened the Dhamma Eye. Previously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no intention of changing them. But when he heard the Buddha's teaching his mind saw the truth, he saw that his clinging to those views was wrong. When the<br>right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous understanding as mistaken, so he compared his experience with a person living in darkness who had found light. This is how it is. At that time the Brahmin Dighanakha transcended his wrong view.<br><br>Now we must change in this way. Before we can give up defilements we must change our perspective. We must begin to practice rightly and practice well Previously we didn't practice rightly or well, and yet we thought we were right and good just the same. When we really look into the matter we upright ourselves, just like turning over one's hand.</div>
