              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">5 Mar 2011 (Sat)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6.30pm – 8.30pm</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today’s session was more about mindfulness of reciting Buddha’s name e.g. Amitabha Buddha. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Initially I thought it is mainly Mahayana Buddhism that we recite buddha’s name mindfully, for example, Pureland. But in the session, there is an extract from Dhammapada, Verse Two (I am not sure Dhammapada is Theravada tradition) has shown an example of how mind if trained mindfully can help to reborn in better places</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(</span><a href="http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=002"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080; font-family: Times New Roman;">http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=002</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Story of Matthakundali</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered Verse (2) of this book, with reference to Matthakundali, a young Brahmin. Matthakundali was a young brahmin, whose father, Adinnapubbaka, was very stingy and never gave anything in charity. Even the gold ornaments for his only son were made by himself to save payment for workmanship. When his son fell ill, no physician was consulted, until it was too late. When he realized that his son was dying, he had the youth carried outside on to the verandah, so that people coming to his house would not see his possessions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On that morning, the Buddha arising early from his deep meditation of compassion saw, in his Net of Knowledge, Matthakundali lying on the verandah. So when entering Savatthi for alms-food with his disciples, the Buddha stood near the door of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka. The Buddha sent forth a ray of light to attract the attention of the youth, who was facing the interior of the house. <strong>The youth saw the Buddha; and as he was very weak he could only profess his faith mentally. But that was enough. When he passed away with his heart in devotion to the Buddha he was reborn in the Tavatimsa celestial world.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From his celestial abode the young Matthakundali, seeing his father mourning over him at the cemetery, appeared to the old man in the likeness of his old self. He told his father about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world and also urged him to approach and invite the Buddha to a meal. At the house of Adinnapubbaka the question of whether one could or could not be reborn in a celestial world simply by mentally professing profound faith in the Buddha, without giving in charity or observing the moral precepts, was brought up. So the Buddha willed that Matthakundali should appear in person; Matthakundali soon appeared fully decked with celestial ornaments and told them about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world. Then only, the audience became convinced that the son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka by simply devoting his mind to the Buddha had attained much glory.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</span></p>
              <div>
              <table class="MsoNormalTable" border="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td style="background-color: transparent; border: #ece9d8; padding: 1.5pt;">
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Verse 2: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.</span></p>
              </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </div>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At the end of the discourse Matthakundali and his father Adinnapubbaka attained Sotapatti Magga and Sotapatti Phala. Adinnapubbaka also donated almost all his wealth to the cause of the Buddha's Teaching.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The above story was shown during the session. During the session, Mr. Shen shared a story which how reciting Amitabha Buddha’s name can protect people from danger. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I can’t recall where the story took place but there was a man who set up a table or alter (something) to offer food for the wandering unseen. One incident happened when this man was actually grabbed or something… A force that made him immobile. He recited Amitabha Buddha’s name in his mind and the unseen force released him immediately.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I tried to summarise what was shared during the session</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There are further reasons why reciting Amitabha Buddha name is important:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-to aspire to reborn in Pureland and learn Dharma in the best conducive environment</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-as we are mostly busy with our secular work and unable to have time for our cultivation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-life is uncertain, death is certain. While we recite Amitabha Buddha’s name, we are slowly ingraining, infusing into our minds. Think of it, something like a spiritual insurance. Because life exists only in each breath, life becomes full of uncertainty. Only reciting Amitabha Buddha’s name helps to devote our mind from all distractions, and prepare us for the inevitable, unexpected death call.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">During Q &amp; A,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One question was asked: “Can evil beings manifest into Amitabha Buddha and confuse the person?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The answer is yes… Freak… If you chant Guan Yin Bodhisattva but Amitabha Buddha came along… most likely the Amitabha Buddha Image is a hoax… The karma does not match.<span>  </span>Mr. Shen thought it was like… “Wrong number leh” Lol whole class was laughing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Another question was: “If chant Shakyamuni Buddha’s name will lead to Pureland? The answer was surprisingly no. Because Shakyamuni Buddha did not create a Pureland. I am not too sure of the details. Sorry about this.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Amituofo.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000099;">Notes with Pureland Perspectives<br style="color: #000099;"><br></span>[1]</strong> Though the Buddhas beseech us to be mindful of Amitabha Buddha (Amituofo), as stated in the Amitabha Sutra, the Buddhas are always mindful of sentient beings, so as to do what they can to help. When help seems absent, it is only because we lack the karmic conditions to be helped. This is as stated in 'The Foremost Attainment of Great Strength Bodhisattva through Buddha Mindfulness' below, from the Surangama Sutra. (Mindfulness of Amitabha Buddha is the easiest practice we can do to reconnect to all Buddhas, as stated in the Amitabha Sutra.)<br><br>å��æ–¹å¦‚æ�¥ï¼Œæ€œå¿µä¼—ç”Ÿï¼Œå¦‚æ¯�å¿†å­�ï¼›è‹¥å­�é€ƒé€�ï¼Œè™½å¿†ä½•ä¸ºï¼Ÿ<br>å­�è‹¥å¿†æ¯�ï¼Œå¦‚æ¯�å¿†æ—¶ï¼Œæ¯�å­�åŽ†ç”Ÿï¼Œä¸�ç›¸è¿�è¿œã€‚<br><br>The Thus Come Ones (Buddhas) in all the ten directions are mindful of living beings, out of pity for them, in the same way that a mother is mindful of her child. If the child runs away, of what use is the mother's concern? But if the child remembers the mother in the same way that the mother remembers the child, then in life after life the mother and child will not be far apart.<br><br><strong>[2]</strong> Like Shakyamuni Buddha, Amitabha Buddha also sends forth light, in all directions to touch and comfort beings in need. This is stated in the vows below, on how Amitabha Buddha's unlimited light of compassion, merits and wisdom can aid us. Through mindfulness of Amitabha Buddha, we can experience this light.<br><br>è®¾æˆ‘å¾—ä½›ï¼Œå…‰æ˜Žæœ‰èƒ½é™�é‡�ï¼Œä¸‹è‡³ä¸�ç…§ç™¾å�ƒäº¿é‚£ç”±ä»–è¯¸ä½›å›½è€…ï¼Œä¸�å�–æ­£è§‰ã€‚<br><br>Vow #12: If, when I [Dharmakara, who became Amitabha Buddha] attain Buddhahood, my light should be limited, unable to illuminate at least a hundred thousand kotis of nayutas of Buddha-lands, may I not attain perfect awakening.<br><br>è®¾æˆ‘å¾—ä½›ï¼Œå��æ–¹æ— é‡�ä¸�å�¯æ€�è®®è¯¸ä½›ä¸–ç•Œä¼—ç”Ÿä¹‹ç±»ï¼Œè’™æˆ‘å…‰æ˜Žè§¦å…¶ä½“è€…ï¼Œèº«å¿ƒæŸ”è½¯ï¼Œè¶…è¿‡å¤©äººï¼Œè‹¥ä¸�å°”è€…ï¼Œä¸�å�–æ­£è§‰ã€‚<br><br>Vow #33: If, when I attain Buddhahood, beings of all kinds in all immeasurable and inconceivable Buddha-lands of the ten directions, who receive my light, that touches their bodies, should not experience [blessings of peace, happiness,] gentleness and softness of body and mind that surpasses that of devas and humans, may I not attain perfect awakening.<br><br><strong>[3]</strong> Matthakundali's case reminds us of the importance and power of faith as a spiritual faculty, that can lead even to fortunate rebirths. As he was weak, he could only profess his faith mentally; not even verbally (e.g. by chanting or praising aloud), yet this was enough for securing a good rebirth as it is still the devotional practice of Buddha mindfulness. A good rebirth is possible via faithful mindfulness of the Buddha without doing charity or observing precepts in the moment as once one is sincerely mindful of Buddha, one would be practising both in that instant. This parallels that taught by Master Ou Yi (è•…ç›Šå¤§å¸ˆ), the Ninth Chinese Patriarch of Pureland Buddhism, as part of the practice of the Six Perfections by Buddha mindfulness, as below. (The easiest way of practising Buddha mindfulness is by verbal or silent recitation of the Buddha's name.)<br><br>çœŸèƒ½å¿µä½›ï¼Œæ”¾ä¸‹èº«å¿ƒä¸–ç•Œï¼Œå�³å¤§å¸ƒæ–½ã€‚<br><br>In true mindfulness of the Buddha,<br>letting go of attachment to one's body, mind and the world<br>is the great Perfection of Giving [Charity].<br><br>çœŸèƒ½å¿µä½›ï¼Œä¸�è´Ÿèµ·è´ªå—”ç—´ï¼Œå�³å¤§æŒ�æˆ’ã€‚<br><br>In true mindfulness of the Buddha,<br>not giving rise to any thought of greed, hatred or ignorance<br>is the great Perfection of Morality [Precepts].<br><br><strong>[4]</strong> Matthakundali was able to attain much glory as a deva in a heavenly plane because the faithful practice of Buddha mindfulness creates much merits, as the Buddhas are the most meritorious of all beings that we can be mindful of. In this sense, the Buddha is able to share his merits with those who are mindful of him.<br><br><strong>[5]</strong> Based on the principle that Matthakundali was able to be reborn in Tavatimsa heaven due to the merits of being faithful to the Buddha in his last moments, if we are also mindful, specifically of Amitabha Buddha in our everyday life, and especially during our last moments, while being equipped with all Three Provisions of faith (in Amitabha Buddha), aspiration (to be reborn in his Pureland) and practice (of true mindfulness of Amitabha Buddha), we can be able to be born in his Pureland, which is more glorious than any heaven - where the path to Buddhahood is guaranteed. This is reflected in this vow:<br><br>è®¾æˆ‘å¾—ä½›ï¼Œè‡ªåœ°ä»¥ä¸Šï¼Œè‡³äºŽè™šç©ºï¼Œå®«æ®¿æ¥¼è§‚ï¼Œæ± æµ�å�Žæ ‘ï¼Œå›½ä¸­æ‰€æœ‰ä¸€åˆ‡ä¸‡ç‰©ï¼Œçš†ä»¥æ— é‡�æ�‚å®�ï¼Œç™¾å�ƒç§�é¦™ï¼Œè€Œå…±å�ˆæˆ�ã€‚ä¸¥é¥°å¥‡å¦™ï¼Œè¶…è¯¸å¤©äººã€‚å…¶é¦™æ™®è–°å��æ–¹ä¸–ç•Œï¼Œè�©è�¨é—»è€…ï¼Œçš†ä¿®ä½›è¡Œã€‚è‹¥ä¸�å°”è€…ï¼Œä¸�å�–æ­£è§‰ã€‚<br><br>Vow #32: If, when I attain Buddhahood, from the ground to above, even to the sky, palaces, towers, ponds, streams, flowering trees, and all myriad objects, are made of combinations of immeasurable variegated treasures and a hundred thousand kinds of fragrances [which radiate the Dharma]. These marvellous magnificent adornments surpass all things heavenly and human. Their fragrances universally pervade worlds of the ten directions and when bodhisattvas smell it, they all cultivate the Buddha's practices. If this should not be so, may I not attain perfect awakening.<br><br><strong>[6]</strong> Matthakundali's case was a very fortunate one, where he was able to be mindful of the Buddha after being prompted by him personally in the nick of time due to his good karma, just before passing away. This illustrates the importance of having strong karmic affinity with at least one Buddha. It also illustrates the importance of death-proximate karma, in linking us to our destination of rebirth. If we are relatively more spiritually 'distant' from any Buddha, regular practice of Buddha mindfulness in everyday life is important - for creating strong karmic connections with Amitabha Buddha, so as to increase our ability to be 'automatically' mindful of him as much as possible, especially on our deathbeds. The light of Amitabha Buddha's light is actually shining upon us all the time. We just need to practise well to experience it.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6.30pm – 8.30pm</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today’s session was more about mindfulness of reciting Buddha’s name e.g. Amitabha Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Initially I thought it is mainly Mahayana Buddhism that we recite buddha’s name mindfully, for example, Pureland. But in the session, there is an extract from Dhammapada, Verse Two (I am not sure Dhammapada is Theravada tradition) has shown an example of how mind if trained mindfully can help to reborn in better places</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=002"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800080;">http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=002</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Story of Matthakundali</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered Verse (2) of this book, with reference to Matthakundali, a young Brahmin. Matthakundali was a young brahmin, whose father, Adinnapubbaka, was very stingy and never gave anything in charity. Even the gold ornaments for his only son were made by himself to save payment for workmanship. When his son fell ill, no physician was consulted, until it was too late. When he realized that his son was dying, he had the youth carried outside on to the verandah, so that people coming to his house would not see his possessions.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On that morning, the Buddha arising early from his deep meditation of compassion saw, in his Net of Knowledge, Matthakundali lying on the verandah. So when entering Savatthi for alms-food with his disciples, the Buddha stood near the door of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka. The Buddha sent forth a ray of light to attract the attention of the youth, who was facing the interior of the house. <strong>The youth saw the Buddha; and as he was very weak he could only profess his faith mentally. But that was enough. When he passed away with his heart in devotion to the Buddha he was reborn in the Tavatimsa celestial world.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From his celestial abode the young Matthakundali, seeing his father mourning over him at the cemetery, appeared to the old man in the likeness of his old self. He told his father about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world and also urged him to approach and invite the Buddha to a meal. At the house of Adinnapubbaka the question of whether one could or could not be reborn in a celestial world simply by mentally professing profound faith in the Buddha, without giving in charity or observing the moral precepts, was brought up. So the Buddha willed that Matthakundali should appear in person; Matthakundali soon appeared fully decked with celestial ornaments and told them about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world. Then only, the audience became convinced that the son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka by simply devoting his mind to the Buddha had attained much glory.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</span></p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Verse 2: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At the end of the discourse Matthakundali and his father Adinnapubbaka attained Sotapatti Magga and Sotapatti Phala. Adinnapubbaka also donated almost all his wealth to the cause of the Buddha's Teaching.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The above story was shown during the session. During the session, Mr. Shen shared a story which how reciting Amitabha Buddha’s name can protect people from danger.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I can’t recall where the story took place but there was a man who set up a table or alter (something) to offer food for the wandering unseen. One incident happened when this man was actually grabbed or something… A force that made him immobile. He recited Amitabha Buddha’s name in his mind and the unseen force released him immediately.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I tried to summarise what was shared during the session</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There are further reasons why reciting Amitabha Buddha name is important:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-to aspire to reborn in Pureland and learn Dharma in the best conducive environment</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-as we are mostly busy with our secular work and unable to have time for our cultivation</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-life is uncertain, death is certain. While we recite Amitabha Buddha’s name, we are slowly ingraining, infusing into our minds. Think of it, something like a spiritual insurance. Because life exists only in each breath, life becomes full of uncertainty. Only reciting Amitabha Buddha’s name helps to devote our mind from all distractions, and prepare us for the inevitable, unexpected death call.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">During Q &amp; A,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One question was asked: “Can evil beings manifest into Amitabha Buddha and confuse the person?”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The answer is yes… Freak… If you chant Guan Yin Bodhisattva but Amitabha Buddha came along… most likely the Amitabha Buddha Image is a hoax… The karma does not match.<span> </span> Mr. Shen thought it was like… “Wrong number leh” Lol whole class was laughing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Another question was: “If chant Shakyamuni Buddha’s name will lead to Pureland? The answer was surprisingly no. Because Shakyamuni Buddha did not create a Pureland. I am not too sure of the details. Sorry about this.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Amituofo.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Thanks for sharing. Regarding the Q &amp; A, I've heard Buddhists who recited Amituofo and wished to be born in Pureland, at their deathbed, only Guanyin Bodhisattva came to fetch her. I understand that we can follow any one of the Buddha from Pureland (<br>Amitabha, Guanyin Bodhisattva or Great Strength Bodhisattva). If you can, may be can help to clarify with Mr. Shen during your next lesson. Thanks.</p>

For all that is done, be it good or evil, if it is good, the merits should be dedicated for rebirth in Pure Land. If it is evil, there should be repentance for aspiring rebirth in Pure Land. Furthermore, without a secondary ambition, this is called Aspiration – Master Ou Yi</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With Faith and Aspiration already complete, recitation of (Amitabha) Buddha’s name is correctly called the main practice, while correction of evil and cultivation of good are all called auxiliary practices – Master Ou Yi</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the practice of reciting the Buddha’s name, our Faith and Aspiration (Vow) are emphasized. If one has the Faith and Aspiration, even if one has not attained single-mindedness (in practice) yet, one can still obtain rebirth in (Amitabha Buddha’s) Pure Land. However, if one has attained single-mindedness, and yet lacks faith and aspiration, one will not be reborn in Pure Land. Many worldly people emphasize being single-minded, not emphasizing Faith and Aspiration, thus missing what is essential. Furthermore, when they have yet to attain single-mindedness, they doubt and fear not being able to obtain rebirth in Pure Land, which is completely opposite of true Faith and profound Aspiration. Therefore, it is beneficial to increase Faith and Aspiration, till single-mindedness is achieved. This is good mindfulness. If we fail to achieve single-mindedness and thus always doubt whether we can be reborn in Pure Land, this becomes bad mindfulness. This should not be not known- Master Yin Guang</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium; background-color: #ffff33;"><strong><span style="background-repeat: repeat; font-family: Arial;">How Do We Know If Amituofo &amp; Pure Land Is Real?</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;"><br></span><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Question: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We are taught in the Kalama Sutta to analyse statements of scriptures, critically, including those taught by the Buddha. How do we use this teaching to gauge the following statement by Shakyamuni Buddha in the Infinite life Sutra, and to develop faith and understanding?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">‘The Bodhisattva Dharmakara <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">has already attained Buddhahood </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">[became Amita(bha) Buddha; Amituofo] </span></strong>and is <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">now dwelling in a western Buddha-land </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">[Sukhavati Pure Land]</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">, called </span></strong>"<strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Peace and Bliss</span></strong>," a hundred thousand kotis of lands away from here.’ Ananda further asked the Buddha, "How much time has passed since he attained Buddhahood?" The Buddha replied, "Since he attained Buddhahood, about <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">ten kalpas have passed.</span></strong>"’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Answer:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> Let us take one step backwards... When we hear that <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Shakyamuni Buddha</span></strong> himself told his disciples that he <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">has already attained Buddhahood</span></strong>, that he dwells in an eternal state of <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Peace and Bliss'</span></strong> (attributes of enlightenment too), more than 2,500 years ago, we too ought to ask if this is really so - because we can't time-travel to verify this for ourselves. (In fact, being unenlightened, we cannot verify the Buddha’s enlightenment.) Trust them as we do, historians might make mistakes too. Though they do agree and we do believe that the Buddha did walk the Earth, the worst case scenario is that the Buddha never existed or was not enlightened. How should we see this 'problem'? Here is an answer, that we should naturally arrive at when we study and practise the Buddha's teachings deeper: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thedailyenlightenment-realisation/message/318"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/thedailyenlightenment-realisation/message/318</span></span></a> (What If There Is No Triple Gem?) We should realise something surprising after reflecting on the above - that for us to be Buddhists, we do need some faith:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">1. Faith that the Buddha existed, <br>2. Faith that there is such thing as enlightenment, <br>3. Faith that he attained enlightenment, and<br>4. Faith that what he taught can lead us to enlightenment too. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In the Pure Land teachings, faith is simply extended one step forward - by having faith that the Buddha taught us accurately about Amitabha Buddha. In a sense, it is easier to believe in the Pure Land teachings than to believe Buddhahood is possible. For instance, if someone says there is a good school where you can learn to become wiser, this is more easy to believe than saying you can attain perfect wisdom and become a principal of your own school one day. Here, the school is analogous to Pure Land, the learning process refers to the accumulation of wisdom and becoming a principal refers to becoming a Buddha. <span>     </span><br><br>There is often focus only on the Kalama Sutta in terms of its Criterion for Rejection alone (such as the teaching of not simply subscribing to scriptures). If we use the Criterion for Rejection only, we will realise that there is no way to absolutely verify the Buddha's enlightenment and the teachings he taught - unless we become enlightened ourselves. For example, his enlightenment is stated in scriptures and our reasoning that he should be enlightened might turn out to be faulty. We thus need to remember the Criterion for Acceptance too. From <span style="color: maroon;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2009/10/the-twin-criteria-for-rejection-acceptance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2009/10/the-twin-criteria-for-rejection-acceptance</span></span></a> : </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">'... Often neglected are the following teachings, where the Buddha got the Kalamas to agree that greed, hate and delusion (Three Poisons) are harmful, leading to evil such as killing, stealing, adultery and lying, which is ‘bad, blamable, censured by the wise and harmful when undertaken’. Conversely, the Criterion for Acceptance is that of using the Criterion for Rejection to realise what is instead ‘good, not blamable, praised by the wise and beneficial (to happiness) when undertaken’. The Kalamas also agreed that the absence of greed, hate and delusion is beneficial, not leading to evil such as killing, stealing, adultery and lying, which is ‘good, not blamable, praised by the wise and beneficial when undertaken’. These teachings are easily forgotten when fellow Buddhists are satisfied with the Criterion of Rejection alone. Well, <strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">it is perhaps easier to reject known non-truths than to accept unknown truths! It takes effort to examine and question for the worth of any teaching. </span></strong><strong><br></strong> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>'When Buddhists rigidly abide by the Criterion for Rejection while not practising the Criterion for Acceptance, their Dharma understanding ironically becomes more dogmatic and narrow-minded – which is what the Kalama Sutta is actually against, </strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>as it teaches how to graciously accept even apparently ‘non-Buddhist’ teachings</strong>, as long as they are in line with the Dharma, in the spirit of eradicating greed, hate and delusion, while increasing generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom. The sutta is not wholly about the Criterion for Rejection, which might be wrongly clung to as the ‘Ten Commandments’ of ‘Thou shalt nots…’ These guidelines given by the Buddha are for skilful application with the Criterion for Acceptance... ' <span style="color: maroon;"><br><br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If we use the Criterion for Rejection with the Criterion for Acceptance, we will realise that the Pure Land teachings pass the Kalama test. If we study the Kalama Sutta <span style="color: maroon;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.soma.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.soma.html</span></span></a> </span>in its entirety, we will realise that at no point does it say it is wrong to have faith. In fact, what it proposes is how to have the right or sound faith - faith that is not blind and irrational. It was the single teaching of the Kalama Sutta that compelled the Kalamas to have further faith in the Buddha's teachings. <br><br>Faith (or rather, ‘saddha’: confidence; conviction) is also the first of the five spiritual faculties (faith, energy; diligence, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom) . That is how crucial faith is in all Buddhist traditions. Take for instance, the Buddha's first five disciples. Before, they had lost faith in the Buddha-to-be's quest for enlightenment. But when they encountered his approach at Deer Park after he became the Buddha, they felt compelled to go forth to serve him due to the majestic changes in his demeanour, which urged them to develop great faith that he is now very special, and probably enlightened. This they verified for themselves when they learnt from him how to become enlightened too. Without the initial faith to get started on the path of Dharma study and practice, the five would never become enlightened. Without their faith, we would not encounter the compassion and wisdom of the Triple Gem passed down through the generations through them.<br><br>Likewise for us, without some minimal faith in the Pure Land teachings, such as in the key 18th Vow of Amituofo, to get us interested in further learning, we would never get started to practise mindfulness of Amituofo well enough to experience the validity of the vow. The Buddha had absolutely no reason to lie about Amituofo and every reason to share about how Amituofo can benefit us. While we might wonder if the scriptures (sutras) on Amituofo are really words of the Buddha, the truth is, historians have discovered hundreds of interlinking sutras that cross-reference to Amituofo, while there is no proof that they are words put in the Buddha's mouth. <br><br>Let us look more at how likely the Pure Land teachings are to be true. It is perfectly logical… (1) that there are many Buddhas in the past kalpas, that there are some special ones, such as Amituofo, who are highlighted by the Buddha. (2) that there are Buddhas like Amituofo, who would create an ideal school (Pure Land) with their great compassion and wisdom for training beings to be enlightened - just as good-hearted Buddhists build good schools in our world to share the Dharma too. (3) that out of the countless schools, there is a best one (Amituofo's) - just as there is a best school for every subject in our world. (4) that this school is elsewhere, as the universe is big and our present karma conditioned us to miss it. (5) that this school, being adorned with the merits of a Buddha, is a land of peace and bliss. (6) that this school is recommended by all Buddhas as the ideal destination of birth because it is so excellent, just as those who care for us hope we can go to the best schools for the best education. The Pure Land teachings are filled with so much skilful compassion and wisdom that it would be incredible if the Buddha did not teach them!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In fact, when we consider the reasoning above, it becomes hard to disprove the Pure Land teachings. This is clearly beyond blind adherence to scriptures. However, that said, the best proof (back to the context of the Kalama Sutta) of the proverbial ‘pudding’, is in the eating (i.e. via tasting the fruits of actual practice). Nothing is better than personal experiential proof - that vanquishes doubts without a trace. Even if others might doubt our experiences, a solid experience of the efficacy of the Pure Land teachings with the blessings of Amituofo, not just on the deathbed but when well and alive, will probably be the most genuine experience one has. Just as countless have verified their faith personally via Pure Land practice, so can we. As the Buddha put it, 'Ehi-passiko' - which means 'COME and SEE'. Just as the first five disciples of the Buddha and the Kalamas CAME closer to the Buddha to SEE what he had to offer, and practised the teachings he advocated because they made great sense, so too should we closer approach the Pure Land teachings, to see (learn and practise) more deeply, and to realise their immeasurable worth and benefits.<br><br><strong>Related Articles:<br></strong><br>The Mark of Faith<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2011/03/the-mark-of-faith"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://thedailyenlightenment.com/2011/03/the-mark-of-faith</span></span></a> <br>Why Pure Lands Must Exist<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/301"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/301</span></span></a> <br>Proof that We All Wish to Go Pure Land<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/171"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/171</span></span></a> <br>Are the Pure Land Sutras Authentic?<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/120"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/120</span></span></a> <br>Many Testimonials of Pure Land Practice<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/297"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/297</span></span></a> <br></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How do We Know the Buddha is Enlightened?

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: SimSun;  " lang="ZH-CN">ä½ è‹¥è‚¯æ”¾ä¸‹ä¸€åˆ‡ï¼Œä¸€å¿ƒå¿µä½›ï¼Œ</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you are willing to let go of (attachment to) everything, and be mindful of (Amitabha Buddha) single-mindedly, and if your worldly lifespan is not at its end, you will be swiftly healed. If your worldly lifespan is at its end, you will be swiftly in the Western Pure Land.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">During the talk, there were some video clips shown. But sorry I don’t have the link. </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In other words, to aspire for birth in Pure Land when very sick is more skilful than to aspire to be headed – because it always creates a win-win situation. Those who can be healed will be healed, while those who should go to Pure Land will be born there swiftly. To aspire to be healed, however, might create a lose-lose situation. Those who cannot be healed will not be healed, while those who should go to Pure Land cannot reach there as they did not generate the right aspiration accordingly. Aspiring to be healed usually reflects attachment to Samsara (unless there are special valid spiritual reasons), which is the opposite of aspiring to be born in Pure Land.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The limits of one’s worldly lifespan depends on one’s karma. While proper mindfulness of Amituofo creates immense merits able to dilute negative karma to effect healing and lengthening of life, one might not have enough time or ability to practice properly and adequately to do so when very sick. This is why we should practice diligently and regularly when alive and well – so as to be ready for the possibility of being very sick in the future. The more well-practised we are in every day life, the easier it will be to practice when unwell. One should also not handker on healing only in terms of this body, as birth in Pure Land is the best form of healing, for both body and mind. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">During the talk, Mr. Shen shared with us what are the auspicious signs when Amitabha Buddha or the Pure Land Bodhisattvas who come to fetch the aspiring Pure Landers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There will be <strong>any</strong> 4 auspicious signs:</span></p>
              <ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One could hear heavenly melodious music,</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Unknown fragrance fills the air,</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One could see Amitabha Buddha’s image or (lotus)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Bright lights radiating </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr. Shen shared one of his stories. (I can’t recall what the beginning of the incident is). There was a man who was about to die of severe illness. His son was a devout Buddhist and his son kept reminding to recite Amitabha Buddha’s name sincerely. His son even gave him a picture of Amitabha Buddha to concentrate. At first, the man rejected and was in pain. After constant pleading from his son, he finally grabbed the picture of Amitabha Buddha. He started to concentrate his mind. They could see Amitabha Buddha coming to them. Unknown fragrance fills the air. All the 4 signs may not appear together. At first the man has many tubes and medical apparatuses on his body, his face shown pain and suffering. But after the removal of all the medical devices, the man’s face shown serenity and calmness unlike the distorted painful look. </span></p>

              <p>Yeah, the sutra did mention è‡ªçŸ¥æ—¶è‡³, meaning we know when Amitabha is coming to fetch us to Pureland. I've heard of many true cases in recent years. One of them is my ex-colleague's father-in-law. He told his family members that Amitabha told him Amitabha would be fetching him in 4 days time. He passed away on the 4th day. Some can even tell the exact timing. It is still happening. From what I've heard, I feel that it happens to mostly Buddhists who are vegetarian. I'm still thinking when I should start to become a long term vegetarian.</p>

And upon reaching Pure Land, one is able to swiftly attain Buddhahood, without backsliding or obstacles. It is truly the expressway to Buddhahood.</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN"><br><br><span class="messagebody2">Usually, for ordinary beings to become Buddhas, we need to go through 52 stages of attainments (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">è�©è�¨äº”å��äºŒä½�</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">) - namely, the 10 Faiths (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å��ä¿¡</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">), 10 Abodes (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å��ä½�</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">), 10 Practices (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å��è¡Œ</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">), 10 Transferences (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å��å›žå�‘</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">), 10 Grounds (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å��åœ°</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">) and Universal Enlightenment (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">ç­‰è§‰</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">; highest Bodhisattvahood), before reaching Supreme Enlightenment (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">å¦™è§‰</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">; Buddhahood).

As such, the time needed for ordinary beings to practise to become a Buddha is more than 3 great Asankya-Kalpas. </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN"><br><br><span class="messagebody2">However, in the Amitabha Sutra (</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: SimSun;    " lang="ZH-CN">ä½›è¯´é˜¿å¼¥é™€ç»�</span></span><span class="messagebody2"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; " lang="EN">), we know that Amitabha Buddha attained Buddhahood (and created his Pure Land) only 10 Maha-Kalpas (130, 4384, 0000 years) ago. This is tremendously shorter than 3 great Asankya-Kalpas. Yet, according to the sutra, despite this short period of time, 'In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, among the beings born there, all are Avaivartikas, many of whom are in the Stage of Becoming a Buddha after One More Life (Stage of Universal Enlightenment). Their numbers are great and cannot be known by calculation, but can be spoken of with [the time of] immeasurable and boundless Asankya-Kalpas.'

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">One of the most outstanding characteristics of the practice of Buddha mindfulness is that it enables one to be swiftly born in Pure Land within this life (if one truly aspires and practises accordingly with the right faith). And upon reaching Pure Land, one is able to swiftly attain Buddhahood, without backsliding or obstacles. It is truly the expressway to Buddhahood.</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br><br><span>Usually, for ordinary beings to become Buddhas, we need to go through 52 stages of attainments (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">è�©è�¨äº”å��äºŒä½�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) - namely, the 10 Faiths (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��ä¿¡</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), 10 Abodes (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��ä½�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), 10 Practices (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��è¡Œ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), 10 Transferences (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��å›žå�‘</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), 10 Grounds (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��åœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) and Universal Enlightenment (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ç­‰è§‰</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">; highest Bodhisattvahood), before reaching Supreme Enlightenment (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å¦™è§‰</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">; Buddhahood). In terms of time, this requires 3 great Asankya-Kalpas (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">é˜¿åƒ§ç¥—åŠ«</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">). [1 Asankya-Kalpa is 1000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000 Maha-Kalpas (or 10 <em>to the power of</em> 48 Maha-Kalpas) while 1 Maha-Kalpa (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å¤§åŠ«</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) is 13, 4384, 0000 years. 3 great Asankya-Kalpas is thus 13, 4384, 0000 x 10 <em>to the power of</em> 48 years.] As this calculation is from the first stage of the 10th Abode onwards, the time spent in prior unsubstantial or trial-and-error practice is not added yet! As such, the time needed for ordinary beings to practise to become a Buddha is more than 3 great Asankya-Kalpas.</span></span> <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br><br><span>However, in the Amitabha Sutra (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä½›è¯´é˜¿å¼¥é™€ç»�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), we know that Amitabha Buddha attained Buddhahood (and created his Pure Land) only 10 Maha-Kalpas (130, 4384, 0000 years) ago. This is tremendously shorter than 3 great Asankya-Kalpas. Yet, according to the sutra, despite this short period of time, 'In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, among the beings born there, all are Avaivartikas, many of whom are in the Stage of Becoming a Buddha after One More Life (Stage of Universal Enlightenment). Their numbers are great and cannot be known by calculation, but can be spoken of with [the time of] immeasurable and boundless Asankya-Kalpas.' (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">æž�ä¹�å›½åœŸï¼Œä¼—ç”Ÿç”Ÿè€…ï¼Œçš†æ˜¯é˜¿éžžè·‹è‡´ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­å¤šæœ‰ä¸€ç”Ÿè¡¥å¤„ï¼Œå…¶æ•°ç”šå¤šï¼Œé�žæ˜¯ç®—æ•°æ‰€èƒ½çŸ¥ä¹‹ï¼Œä½†å�¯ä»¥æ— é‡�æ— è¾¹é˜¿åƒ§ç¥‡è¯´ã€‚</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) What is inconceivable is that within just 10 Maha-Kalpas, there are already countless beings in Pure Land who are on the brink of Buddhahood. This bears testimony to the efficiency of Pure Land in training beings for Buddhahood.</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br><br><span>Though the stages attainable in Pure Land are in greater detail below, they should not be a key concern, as whatever stage one first realises there will be non-retrogressible and only lead towards steady progression in spiritual practice. Due to the supremely blessed environment of Pure Land, it is not necessary to ascend all the 52 stages to Buddhahood one by one. Pure Land is as such, the most accelerated and thus swiftest path towards Buddhahood.</span><br><br><span>The Contemplation Sutra (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä½›è¯´è§‚æ— é‡�å¯¿ä½›ç»�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) states that beings of the lower level of the lower grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸‹å“�ä¸‹ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) [who have done the 5 heinous misdeeds (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">äº”é€†ç½ª</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) and the 10 unwholesome deeds (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å��æ�¶ä¸š</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), who repent and practise (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">è¡Œ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) sincerely with faith (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¿¡</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) and aspiration (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">æ„¿</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) for birth in Pure Land) will be reborn there from lotuses after 12 Maha-kalpas, and give rise to irreversible Bodhicitta (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">è�©æ��å¿ƒ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">; aspiration for Buddhahood). This is in sharp contrast with being reborn in Avici hell (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">é˜¿é¼»åœ°ç‹±</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) to suffer relentlessly for an unimaginably long duration of no certain limit, thereafter being reborn gradually in better lives to 'restart' spiritual cultivation. Due to the bountiful merits of Amitabha Buddha which he is ready to share, mindfulness of Buddha is the only way to escape from otherwise certain rebirth into the hells, including the worst, as above. The middle level of the lower grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸‹å“�ä¸­ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) requires 6 Maha-Kalpas to give rise to Bodhicitta, while the higher level of the lower grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸‹å“�ä¸Šç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) requires only 10 Small Kalpas (160,798,000 years) to realise the First Ground (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">åˆ�åœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) of Bodhisattvahood. If we are sincere and proficient Dharma practitioners, we are likely to be born in higher levels and grades, thus taking even less time to realise Buddhahood.</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br><br><span>For the lower level of the middle grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸­å“�ä¸‹ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), one realises the Stage of Stream-Winner (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å…¥æµ�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) after 7 days of birth and the Stage of Arhathood (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">é˜¿ç½—æ±‰</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) after 1 Small Kalpa (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å°�åŠ«</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">; 16,798,000 years). For the middle level of the middle grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸­å“�ä¸­ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), one realises the Stage of Stream-Winner after 7 days of birth and the Stage of Arhathood after half of 1 Small Kalpa. For the higher level of the middle grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸­å“�ä¸Šç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), one realises the Stage of Arhathood almost immediately when born.</span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><br><br><span>For the lower level of the higher grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸Šå“�ä¸‹ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), one is born from a lotus after 1 day and 1 night, and able to realise the Stage of the First Ground (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">åˆ�åœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) of Rejoice (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å–œåœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) after 3 Small Kalpas. For the middle level of the higher grade of birth (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸Šå“�ä¸­ç”Ÿ</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">), one realises the Stage of the Eighth Ground (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">å…«åœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) of Unshakability (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">ä¸�åŠ¨åœ°</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) after 7 days and realises the Patience of the Non-birth of Dharmas (</span></span><span><span style="font-family: SimSun;">æ— ç”Ÿæ³•å¿�</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">) after 1 Small Kalpa.
