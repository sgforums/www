The 'karma' within Buddhism is not the same theory as the 'karma' within Hindusim. Same as the 'dharma' and 'nirvana'. And the word 'Hinduism' is a modern derivation</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is more of a Chinese culture that we don't eat beef because rice is our staple food and long before the green revolution, our ancestors in CHina used bulls to plough the land. To show our gratitude, they did not eat beef. Also it makes much economical sense not to kill them or who's gonna plough the land?<br>Also, we drink milk from the cows. So the Chinese sees cows like our mother who feeds us milk. Again another sign of gratitude.<br>Gratitude is one of the main ideas enforced within Chinese culture.<br>So it is 100% a myth that Buddhist cannot take beef.<br>I'm gonna get that Big MAc at McDonalds and eat it infront of the camera and upload it into utube if you wish to see...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's more of a cultural thing rather than a proscribed tradition. Like many others have typed here, Buddhism came from India where traditionally people do not eat beef. Chinese also do not eat beef due to certain beliefs as well. In Theravadin Buddhism, the monks eat whatever is offered to them and that may include beef in the menu (my mum went to Thailand and the people there seem to eat beef alot). I think even Indian Muslims do not eat beef due to the culture.<br>I myself eat beef.<br>Gassho</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe many people have already given you reply, and in fact, in our forum, this topic has been discussed a few times previously. But I just posted this in another forum some days ago:<br><br><blockquote> The custom of not eating beef is linked with Hinduism and Chinese folks culture. Because they do not forget the hard work that cows have helped in their agriculture. And also, the Hindus treat cows as holy animals.<br><br>Actually Buddha did not particularly single out beef as not to be eaten. However, those who choose to eat meat should eat meat under only three conditions:<br><br>did not see the killing, did not hear the killing, and do not suspect that they were killed.<br><br>In this way, the meat is karmically purer.</blockquote>And also to clarify: the tradition of not eating meat is not found in all traditions, whether Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana. Please don't confuse Chinese folks traditions with Mahayana Buddhism just because both seems 'Chinese'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Mahayana Buddhists as far as I know also eat beef. I do eat beef because I am not a vegetarian yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br>So to say, those who aspire to be bodhisattvas must be vegetarian. It is only particularly in the Mahayana sutras that vegetarianism is promoted... but Buddha never made a law to prevent his Sangha from consuming meat. In fact, he rejected Devadatta (his disciple who wanted to kill 4 four times) advise to make it a law to be vegetarian.[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> got to ask why Ven Hai Tao consolidated so many sutras that said other wise.<br>take a read:<br><br><a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?s=9c113aed7c254c0ba34cb9c10a74b963&amp;showtopic=22615" rel="nofollow">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?s=9c113aed7c254c0ba34cb9c10a74b963&amp;showtopic=22615</a><br><br>From "Mahaparinirvana Sutra":<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Then Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: "O World-Honoured One! To one who eats flesh, we should not give flesh. Why not? I see a great virtue arising out of abstention from eating flesh." The Buddha praised Kasyapa and said: "Well said, well said! You now come to know my mind well. A Bodhisattva who protects Dharma should be thus. O good man! <strong>From now on, I do not permit my sravaka disciples to eat meat. </strong>When receiving from a danapati a pristine dana [gift] of faith, think that one is eating the flesh of one's own son." Bodhisattva Kasyapa said further to the Buddha: "O World-Honoured One! Why is it that the Tathagata does not allow us to eat meat?" "O good man! Â“One who eats meat kills the seed of great compassion."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kasyapa said again: "Why did you first allow the bhiksus to eat three kinds of pure meat?" "O Kasyapa! These three kinds of pure meat were so instituted following the need of the occasion." Bodhisattva Kasyapa said again to the Buddha: "O World-Honoured One! In what circumstances do you not allow the ten impurities or the nine kinds of what is pure?" The Buddha said to Kasyapa: "This also is permitted by gradual steps following the need of the occasion. This is what applies in the actual segregation from eating meat."</span><br>Bodhisattva Kasyapa said further to the Buddha: "Why is it that the flesh of fish is praised and called beautiful?" "O good man! I do not say that the flesh of fish is a beautiful food. I say that sugar can, non-glutinous rice, rock candy, black rock candy, all kinds of wheat, honey, milk, cream, and oil are beautiful foods. Various kinds of clothing material can be stocked, but what can be stocked is those whose colour has faded. How could one greedily stick to [crave after] the flesh of fish?"<br><br>Kasyapa said again to the Buddha: "If the Tathagata means to prohibit the eating of meat, such things as the five kinds of flavours as milk, cream, fresh butter, clarified butter, and sarpirmanda, all kinds of clothing, silk cloth, horse-shoe shell, hide and leather, bowls of gold and silver should not be received." "O good man! Do not muddle things up with what the Nirgranthas [Jains] say. Each of the prohibitions which the Tathagata lays down has a different meaning. By this, three pure meats are permitted standing on different grounds and the ten kinds of meat are prohibited by different standpoints. By different standpoints, all are prohibited, until the time of one's death. O Kasyapa! Â“I, from now on, tell my disciples to refrain from eating any kind of meatÂ”. O Kasyapa! When one eats meat, this gives out the smell of meat while one is walking, standing, sitting or reclining. People smell this and become fearful. This is as when one comes near a lion. One sees and smells the lion, and fear arises.<br><br>O good man! When one eats garlic, the dirty smell is unbearable. Other people notice it. They smell the bad smell. They leave that person and go away. Even from far off, people hate to see such a person. They will not come near him. It is the same with one who eats meat. It is a similar situation with all people who, on smelling the meat, become afraid and entertain the thought of death. All living things in the water, on land and in the sky desert such a person and run away. They say that this person is their enemy. Hence the Bodhisattva does not eat meat. In order to save beings, he shows [pretends] that he eats meat. Though he [seems to] eat meat, in actual fact he does not. O good man! Such a Bodhisattva does not even take pure food. How could he eat meat?<br><br>One hundred years after my death, all the holy sages of the four fruitions [the four stages leading to "arhatship"] will enter Nirvana. The age of Wonderful Dharma will be over, and there will appear the age of Counterfeit Dharma, when the bhiksu will keep the precepts [only] as a matter of form, will recite [only] a little of the sutras, will greedily take food and drink and [excessively] nourish his body. What he wears on his body will be ugly and coarse. He will look wearied and show no dignity. He will feed [farm] cows and sheep and carry fuel and grass. His beard, nails and hair will be long. He will don the kasaya [priestly robe] but look like a hunter. He will narrow his eyes, walk slowly and look like a cat who is after a rat. He will always mutter: "I have attained arhatship". He will suffer from all kinds of diseases, lie and sleep on dung. Outwardly he will look wise, but inside he will be greedy and jealous. He practises mute like a Brahmin. Truth to tell, he is no shramana [monk], but only tries to appear as such. He is burning with perverted views, ever slandering Wonderful Dharma. One such as this transgresses against the precepts, right action and deportment instituted by the Tathagata. He talks about the fruit of emancipation, but his actions depart from what is pure and he violates Dharma, which is profound and hidden. Each such person, following his own interpretation, will speak contrary to what the sutras and vinaya rules state, saying: "The Tathagata allows all of us meat". They will talk thus and say that the Buddha has so spoken. They will dispute and say that they are shramanas and successors to the Buddha's teaching. O good man! At that time, again, there will be shramanas who store cereals, receive fish and meat, prepare meals themselves, and keep oil pots. They will be around bejewelled parasols, leather footgear, kings, ministers and rich people. They will indulge in astrological practices and medical treatments; they will keep servants, gold, silver, beryl, musaragalva, agate, crystal, coral, amber, jade, horse-shoe shell, and many kinds of melons [seeds]. They will learn all arts, painting, plastering, book-making, and all kinds of science, all kinds of seed- sowing and planting of roots, placing of curses, charming, preparation of medicines, theatrical art, music, adorning of their body with fragrances and flowers, gambling, "go" game, and various kinds of handiwork. If any bhiksu rejects such evils, one can say that he is truly my disciple."<br><br>Then Kasyapa said further to the Buddha: "O World-Honoured One! The bhiksus, bhiksunis, upasakas and upasikas may have to live depending on people. At the time of the alms-round, one may be given food containing meat. How can one take it and yet be pure?" The Buddha said: "Use water, wash away the meat, and then eat it [the rest of the food]. The utensil may be defiled by meat. But if no taste of meat remains, this may be used. There will be no harm done. If one sees that there is a lot of meat, one should not accept such a meal. One must never eat the meat itself. One who eats it infringes the rule. I now set this rule of segregating one's self from eating meat. If we go into detail, there will be no end of explanations. It is now time that I enter Nirvana. So I must dispense with explanations. This is "answering well what is enquired about."</span><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Many sources say Buddha died from eating bad mushrooms, not pork. It is understood that the Buddha taught his monks against killing animals, but, since they were to live on alms, to accept meat given to them so long as the animal had not been killed specifically for their benefit. However, people who offered food to Buddha would have certainly known his preference for vegetarian meals, so may have prepared fitting food.<br>2. While there have been arguments that he ate meat when it was given as an alm, there are just as many arguments to the contrary (See To Cherish all Life by Roshi P. Kapleau). It is against the basic tenants of Buddhism to eat meat, and only those who whish to justify meat eating will argue differently.<br>3. The Buddha was most certainly a vegetarian. There are many sutras composed after his death containing almost any imaginable sort of distortion or misrepresentation of the original teachings, so the fact that some sutra somewhere (or even many) claim that he ate meat is in itself meaningless. The only important criterion is what those sutras which are indisputably authentic say. These, without exception, very strongly advocate, even mandate, vegetarianism. I am a medical student at the Albert Einstein Collge of Medicine in NYC, and was a history major concentrating on Asian history, at Cornell U. I have lived in Japan for two and a half years, and my wife is Japanese and Buddhist. (She eats meat, just as many Christians do not forgive their enemies, etc. The practice of the nominal followers of the founder of a religion is no guide to the lives or even teachings of that founder.) </span></div>
