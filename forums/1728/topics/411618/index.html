              <p>The first point is the outer condition the basis for practicing
              shamatha and vipashyana. This is to have a proper place to meditate, a
              place without obstacles. For example, in some places people are
              prejudiced against meditators, which can create problems. The best
              place for meditation is one that is blessed by great meditators of the
              past. We also need certain inner conditions to meditate properly. The
              first quality is to not be too attached to outer sense objects and not
              so concerned about getting what we want. We simply should have few
              desires.<br> <br> The second quality is to be satisfied or content with the situation we
              have. How to encourage these two qualities can be illustrated by how
              parents talk to their children about meditation. If the parents are
              good practitioners, they will encourage their children by saying, "Try
              not to be too ambitious. Don't strive too much for outer things. Be
              content and be satisfied with what you have. In this way you will be
              able to practice meditation. Otherwise you'll be wasting your time."
              Parents who do not practice meditation give the opposite advice: "You
              should strive very hard and be very ambitious. You should try to become
              very rich and get ahead. Acquire property and hold on to it. Otherwise
              you'll be wasting your time." So we can see here how to encourage these
              qualities properly.<br> <br> The third quality is not to be involved in too many activities or
              responsibilities. If we are too busy, then we will not be able to
              practice meditation.<br> <br> The fourth quality is to have good conduct. This means that we avoid
              negative actions which bring harm to others. All Buddhist vows are
              concerned with avoiding actions that produce negative karma. There are
              different kinds of vows, those of a layperson, a novice monk, a fully
              ordained monk, and a Bodhisattva. When lay people practice meditation,
              it is good to have taken the five-layperson vows, which in Sanskrit are
              called the upasaka vows. These are to avoid killing, stealing, lying,
              harming others sexually, and drinking alcohol and taking drugs.<br> <br> Since our main practice is the Bodhisattva path, it is important to
              take the Bodhisattva Vow, which can be practiced as a layperson. Monks
              and nuns also take the Bodhisattva Vow. Both lay and monastic
              practitioners can combine the practice of a Bodhisattva with the
              upasaka vows. For example, Marpa the translator was a lay Bodhisattva,
              whereas the Indian master Nagarjuna was a monk Bodhisattva. Both were
              enlightened.<br> <br> Now we will discuss the requirements for practicing vipashyana. It is
              essential to follow and rely on a proper teacher, someone who can
              explain the teachings correctly. In the Theravada tradition a teacher
              must be able to explain meditation on selflessness from his own
              experience. In the Mahayana tradition a teacher must have an
              understanding of emptiness--the Madhyamaka or Middle Way teachings-and
              be able to explain it clearly.</p>
              <p>The second quality for practicing vipashyana is to properly analyze the
              teachings we have received. If we have received Mahayana teachings on
              emptiness, then we should study different commentaries and receive
              instructions from our teacher on how to understand them. We then need
              to analyze and contemplate these teachings and instructions, which will
              greatly benefit our vipashyana practice.</p>
