              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              to recognize and overcome three universal obstacles to practice</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Detours and obstacles are a fact of
              practice life. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some arise out of our
              own psychology and conditioning: patterns of self-judgment and perfectionism, a
              tendency to procrastinate or seek diversions, addiction to control, and the
              like. Other obstacles seem to be more universal, and these are the ones that
              nearly every practitioner faces at one time or another. These obstacles are at
              the heart of practice, yet they are seldom given the emphasis they deserve. But
              until we can see them clearly—see how they manifest in our lives—it will be
              difficult, if not impossible, for our practice to move forward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are three obstacles in particular that we need to address.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Misunderstanding the depth of waking
              sleep </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              first obstacle to practice is not understanding the magnitude and power of
              waking sleep. “Waking sleep” refers to the state in which we live most of the
              time—identified with, or lost in, our thoughts, our emotions, and our actions.
              In the first place, we’re addicted to our thoughts: believing that our thoughts
              and opinions are the Truth is the veil through which we perceive reality. But
              we also have difficulty controlling our emotions; in fact, we love to indulge
              them. Furthermore, we can’t seem to stay in the present moment for more than a
              few seconds at a time; the present is the last place we want to be. Because we
              are so frequently lost in the obscuring confusion of our thoughts and emotions,
              we lack the clarity and presence that come when we are more awake.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              teaches that we are all born with buddhanature and that our spiritual
              aspiration is to allow our true nature to reveal itself, just as an acorn
              aspires to become an oak tree. Yet emphasizing our basic goodness, as important
              as it is, is only part of the picture. No matter how strong our aspiration may
              be, if we don’t develop deep insight into the power and magnitude of waking
              sleep, we will be blindsided by it again and again. It’s imperative for us to
              understand that spiritual practice is not just something we do when we’re
              sitting in meditation or when we’re on retreat. Just as there is no end to the
              power of life means practicing at all times, with everything we encounter, not
              just when we’re on the cushion or when something upsets us. Failing to see
              everything as an opportunity for practice is a setup for frustration and
              disappointment, keeping us stuck where we are and limiting our possibilities
              for inner growth. The more we include in our practice, the more satisfying our
              life can be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Underestimating resistance </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              second obstacle we encounter in practice, closely related to the first, is
              underestimating the degree to which resistance is a predictable and inevitable
              part of a practice life. Resistance comes in many forms: not wanting to sit in
              meditation, not wanting to stay with our experience for more than a few
              seconds, spinning off into thinking about the past or the future, suppressing
              or avoiding emotional pain, finding fault with ourselves, finding fault with
              others. We can see resistance in our commitment to believing such thoughts as
              “This is too hard,” “I can’t do it,” or “I’m unworthy.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              another, more subtle form of resistance is thinking and talking about practice
              rather than actually experiencing our life. Thinking and talking about practice
              are easy substitutes for the real effort that a practice life requires. We
              resist facing life as it is because that would mean abandoning our views of how
              we think it should be. The most basic form of resistance is wanting life to be
              other than it is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              the most part, we don’t really want to wake up. We have to be honest about
              this. We want to hold on to our beliefs and even to our suffering. Afraid of
              the unknown, we cling to the familiar. We don’t want to give up our illusions
              even when they make us miserable. Resistance is the ego’s effort to maintain
              control. Yet no matter what form it takes, it brings us no peace. Pema Chödrön
              tells a story about a friend who as a child had recurring nightmares in which
              ferocious monsters were chasing her through a house. Whenever she closed a door
              behind her, the monsters would burst through the door and frighten her. Pema
              once asked what the monsters looked like, but her friend couldn’t tell her,
              because in the dream she had never turned around to see.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              some point, however, she decided not to turn away from what she feared. The
              next time she had the nightmare, just as she was about to open a door to avoid
              being caught by the monsters, she stopped running, turned around, and looked
              the monsters in the eye. They were huge, with horrible features, but they
              didn’t attack her; they just jumped up and down. As she looked closer, the
              three-dimensional multicolored monsters began to shrink into two-dimensional
              black-and-white shapes. At that moment, the girl awoke, and she never had that
              nightmare again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is in running away from our “monsters” that we make them seem so solid.
              Whatever we resist exerts a strong hold on us: in solidifying it, we empower it
              to stay in our mind and our life. But when we cultivate the willingness to be
              with life just as it is, our relationship to what we’ve avoided starts to
              change. Once we see through the solidity of our resistance, our lives become
              more fluid and workable. We’re able to move beyond where we were once stuck.
              Even if we don’t like our life as it is, we don’t need to wage war against it.
              We can start meeting our resistance squarely by noticing all of the ways in
              which we avoid the present moment, the ways in which we avoid practice, the
              ways in which we resist what is. Understanding the depth of our resistance is
              of major importance in furthering our practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              form of resistance arises when we hit the “dry spot.” The dry spot is the
              moment when we lose our connection with the aspiration that originally brought
              us to practice. Often we hit the dry spot when our expectations of practice are
              unfulfilled—when it isn’t bringing us the immediate peace, calm, or freedom
              from fear that we had hoped for. Disappointment leads to anger, and anger to
              resistance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              important to understand, however, that vacillating between aspiration and
              resistance is the natural rhythm of practice and that the dry spot is a natural
              manifestation of this cycle. But the first few times we hit the dry spot, it
              doesn’t seem natural at all. We may even feel as if we’re failing at practice,
              since the thoughts that arise in these moments seem like fixed truths. It’s
              hard to see them for what they are—simply automatic reactions to the inevitable
              ups and downs of practice life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hitting
              the dry spot is the point at which students often leave practice. But if we can
              wait it out, we begin to understand the natural cycle of resistance. We even
              come to expect the doubting mind to arise. Doubt in itself is not the problem.
              The problem comes from identifying with the doubting “me” and believing that
              this is who we really are. But if seen for what it is, doubt can even be a
              positive force in practice. Provided we don’t get lost in the negative beliefs
              that arise with it, it can lead to a deepening of our quest. As practice takes
              hold, we can learn to use doubt as an opportunity to experience the grief of
              our unfulfilled expectations about practice. We can learn to surrender to, and
              reside in, the physical experience of what doubt feels like in the body,
              instead of following the story line of negative thoughts. Not following the
              story line can be difficult, because the thoughts seem so true, so solid, so
              compelling. But if we can stay with the visceral experience of doubt, even as
              the anguish of not knowing remains, the dryness is transfused with a deeper
              sense of aspiration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thomas
              Merton expressed this clearly: “True love and prayer are learned in the moment
              when prayer has become impossible and the heart has turned to stone.” When we
              understand the cycles of resistance and can wait out a dry period by resting in
              the direct physical experience of doubt, we will gradually come to feel a
              renewed sense of direction and hope.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wanting to feel a particular way </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              third major obstacle we encounter in practice is a deep-seated desire to feel a
              particular way, whether calm or clear or spacious or simply free of anxiety.
              Probably all of us share the illusion that if we practice long enough and hard
              enough, we’ll get what we want: enlightenment, good health, a satisfying
              relationship, or whatever else we’re seeking. We can tell that we’re still
              harboring this illusion if we believe that experiencing difficulties or
              distress means that something is wrong—specifically, that something is wrong
              with us. This persistent belief drives us to do whatever we can to alleviate
              our discomfort. We believe deeply that if we just practice harder, we’re sure
              to feel better.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              should never underestimate the extent to which we equate feeling better with
              being awake. But a key point about spiritual practice is that we don’t have to
              feel any particular way. Nor do we have to be any particular way. All we can do
              is experience, and work with, whatever is arising in our life right now. No
              matter what is going on or how we feel about it, the essence of practice is to
              honestly acknowledge whatever is happening in the moment and stay present with
              our experience of it. In this way we can come to feel a true appreciation for
              life just as it is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There’s
              a famous Buddhist story about a man who was shot in the chest with an arrow.
              The pain was great, but the Buddha pointed out to the man how much greater the
              pain would be if he had been shot with a second arrow in the exact same spot.
              What this teaching suggests is that however painful or disappointing our
              experience may be, adding the second arrow of our judgmental thoughts about it
              will only deepen the pain and lead to greater suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If,
              for example, I wake up not feeling well, adding the judgment “This shouldn’t be
              happening to me” will only make me feel much worse. The countermeasure to
              judging is to move out of the mental world and our thoughts about what’s
              happening, and into the physical realm and what we’re actually feeling in the
              moment. Judgments are based on ideals or expectations, and these thought-based
              pictures are at least one step removed from what is real. Coming back to what
              is, minus our thought-based pictures, is a step toward freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              we can see through our deep-seated desire to feel a particular way and realize
              that we don’t have to feel different in order to be free, we can experience the
              equanimity that comes with staying truly present with what is.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fully
              grasping the three obstacles that we’re sure to encounter on the spiritual
              path—misunderstanding the depth of waking sleep, underestimating resistance,
              and wanting to feel a particular way—is the essential foundation for learning
              how to work with them effectively. And working with them, in turn, will take us
              to the heart of what it means to be free.</span></p>
