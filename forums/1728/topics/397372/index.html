              <p>A good article that Thusness recommended me a year ago, just got reminded of it in another forum.</p>
              <p><br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">How to do nothing - Basic Instructions</span> <br> <br> <br> If your focus space is Nothingness, then “Evenly Cover the space and do 
              nothing” reduces to
              <br> “Do Nothing.” Here’s how to Do Nothing:
              <br> <br> - You don’t need to position your attention in any particular way.
              <br> - Let whatever happens happen, but as soon as you notice that you are 
              doing anything
              <br> intentionally, stop.
              <br> <br> The second part of the instruction requires some clarification. We will 
              define “intentional” to
              <br> mean something you can voluntarily control, meaning you have total 
              control over initiating and
              <br> stopping the action –like raising or dropping your arm. Therefore, by 
              definition, you can always
              <br> stop an intentional act, because if you cannot stop doing something, it 
              is not really intentional
              <br> and you don’tneed to stop. The instructions are very clear; only stop 
              doing what you easily can
              <br> stop doing. Let anything else happen as it will.
              <br> Examples of things that you can stop doing are:
              <br> <br> - Intentionally thinking (as opposed to thinking that just happens to 
              you)
              <br> - Trying to focus on a certain thing
              <br> - Trying to have equanimity
              <br> - Trying to keep track of what is going on
              <br> - Trying to meditate
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">More About Thinking</span> <br> <br> Some thoughts are intentional. It’s possible for you to make a decision 
              to think about
              <br> something and it’s also possible to decide not to think about that 
              thing. Other thoughts are
              <br> not intentional. They just sort of happen to you. They are not under 
              conscious control. You
              <br> may find that your thoughts are mostly intentional or mostly not under 
              your control.
              <br> The important point to remember is that the “Doing Nothing” as we’ll 
              define it does not
              <br> require you to stop all thoughts. You just stop intentionally thinking. 
              If you can’t stop
              <br> thinking about something then you don’t need to stop because you’re not 
              thinking
              <br> intentionally, by our definition of that word. So by this definition, 
              “Doing Nothing” is
              <br> actually a very easy-going process. It just means stop doing whatever 
              you can stop doing and
              <br> don’t worry about the rest of the stuff.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Doing
               Nothing and the Experience of Nothing</span> <br> <br> Doing Nothing is a way of moving toward the experience of nothingness. 
              When you Do
              <br> Nothing, you let go of the intention to go any place or achieve any 
              goal. You even let go of
              <br> the intention to get focused or have clarity or avoid chaos. In essence 
              you let go of the
              <br> intention to “meditate.”
              <br> At first this may be a bit disconcerting and uncomfortable, but after a 
              while you begin to get
              <br> the sense that something is pulling you, taking you on a journey. If you
               Do Nothing long and
              <br> continuously enough, nothing will begin to tug on you, taking you on a 
              journey to Zero,
              <br> Groundless Ground, the Source of consciousness. In other words, you 
              don’t have to try to get
              <br> to the Source—you just stop doing anything and wait for it to get to 
              you!
              <br> To sum it up, when you practice “Doing Nothing” it doesn’t mean that the
               goal is to have
              <br> nothing happen. In fact there may be a lot happening. That’s okay, as 
              long as you keep letting
              <br> go of the intention to do anything about what’s happening.
