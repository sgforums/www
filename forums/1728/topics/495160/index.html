              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In working with someone who is dying, there is a tremendous
              temptation to ignore our own relationship to death and immediately assume the
              role of the helper. But when we do so, we are losing our common ground with
              that person. Entering a dying person’s world takes courage and empathy. Only by
              accepting our own vulnerability to death do we overcome the divided perspective
              of “I (over here) am helping you (over there).” Only then are we in the same
              boat. So in a sense, we need to be willing to die with that person. Usually we
              do not want to be in the same boat at all. Although it is embarrassing to
              admit, we are secretly glad that it is someone else who has cancer and we are
              the one looking after him rather than the other way around. We find security in
              the fact that we are not the one who is sick right now. It is hard not to feel
              that way, even when we are sincerely and earnestly trying to help.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is no point in hiding that tendency and pretending to
              have empathy. Instead of feigning benevolence, we could acknowledge that we are
              afraid of sickness, afraid that the same thing might happen to us, and we are
              desperate to distance ourselves from that possibility. We could look into that
              fear and see how it operates. Beginning at the beginning, we could notice how
              we enter a sick person’s room. What concerns come up in our mind? How do we
              view that person? How much can we identify with her situation? When do we shut
              down? Where are we holding back? What are our limits? Being honest about our
              limitations protects us from becoming patronizing and self-satisfied. When we
              are more honest, we don’t have as much to prove. We accept who we are and go
              from there. So our whole approach lightens. At the same time, we also relieve
              the people with whom we are dealing from having to prove themselves to us. So
              there are fewer barriers; we are less separate. When we approach a sick or
              dying person, we are simply relating to her as an ordinary human being, in the
              same category as ourselves.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Working with others gives us constant feedback as to our own
              state of mind. Spending time with dying people is revealing. It reflects back
              to us with great honesty and vividness our own current relationship with
              uncertainty, death, and impermanence. It exposes our shortcomings and cuts
              through our pretenses. If we are open to this feedback, we can sharpen our
              understanding of who we are and reawaken our humor. We are reminded over and
              over again not to take ourselves too seriously. Although we may dream that we
              are going to be the one who steps in and, just in the nick of time, helps some
              dying person realize his or her human potential, I doubt whether any of us is
              going to accomplish that very often. If we have some humor about ourselves, we
              realize that we, too, are involved in a slow process of growth. We are working
              with our own states of mind, just as other people are working with theirs. We
              are also dying, just as they are. We are all in this together.</span></p>
