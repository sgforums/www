              that</span></p>

A 19th
              century Dubliner born with wanderlust in his bones, he became an alcoholic hobo
              and free thinker who travelled the world by steam ship and cattle car, only to
              eventually transform himself into U Dhammaloka — the world’s first westerner to
              don the saffron robes of an ordained Buddhist monk.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A hero to
              millions for his outspoken political stance against the yoke of colonialism
              across Asia during the late 1800s, Carroll’s extraordinary life story is all
              the more remarkable for being virtually unknown until relatively recently.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Born
              around 1850, he spent much of his youth in a transitory existence as a “tramp,
              shepherd, truckman and tally clerk” across the Europe and the USA, before
              signing on as a stevedore on a steamer bound for China.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Forced to
              disembark in Rangoon for ‘disorderly conduct’, he eventually pitched up at a
              remote monastery within the depths of Burma’s forests, where he closed the door
              on his dissolute past to train in ancient Buddhist practices, emerging seven
              years later as the first fully-ordained western Buddhist monk.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Far from
              observing the peaceful image of the Buddhist calling, however, Laurence Carroll
              then dedicated his life to a political activism that set him on a collision
              course against the Catholic Church and rigid British Colonial rule, both of
              which were then firmly rooted across Southeast Asia.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A heroic
              figure who drew thousands to his fiery speeches promoting education and
              independence across Siam, Cambodia, Malaya, Ceylon and Nepal, he became an
              enigmatic Robin Hood of the oppressed.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“When I
              first stumbled upon this story, I was gobsmacked,” explains filmmaker Ian
              Lawton.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Not just
              by the fact that this was an amazing story, but that I was only finding out
              about it today. I felt this man should be a household name alongside other
              notable Irish historical figures like Oscar Wilde, Michael Collins or Daniel
              O’Connell. He certainly is a great Irish hero, but one that nobody outside
              academia knows about.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
              discovery of Laurence Carroll’s incredible life resulted from a painstaking
              five years of collaborative academic detective work by Dr Laurence Cox,
              professor of Sociology at NUI Maynooth; Alicia Turner of York University,
              Toronto; and Professor Brian Bocking of University College Cork.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Shortly after
              his ordination, a notice appeared in a Burmese newspaper warning all Christian
              missionaries not to distribute religious tracts or sell bibles in the province
              of Burma, signed by order of U Dhammaloka, the Bishop of Rangoon. It was an
              audacious beginning to a life devoted to fighting the cause of the underdog.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“He was
              put on trial for saying that the British had taken Burma from the Burmese and
              now desired to trample on their religion. He found that a strong defence of
              local religion could tweak the nose of the powers that be, and became immensely
              popular for doing so.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Carroll
              travelled constantly, touring rural Burma and the towns of Ceylon, setting up
              schools in Singapore and Bangkok, networking in Japan and teaching in Nepal.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“We find
              him running up against the authorities time and again, a lifelong habit of
              his,” says Lawton. “His personality emerged by turns as charming, frustrating,
              witty and grandiose, he was evidently a great storyteller and a courageous and
              resourceful individual.”</span></p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 18.7pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 20.5pt; line-height: 112%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">BLANK CHAPTER</span></strong><span style="font-size: 20.5pt; line-height: 112%; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></h2>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Intriguingly,
              a full 26 years of Carroll’s life before 1900 remain unaccounted for: “He was
              under constant police and intelligence surveillance, tried for sedition and
              faked his own death before disappearing as mysteriously as he had appeared.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“He was
              perhaps just too colourful to remember comfortably, and later generations
              quietly forgot this story,” Cox concludes.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Carroll
              was also famous not just for speeches denouncing Christian missionaries and
              European colonialism, but also proving that his background was no barrier to
              Buddhism, adds UCC’s Professor Bocking.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“The most
              important thing for us in learning about Dhammaloka is that he opens up a whole
              world of early Western Buddhists who were not respectable types but who came
              out of an imperial underclass that was interested in religion.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Ian
              Lawton is currently crowdfunding his film, and sees the project as a tale about
              meticulous academic detective work, and a remarkable Irishman who time is long
              overdue.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“Considering
              he travelled in a time before passports and was constantly changing his name,
              and the fact that most evidence has been wiped out by two world wars and other
              contributing factors, it is a remarkable achievement and ought to be
              celebrated. This was a man who faced down colonialism and Christian
              missionaries — a man who stood up to the British empire and paid the ultimate
              price.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Though
              only one grainy photograph exists of Carroll, and precious little of his
              writings, Lawton sees much of his Irish birthright apparent in his personality.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“He certainly
              did have a sense of humour and a sharp wit. The fact that he once offered
              15,000 rupees in a newspaper article to anyone who could show him a virgin
              mother is evidence of how funny he was. I’d say he enjoyed his celebrity and
              used it to his advantage,” he adds.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Carroll
              must be reinstated for a new generation a century after his death, he believes.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“To me,
              he is up there with Martin Luther King and Lenny Bruce, people who had the
              passion and drive to stand up for what they believed in, no matter what the
              odds.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 20.5pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">USING ANIMATION</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Given the
              lack of footage of Carroll, the filmmaker intends to realise several scenes
              through animation. “The bulk of the narrative will be derived from interviews
              with the core research team, with additional commentary from other notable
              figures in the field of Buddhism and world history.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Lawton’s
              funding goal is a modest €15,000 through crowdfunding. This allows him to help
              raise awareness for a film that’s still in the pipeline.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“This is
              a sign of the times. We are living in an era where this kind of pre-selling is
              becoming more and more necessary for small independent productions these days.
              Building an audience prior to principal photography is becoming increasingly
              important for a movies survival.”</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He sees
              the film as having a universal appeal.</span></p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“I don’t
              see it as specifically a ‘Buddhist’ film, nor a film with merit only for
              history buffs. This is a story of one man’s triumph over adversity. A hero’s
              journey.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="contextmenu" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">“A man
              standing up to the might of the British empire, yet ultimately failing by being
              written out of their history, erased from existence by a superpower. This film
              will be his ultimate victory.”</span></p>
