              <p>Initially I wanted to consolidate the Dzogchen and Mahamudra threads into a single topic, but seems like FireIce deleted Nahahwu and his posts. So I'll just post whatever is still opened my screen.</p>
              <h1>hepa Sri Gyelpo by Patrul Rimpoche</h1>
              <p>The Khepa Sri Gyelpo by Patrul Rimpoche is for some the single
                                      most important Dzogchen text in the Dzogchen 
              Nyingthik tradition.
                                      Within the frame of view, meditation and action,
               Patrul Rimpoche
                                      includes Garab Dorje's three incisive precepts, 
              or imperatives, in
                                      his exposition of the vision, or view, of 
              Dzogchen atiyoga. He
                                      gives very precise instructions in the practice 
              of view and
                                      meditation. The meditation technique employed is
               explosive
                                      utterance of the sacred syllable PHAT.<br> <br> <br> Homage to the Guru!<br> <br> Vision is Longchen Rabjam, the All-pervasive 
              Vast Expanse;<br> meditation is Khyentse Wozer, the Radiance of 
              Wisdom and
                                      Love;<br> action is Gyelwai Nyugu, the Bodhisattva.<br> Practicing such vision, meditation and action,<br> Without stress or strain you will attain 
              Buddhahood in this
                                      lifetime;<br> And failing that - what peace of mind!<br> <br> Yes, Vision is Longchen Rabjam, All-Pervasive 
              Vast Expanse,<br> and the three precepts strike that essential 
              reality.<br> First, keep the mind relaxed,<br> and neither diffused nor concentrated, remain 
              without
                                      thought;<br> in this state of equilibrium and relaxation<br> abruptly utter a mind-shattering PHAT!<br> forcefully, loud and short - and there it is!<br> nothing at all but wonderment and illumination.<br> In illuminated wonderment is all-pervading 
              freedom of mind,<br> and in that inexpressible all-penetrating 
              freedom of mind<br> recognise the dharmakaya's total presence.<br> A direct introduction into the nature of mind is
               the first
                                      imperative.<br> <br> Then, whether there is quiescence or flow,<br> rage or lust, happiness or sadness,<br> at all times and in every situation,<br> sustain that recognition of the dharmakaya's 
              total presence.<br> The 'son' clear light uniting with the familiar 
              'mother'
                                      light<br> remain absorbed in ineffable total presence.<br> Again and again disrupt quiescence, elation, 
              clarity and
                                      flow,<br> by abruptly uttering the syllable of means and 
              insight,<br> and meditative absorption and subsequent insight
               are
                                      identical<br> and the sessions and intervals of meditation are
                                      indistinguishable:<br> always remain in this state of 
              non-differentiation.<br> While stability in this is developing , however,<br> renounce entertainment and treasure meditation;<br> practice formal meditation in set periods<br> and at all times and in every situation<br> watch the free play of the dharmakaya alone<br> convinced that there is nothing other than that.<br> Absolute conviction is the second imperative.<br> <br> In the event of lust or anger, pleasure or pain,<br> or any fortuitous thought,<br> with direct recognition of it no residue 
              remains;<br> by intuiting this liberating aspect of the 
              dharmakaya,<br> analogous to a figure drawn in water,<br> there is uninterrupted spontaneous arising and 
              reflexive
                                      release.<br> Whatever arises is the food of naked presence 
              and emptiness;<br> whatever moves is the creativity of the 
              sovereign dharmakaya,<br> spontaneously dissolving, leaving no trace – 
              awesome!<br> The way things arise is the same as before;<br> the crucial difference is in their release.<br> Without this vital function of release, 
              meditation is a delusory
                                      path;<br> imbued with it, we abide in dharmakaya 
              non-meditation.<br> Implicit confidence in release is the third 
              imperative.<br> <br> In this vision that possesses those three 
              imperatives,<br> meditation, the interfusion of wisdom and love,<br> and the Bodhisattva's customary activity, act as
               support.<br> Though the Buddhas of past present and future 
              confer,<br> there are no precepts superior to these.<br> <br> The Dharmakaya Treasure-finder, the creativity 
              of total
                                      presence,<br> took this treasure from the matrix of perfect 
              insight.<br> This treasure is not an extraction of ore from 
              rock;<br> it is the final testament of Garab Dorje;<br> it is the spiritual elixir of the three 
              transmissions<br> entrusted with the seal of secrecy to my heart 
              sons.<br> <br> This message from the heart is the profound 
              truth;<br> ihis vital truth is my heart message.<br> Do not abandon this vital truth;<br> do not let these precepts escape you.<br> <br> The Extraordinary Teaching of the Khepa 
              Srigyelpo,<br> Glorious Sovereign Wisdom, is complete.</p>

                                      the final result.<br> Thus it is demonstrated by these three aspects.<br> <br> The ground to be understood is the all-pervasive

                                      essence.<br> Uncompounded, luminous, and empty, it is the

                                      awareness.<br> Beyond confusion and liberation, it is 
              completely quiescent, like
                                      space.<br> Although it abides without separation in samsara
               or joining in
                                      nirvana,<br> Due to the great demon of coemergent and

                                      fixation,<br> And the different perceptions of worlds and 
              inhabitants,<br> The six classes of beings appeared as a dream.<br> <br> Although this is so, you have never moved and 
              will never move<br> From the original condition of the essence.<br> Endeavor therefore in purifying the temporary 
              stains.<br> <br> The stages of the path that bring about 
              realization are
                                      innumerable.<br> Purify your beings, sow the seeds, and cultivate

              aspects.<br> <br> First of all is to purify your mind and being.<br> The vajra master, the root of the path,<br> Is someone who has the pure conduct of samaya 
              and vows.<br> He is fully adorned with learning, has discerned
               it through
                                      reflection.<br> And through meditation he posseses the qualities
               and signs of
                                      experience and realization.<br> With his compassionate action he accepts 
              disciples.<br> <br> Serve a master endowed with these 
              characteristics by means of the
                                      three pleasing actions,<br> And do not commit the displeasing ones for even 
              an instant.<br> Take the pledge to accomplish whatever he 
              commands<br> By the skill of correctly training in his 
              thoughts and deeds.<br> <br> The master should give the teachings suited to 
              the mind of the
                                      disciple<br> Who has faith, renunciation, and compassion,<br> And who has sharp faculties, intelligence, and 
              discipline.<br> He should not give instructions that are 
              inappropriate for the
                                      recipient.<br> <br> For the way of guiding gradually in accordance 
              with the types of
                                      mental capacity,<br> First, keep far away from places of disturbance<br> By going to a place of solitude and giving up 
              worldly
                                      activities.<br> <br> Sit on a comfortable seat, straighten your body,
               and expel the
                                      stale breath.<br> Supplicate the Three Jewels and generate 
              devotion to your
                                      guru.<br> Apply mindfulness and reflect in the following 
              way.<br> <br> This bodily support adorned with the perfect 
              freedoms and
                                      riches,<br> Like the udumbara flower, is extremely hard to 
              find.<br> If you skillfully take advantage of it,<br> Then this find has great value, exceeding that 
              of a wish-fulfilling
                                      gem.<br> Therefore follow spiritual guides and virtuous 
              friends<br> At all times and on all occasions.<br> <br> Giving up concerns for this life, and for the 
              sake of the
                                      future.<br> Exert yourself quickly to take advantage of it, 
              for if you don't,
                                      it will not last.<br> <br> Like the rising and setting of the sun and moon,
               composite things
                                      are impermanent.<br> The time of death lies uncertain, like a flash 
              of lightning in the
                                      sky.<br> At the time of death nondharmic things are of no
               help at all,<br> So practice the sacred and sublime Dharma 
              correctly.<br> <br> The root of practicing the sacred Dharma is the 
              law of karma.<br> Through evil deeds and nonvirtues you will go to
               the three lower
                                      realms.<br> By virtuous actions you achieve the higher 
              realms and
                                      liberation.<br> Therefore confess evil deeds and make the 
              wholehearted vow to
                                      refrain from them.<br> <br> Diligently take up the roots of virtue.<br> Prostrations and circumambulations purify the 
              wrongdoings of your
                                      body.<br> Reciting and reading the Buddha's words purify 
              the obscurations of
                                      your speech,<br> And supplicating the Three Jewels pacifies the 
              faults of your
                                      mind.<br> Always train correctly in being mindful, 
              careful, and
                                      conscientious.<br> In particular, for accomplishing the state of 
              emancipation,<br> With the recognition and remembrance that all of
               samsara<br> Is like a fiery pit, a garden of razors, or a 
              forest of
                                      swords,<br> Arouse again and again the intense and genuine 
              attitude<br> Of desiring to be quickly freed from the three 
              sufferings<br> <br> At some point, when you understand that all 
              samsaric grandeur<br> Is impermanent, inconstant, and illusive,<br> Fascination with even the splendor of Brahma and
               Indra<br> Will have no occasion to arise for as much as an
               instant.<br> <br> While truly perceiving the Three Precious Ones, 
              the Roots, and the
                                      guardians of the Dharma<br> To be the unfailing and permanent protection,<br> Regard them repectfully as your refuge until 
              enlightenment<br> In order to free yourself and others from the 
              terrors of
                                      samsara.<br> <br> Using your own experience as a measure,<br> Arouse the bodhicitta of aspiration<br> Through the four immeasurables of love, 
              compassion, joy and
                                      impartiality<br> In order that your mothers, all beings, may have
               happiness and be
                                      free from suffering<br> <br> With the intent of pursuing complete 
              enlightenment solely for the
                                      sake of others,<br> Give away, like grass, your body and possesions,<br> And give the relief of protection to those 
              disturbed by
                                      dangers.<br> Practice the Dharma yourself and establish 
              others in it.<br> <br> With the intention of renouncing, a throughly 
              delighted frame of
                                      mind,<br> Constrain yourself from committing the negative 
              misdeeds of your
                                      three doors.<br> Practice the conditioned and unconditioned 
              virtues as much as you
                                      can,<br> And motivate yourself to carry out all your 
              deeds for the sake of
                                      sentient beings.<br> <br> In order never to be overcome by harmdoers,<br> Cultivate patience through mindfulness of the 
              demerits of
                                      anger.<br> Joyfully undertake hardships for the sake of the
               Dharma,<br> And be unafraid of the profound emptiness.<br> <br> By awakening a courageous fortitude for what is 
              virtuous,<br> Don the armor of tirelessly engaging in 
              bodhisattva deeds.<br> Exert yourself without distraction throughout 
              day and night,<br> And cast away weariness when achieving the 
              welfare of others<br> <br> With the thorough intention to calm your mind,<br> Take the mundane dhyanas as the foundation.<br> Through fully accomplishing samadhi with 
              vipashyana,<br> Enter the domain of the experience of the 
              tathagatas.<br> <br> By means of the intelligence that fully discerns
               phenomena,<br> First comprehend the words of all teachings 
              through learning.<br> Next seek an understanding of their meaning 
              through
                                      reflection,<br> And finally realize the meaning through 
              meditation.<br> <br> Having ripened your own beings, gather followers
               through
                                      generosity,<br> Delight them with pleasing words, and comfort 
              them by being
                                      consistent.<br> Through counseling them in meaningful conduct, 
              fully establish
                                      them,temporarily and ultimately<br> In the splendor of benefit and well-being.<br> As the essential point, take upon yourself the 
              burden<br> Of all the miseries of sentient beings,<br> Give away your happiness and virtue to the six 
              classes of
                                      beings,<br> And train in compassion and bodhicitta without 
              being carried away
                                      by difficulties.<br> <br> In particular, external objects grasped by 
              fixation<br> Are all unreal and appear like an illusion.<br> Not permanent, yet their transiency is able to 
              function.<br> They are not singular, since a variety emerges 
              and changes.<br> They are not independent, but follow the karmic 
              deeds.<br> They are not particles, since partless atoms do 
              not exist.<br> <br> If they did exist, gross things could not be 
              assembled.<br> If they had parts, this would contradict the 
              assertion of
                                      partlessness.<br> They are nothing but a nonexistent and false 
              appearance, an
                                      interdependence,<br> Like dreams, magical illusion, and the 
              reflection of the moon in
                                      water.<br> Regard them as a city of gandharvas and as a 
              rainbow.<br> <br> The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego 
              or a
                                      self-entity.<br> It is neither seen as something different from 
              the aggregates<br> Nor as identical with these five aggregates.<br> If the first were true, there would exist some 
              other
                                      substance.<br> This is not the case, so were the second to be 
              true,<br> That would contradict a permanent self, since 
              the aggregates are
                                      impermanent.<br> Therefore, based on the five aggregates,<br> The self is a mere imputation by the power of 
              ego-clinging.<br> <br> As to that which imputes, the past thought has 
              vanished and is
                                      nonexistent.<br> The future thought has not occurred, and the 
              present thought does
                                      not withstand scrutiny.<br> In short, understand the twofold self, the 
              perceiver and the
                                      perceived,<br> To be totally quiescent, like the sky, and 
              devoid of arising,<br> And also that this nonarising is beyond the 
              domain of conceptual
                                      mind.<br> Since even the Omniscient Ones find no words for
               this,<br> This absence of mental constructs is called the 
              Middle Way.<br> <br> Having realized this, rest in equanimity,<br> Free from conceptual activity, in the state 
              devoid of
                                      fixation.<br> Thoughts then subside, and the natural state of 
              the essence is
                                      seen.<br> Hereby you accomplish the virtues such as the 
              eyes,<br> superknowledge, and dharani-recall.<br> <br> The causal vehicle of the paramitas<br> Is to gradually attain the paths and bhumis.<br> On the path of fruition, you should still regard<br> The practice of unified emptiness and compassion
               as the basis of
                                      the path.</p>

              <h1>The Main Road of the Triumphant Ones,Lozang Chokyi Gyeltsen</h1>
              <p>Namo mahamudraya: Homage to mahamudra, the great seal of
                                      reality.<br> <br> I respectfully bow at the feet of my peerless 
              guru, lord of that
                                      which pervades everywhere, master of those with 
              actual attainment,
                                      who expounds the all-pervasive nature of 
              everything, the great seal
                                      of reality, mahamudra, inseparable from the 
              diamond-strong sphere
                                      of mind that is beyond speech. Gathering 
              together the essence of
                                      the sutras and tantras and condensing oceans of 
              guideline
                                      instructions, I shall write some advice 
              concerning mahamudra from
                                      the Gelug/Kagyü tradition, deriving from the 
              pioneering fatherly
                                      Dharmavajra, a mahasiddha with supreme actual 
              attainment, and his
                                      spiritual offspring.For this there are 
              preparatory practices,
                                      actual techniques and concluding procedures. As 
              for the first, in
                                      order to have a gateway for entering the 
              teachings and a central
                                      tent pole for erecting a mahayana mind. 
              earnestly take the safe
                                      direction of refuge and develop a dedicated 
              heart of bodhichitta.
                                      Do not let these merely be words from your 
              mouth. Since seeing the
                                      actual nature of mind is dependent upon building
               up bountiful
                                      stores and purifying yourself of mental 
              obstacles, direct towards
                                      your root guru at least a hundred thousand 
              repetitions of the
                                      hundred-syllable mantra and as many hundreds of 
              prostrations as
                                      possible, made while reciting The Admission of 
              Downfalls. In
                                      addition, make repeated heartfelt requests to 
              your root guru
                                      inseparable from all Buddhas of the three times.<br> <br> As for the actual basic techniques, although 
              there are many ways of
                                      asserting mahamudra, there are two when divided 
              according to the
                                      sutras and tantras. The latter is a greatly 
              blissful clear light
                                      mind manifested by such skillful methods as 
              penetrating vital
                                      points of the subtle vajra-body and so forth. 
              The mahamudra of the
                                      traditions of Saraha, Nagarjuna, Naropa and 
              Maitripa, it is the
                                      quintessence of the anuttarayoga class of tantra
               as taught in The
                                      Seven Texts of the Mahasiddhis and The Three 
              Core Volumes. The
                                      former refers to the ways of meditating on 
              voidness as directly
                                      indicated in the expanded, intermediate and 
              brief Prajnaparamita
                                      sutras. The supremely realized Arya Nagarjuna 
              has said, "Except of
                                      this, there is no other pathway of mind leading 
              to liberation."
                                      Here I shall give instruction on mahamudra in 
              accordance with his
                                      intentions and discuss the methods that lead you
               to recognize mind
                                      in keeping with the exposition of the lineage 
              masters.From the
                                      point of view of individually ascribed names, 
              there are numerous
                                      traditions, such as those of the simultaneously 
              arising as merged,
                                      the amulet box, possessing five, the six spheres
               of equal taste,
                                      the four syllables, the pacifier, the object to 
              be cut off,
                                      dzogchen, the discursive madhyamaka view, and so
               on. Nevertheless,
                                      when scrutinized by a yogi learned in scripture 
              and logic and
                                      experienced in meditation, their definitive 
              meanings are all seen
                                      to come to the same intended point.<br> <br> Of the two main techniques of the sutra 
              tradition of mahamudra,
                                      namely seeking to meditate on mind on top of 
              having gained a
                                      correct view of reality and seeking a correct 
              view on top of having
                                      meditated on mind, I shall explain here in 
              accordance with the
                                      latter technique. On a seat conducive for mental
               stability, assume
                                      the sevenfold bodily posture and clear yourself 
              purely with a round
                                      of the nine tastes of breath. Thoroughly cleanse
               your state of
                                      awareness, and then, with a purely positive 
              mind, direct toward
                                      your practice your taking of refuge and the 
              reaffirmation of your
                                      dedicated heart of bodhichitta. Meditate next on
               a profound path of
                                      guru-yoga and, after making hundreds of very 
              strong. fervent
                                      requests, dissolve your visualized guru into 
              yourself.<br> <br> Absorb for awhile unwaveringly in this state in 
              which all haphazard
                                      appearance-making and appearances have been 
              contracted until they
                                      have disappeared. Do not contrive anything with 
              thoughts such as
                                      expectations or worries. This does not mean, 
              however, that you
                                      cease all attention as if your had fainted or 
              fallen asleep. Rather
                                      , you must tie your attention to the post of 
              mindfulness in order
                                      not to wander, and station alertness to be aware
               of any mental
                                      movement.Firmly tighten the hold of your 
              mindfulness on that which
                                      has the nature of clarity and awareness and 
              behold it
                                      starkly.<br> <br> Should your mind give rise to any thoughts, 
              simply recognize them.
                                      Or, like your opponent in a duel, cut thoughts 
              immediately as soon
                                      as they occur. Once you have completely cut 
              these off and have
                                      settled your mind, then, without losing 
              mindfulness, loosen and
                                      relax its tightness. As has been said, "Loosen 
              and relax its firm
                                      tightness and there is the settled state of 
              mind." And elsewhere,
                                      "When mind ensnared in a tangle is relaxed, it 
              frees itself without
                                      a doubt." Like these statements, relax but 
              without any
                                      wandering.When you look at the nature of any 
              thought that arises,
                                      it automatically disappears by itself and a bare
               absence
                                      dawns.<br> <br> Likewise, when you inspect mind's nature when it
               is settled, a non
                                      obstructive bare absence and clarity is vivid. 
              You see that the
                                      settled and moving minds are mixed together. 
              Thus, no matter what
                                      thought arises, when you recognize that it is a 
              movement of mind
                                      and, without blocking it, have settled on its 
              nature, you find it
                                      is like the example of a bird confined on a 
              boat. As is said, "Just
                                      as a crow having flown from a ship after 
              circling the directions
                                      must realight on it.."<br> <br> From cultivating such methods as these, you 
              experience the nature
                                      of the totally absorbed mind to be a 
              non-obstructive lucidity and
                                      clarity. Not established as any form of physical
               phenomenon, it is
                                      a bare absence which, like space, allows 
              anything to dawn and be
                                      vivid. Such nature of mind must in fact be seen 
              straightforwardly
                                      with exceptional perception and cannot be 
              verbally indicated or
                                      apprehended as a "this." Therefore, without such
               apprehension,
                                      settle in a fluid and flowing manner on whatever
               cognitive dawning
                                      arises.<br> <br> The great meditators of the snow mountains are 
              practically of a
                                      single opinion in proclaiming that this is a 
              guideline indicating
                                      how to forge a state of Buddhahood. Be that as 
              it may, I,
                                      Chökyi-gyeltsen, say that this is wondrous 
              skillful means for
                                      beginners to accomplish the settling of their 
              mind and is a way
                                      that leads you to recognize merely the 
              conventional nature of mind
                                      that conceals something deeper.<br> <br> As for the methods that can lead you to 
              recognize the actual
                                      deepest nature of mind, I shall now record the 
              personal
                                      instructions of my root guru, Sanggyay-yeshey, 
              who as his name
                                      literally means is the embodiment of the 
              Buddhas' deep awareness.
                                      Assuming the guise of a monk clad in saffron, he
               has eliminated the
                                      darkness enshrouding my mind.<br> <br> While in a state of total absorption as before, 
              and like a tiny
                                      fish flashing about in a lucid pond and not 
              disturbing it,
                                      intelligently inspect the self-nature of the 
              person who is
                                      meditating. It is just as our source of 
              direction, the highly
                                      realized Arya Nagarjuna, has said, "A person is 
              not earth, not
                                      water, nor fire, nor wind, not space, not 
              consciousness. Nor is he
                                      or she all of them. Yet what person is there 
              separate from these?
                                      And just as a person is not perfectly solid 
              because he or she is
                                      what can be labeled on the collection of these 
              six constituents,
                                      likewise none of the constituents are perfectly 
              solid because each
                                      is what can be labeled on a collection of 
              parts." When you search
                                      and, as has been said, cannot find even a mere 
              atom of a total
                                      absorption, someone totally absorbed and so on, 
              then cultivate
                                      absorbed concentration on voidness which is like
               space, and do so
                                      single-pointedly without any wandering.<br> <br> Furthermore, while in a state of total 
              absorption, scrutinize mind.
                                      Not established as any form of physical 
              phenomenon, it is a
                                      non-obstructive bareness that gives rise to the 
              cognitive dawning
                                      and emanation of anything, and which endures as 
              an unhindered
                                      clarity and awareness, engaging with objects 
              without discontinuity.
                                      It appears not to depend on anything else. But 
              as for the implied
                                      object of the mind that apprehends it to exist 
              as it appears, our
                                      guiding light, Shantideva, has said, "Such 
              things as continuum or
                                      collection are not as they seem. They are false,
               as in the case of
                                      a rosary, an army and so on." By means of 
              scriptural authority and
                                      lines of reasoning such as this, totally absorb 
              yourself on
                                      everything's lack of existing as it appears.<br> <br> In short, as my spiritual mentor, 
              Sanggyay-yeshey, omniscient in
                                      the true sense, has said, "When, no matter what 
              dawns in your mind,
                                      you are fully aware that what it is an 
              appearance of exists simply
                                      as what can be apprehended by conceptual 
              thought, you experience
                                      the deepest sphere of reality dawning without 
              need to rely on
                                      anything else. While this dawning, to immerse 
              your awareness in it
                                      and totally absorb, my goodness!" Similarly, 
              fatherly Pa
                                      Dampa-sanggyay has said, "Within a state of 
              voidness, the lance of
                                      awareness twirls around. A correct view of 
              reality cannot be
                                      impeded by anything ultimately tangible or 
              obstructive, O people of
                                      Dingri." All such statements come to the same 
              intended point.<br> <br> At the conclusion of your meditation session, 
              dedicate whatever
                                      ennobling, positive potential has accrued from 
              meditating on
                                      mahamudra, the great seal of reality, as well as
               your ocean like
                                      collection of positive potential of the three 
              times, toward your
                                      attainment of the peerless state of 
              enlightenment.<br> <br> Having accustomed yourself like this to seeing 
              with a correct view,
                                      when you subsequently inspect how your mind 
              makes the objects of
                                      any of your six collections of consciousness 
              appear, you experience
                                      their bare mode of existence dawning in an 
              exposed, resplendent
                                      manner, This is called the essential point of a 
              correct view
                                      recognizing whatever dawns in your mind.In 
              short, always cultivate
                                      your realization by not apprehending things, 
              such as your mind and
                                      so forth, to exist in the manner in which your 
              mind gives rise to
                                      an appearance of them. Do this by keeping firm 
              to their actual mode
                                      of existence. When you cognize one thing like 
              this, you see the
                                      nature of all phenomena of samsara or nirvana as
               being uniformly
                                      the same. Aryadeva has confirmed this point, "As
               has been
                                      explained, the way in which mind becomes the 
              seer of one functional
                                      phenomenon is the way it becomes the seer of 
              everything. The
                                      voidness of one thing suffices for the voidness 
              of all
                                      things."Before the face of proper, total 
              absorption on the actual
                                      nature of reality, there is just the severance 
              of fantasized,
                                      impossible extremes - namely, inherent, findable
               existence or total
                                      non-existence - with respect to everything of 
              samsara and
                                      nirvana.<br> <br> Yet after you arise, when you inspect, you see 
              that your mind still
                                      gives rise to the appearance of things that 
              dependently arise,
                                      which do function and can only exist as simply 
              what can be labeled
                                      by names. It is unmistakable that such things 
              still naturally dawn,
                                      yet they are like dreams, mirages, reflection of
               the moon in water
                                      and illusions.<br> <br> When the time comes that you can perceive 
              simultaneously the
                                      appearance of things without this causing their 
              voidness to be
                                      obscured to your mind, and their voidness 
              without your mind ceasing
                                      to make their appearance dawn, you have directly
               manifested the
                                      excellent pathway mind that perceives everything
               from the single,
                                      integrated point of voidness and dependent 
              arising being
                                      synonymous. The attainment of the resultant two 
              unified Buddha
                                      bodies comes from the unified practice of wisdom
               and method, This
                                      follows from the fact that all objects have both
               voidness and
                                      appearance levels of truth.These words have been
               written by the
                                      renounced meditator Lozang-chökyi-gyeltsen, who 
              has heard many
                                      teachings. By its positive merit, may all beings
               quickly become
                                      triumphant Buddhas through this pathway of mind,
               apart from which
                                      there is no second gateway to a state of 
              serenity.I have compiled
                                      these techniques that lead you to recognize the 
              great seal of
                                      reality, mahamudra, at the repeated request of<br> <br> Gedün-gyeltsen, who holds the monastic degree of
               Infinitely Learned
                                      Scholar of the Ten Fields of Knowledge, and of 
              Sherab Senggey from
                                      Hatong, who holds the monastic degree of Master 
              of the Ten
                                      Difficult Texts. They have seen all concerns for
               the eight worldly
                                      emotional states to be dramas of madness and now
               live in remote
                                      solitude, following a sagely way of life and 
              taking this pathway of
                                      mind as their essential practice. Many other of 
              my disciples who
                                      truly wish to practice mahamudra at its 
              definitive level have also
                                      requested such a text.<br> <br> I have especially composed this text now since 
              the triumphant
                                      Ensapa, the omniscient lord of masters with 
              actual attainment,
                                      himself has said in one of his songs of 
              experience to instruct
                                      himself and others, "I have written explanation 
              of lamrim the
                                      graded stages of the path from the Kadam 
              tradition all the way from
                                      whole-hearted commitment to a spiritual teacher 
              up through shamata
                                      and vipashyana. But I have not committed to 
              paper the ultimate
                                      guideline instructions for mahamudra, which are 
              not included among
                                      these aforementioned pathways of mind and which 
              are not well known
                                      at present to those of the Land of Snows."<br> <br> Thus, what was not set down in writing at that 
              time due to need for
                                      restriction was intended for a later period. 
              Scriptural sources
                                      establish as much - for example, from The Lotus 
              Sutra, "Because it
                                      is to be realized completely by the Buddhas' 
              deep awareness
                                      Sanggyay-yeshey, you could never say to those 
              who would prematurely
                                      write about this method of their own accord that
               you are
                                      enlightened. If you ask why, it is because those
               who are sources of
                                      safe direction have regard for the 
              times."Therefore, also in order
                                      for such prophesies as this to be fulfilled, I, 
              the renounced
                                      meditator Lozang-chökyi-gyeltsen, who have not 
              let degenerate the
                                      lineage of inspiration from those who have 
              practiced
                                      straightforwardly this pathway of mind from the 
              peerless universal
                                      teacher, the king of the Shakyas, down through

              become a member of
                                      this lineage, not letting the close bond of its

              <p> </p>
              <p>All who commit themselves to remain in retreat should ensure that
              faith, renunciation, compassion and looking into the nature of mind lie
              at the very heart of their practice. <br><br>Faith <br><br>‘Faith’
              means complete trust in, and reliance upon, the Three Jewels in
              general, and our own teacher in particular, as well as in the Dharma we
              are practising. If we practise for a long time, after a while we might
              think, “I still haven’t gained any signs of progress! The teacher can’t
              have given me the most profound instructions. It would be better for me
              to do the main practice, rather than the preliminaries, because it’s
              more profound!” Or if we are doing the main practice we might think, “I
              think it would be better for me to set aside this simple generation
              stage practice and do some dzogrim instead.” Or even, “Dzogchen would
              be more profound than these completion stage practices like tummo.” <br><br>You
              might think that once you have received the Dzogchen teachings you will
              have all kinds of profound lofty experiences, even after just a few
              days. If you have such high expectations, then when things don’t work
              out that way, you will begin to doubt the instructions and relax your
              diligence. Or, if you do develop the slightest hint of renunciation or
              gain some minor experience or realization, you will only develop pride
              and think, “The Kagyü, Sakya and Gelug schools have nothing to compare
              with these Nyingma teachings!” You must avoid developing wrong views
              such as this and arrogantly supposing that you have gained some special
              experience or realization. No matter who you are, the ordinary mind is
              always prone to change and transformation, so you should try never to
              get carried away.<br><br>Even if you were to practise day and night
              with unflagging diligence for a full twelve years and still fail to
              have even one good dream, you must never lose heart. Recognizing that
              this is due simply to the strength of your own obscurations, you must
              be confident that neither your teachers nor the teachings will ever let
              you down. <br><br>On the other hand, even if you were to make such
              swift progress that in just a single day you reached the level at which
              there is nothing further in samsara to be abandoned nor anything
              further in nirvana to be gained, you should feel no pride, because to
              do so would only be to invite the demon of obstacles. That is why
              Jetsün Milarepa said:<br><br> When you are approaching the end of the Dharma,<br><br> Continue ceaselessly, without any highs or lows,<br> And without hopes for signs of swift attainment,<br> Ensure your practice endures as long as you do!<br><br>This is marvellous advice. <br><br>Renunciation<br><br>‘Renunciation’
              means that while in the retreat centre, every single time you recite
              the Seven Line Prayer or complete a single mala of mani mantras, you
              must dedicate it towards the attainment of buddhahood for yourself and
              all other sentient beings. While in retreat, you should not waste even
              a single moment in idleness or frivolity, and you must avoid any form
              of insincerity or duplicity, such as pretending—for as long as you are
              in other people’s view—to practise perfectly. <br><br>Do all that you
              can to bring your own stubborn mind under control and to develop your
              faith, diligence and renunciation. Never think that the Dharma you are
              practising is for your benefit alone. To recite even a single mani
              mantra is of inconceivable benefit, so dedicate it for the sake of all
              who live. <br><br>Again and again, develop compassion for all sentient
              beings in general, and particularly for those who dislike you. It might
              be difficult at first, but you will never attain enlightenment as long
              as you continue to feel ill-will towards your enemies. Those who are
              now your enemies were in former lives your parents, and there is
              nothing fixed about the status of an enemy or friend. To feel hostility
              towards enemies and affection towards your friends is nothing but a
              deluded form of perception. If you train your mind to recognize
              everything as insubstantial like a dream, hostility towards enemies
              will lose its meaning entirely. This is crucially important, because
              ordinarily our lives are driven by the yearning to acquire food and
              clothing, possessions, partners, status and acclaim. We put a great
              deal of thought into devising the cleverest, most efficient ways to
              obtain them, and we think, “So-and-so has this much money, my friends
              have this much, so I need more.” Or: “In the past, I stayed in this
              kind of house, in this part of town, but now I shall move to a better
              place.” We must put a stop to all such thinking.<br><br>With ordinary
              work, the more you do the more suffering you create for the future. But
              now that you have found a human existence, met an authentic teacher,
              and received the Dharma teachings, your situation is even better and
              more fortunate than that of Indra, king of the gods. If you now put the
              teachings into practice with steadfast determination, you are sure to
              find happiness in all your future lives. So be content with only the
              most basic food and clothing. Let me put it simply: do all that you can
              to renounce and minimize the ordinary affairs and activities of samsara.<br><br>Noone
              should stay in the retreat centre without taking the vows of refuge.
              Even if you are a layperson, for the three years that you are in
              retreat you must avoid sexual relations, and, while in retreat, it is
              enormously significant and beneficial to wear the robes of a monk or
              nun. The Buddha himself said it is permissible for anyone who has taken
              the vows of refuge to wear the monastic robes.<br><br>Compassion <br><br>Generally
              speaking, you have been practising the teachings of the Mahayana ever
              since you first entered the door of the Dharma, and this is really
              nothing other than compassion. Without genuine compassion there is
              simply no possibility of reaching buddhahood. <br><br>In their
              delusion, all the beings of samsara cherish only their own selfish
              interests and neglect others’ welfare. At the moment, no matter how
              well off we may be in terms of food, clothing or material possessions,
              and no matter how much happiness we may experience, we can never be
              satisfied. At the same time, if we give away even just a tiny fraction
              of what we own, it feels as if we are losing something enormous. We
              must let go of such attitudes, and, instead of caring for ourselves
              alone, learn to cherish others. Previously we neglected others, but now
              we must neglect our own selfish goals. Whenever we perform any virtuous
              deed with body, speech or mind, we must first remember that we are
              doing so as a means to bring about the enlightenment of all. <br><br>In
              Dharma practice, the most important thing is motivation. If it is
              motivated by the wish to benefit all beings, then even a single
              prostration or a single recitation of the hundred-syllable mantra will
              yield inexhaustible merit—merit that will remain until we have reached
              enlightenment and there are no beings left in samsara. Whereas if we do
              not have this motivation of universal benevolence, even a hundred
              thousand prostrations, or a hundred thousand recitations of the
              hundred-syllable mantra, will bear fruit only once before the merit is
              exhausted, and a single burst of anger will be enough to destroy our
              entire stock of virtue. It is crucial to understand this. If we
              consider that our practice is for the sake of all others, then because
              sentient beings are infinitely vast in number, our own merit will be
              equally vast. <br><br>No one is entirely free from suffering, so
              consider all the major and minor sufferings that befall others, and
              imagine them happening to you instead. How would you feel? Surely you
              would do all that you could to find a way to avoid the pain. So reflect
              continually on all the sufferings that other beings undergo and develop
              the compassionate wish that they may be free from pain. Once you have
              true compassion, you will naturally feel the wish to benefit others.
              Our teacher, the Buddha, while still a bodhisattva, had such vast and
              overwhelming compassion that he made five hundred prayers of aspiration
              for our benefit, and, as his followers, we too must make compassion the
              very core of our practice. <br><br>The immeasurable benefits of
              generating true compassion are described in detail in The Words of My
              Perfect Teacher and the Bodhicharyavatara, so please study them. <br><br>Looking into the Nature of Mind <br><br>To
              look into the nature of the mind we must understand how all its
              ordinary thoughts about anything and everything imaginable are just
              empty and insubstantial. Until now, we have been the slave of what we
              call ‘mind,’ forced to wander helplessly through samsaric existence.
              Now we must reverse the situation, and take control of our own mind. It
              will be easy to do this if we have some real understanding of how the
              mind is empty, but just entertaining some vague notion of mind’s
              emptiness, by thinking, “Well, this is what the masters say,” or “This
              is what it says in the texts,” will not help us to recognize the
              insubstantiality of our own deluded perception. <br><br>Turn your
              attention within then, and allow your mind to relax. You will notice
              not just one thought or idea, but many. For example, if you think of
              your mother, that is one thought, but then it in turn evokes all kinds
              of other thoughts, such as memories of the kindness she showed you. If
              she is still alive, you might think about going to visit her, and if
              not, you might feel sad. These are thoughts of attachment. If you think
              about your enemies, reflecting on the ways they have hurt you in the
              past, how they are sure to do so again in the future, and how you must
              find some way to be rid of them, these are thoughts of aversion. You
              might wonder where this attachment and aversion come from. In fact,
              they come from the deluded belief in the existence of what we call “I.”<br><br>Where
              is such an “I” to be found? Is it in the body or the mind? If you
              really look into the body, examining each of its parts—flesh, blood,
              bones and skin—you can not find anything at all called ‘body,’ so how
              could this be the location of the “I”? The mind, on the other hand, is
              insubstantial, so how could the “I” abide within it? In fact, the “I”
              is merely a concept or a thought. There is no location within a
              thought, and nothing could remain there, but still the power of one
              thought, such as the thought of our mother, causes us to think another
              thought, about her kindness to us, and that in turn inspires the
              thought of wishing to see her.<br><br>If we look into this process in
              more detail, we can see that while we are thinking about our mother’s
              kindness, the initial thought of our mother is no longer there—it has
              already gone. And the thought that we must visit her has not yet
              occurred—it is still in the future. As soon as we look into it, the
              present thought of our mother’s kindness is no longer there; it has
              already turned into the future thought of wanting to visit her. This
              means that the thoughts of the past, present and future can not exist
              at the same time, and we only use these terms for the sake of
              communication. The past is gone, like a person who has died, and the
              future (or ‘that which is yet to come’) does not exist at all. In fact,
              there is no such thing as a ‘present thought’ existing somehow
              independently of past and future. Before we thought of our mother that
              ‘present thought’ was still in the future. Then, as we thought of her,
              it was present. Finally, as we brought to mind her kindness, it was
              already in the past. <br><br>For one thought to pass through these
              three phases of time is a sign of its impermanence, and whatever is
              impermanent is empty. It is because a thing is empty that it can change
              over the course of the past, present and future. <br><br>Consider the
              surface of a mirror: because it is empty [and not fixed in a particular
              way], reflections can appear within it. When a person’s likeness
              appears in a mirror, the reflection resembles the real person, but the
              person’s face has neither entered the mirror nor been transferred to
              its surface. The image of the face appears because of certain causes
              and conditions, including the clarity of the mirror and the presence of
              the person’s face before it. The reflection of the face and the face
              itself are not the same. The reflection is inanimate, and when the
              reflection disappears the real face does not. A face can be burned if
              it is touched by fire, but you can not burn a reflection. Nevertheless,
              the reflection and the face are not completely different either,
              because the reflection can not appear in the absence of the person’s
              face, and if the person adopts a particular expression, such as a smile
              or a look of anger, the reflection also appears that way. <br><br>For
              these reasons, thoughts and reflections appear to be real only when we
              fail to examine them or look into them in any detail. If we do pause to
              consider them, we find that although they appear, they do not really
              exist. And this is true not just of these phenomena. It applies to all
              the appearances of our deluded samsaric experience: they seem real
              enough as long as we do not examine them too deeply, but when we do, we
              find that they are not real. This is why we refer to them as
              “unexamined, seeming reality.” <br><br>If the understanding of this
              point develops and takes hold, so that it becomes self-sustaining, that
              is what we call ‘experience.’ When we become more and more familiar
              with this, so that the mind is no longer swayed by thoughts of aversion
              or attachment, that is what we call ‘realization.’ <br><br>When we
              examine thoughts again and again in this way, we come to see that
              although they have no real existence, still they appear, and although
              they appear, they are insubstantial. At the same time, we understand
              how the thoughts of the past, present and future exist only as mere
              names or labels, and have no more reality than that. <br><br>If we
              have this understanding, then whenever we think of our mother and
              remember all the kindness she showed us, we need not succumb to
              thoughts of attachment. We will think, “Even if I were to go and see my
              mother, what good would that do? She has managed to provide food and
              clothing for herself, and even to provide for my material needs as
              well. If I were to take on this role, I would need to find work in some
              trade or business, and that would provoke all kinds of attachment and
              aversion and produce lots of distractions, which would only come in the
              way of my Dharma practice. Instead, I should put my energy into
              practising the Dharma, straightaway as much as I can, then dedicate all
              my sources of merit to my mother, to help relieve her sufferings of
              birth, death and the bardo states. It would be better for me to forget
              about ordinary worldly feelings of attachment to my mother. She has
              other children who can take care of her material needs, but there is no
              one but me to offer her spiritual assistance.” If we think this way, it
              will prevent us getting caught in the ordinary patterns of thought
              which can come up whenever we recall our mother. <br><br>This also
              gives us some clues as to how we can give up our thoughts of aversion
              towards our enemies. At first it might be a little difficult to
              overcome our attachment and aversion, but by practising again and
              again, it will become easier. <br><br>If you can overcome attachment
              and aversion, you will no longer accumulate karma. Morevoer, if you
              look into the unaltered state of mind that follows whenever feelings of
              attachment or aversion have subsided, you will find the nature of mind.
              As long as there are not too many thoughts arising, look undistractedly
              into the mind itself. Whenever there are lots of thoughts, examine them
              in the way I just described. If you become really familiar with this by
              training in it again and again, recognition of the nature of mind will
              occur naturally and spontaneously. The mind will no longer be caught up
              in thoughts, and even if thoughts do arise, they will not have any real
              strength and there will be no need to analyze or examine them. It will
              be sufficient simply to maintain an unaltered state of mind. <br><br>If
              ever you can not counteract a thought of attachment or aversion, repeat
              the process of investigation. When you have thoughts, don’t react with
              anxiety, thinking, “I shouldn’t have thoughts during meditation! Now
              lots of thoughts are going to come.” Simply look straight into the
              nature of any thought—be it positive or negative—and it will lose its
              strength and disappear. Without letting go of the state which follows,
              look gently into the nature of mind, and thoughts will vanish by
              themselves. When thoughts no longer occur one after another in swift
              succession you will gradually be able to liberate them. <br><br>When
              looking into the nature of mind, don’t expect to gain some
              exceptionally high or profound realization, or to see anything new. Nor
              should you hesitate or doubt your ability to meditate. Just trust that
              the nature of mind is simply the mind itself left in an unaltered
              state, and do all that you can to sustain this, without distraction, at
              all times, during and between the meditation sessions. Don’t expect to
              gain realization in just a few months, or even years. Whether you
              develop any of the qualities that come from the practice or not, remain
              steadfastly determined and resolve to continue the practice with
              diligence, day and night, throughout this life, future lives and the
              bardo state.<br><br>Understand this: it is more important to take to heart the key instructions than to receive a great many teachings. <br><br>In
              general, you should look at the instruction manual Words of My Perfect
              Teacher, and check whether or not your practice accords with what it
              says there. If you notice something that does not correspond, change
              it; and if there is something that is only partially in agreement, see
              whether or not it can be improved.<br><br>Aspire to practise the Dharma authentically, and never do anything that might upset your Dharma brothers and sisters.<br><br>In short, devote yourself to the Dharma as much as you possibly can, with body, speech and mind.<br><br>I
              will certainly come and visit you, and I will always remember to pray
              and practise for your protection, so that all your wishes in accordance
              with the Dharma will be accomplished.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p>We start the practice with the focus on samsara. Now samsara consists<br> of six realms or the six states;<br> so there is a separate meditation for each of these. In each case you<br> meditate on the sensations of<br> that specific realm and then on the emptiness of those sensations. You<br> do so by looking at the direct<br> nature of your own mind and thereby experiencing the emptiness of the<br> sensations.<br> So the first realm is the hell realm and, among the two types of hell<br> realms, the hot hell. During<br> these meditations you will be visualizing yourself in your ordinary<br> form with the exception that you<br> visualize your body as hollow. So, from the outside, you will look as<br> you look and from the inside<br> there are no bones or guts.<br> <br> In the center of your right foot towards its heel, visualize a black<br> Duh syllable. You then think that<br> all of the karma which is likely to cause your rebirth anytime in<br> hell, all of the karma accumulated<br> by others which will cause their rebirth in hell, and all of the<br> hellish kleshas that afflict you and<br> others, are drawn into that black Duh syllable. The syllable in your<br> foot is then transformed into the<br> realm of the hot hell, clearly like an image in a mirror. Then you<br> imagine that you, in the form of a<br> little body, are actually in that hot hell inside your right foot. Try<br> to imagine it as clearly as<br> possible, the inconceivable suffering of the hot hells. While you are<br> doing so, you repeat the mantra<br> Ram Naraka at least seven times. The first part, while doing this<br> contemplation, is to imagine<br> yourself burning in the hot hell and then towards the end of it you<br> look directly at the nature your<br> mind which causes the appearance and the sensations of the hot hell<br> realm to dissolve into emptiness.<br> Next, in the same way, you visualize in the corresponding place in<br> your left foot an identical black<br> Duh syllable, and withdraw into that all the karma and kleshas<br> accumulated this life and in previous<br> lives by yourself and others that causes rebirth in the cold hell.<br> Again, imagine that you are stuck<br> there and are experiencing all the inconceivable suffering of extreme<br> cold. While doing so, you recite<br> the mantra Kham Naraka seven times and then you look at the nature of<br> the mind of the meditator, the<br> person visualizing this, the experiencer, the person who is<br> experiencing the suffering and looking at<br> the nature of the mind. At this point of course is the return to the<br> practice of Mahamudra or Trekcho,<br> and by doing so the appearances dissolve into emptiness.The purpose of<br> these first two meditations is,<br> through the direct experience of emptiness, to purify the habit of the<br> two hells.<br> <br> The second realm, from the bottom up, is the preta or hungry ghost<br> realm. The corresponding meditation<br> concerned with this realm begins by visualizing a red Preh in your<br> lower abdomen that is in the center<br> of your body at the level of the genitals. You think that all of the<br> karma accumulated by yourself and<br> others, through greed and the klesha of greed itself, in short all<br> wrong doings and obscurations that<br> can cause birth as a preta are withdrawn into this red syllable. At<br> that point, it is transformed into<br> the preta realm. You imagine, after being born there, intense<br> suffering of hunger, thirst and craving.<br> You recite the mantra Sarva Pretaka at lease seven times and then<br> again you look at the nature of the<br> mind of the person meditating, the person experiencing, and by doing<br> so the contents of the meditation<br> dissolve into emptiness.<br> <br> The third samsaric realm is the animal realm. For this you visualize a<br> dark red colored syllable at<br> the level of the navel in the center of your body; its a dark red Trih.<br> You think that all of the karma and kleshas that cause the rebirth as<br> an animal, principally the karma<br> and kleshas associated with stupidity and apathy, are drawn into this<br> syllable which is transformed<br> into the habitat or realm of animals. You imagine yourself born in<br> this realm and, as vivid as<br> possible, imagine the suffering you are experiencing being born an<br> animal, such as enslavement and<br> being preyed upon. The suffering that is fundamental to this realm is<br> the suffering of stupidity and<br> the inability to communicate. You recite the mantra Sarva Tiryaka, at<br> least seven times. Then at the<br> end, as before, you look at the nature of the mind of the meditator,<br> the experiencer, causing all the<br> appearances of the meditation to dissolve into emptiness.<br> <br> The fourth realm, the first of the so called fortunate or higher<br> realms, is the human realm. Here you<br> visualize the syllable at the center of the heart and the syllable is<br> Nrih, it is green. Then you<br> think of all of the causes of human rebirth, principally the klesha of<br> desire and the karma<br> accumulated through desire by yourself and others, dissolving into<br> this green syllable which becomes<br> the four continents of the human world. Imagine yourself born there<br> and the sufferings most astigmatic<br> to the human realm are birth, aging, sickness and death. Try to<br> imagine these four as clear as<br> possible. While doing so the mantra that is recited is Sarva Anuse,<br> seven times. Then afterwards you<br> look at the nature of the mind, the meditator, the experiencer, and<br> the appearances dissolve into<br> emptiness.<br> <br> The second of the higher realms and the fifth realm in samsara is the<br> realm of the Asuras or non gods.<br> Here the place is the center of the throat, the syllable is Suh, and<br> it is yellow. You visualize that<br> while thinking that all of the causes of rebirth, principally the<br> klesha of jealousy and the actions<br> motivated by jealousy, are drawn into that syllable which is<br> transformed into the Asura realm. You<br> then imagine you are born in and stuck in this realm and that you are<br> undergoing the suffering of an<br> Asura. Now, because their nature is jealousy, their principal<br> suffering is unsuccessful warfare<br> against the gods and you imagine all the experiences of being killed<br> and wounded. You recite the<br> mantra Sarva Asurra seven times. And then again you look at the nature<br> of the mind, the meditator, the<br> experiencer, and the appearances of the Asura realm dissolves into emptiness.<br> <br> The sixth and highest realm within samsara is the god or deva realm.<br> You visualize the syllable Ah,<br> white in color, inside your head toward the top. Again you think that<br> all of the causes for rebirth in<br> the deva realm are withdrawn into the syllable. Principal among these<br> are the klesha of pride and<br> actions motivated by pride. All of this dissolves into the syllable<br> which is transformed into the god<br> realm, specifically the type of god realm which is called the deva<br> realm of desire. You imagine that<br> you are born in that realm and experience the suffering of a deva.<br> Now, generally speaking, the devas<br> enjoy tremendous pleasure, comfort and prosperity, but since they are<br> still within samsara it ends and<br> when it ends they experience incredible suffering, the suffering of<br> death and downfall. Because the<br> deva realm and life in the deva realm is so pleasant, when they see<br> signs of their impending death,<br> [they do sometimes before it occurs] they suffer terribly because of<br> what they are losing. Now,<br> because of the contrast with the subsequent rebirth, which they can<br> see; so obviously if they know<br> that they are going to be reborn in one of the three lower realms they<br> suffer. But, even if they are<br> going to be reborn as a human or as an Asura, they suffer because of<br> not having control or choice.<br> Think that you are experiencing the suffering of a deva, and repeat<br> the mantra Sarva Deva seven times.<br> And as before, look at the nature of the mind of the meditator, the<br> experiencer, which is the practice<br> of Mahamudra or Trekcho, and the appearance of the meditation of the<br> deva realm dissolves.<br> <br> In that way you eradicate or prevent the birth in and experience of<br> the suffering of the six realms.<br> At the end of all six phases of the meditation you again look at the<br> nature of your mind. The point is<br> to realize that the experience of suffering, such as the individual<br> sufferings of the six realms, the<br> experience of suffering is mind; it is not something other than mind.<br> These sufferings occur, but they<br> occur as manifestations or display of mind and mind is not anything,<br> it is empty of being anything. So<br> by recognizing the emptiness of mind and the emptiness of the<br> experiences of mind, this is an<br> instruction for preventing rebirth in the six realms. This is also<br> referred to closing the door of<br> rebirth in the six types of existence.<br> <br> At this point or phase of the contemplation you recite the six<br> syllable mantra of The Great<br> Perfection, which prevents rebirth in the six realms.<br> AH AH SAH SAH MAH HAH<br> Next, in the same meditation, you visualize the embodiment of the<br> wisdom body speech and mind of all<br> buddhas, as the three syllables in your three places. So, inside your<br> head, you visualize a white Om,<br> inside your throat, a red Ah, and in your heart, a blue Hum. You then<br> think that the blessing and<br> wisdom of the body speech and minds of all the buddhas are drawn into<br> these three syllables. Once<br> these blessing and wisdom of the buddhas are drawn into these<br> syllables, they blaze with wisdom fire,<br> the fire of five colors in each case.<br> <br> Now, previously after visualizing each realm, you looked at the nature<br> of your mind, and the<br> visualization of each realm dissolved, but you didn’t totally get rid<br> of the realms. Here you are<br> going to get rid of them. So you think that the wisdom fire which<br> comes from these three syllable<br> fills your whole body, burning up and away the six realms all at once,<br> and the seeds which cause the<br> rebirth in them. While visualizing that, you recite the mantra OH AH<br> HUM. That’s the samsara part.<br> Now we come to the nirvana part. The nirvana part is the contemplation<br> of the Three Jewels, but<br> starting from the bottom up. So first sangha, the dharma and then the<br> buddha. Now during the previous<br> meditation you visualized yourself in your ordinary form. You are<br> going to change that; first you are<br> going to visualize yourself as the sangha. The supreme member of the<br> Mahayana sangha is the<br> Bodhisattva Maitreya because he is going to be the next buddha. He is<br> the closest member of the sangha<br> to buddhahood. You visualize yourself as Maitreya and while doing so<br> you recite the mantra; NAMO<br> SANGHAYA.<br> <br> Next is the contemplation of the jewel of the dharma. You think that<br> your body, as the Bodhisattva<br> Maitreya, is transformed in an instant into the embodiment of dharma.<br> The realization of dharma is<br> depicted as the female deity. The cause of all awakening, the cause of<br> all buddhahood is the<br> perfection of discernment, Prajnaparamita. Although the perfection of<br> discernment is truly the<br> realization of the nature of all things, because it is the cause of<br> all awakening when it is depicted<br> as a deity, it is called the great mother Prajnaparmita. So you<br> visualize yourself as her because she<br> is the embodiment of all dharma. She is gold in color with four arms<br> and so on. You recite the mantra;<br> NAMO DHARMAYA, three times.<br> <br> Then there is the jewel of the buddha. You think that you, as the form<br> of the great mother, are<br> transformed in an instant into the Buddha Sakayamuni, and visualizing<br> yourself as the buddha you<br> recite the mantra NAMO BUDDHAYA, three times. Then having visualized<br> yourself as the buddha, you<br> visualize yourself as the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. The reason you<br> visualize yourself as Chenrezig<br> at this point is that he is the embodiment of the compassion of all<br> buddhas. So you think that you,<br> the Buddha Sakayamuni, are transformed into the Bodhisattva<br> Avlalokiteshvara, and you visualize<br> yourself as him in the usual manner, white in color with one face and<br> four arms, and you recite the<br> mantra OH MANI PADME HUM, three times.<br> <br> Then in order to reveal or enhance the power of compassion you think<br> that Avalokiteshvara is<br> transformed into his ferocious or wrathful form, Hayagriva. Now<br> Avalokiteshvara has these two aspects<br> because compassion itself is embodied in the peaceful form and the<br> power or effectiveness of<br> compassion is in the wrathful form. So you visualize yourself as<br> Hayagriva, who is red in color and<br> recite the mantra; OM HAYAGRIVA HUM PHAT, three times.<br> <br> Now all of this is basically connected with the purification of the<br> body, and your body is composed of<br> the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and space. Not only your<br> body but all of the external<br> phenomena are composed of the five elements as well. While reflecting<br> that the five elements do not<br> exist independently, that things appear that way as the display of<br> mind, you recite the essence<br> syllable of the five elements; E YAM RAM BAM LAM, three times. E, the<br> essence of space, YAM, the<br> essence of wind or air, RAM, the essence of fire, BAM, the essence of<br> water and LAM, the essence of<br> earth. That section is the purification of body.<br> <br> The second section is the purification of speech. The purification of<br> speech is done through the use<br> of the syllable HUM, by mantra.You sit in the same posture, except<br> that you join the palms of the<br> hands above the top of the head, and you visualize your body as a five<br> prong golden vajra. In the<br> center of the vajra you visualize your mind as a blue HUM, and you<br> think that from the bindu at the<br> top of the HUM lots of blue HUMS emerge and come out of your body, the<br> golden vajra, and fill the<br> entire universe with HUMS. Then you think; they return and come<br> together into one cubic size HUM, in<br> the space in front of you. Then you think from the HUM, in the center<br> of the vajra, which is somewhat<br> identified with your heart, more HUMS come out and this time they fill<br> your body. While doing this<br> recite three long HUMS, and then after that, for the rest of the time<br> you do short HUMS, recited in<br> groups of three.<br> <br> The final part of the preliminaries done after that is called the<br> natural settling of body, speech and<br> mind. So after doing all of these you then rest your mind without any<br> contrivance or artifice in<br> primordial purity, which means you return to the Trekcho or break<br> through practice that you did<br> earlier.<br> <br> The practice of breakthrough or Trekcho is the basis for the teachings<br> and practice of the six lamps,<br> which constitute the path of the leap over. The practice of Togel in<br> itself has two aspects, the<br> preliminaries and the main practice.<br> <br> Now we come to the presentation of the actual practice, which is<br> called the introduction of the six<br> lamps. The use of the term lamp, or torch, connotes or denotes<br> something that dispels darkness. What<br> we are trying to do in our practice is recognize a direct experience<br> of the Dharmata, or nature of all<br> dharmas or things. This is of course the nature of our own mind.<br> Principally we recognize it by<br> looking at our own mind. The first thing you can say about your own<br> mind is that it is emptiness<br> because it is empty of any substantial existence. If that was all the<br> mind was, just emptiness and it<br> was nothing, then we could not call the mind, or the nature of the<br> mind, a lamp. It would not have the<br> capacity to dispel darkness; in fact it would be darkness itself.<br> While your mind’s nature is<br> emptiness, it is not obscurity or darkness, it is illumination. Along<br> with the mind’s emptiness, the<br> other character that defines the mind is cognitive lucidity or<br> awareness. So here the first use of the<br> term lamp is to refer to the nature of your mind, which is like a<br> lamp, in being the unity of<br> cognitive lucidity and emptiness.<br> <br> There are six aspects to this lamp or the illuminating quality of ones<br> basic nature. The first is<br> called the abiding lamp of the ground. This is what was pointed out in<br> the chapter which introduced<br> Mahamudra and Trekcho or breakthrough. Any sentient being by<br> definition has a mind. Any being that has<br> a mind possesses the same fundamental nature. All minds are of the<br> same nature and this nature is<br> emptiness, not obscurity. It is an emptiness that is inseparability<br> from lucidity. This lucidity which<br> is the defining characteristic of a mind, or of cognition, is at the<br> same time the innate ability to<br> achieve the perfect wisdom of buddhahood, the innate ability to<br> realize the nature of all things.<br> Therefore, this lucidity, which characterizes any and all minds, is<br> called Sugatagarba or the seed or<br> nature of those who have gone to bliss. Now the term sugata refers to<br> a buddha and it means those who<br> have gone to bliss, those who no longer are remaining in a state of<br> suffering. When it is said we all<br> possess the basic nature of that, it means we all possess the ability<br> to transcend suffering, the<br> ability to achieve buddahood. So cognitive lucidity in and of itself<br> is the seed of the potential to<br> achieve and the ability to achieve awakening. And this is so because<br> we always have this as our basic<br> nature.<br> <br> The first of the six lamps, the abiding lamp of the ground, is in a<br> sense an explanation or common to<br> Togel and Trekcho. The others are uncommon, in that they are only<br> explained or pointed out in the<br> contents of Togel instruction. Now Dharmata, the nature of things, if<br> you look at it from the point of<br> view of its vastness in scope is literally the nature of all things.<br> Therefore it is all pervasive.<br> But the root of Dharmata is the mind and therefore the primary<br> observation of Dharmata is in one’s own<br> mind.<br> <br> We saw before that the mind has two aspects, what it is or how it<br> really is, and what it appears to be<br> or how it appears. In terms of how the mind appears, the mind appears<br> to reside in the body. The way<br> we experience is our appearing to be a resident of our body. This<br> means that while Dharmata is all<br> pervasive, because it is the nature of mind and because the mind<br> appears to reside within the body,<br> Dharmata is most apparent within your body. Now your mind pervades<br> your whole body, but especially the<br> mind itself.<br> <br> In the primordial wisdom of the sugatas, the principle mind is seated<br> within the heart. Therefore, the<br> second lamp is called the citta flesh lamp. So the heart is the lamp<br> made of flesh or living tissue.<br> The reason for this is that, as we saw earlier, while you are alive<br> the fundamental seat of the eighth<br> consciousness is your heart. Now when you die and your mind leaves<br> your body, that’s a whole different<br> thing. Your body becomes a corpse. But as long as you are alive, your<br> body and mind are<br> interconnected. Therefore, the second lamp is the heart, which is the<br> seat of mind.<br> <br> The third lamp is called the smooth white channel lamp. This is the<br> channel which connects the heart<br> to the eyes. The eyes are the fourth lamp and the third lamp is the<br> channel that connects these two.<br> It is this channel that causes the appearances of Dharmata, seated in<br> the heart to be visible. In<br> order to be visible obviously they have to appear to the eyes and the<br> connection between the heart and<br> eyes is called the smooth white channel lamp. Now it is a channel, but<br> it is a channel that does not<br> contain either blood or lymph. It is empty of everything except wind.<br> For example, in some Dzogchen<br> tantras it says, “It is in the white place of the brain that the<br> appearances arise to the senses.”<br> This refers to the vision of the eyes because this channel passing<br> from the heart, the smooth white<br> channel lamp, passes via or through the brain.<br> <br> The fourth lamp is called the distant lasso water lamp. This refers to<br> something that is in the center<br> of the eyes. Because you can see things that are distant, its called<br> the distant lasso water because<br> of the composition of the eye. It refers, not to the entire eye, but<br> to the sense faculty within the<br> eye that is at the end of the smooth white channel lamp. The smooth<br> white channel lamp starts at the<br> heart and ends at the optic nerve.<br> <br> The fourth lamp is the gate for the appearance of wisdom. The wisdom,<br> in this case, refers to the<br> display of Dharmata and the condition for its appearance is the use of<br> the eyes in a particular way,<br> or gaze, in connection with a source of light. Traditionally the sun<br> is given as the main example but<br> it can also be the light of the moon, an electric light, or a light<br> from a flame. Through the<br> application of gaze you cause to appear to the fourth lamp, or in the<br> fourth lamp, the eyes, a rainbow<br> like light phenomenon. This embodies the purity of the Dharmakaya and<br> the five certainties of the<br> Sambhogakaya, initially appearing as multi colored light and circles<br> of light. The gate for that<br> appearance is the distant lasso water lamp. When you do this and apply<br> the gaze and make use of the<br> four lamps explained thus far, what you will see looks something like<br> the tail of a peacock which<br> contains circles, which are often five different colors; one<br> surrounding another like circular shields<br> used in warfare.<br> <br> What you are seeing with the fourth lamp is the fifth lamp which is<br> called the pure lamp of the<br> expanse. Here it is called the pure lamp of Dharmadhatu. Through the<br> meeting of the fourth and fifth<br> lamps you experience the spontaneous display of the nature of all<br> things. This means that what you are<br> seeing is not a created or composite physical phenomenon. Within the<br> rays of light, which are created<br> by the gaze, you see not only large circles or spheres but lots of<br> minute or little ones, like a net<br> of pearls or little drops like fish eyes, and sometimes they appear in<br> moving patterns of lattice<br> networks. That aspect of what you are seeing is the appearance of the<br> unceasing activity of<br> Nirmanakaya. What you experience is called the display of the Trikaya<br> in the form of rainbow lights;<br> they are the unlimited display of the same nature; the Dharmata. What<br> you are seeing are the three<br> kayas as the unified appearances. Know that they appear in different<br> ways; know that in reality the<br> different modes of appearances of the three embodiments are in essence<br> indivisible from reality<br> itself.<br> <br> The way you do this is by using a light source and in this text the<br> example used is the sun. Usually<br> you use the sun as soon as it has arisen or as it sets. But, whenever<br> you do it, it has to be done in<br> a certain way for this to work and for it to be safe.<br> <br> First thing, you do not look at the sun. You are not trying to get the<br> direct light of the sun into<br> your eyes. Nor do you look at the rays of the sun in the usual sense,<br> as the sun has rays coming out<br> of it. What you do is look one cubit below the sun, some distance from<br> it, and you cause the<br> appearance of rays by squinting. By closing your eyes half way you<br> adjust them exactly as to how much<br> you close them, to what or how much you need to, in order to generate<br> the appearance of rays. When<br> this happens, one of the things that occurs is you cause the<br> appearance of refractions of the light,<br> so that it appears in different colors. The squinting of the eyes<br> causes the rays of light to appear<br> like aligned weapons, like parallel spears, which seem like a downpour<br> of weapons shooting into<br> oneself at your heart.<br> <br> This one aspect of this training, and one benefit of this, is that you<br> prepare yourself for the<br> appearances of the bardo. Because, in the bardo after death the light<br> of wisdom appears in part as<br> brilliant rays of light that you perceive as threatening, as weapons,<br> as something that you have to be<br> afraid of. So one thing you are doing in this practice is learning to<br> recognize such phenomena as your<br> own display and not as something coming from outside yourself.<br> <br> When you do this you see five colors of light. The five colors of<br> light are considered the display of<br> emptiness. The reason that you see the five colors is because in the<br> impure context or form, we<br> experience the five poisons, attachment, aversion, pride, jealously<br> and apathy. If they are recognized<br> in their pure nature, these are the five wisdoms, which are<br> inseparable from the five buddhas. In the<br> impure context we experience the five aggregates, form, sensation,<br> perception, mental formation and<br> consciousness. In the pure form they are the five buddhas; Varochana,<br> Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava,<br> Amitabha and Amoghasiddhi. In the impure contents we experience the<br> five elements. Blue light is the<br> element of space, white light of water, yellow light of earth, red<br> light of fire and green light of<br> air. In their pure form they are the five female buddhas. The dark<br> blue light is Akasadhatvisvari; the<br> white light is Buddhalocana; the yellow light is Mamaki; the red light<br> is Pandaravasini and the green<br> light is Samayatara.<br> <br> The five colors of light are the five families in nature, white sugata<br> family; blue vajra family;<br> yellow ratna family; red padma; and green karma. But if they are<br> unrecognized, they are the five winds<br> which give rise to the five physical elements. Again, if unrecognized,<br> they are the five directions;<br> the center, south, west, east and north. If their nature is recognized<br> they are the five pure realms.<br> If unrecognized they are the five maras; the mara of the lord of<br> death, means everyone is subject to<br> death which of course interrupts their practice. The mara of the<br> aggregates refers to the physical<br> body, encased in this material human body subject to its changes. The<br> klesha mara or mara of<br> disturbing emotions is to be caught up in these emotions, as all<br> sentient beings are. The mara of the<br> child of the gods is the demon of seduction. It is our inner voice<br> that whispers to oneself and gives<br> wrong advice, such as, there is something more interesting than<br> practicing. Do it later, tomorrow,<br> next week or next month. If recognized they are the five wrathful<br> deities, vajra heruka, ratna heruka,<br> and so forth.<br> <br> The technique just presented using the creation of appearances of rays<br> from a light source, such as<br> the sun, is called the ‘introduction to rays.’ The appearances are<br> classified as light rays and sound.<br> Another instruction that is given is called the ‘introduction to<br> squeezing the oceans.’ The word<br> ‘oceans’ is referring to the eyes and this is the technique where you<br> squeeze or press on your eyes<br> with your fingers, and by doing so you see light. The light that you<br> see is said to be the display of<br> the wisdom light of the peaceful deities in your heart. In order to<br> see this particular light you have<br> to squeeze quite hard. So don’t do it for very long.<br> <br> The third one which is connected to sound is called ‘the introduction<br> to the waves of the ocean.’ This<br> one, with your fingers, you block the ears by pressing on them. First<br> very indistinct and then<br> progressively louder and louder, you hear a hum or humming, that is<br> said to be the nature sound of<br> Dharmata.Now the point of all these techniques is to use the<br> appearance as a means for realizing the<br> nature itself, or Dharmata. You can also do this by remaining in<br> complete darkness. Generally speaking<br> the techniques that use light are called instructions or guidance in<br> brightness and the ones that<br> depend on darkness are called the instruction in darkness.<br> <br> These appearances can arise through meditation practice using these<br> techniques or they also happen<br> after you die in the bardo. When these appearances arise in the bardo<br> they constitute the sixth lamp,<br> which is called the ‘bardo lamp of time.’ Although in the bardo the<br> appearances of light and sound are<br> far more intense then what you experience through practice in this<br> life. Nevertheless, through<br> familiarization with this phenomenon in this life in practice, you<br> gain the ability not to be<br> intimidated by these appearances through your recognition of them as<br> empty display.<br> <br> Now the part of the bardo or the phase of the bardo, in which these<br> things appear, is called the<br> ‘bardo of Dharmata.’ When you are dying, what is called the life wind<br> is gradually weakening. Now, it<br> is the life wind that keeps you alive, and the life wind also keeps<br> the white element, which you have<br> inherited from your father in place at the top of your body; and the<br> red element that you have<br> inherited from your mother in place in the lower abdomen. As the life<br> wind becomes weaker and<br> weakening, these two start to move. It is as though the wind has a<br> pressure that keeps these elements<br> in place. As the life wind starts to become more and more impaired the<br> white element, inherited from<br> your father, descends from the top of your head downward through your<br> body, you experience an all<br> encompassing whiteness. As the red element inherited from your mother<br> begins to move upward from the<br> lower abdomen, you experience an all encompassing redness. When the<br> life wind is no longer<br> functioning, then these two elements meet at the heart and encapsulate<br> the seed of the mind within the<br> heart causing an experience of all encompassing blackness, or darkness.<br> <br> Immediately after that there is an experience of emptiness, an<br> experience of the nature of all things,<br> just as it is, without any other appearances or other factors<br> interfering with it. That initial<br> experience of emptiness and what happens immediately after that, is<br> called the ‘bardo Dharmata,’<br> because it is the display or experience of the nature of things itself.<br> <br> If you have become familiar with the nature of things through<br> meditation, in the preceding life, then<br> there will be no difference between the Dharmata that you have<br> experience and the Dharmata that<br> presents itself to you at that point and being able to recognize the<br> present Dharmata. Because of your<br> experience with it in practice is called the ‘meeting of the mother<br> and child Dharmatas.’ The mother<br> is what arises for everyone, and the child is what you have cultivated<br> and familiarized in practice.<br> So in that way through practice you are able to recognize the nature,<br> then you remain in that<br> recognition in the state of samadhi for sometime. If you do not<br> recognize it, then that brief glimpse<br> of emptiness ceases and you start to see the appearances of the clear<br> light such as the peaceful and<br> wrathful deities, lights and sounds and so on. It is at that point<br> that familiarity with these,<br> through meditating on the lights, circles and the forms of deities<br> will be of benefit.<br> <br> In Trekcho and essence Mahamudra the main point is to be able to rest<br> in and sustain the continuity of<br> the view. When practicing Togel while maintaining the view, one uses<br> whatever manifests as an<br> adornment in the sense of acknowledging that all the different<br> experiences are actually the display or<br> manifestation of innate wakefulness.<br> <br> If you have the habit of meditating on this aspect of The Great<br> Perfection, then you can achieve<br> liberation at that point in the bardo. So therefore, at this point,<br> Karma Chagmey Rinpoche says, “In<br> order to prepare for that aspect of the after death experience, you<br> should regularly gaze at light in<br> this way.” He also says, “If you do this assiduously you will see<br> truly wondrous things.” He cautions<br> us at this point. He says, “Make no mistake what you are seeing when<br> you do this authentically is not<br> like looking at a rainbow that appears in the sky. It is not external<br> light in that way, because it is<br> the spontaneous display of the five families. Therefore, when you see<br> these five color rays of light,<br> it is no different from seeing the five Buddhas themselves.” He<br> concludes, “If you have purified karma<br> you will actually see the forms of deities, peaceful deities like<br> Avalokiteshvara, Amitabha and Guru<br> Rinpoche, wrathful deities, like Hayagriva, and so on.”<br> <br> The practice, of course, consists of the common preliminaries, the<br> four thoughts, the uncommon preliminaries, the practice of generation<br> and completion of Mahamudra and the Dzogchen practices of Trekcho and<br> Togel. So at this point he presents a way to apply these as an on<br> going practice. First of all, whatever you practice you must insure<br> that you don’t do it for your own benefit alone. At the beginning of<br> any session of practice clarify concisely your motivation for doing<br> it. Recollect that there are innumerable beings who are suffering<br> intensely, who lack the happiness that they seek. So resolve that<br> whatever practice that you do, whatever virtuous actions that you<br> perform will be done for their benefit. In that way, before the<br> session begins, generate bodhicitta. Then at the beginning of the<br> session briefly recollect in sequence the four thoughts which turns<br> the mind and then briefly meditate in sequence on the uncommon<br> preliminaries; each of the four or five, if refuge and bodhicitta are<br> considered separate uncommon preliminaries. For the main practice<br> visualize yourself as Chenrezig, as instructed in the text, and<br> visualize the Buddha Amitabha present above your head as the lord of<br> your family. Then think that Amitabha is the embodiment of all the<br> root and lineage gurus and in order to reinforce that thought, invite<br> all the root and lineage gurus, including all of the siddhas of India<br> and Tibet, and cause them to dissolve into Amitabha. Next invite all<br> of the yidams which you are connected with, such as Vajrasattva,<br> whomever, invite all of them and dissolve them into yourself as<br> Chenrezig.<br> <br> Then visualize the seed syllable HRIH in your heart and the six<br> syllable mantra OM MANI PADME HUNG surrounding it. Reflect upon the<br> fact that the mantra is the essence mantra of all yidams without<br> exception. Now the reason for this recollection of Amitabha as the<br> embodiment of all gurus and Chenrezig as the embodiment of all yidams,<br> and his mantra as the embodiment of all essence mantras, is so while<br> doing this one practice you can be simultaneously accomplishing all<br> gurus, all yidams, and all mantras. Think that rays of light from the<br> syllable HRIH and its surrounding mantra in your heart emerge filling<br> the entire universe which is transformed into the realm of Sukhavati.<br> These rays of light also strike all beings, transforming each and<br> every one of them into the bodhisattva Chenrezig, resting in the<br> attitude that the entire universe is Sukhavati, and all beings within<br> it are Chenrezig. It is the maintenance of the first of what are<br> called the three barings, and this is the baring or outlook of all<br> appearances as the body or presence of the deity.<br> <br> After that commence the repetition of the mantra OM MANI PADME HUNG,<br> and while you recite it, think that simultaneously all beings in the<br> form of Chenrezig recite the mantra along with you. Contemplating<br> that, while reciting the mantra, is the practice of the second baring<br> or outlook, which is the attitude that all sound is the speech or<br> mantra of the deity. The particular value of this is that by<br> contemplating, without distraction, that all beings without exception<br> recite the mantra along with you, every single mantra that you recite<br> is the equivalent of billions of mantras. After the recitation, then<br> look at your mind and whatever thoughts arise, good or bad, simply<br> look at them without distraction and without any attempt to alter<br> them. Practicing that is the third baring, the attitude that all<br> thoughts and memories are the mind or wisdom of the deity. In that<br> way, you practice what is called the three fold baring.<br> <br> The third part of the three fold baring is the outlook that all<br> thoughts and recollections are the mind of the deity includes the<br> practice of Mahamudra and the Trekcho aspect of the practice of the<br> Great Perfection. In that way, the practice of the three fold baring,<br> appearances as the deity’s presence, sound as the deity’s speech or<br> mantra and thoughts and recollections as the deity’s mind or wisdom,<br> includes the practice of the generation stage, the completion stage<br> and their unity. As to how to perform these, you can practice all<br> three barings simultaneously. In that way, you have one simple<br> practice which includes all the essential points. But if that is<br> difficult, you can also practice them in sequence as they were<br> explained here.<br> <br> Now in addition to this Chagmey Rinpoche says: “At sunrise and sunset<br> or if you don’t use the sun, when you have access to a suitable<br> electric light or candle, do the Togel practice of gazing at the rays<br> and when you first arise in the morning and the last thing before you<br> go to sleep at night practice Tonglen, taking and sending. This is the<br> taking of the suffering of others and the giving to them of your<br> happiness, in coordination with the breathing. Finally, just before<br> you go to sleep, dedicate all of the virtue you have accumulated<br> during that day to the awakening of all beings with the aspiration<br> that all beings achieve buddhahood without impediment as quickly as<br> possible. In addition, from time to time, make the aspiration to be<br> reborn in the pure realm of Sukhavati. If you practice all of this in<br> a relatively simple and concise format you have a complete practice of<br> dharma.<br> <br> The ideal dedication is one which you are free of the idea that the<br> dedication exists, the dedicated virtue exists and the recipient of<br> the dedication exists. But you might ask, how do you do this? The best<br> way is to rest in the state of practice without straying and remain<br> looking at the nature of your own mind, without straying from that<br> recognition, dedicate the virtue to all beings.<br> <br> Every time you practice, every time you contemplate these things and<br> every time you listen to them, seeds or habits are imprinted in you<br> all-basis consciousness, habits of generation stage practice,<br> completion stage practice, Mahamudra, and so on. So you are very<br> fortunate to have exposure to these things, to practice these things,<br> to gain experience of these things. Recollecting that even when it<br> becomes difficult, maintain an attitude of confidence, enthusiasm and<br> devotion. In short practice as much as you can.</p></div>
