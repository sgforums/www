              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Dasho Karma Ura is the president of the Centre for Bhutan Studies
              and Gross National Happiness (GNH) Research. This think tank is not merely a
              cloistered university institution; it advises the Bhutanese government on
              public policy with a view to resolving social problems. On a recent visit to
              Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, American author Eric Weiner, who has written
              extensively on the pursuit of happiness and spirituality in general, “found
              himself sitting across” from Karma Ura and sharing with him the story of a
              mysterious panic attack Weiner had recently experienced, despite his impression
              that life was generally going well. Karma Ura’s advice: to think about death
              for five minutes every day. (BBC)</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">So how might Karma Ura’s advice help Weiner, and prevent his panic
              attacks from recurring? Bhutan is primarily a Buddhist country: according to
              the Washington, DC-based Pew Research Center, in 2010, 74.9 per cent of the
              population identified as Buddhist. In Buddhism, meditation on death is a common
              practice: believing in reincarnation (at least traditionally), we are taught to
              cherish this human life and use it well, in the knowledge that in the next life
              our experience will likely be very different. But assuming that Weiner was not
              a practicing Buddhist, why would Karma Ura have offered this advice? Indeed,
              “But why would I want to think about something so depressing?” was Weiner’s
              reply.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">In fact, the answer lies therein.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">For most of us, death is something we greatly fear—probably more
              so than anything else. In the West, talking about death is traditionally taboo,
              and even the idea of thinking about it can appear off-putting. If we do
              contemplate it without aversion, however, we will soon realize that death is
              the only certainty in life. Karma Ura attributed Weiner’s panic attack, occurring
              in the midst of a seemingly happy life, to this fear: “It is this thing, this
              fear of death, this fear of dying before we have accomplished what we want or
              seen our children grow. This is what is troubling you,” he told Weiner. (BBC)</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">In developing countries, a fair number of which have substantial
              Buddhist populations, death is more widely accepted as an everyday reality. As
              Karma Ura pointed out: “Rich people in the West, they have not touched dead
              bodies, fresh wounds, rotten things. This is a problem. This is the human
              condition. We have to be ready for the moment we cease to exist.” (BBC)</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">In Bhutan, where the Buddhist tradition practiced is that of
              Vajrayana, reminders of death are everywhere in its religious imagery. Deities
              appear in wrathful as well as peaceful forms, dressed in ornaments made of
              human bone and severed heads; skull drums, skull cups, and thigh-bone trumpets
              are a part of its rituals. “Unlike many of us in the West, the Bhutanese don’t
              sequester death,” remarked Weiner. (BBC) There are also the Cham
              dances—attracting big crowds, including families with children—which often
              depict the intermediate state that follows death and the passage of the dead
              into the next life.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Contemplation on death and impermanence is also one of what are
              often known as “The Four Thoughts that Change the Mind,” or the Outer
              Preliminary Practices of Vajrayana Buddhism. In fact all four are interrelated:
              we consider the difficulty of finding a precious human rebirth, and its
              freedoms and advantages; the defects of samsara; and karma, or the law of cause
              and effect. Reflecting on these daily, our mind becomes fertile ground for
              practice, and we will not waste any time.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Meditating on death and impermanence, we confront the certainty of
              death and its potential imminence—maybe even before we take our next breath. We
              become aware that at the time of death, only the Dharma can help us—not our
              friends or connections, our material wealth, or even our own body. As the great
              Nyingma lama Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche said: “If we really meditate on
              impermanence, it is said that in the beginning it can be the cause of us
              practicing the Dharma, in the middle it can provide the conditions for us
              progressing along the path, and at the end it can cause us to achieve the result
              of complete and perfect awakening. So impermanence is of the utmost
              importance.” (Rigpa Shedra)</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Being aware, and certain, that we will die, we can prepare by
              undertaking practices to avoid rebirth in samsara, such as</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>phowa</span></em><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">(the transference of
              consciousness at the moment of death). Other advanced practices enable us to
              attain liberation during the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>bardos</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">,
              or transitions, subsequent to the process of dying, and even to direct our
              consciousness into a new birth for the benefit of others.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">As we become more familiar with the certainty of death and the
              process of dying, fear loses its grip. Of course, not all of us are Buddhists,
              and we may not believe in rebirth or reincarnation, but becoming more aware of
              dying and death can still help us to appreciate this life all the more. “My
              religion is to live—and die—without regret,” said the Tibetan poet-yogi
              Milarepa (secularbuddhism), yet so many die wishing they had done things
              differently. According to the website secular buddhism, the top five regrets of
              the dying are: 1) I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not
              the life others expected of me; 2) I wish I hadn’t worked so hard; 3) I wish
              I’d had the courage to express my feelings; 4) I wish I had stayed in touch
              with my friends; and 5) I wish that I had let myself be happier.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Being intimately aware of the certainty of death can help us avoid
              such pitfalls and the pain of regret that accompanies them. We will also become
              more content with what we have while we’re here and perhaps less greedy for more.
              And knowing we will one day have to part from friends and family, our
              attachments—and therefore our grasping—will loosen and we will allow things to
              change, as they inevitably will. Of course, being less attached does not mean
              we stop caring. On the contrary, our preparedness for death helps to ensure
              that we do our best for those we love. We will be sure to make a will, and
              perhaps leave instructions for our end-of-life care in the form of an advance
              directive, or a letter to our doctor and loved ones about what matters most to
              us as we approach our death.*</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Spending time with the dying can be a wonderful and compassionate
              way to prepare for death. At The Harley School in Rochester, New York, high
              school seniors have the option of taking a class called “hospice,” in which
              they learn to care for the dying. “They all come in afraid,” says their
              teacher, Bob Kane. (mindful) He asks them why they want to take the class, and
              about their experience with death. Recalling that first day, Alejandra Biaggi,
              18, shares: “Some of us were tearing up. My grandfather died last summer, and
              talking about it was such a release. Nowadays death is so taboo.” Through
              working in the hospice, however, it’s now a subject they are much more
              comfortable with: “Death is just a part of life,” Alejandra concludes. For
              Carolyn Rumrill, 18, the course has helped her to see the “big picture,” and
              she feels she is now less self-centered. A candle is lit before every class—a
              reminder that life is as fragile as the flickering flame.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Death is something that comes to us all, whether Buddhist or not.
              If we, as a society, learn to recognize and accept this reality into our daily
              lives without aversion, we might be well on the way to breaking the death taboo
              and making our lives more meaningful.</span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
