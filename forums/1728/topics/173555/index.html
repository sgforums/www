Why should they give up what they built up themselves and give it up with two hands to the Communists?

            <div class='col-md body'>Again I am not siding any political parties here, but when I went to China to visit the Buddhist mountains with my dharma teacher and other practitioners from my dharma centre, we noticed that the government has laxed on religious restrictions. Religions are definitely recovering under the Communist rule, the era of Cultural revolution is long over.<br><br>During our visit, Jiang Zemin visited Jiu Hua Shan (mountain of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva), some of us saw him. We had to change hotel the day before because Jiang Zemin occupied the entire hotel we were supposed to go. Many many bodyguards etc - the bodyguards asked the hotel people to close their windows but we refused and if not wrong someone even shouted back to greet Jiang Zemin so the bodyguards had no choice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But anyway we spoke to the abbot of the Jiu Hua Shan, who has in turn spoken to Jiang Zemin before we visited him, said that Mr Jiang is quite supportive of the Buddhist developments and he is hopeful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not side any political systems.<br><br>I definitely do not support the kind of communism practised during Mao's and Soviet era, or the North Korean kind.<br><br>But Communism in China is no longer communism that we commonly know. The current political system in China may still be the best and only stable and workable system in China. Democracy does not work for every nation, sometimes it may only bring more chaos. But for more developed and stable countries I think it is good.<br><br>Buddha's idea of 'classlessness' is definitely not Communism. It refers to having no discriminate distinctions of the Caste system in Hinduism. But not taking away wealthy people's hard work to make it 'fair'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, Buddha was definitely an expounder of meritocracy. Therefore we shall strive to seek spiritual progress and also achieve our goals in life with zeal and commitment.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2a.htm</a><br><br><strong>Seize The Day</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Noble Eight-fold Path[1] taught by Buddha, the Right Action[1] advocates practitioners of Buddhism to pursue all that are virtuous with zeal and a commitment to progress. Such should be the correct attitude whether in our career or in pursuit of the ultimate truth. The following short story may help to illustrate Buddha's teaching more clearly.</span><br><br>Early one morning Buddha and one of his chief disciples, Ananda, set out from Jetavana to seek alms. They came to the city of Sravasti. As they entered the city gate and were walking along a path by the city wall, they saw an aged couple.<br><br>Their backs were crooked and they could neither straighten themselves nor move about. They were dressed in rags, appearing unhygienic and well worn with age: frail, toothless, grey hair, hard of hearing and poor eyesight. They lived next to a pile of rubbish by the derelict wall of a sleazy alley. They crouched close to each other, facing a small fire for warmth. With eyes only for each other, they resembled a pair of old swans that cannot bear to part.<br><br>The Buddha turned his head and asked Ananda, "Did you see that aged couple by the wall and the warmth of the burning cow dung?"<br><br>Ananda replied, "World Honoured One, I see them."<br><br>The Buddha continued, "If this old couple had been determined and diligent when they were young and strong, regardless of the nature of their work as long as it is legitimate, perhaps at this age they are already amongst the wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. On the other hand, if they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Arhat [2] by now.<br><br>Even if they were not that determined when they were young, but are ambitious and diligent only at a later age and they work with the Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the second wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. Similarly, if on the other hand, they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Anagami [2].<br><br>Worse still, should they only realise about diligence and progress when they are already at their middle age, and only then began to work with the Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the third wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. If they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the Sakrdagamin [2].<br><br>However, they did none of the above. Instead, they spent their life times loving and possessing each other, and wasted the most useful time of their lives. That is why today they are helpless and have no way out of their predicament. They live in poor conditions, are penniless and there is nothing that they can do. For them it is a living death, having to face the retribution of their own doing, and nobody took any pity on them. What meaning is there in a life like this?"<br><br>In order to encourage people not to fall into the same predicament, the Buddha said, "Ananda, always remember to advise and guide people:<br><br>In youth, be determined, diligent, and thrifty and strive to acquire knowledge.<br><br>Maintain a mind that is distant and unchained from desire and be focused on building a career during the prime of life.<br><br>In middle age, realise a stable career that is based on diligence, zeal, progress and Right Action.<br><br>Always use the wealth meaningfully to benefit self and others.<br><br>Do not wait till old age and rely on the people's benevolence like the aged swan."<br><br>The above incident demonstrates the compassion of the Buddha in caring for sentient beings and encouraging people to be determined in striving for progress, regardless of whether one is concerned with building a career, or one who has renounced the worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path. His only wish was for all sentient beings to be distant from suffering and attain happiness in life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes:<br>[1] Noble Eight-fold Path:<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not right to say that Taiwan economy advancement is solely by the people of taiwan. When Kuo Min Tang retreat to Taiwan, they not only brought  tons of gold bar that KMT collected from the entire china back to taiwan, but also experts and elite groups in various industry. KMT was once the richest political party in the world before the japan spy Lee Teng Hui became KMT president and brainwash the taiwanese.<br><br>Of course, everyone has right to decide the citizenship they want to have. For example, if you want to migrate from singapore to australia, simply fill up the form, follow the legal way and disappear. But if you want to bring a piece of land at singapore and transfer the territory to another country, the police will go after you. Same will happen to Chen Shui Bian who threaten to bomb 3 gorgeous damp, if his terrorists gang managed to do that, he will be hanged for sure then followed by sufferings in hell.<br><br>Well, everybody talk about democracy, communism also talk about democracy, just that their definition is without public election. I personally also support voting, especially in a modern society like in singapore. But not all province and rural area in china is ready for that. Not even Hong Kong is ready for public election. Have British colonist ever give Hong Kong people power to vote throught out their colonisation period? No, they never. Only when Hong Kong is to be return, then they start to talk about election, this is "smart".<br>I want to remind those colonist-to-be, history has showed that when china is in chaos, the whole world is in chaos, when china is strong, the whole world will be peace.</div>
