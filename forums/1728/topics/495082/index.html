              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The fate of the Buddha’s begging bowl</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">November 17, 2017, Bhante Dhammika The Island</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One of the most revered relics in the ancient Buddhist world
              was the Buddha’s begging bowl. A rough outline of its long convoluted history
              is this – it was supposedly given to the people of Vesali by the Buddha when he
              passed through the city on his way to Kusinara. In the 1st/2nd century King
              Kanishka took it to Pushapura, now Peshawar, where a string of Chinese pilgrims
              reported seeing it between the 3rd and the 9th centuries. The importance of the
              bowl is attested by numerous depictions of it in Gandhara art, usually shown on
              the pedestal of Buddha statues. During the Islamic period it was taken from one
              palace or mosque to another until at a date unknown it ended up in Sultan Way’s
              Baba’s shrine on the outskirts of Kandahar Afghanistan. Several British
              officers report seeing it there in the 19th century, one attempting to
              translate the inscription on it, and another, Alexander Cunningham, trying to
              trace its history, a fact I mention in my Middle Land Middle Way (1992, p.136).
              In the late 1980s during Afghanistan’s civil war President Najibullah had the
              bowl taken to Kabul’s National Museum. When the Taliban came to power, their
              Minister of Culture ordered all Buddhist artefacts in the museum smashed
              although the bowl remained undamaged, no doubt because of the Quranic verses
              inscribed on its outer surface. Today it can still be seen in the museum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The bowl is not small. It is a stone hemispherical vessel of
              greenish-grey granite with a diameter of about 1.75 meters, a height of about
              three ¾ of a meter, and a thickness of about 18 cm at its rim, rather thicker
              elsewhere particularly at its middle and the base. It has no cracks or
              abrasions, except for a portion about the size of the palm of one’s hand that
              has flaked away from near the rim. There is a delicate lotus petal design
              chiselled around its base, attesting to its Buddhist past, and inscribed in
              beautiful large calligraphic script horizontally along the rim of the bowl, are
              six rows of verses from the Quran, reflecting its Islamic continuum and its
              status through the ages as an object of special religious interest. Traces of
              similar calligraphic script are visible on the surface on the inner side of the
              bowl. The bowl is about 350 to 400 kg in weigh, far too heavy to lift.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This bowl was probably an early larger copy of the Buddha’s
              actual bowl placed in a monastery in Vesali for people to offer their first
              fruits in, a custom common in ancient India and which survived even in Sri
              Lanka and elsewhere up to the 19th century. The bowl’s great size may well have
              encouraged the acceptance of the widespread belief amongst ancient Buddhists
              that the Buddha was 18 feet tall. Only someone that big could have used or even
              lifted a bowl this size.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is interesting to keep in mind that Sri Lanka claimed to
              have the Buddha’s begging bowl, although any legend of how it got to the island
              has not been preserved. This Sri Lankan relic is mentioned several times in the
              Culavamsa as being as precious and holy as the Tooth Relic. The chronical tells
              us for instance, that when King Manabharana moved from Rohana to Polonnaruva he
              brought the Tooth Relic and the Bowl Relic with him. It also gives us a
              description of an elaborate ceremony during the reign of Parakramabahu I in
              which the two relics were drawn through the streets of the capital in a wheeled
              pavilion made of gold. Sometime after the fall of Polonnaruva the Bowl Relic
              disappeared and was forgotten</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I am writing about the Buddha’s begging bowl because after
              being in obscurity for so long it recently hit the headlines in India when it
              was mentioned in the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament. I reproduce below from the
              Ministry of External Affairs website. "MP Dr. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh
              asked; ‘Will the Minister of External Affairs be pleased to state: (a) whether
              the Government has recently got the information that the begging bowl of
              Buddha, given to the people of Vesali by him, has been found in the Kabul
              museum; (b) if so, the details thereof; (c) whether the Indian Embassy in
              Afghanistan has sent a photo of the said bowl to the Government; (d) if so, the
              details thereof; (e) whether the Government has initiated the process to
              recover the said bowl; (f) if so, the details thereof; (g) whether the
              travelogues of the Chinese pilgrim Faxian and the writings of Dr. Cunningham
              and Shri S.V. Sahni mention the said bowl; and (h) if so, the details
              thereof?’."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Minister Prenteet Kaur in reply answered; "The
              Embassy of India, Kabul has made enquiries in the matter. It is learnt that the
              item purported to be Lord Buddha’s begging bowl was apparently in Kandahar
              until the regime of former President Najibullah. It was later brought to Kabul
              and is currently in the Kabul Museum. It has been pointed out that the begging
              bowl, a photo of which our Embassy has obtained, is rather large, besides
              having inscription in Arabic and Persian, thus calling into question its
              provenance. The Archaeological Survey of India has been requested to convey any
              information or advice it may have regarding the provenance of the bowl
              currently in Kabul Museum."</span></p>
