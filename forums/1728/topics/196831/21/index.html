            <div class='col-md body'>To justdoit 77, this just reminds me...<br><br>A guru has once said in his book " People occasionally come to me wanting to abandon their worldly lives in order to pursue meditation full time. They wonder if this is the "spiritual" thing to do. I tell them that what makes our life spirtual or worldy is not our vocation but our view.<br><br>Actually i feel, cultivating is a 24 hour a day practise. For a layman like me whom hasn't been cultivating much should practise maybe for every ten minutes in my life to cultivate. It does not matter u got engage in forum or skype.. it is about the spirit of practism.. my 2 cents of opinion lah...<br><br></div>

Like a unhealthly fear, it distorts the way we see things as it really is. Yes there is a possibility that things might turn out this way and NOT this way. So what is the percentage of things turn out there way? Well, we cannot predict what future will brings us lah but what we can do now is the sow the right seeds for future good harvest.<br><br>Btw, do u believe in Karma?<br><br>Karma is a worldly truth that anyone can see- the process of things coming together and having a particular repercussion. For example, the moon shines oan a lake, causing a reflection. Or sunlight hits a magnifying glass, creating fire. We see someone else eating ice cream and suddenly, we want ice-cream too. Events occur, and as a result, a third event takes place. The moon reflection doesn't exist independently but, like magic, arises from a gathering of causes and conditions. In Buddhism, we talk about karma in terms of how it lays the ground for us to move from lifetime to lifetime. Even if we don't believe in lifetimes, we can look at karma as how we move from past to present to future.<br><br>Like gravity, karma is so basic that we don't often even notice it. But karma is happening everywhere. Whatever, we see is a meeting of interdependent causes and conditions- not a snapshot but a moving picture. If we walk now the street, we are dependent on the ground being there, on having a good health, on having a mind that can make our body move, and on having the time to walk and a place to walk to. Those are all dependently related.<br><br>Karma sometimes manifest very directly. We eat a meal and we feel full. We<br>turn the key and the car starts. A more subtle interconnectedness has to do with our thoughs, actions and words. 2 little words, and we are married to somebody. We never know at exactly what moment one action or word is going to trigger another, but everythings we do sets something else in motion.<br><br>Whether or not we think about the law of karma- whether or not we even know it exists- it is always in effect. It governs every corner of our being. Karma cannot be deceived. It keeps unfolding. It is painfully democratic. Whether we are rulers or subjects or pedestrians, there is no difference. We cannot opt out of it. There is no time out in life.<br><br>Whatever we do lays a seed will grow. Every thought that occurs, especially if we water with intention, plants a seed. The karmic seed we plant might rest in the depth of our mindstream for ten billion lifetimes waiting for the necessary conditons to occur, but once they do, it will ripen. If i am feeling really upset, thinking " I am going to do something about this", i am planting the seed of a rebirth into a realm of irritation. As long as i water that seed, i am creating an environment in which it is harder for seeds of love to grow. By the same token, if i water seeds of love, anger will have fewer opportunities to ripen...<br><br>Taken from " ruling the world" by Sakyong Mipham.<br><br>ok after typing so much things.. all i want to say is respect karma as we know that every decision that we make has repercussion... which will lead to happiness when we make the right choices.<br><br>The only problem is discernment. Do we have the wisdom to discern the decision? Read up on there book. It is quite a cool book.</div>
