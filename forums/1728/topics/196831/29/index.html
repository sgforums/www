There is one more copy left there. Really good translation.. I am re-reading it from the beginning, now at page 35.<br><br>Apart from that, I also purchased 'The Sutra of Hui-Neng: Grand Master of Zen' translation by Thomas Cleary, $20 ($22.20 without membership) from Evergreen Buddhist Cultural Service, also containing Hui-neng's Commentary on the Diamond Sutra (this is the main factor why I bought this book as I can't find the commentary's translation on the net)<br><br>Initially I also wanted to buy the 'Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma' translated by Red Pine, however, I realised that the translation can be found on the net (here: <a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/THE%20ZEN%20TEACHINGS%20OF%20BODHIDHARMA.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/THE%20ZEN%20TEACHINGS%20OF%20BODHIDHARMA.htm</a>)<br><br>I have also ordered a book (out of stock) called 'The Crystal and the Way of Light' by Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, this is a Dzogchen book and is not found in my 'Ren Cheng Pu Sa Dao', I ordered it due to my interest to find out more about the Dzogchen teachings.<br><br>Apart from that, I have not purchased the translations of the other contents of Ren Cheng Pu Sa Dao, as their translations can already be found on the net (such as the <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/heartsutra.htm" rel="nofollow">Heart Sutra</a> which the words are already quite simple in Chinese, <a href="http://www.prajna.nl/teksten/onderricht/soetras/complete/" rel="nofollow">The Sutra of Complete Enlightenment</a>, <a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/Hui-Hai/The%20Zen%20Teaching%20of%20Instantaneous%20Awakening/The%20Zen%20Teaching%20of%20Instantaneous%20Awakening-%20Teachings%20of%20H.htm" rel="nofollow">Ch'an Master Hui Hua's The Zen Teaching of Instantaneous Awakening</a>)<br><br>However, I am unable to find the English translation for the Buddhapitakaduhsilanirgraha Sutra (Fo2 Zhang4 Jing1), and so I'll just stay put with the Chinese version found in my Ren Cheng Pu Sa Dao.

It could be earthquake, tsunami, virus outbreak etc.<br><br>Or there will not be eventually ... who really know ?<br><br>Venerable Mahinda didn't predict the current earthquake. He did advise us to work hard in purifying bad karma and be vigilance in case of any crisis.. learning first aid skills are life skill.. practical and realistic. He did give us a realistic view that natural disaster is increasing 4folds.<br><br>Nevertheless, pls ignore this if you don't believe in it.<br><br>Cheers..<br><br></div>
