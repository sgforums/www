            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, I will be leaving for China between 24/12/06 to 2/1/07. I will be leaving in a early morning flight. I will be going to several places like Jiu Zhai Gou, Chengdu, and surrounding places, even Mt Emei (Pu Sien Pu Sa's mountain). That will be third pilgrimage mountain I have visited! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (I have previously visited Jiu Hua Shan and Pu Tuo Shan, which are the mountains of Ksitigarbha-Di Zhang Wang and Avalokitesvara-Guan Shi Yin respectively, you can find the photos in this topic)<br><br>I will share some photos when I am back. Hopefully in between this period of time, there is no arguments, no troubles, just peaceful discussions. I also hope more people can participate in the discussions or debates when I am not around.
