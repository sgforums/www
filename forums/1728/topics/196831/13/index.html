I visited in winter and Jiu Zhai Gou is very deserted in winter due to cold weather. There was no precipitation/snow over the past 2 weeks before we came, so there was little snow on the ground, otherwise the entire place would be covered white. But as you can see even the lake is becoming frozen... night time temperatures drop to about -12 degrees. But still, it is not as cold as we thought.. we have not much problems with the cold.<br><br>But if you come in spring, it is a totally different picture -- the place is totally crowded and in some places you have to squeeze your way through. About 200000 tourists visit that area each year.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Kyusaiko.jpg"><br><br>It is getting increasingly popular as in recent years, China tourism board is trying to promote Sichuan tourism and includes places like Jiu Zhai Gou. Jiu Zhai Gou got its name from the past where there are 9 Tibetan villages.. so known as 'jiu zhai'.<br><br>The next place they are going to develop tourism is in Tibet, which will start from next year. Why? Because next year onwards they complete their railway stretching all the way from Beijing to Tibet. The whole China is linked by this train system. You can take a ride in the train from Chengdu to Tibet, it will only take 2 days. I am interested to visit Tibet some time in the future.<br><br>Back to Jiu Zhai Gou. The other thing is Jiu Zhai Gou is a natural reserve, they only limit certain tourist spots for people to visit, and it is kept very clean and unpolluted (i.e you cannot smoke there). It is free of the heavy pollution from the major cities in the same province like Chengdu. The hotel we stayed in was also wonderful, it is 5 stars but also known as a 6 star hotel. Best hotel in the entire trip.<br><br>There are two ways you can get to Jiu Zhai Gou.. first, you arrive in Chengdu airport, you take a transit, domestic flight from Chengdu to the airport at Jiu Zhai Gou.<br><br><img src="http://xs511.xs.to/xs511/07023/DSC00311.JPG"><br><img src="http://xs511.xs.to/xs511/07023/DSC00318.JPG"><br><img src="http://xs511.xs.to/xs511/07023/DSC00328.JPG"><br><br>As you can see... even the flight itself one is able to enjoy very nice sceneries.. We have to fly to 3000+m altitude (highest point was 4700m+, Huang Long, but was closed during late winter so we didn't have the chance to visit... heard it was very very nice), up to the Tibetan plateau. (P.s if you have no or little body symptoms staying at that level of altitude it probably means you will have no problems going to Tibet in the future... and I think it should not be a problem for me)<br><br>The other way up JiuZhaiGou is to ride a bus all the way up... but this can be very tiring and can take an entire day. One has to travel through lots of mountain and winding roads all the way from Chengdu to JiuZhaiGou. We took an airplane up to Jiu Zhai Gou, but our return journey is through bus. In this way, we will not miss both the sceneries from the airplane as well as the sceneries you will catch through the bus ride.. and not waste so much time and energy in taking the bus ride twice.<br><br>I have only posted a few pictures of Jiu Zhai Gou above.. but we actually visited lots and lots of sites that are just as beautiful. Very nice place.. some famous movies/shows (i.e ba sien guo hai etc) I can't remember which shows.. are actually taken there.<br><br><blockquote>btw nice scenario.. </blockquote>You mean.. sceneries  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Yup it is truly beautiful.</div>

The personality that has a past and a future momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious presence, very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever response is needed then arises out of that state of consciousness.<br><br>The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them into the Now - that intensely alive state that is free of time, free of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping away from the present moment even for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to depend on a particular activity to be in that state. But you don' t need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter that state now.</span><br><br>~ The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle</div>
