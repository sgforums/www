But since now most of the Ren Cheng students have received dharma transmissions by my Master's dharma successor, Missionary Chen Ming An, we have decided to mass publish the book for our students. Costed $60 per book.<br><br>It has really interesting stuff... many Great Buddhist sutras, commentary by 6th Patriarch Hui Neng on Diamond Sutra, and many of the old Chan/Zen masters' conversations and talks, those by 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng, Zen Master Huang Po, 1st Zen Patriarch Bodhidharma, Zen Master Hui Hua.<br><br>It has lots of high level dharma teachings in there... and topics like non-duality is elaborated quite a lot inside. Really good stuff.<br><br>This is only the first series. It is really an interesting read... I'm quite excited about it and after my exams will take time to read it... the only bad thing is the book is in traditional Chinese, but the great thing is that my mom agreed to translate them to simplified Chinese for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://xs318.xs.to/xs318/07316/RC1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://xs318.xs.to/xs318/07316/RC2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://xs218.xs.to/xs218/07316/RC3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://xs218.xs.to/xs218/07316/RC4.jpg"></div>
