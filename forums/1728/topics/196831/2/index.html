            <div class='col-md body'>From my understanding and from discussion with mystical friends, the linear chakra formation of Hinduism (Kundalini) is incomplete. The complete energy circuit of our subtle body are close loops which is described in Taoism qi-gong as... microscopic orbit (xiao zhou tian) and macroscopic orbit( da zhou tian). People has postulated that doing the Hindu kundalini practice can cause problems...because of the incomplete linear energy flow...causing energy to get accumulated and stuck at the end points.<br><br>my 2 cents.</div>
