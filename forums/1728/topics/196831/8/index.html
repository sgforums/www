Then... funny, I suddenly remembered something I saw yesterday and I woke up.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Good sons, this 'ignorance' actually lacks substance. It is like a man who is dreaming. At the time of the dream, there is no non-existence. But when he awakens he finds that there is nothing for him to hold on to. Similarly, when the sky-flowers disappear from the sky, you cannot say that there is a definite point of their disappearance. Why? Because there is no point from which they arose. All sentient beings falsely perceive arising and ceasing within the unarisen. Therefore they say that there is 'transmigration through life-and-death.' "<br><br>"Good sons, in the practice of Perfect Enlightenment of the causal stage of the Tathāgata one understands these 'sky-flowers,' thus there is no transmigration, nor body/mind to undergo life-and-death. But they are not caused to be non-existent. It is because they lack original nature. Now, this [prior] awareness is in itself void, like empty space. Yet since this awareness that perceives it to be like empty space is none other than the appearance of sky-flowers, you also cannot say that there is no nature of awareness. Existence and non- existence both being dispelled is called 'according with pure enlightenment.' "<br><br>"Why? Because its nature is completely empty; because it is eternally changeless; because there is neither arising nor ceasing within the matrix of the Tathāgata, and because there are no fixed points of view. Like the nature of the reality-realm it is totally complete and perfect, pervading the ten directions. Therefore it is called the 'reality-practice of the causal stage.' Bodhisattvas, relying upon it arouse their pure mind within the Mahayana. Sentient beings of the degenerate age who practice relying on this will not fall into erroneous views."</span><br><br>Somehow when I remembered seeing this last night (bohiruci posted it), I knew it was an illusion and stopped attending to the story and just woke up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Emptiness alone, only and all, with an edge of extremely faint yet luminous bliss. That is how the subtle feels when it emerges from the causal. So it was early this morning. As the gross body then emerges from this subtle luminous bliss it's hard to tell, at first, exactly where its boundaries are. You have a body, you know that, but the body seems like the entire material universe. Then the bedroom solidifies, and slowly, very slowly, your awareness accepts the conventions of the gross realm, which dictate that <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> body is <span style="font-style: italic;">inside</span> this room. And so it is. And so you get up. And so goes involution, yet again.<br><br>But the Emptiness remains, always.<br><br>~ Ken Wilber</div>

It presents an opportunity for each Vipassana meditator to earn merits by participating in a historic structure that will serve as the beacon of Dhamma for centuries to come - The Global Pagoda project on the Essel Plateau in Gorai in Mumbai. The construction of the first stage including the foundation was completed last year. Work on the crucial second stage is progressing at full speed and is expected to finish within months.<br><br>The great monument will have a huge meditation hall and a display gallery giving information about the life and the teaching of the Buddha. In external appearance, it will resemble the ShweDagon Pagoda of Myanmar (Burma).<br><br>In addition to its functional utility, the Global Pagoda will be an expression of our gratitude: towards the Buddha, towards the chain of teachers who preserved the Dhamma in its pristine purity, towards the country of Myanmar, and towards Sayagyi U Ba Khin.<br><br>It is Acharya Shri Goenkaji's wish that every meditator takes part in the construction of the Pagoda.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just now I went to meditate... I was very tired today and when I am tired, I enter into a dream like state and starts "dreaming" (although not completely asleep), slowly losing awareness of my surroundings, like falling asleep. Initially I try to maintain a 'witnessing' even though the dreams are going on, it worked well at first, but eventually, I lost it. Then I sort of 'woke up' and thought... since I can't really put a stop to the 'dream'.. maybe I should try something else... since visual images pops up in my mind.. I must as well use it...<br><br>And then I did a visualisation meditation of dissolving into light (details I will not describe here) and merging with the Buddhas.... it worked quite well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I wonder if anyone has such experiences...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some meditation advises which I found useful, by Dharma Dan:<br><br><blockquote>If you can perceive one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity that binds you on the wheel of suffering shatters. In short, when doing insight practices, constantly work to perceive sensations arise and pass as quickly and accurately as you possibly can. With the spirit of a racecar driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and still stay on the track, you are strongly advised to stay on the cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations quickly and accurately.<br><br>------------<br><br>These meditation objects and postures are not that important, but understanding impermanence directly is.<br><br>--------------<br><br>I sometimes meditate when reclining before sleep, when reclining in the morning<br>before I have to get up, when I wake up in the middle of the night, before catnaps on the couch, during boring lectures and meetings, and in the lounge of the school I attend before afternoon classes. I have come to the conclusion that five minutes of really engaged, clear and focused practice in poor circumstances can often produce more benefits for me than an hour of poor, vague and distracted practice in Â“optimal conditions.Â”</blockquote><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, Adobe/.pdf version</a>, by Arhat, <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">Dharma Dan</a></div>
