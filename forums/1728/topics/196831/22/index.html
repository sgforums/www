            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">There is a subtle difference in the mental state btw worrying and finding a constructive solution for the problem.  A mind that worries too much saps energy and does not solve the problem right? Quit worrying by busying urself to pre-occupy the mind from being discursive ( that is thinking too much and lead to speculation.)<br><br>An ancient advice: If you can do about it, do it but if you don't, accept it. Sometime, acceptance of the evitable brings inner peace and strength.<br>Btw, problems are impermanet. Every minute and even second, we can turn things around by what we do now. So don't give up in whatever u are facing now.<br><br>We can also change our perspective by don't see it as a problem and it couldn't be a problem! Like what u says, don't worry.. shrug the problem and happy go lucky attitude lor.<br><br>When we are not too attached to a "me" plan, we find much more lasting peace/happiness.<br><br>Do u think worry is a delusion/ignorance in life too? Like a unhealthly fear, it distorts the way we see things as it really is. Yes there is a possibility that things might turn out this way and NOT this way. So what is the percentage of things turn out there way? Well, we cannot predict what future will brings us lah but what we can do now is the sow the right seeds for future good harvest.<br><br>Btw, do u believe in Karma?<br><br>Karma is a worldly truth that anyone can see- the process of things coming together and having a particular repercussion. For example, the moon shines oan a lake, causing a reflection. Or sunlight hits a magnifying glass, creating fire. We see someone else eating ice cream and suddenly, we want ice-cream too. Events occur, and as a result, a third event takes place. The moon reflection doesn't exist independently but, like magic, arises from a gathering of causes and conditions. In Buddhism, we talk about karma in terms of how it lays the ground for us to move from lifetime to lifetime. Even if we don't believe in lifetimes, we can look at karma as how we move from past to present to future.<br><br>Like gravity, karma is so basic that we don't often even notice it. But karma is happening everywhere. Whatever, we see is a meeting of interdependent causes and conditions- not a snapshot but a moving picture. If we walk now the street, we are dependent on the ground being there, on having a good health, on having a mind that can make our body move, and on having the time to walk and a place to walk to. Those are all dependently related.<br><br>Karma sometimes manifest very directly. We eat a meal and we feel full. We<br>turn the key and the car starts. A more subtle interconnectedness has to do with our thoughs, actions and words. 2 little words, and we are married to somebody. We never know at exactly what moment one action or word is going to trigger another, but everythings we do sets something else in motion.<br><br>Whether or not we think about the law of karma- whether or not we even know it exists- it is always in effect. It governs every corner of our being. Karma cannot be deceived. It keeps unfolding. It is painfully democratic. Whether we are rulers or subjects or pedestrians, there is no difference. We cannot opt out of it. There is no time out in life.<br><br>Whatever we do lays a seed will grow. Every thought that occurs, especially if we water with intention, plants a seed. The karmic seed we plant might rest in the depth of our mindstream for ten billion lifetimes waiting for the necessary conditons to occur, but once they do, it will ripen. If i am feeling really upset, thinking " I am going to do something about this", i am planting the seed of a rebirth into a realm of irritation. As long as i water that seed, i am creating an environment in which it is harder for seeds of love to grow. By the same token, if i water seeds of love, anger will have fewer opportunities to ripen...<br><br>Taken from " ruling the world" by Sakyong Mipham.<br><br>ok after typing so much things.. all i want to say is respect karma as we know that every decision that we make has repercussion... which will lead to happiness when we make the right choices.<br><br>The only problem is discernment. Do we have the wisdom to discern the decision? Read up on there book. It is quite a cool book. </div></blockquote>so how come you have so many problems to share on AA</div>

If not, i will not be quoting there huge chunk from an enlightened guru. There are chapters in there book that teaches how but ultimately, it depends on ourselves and our realisation in what the book says.<br><br>Sometime, the mind get so tangled and clouded with negative emotion that we can't think accurately of the situation. Sometime, u need a third party to analysis for u.<br><br>"Every minute in my life, i can turn things around by what i can do now." Whenever i am feeling down, this quote always shakes me up and remind me not to stay fix with a problem. it is quite dharma right? Nothing is permanent.<br><br>eh why not? Eric.. it is my life.. u don't own me... i am not saying i have no problems in life.. however, i can say that i worry too but i don't let these sorts of things plague me like i used to. I have developed inner confidence in dealing some problems as i grow older. There is a difference.<br><br></div>
