              Buddhism Changed His Career</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">21 Apr 2017 Corey Barnett
              World Religion News </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ever
              since his speech against the occupation of Tibet during the ’93 Oscars, the
              actor has seen a downward spiral in his popularity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Once
              one of the most sought after and loved actors in Hollywood, Richard Gere’s open
              opposition to the Chinese occupation of Tibet has created a rift between him
              and Hollywood directors, due to China’s financing of Hollywood films. Chinese
              authorities have imposed a life-long ban on him from entering the nation. Now
              that the superpower has become a huge market for Hollywood, it is only natural
              that for Hollywood to shy away from him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gere’s
              interest in Buddhism, however, is neither new nor young. He was interested in
              Tibetan Buddhism since his early 20s, and has been devoted to the Dalai Lama
              ever since and considers the Dalai Lama to be his teacher and guru. His devotion
              to Buddhism followed him into his life as a celebrity, and today, he is a
              full-fledged practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              downward spiral began after a speech he made in 1993 during the Oscars. Instead
              of sticking to what he was supposed to have said, Gere launched a full-fledged
              verbal attack on the Chinese government, decrying the country’s lack of human
              rights, and its inhuman and unfair occupation of Tibet. Ever since then, he
              steadily became an enemy of China, and eventually, lost popularity with
              Hollywood as well. In fact, Gere reveals that directors have been very open
              about the reason they either rejected him for their movies or canceled their
              contract with him – disfavor with China. This fear of China is so high, he
              adds, that even directors are afraid to cast him. “If I had worked with this
              director, he, his family would never have been allowed to leave the country
              ever again, and he would never work,” he told Vanity Fair.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gere
              has not backed down from his open attacks on China, despite how it has affected
              his career. In 2008, for example, he spoke in favor of boycotting the Beijing
              Olympics in a show of solidarity with Tibet. He is not afraid of the
              consequences because according to experts, he has enough power, money, and
              freedom to be unaffected by the lack of movie offers from Hollywood.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gere
              firmly believes that the reason for his drop in popularity in Hollywood is
              solely because of his outspokenness about Tibet and friendship with his
              teacher, the Dalai Lama. Gere even visited the Dalai Lama recently for a
              religious Buddhist ceremony that the Tibetan Buddhist leader was conducting in
              India, giving fresh impetus to speculations that he is greatly devoted to the
              leader.</span></p>
