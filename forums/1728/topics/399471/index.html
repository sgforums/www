              Found this article which I think is well written. Thusness thinks it is very good and told me to post this in our blog as it is very important.

                  <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-823" title="huang" src="http://zenhsin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/huang.jpg" alt="huang" width="330" height="459"><br> <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br> <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Most Zen masters. 
                      the ancient as well as the present, are quite reluctant to describe or 
                      explain the experience of awakening (satori in Japanese, wu in Chinese) 
                      since explanations may create clinging to images and words of what a 
                      satori is, hence being a barrier to enlightenment. Moreover explanations
                       and analysis won’t give the slightest insight into how a satori is 
                      experienced since it is beyond words.<br> </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">However they are 
                      some concepts, stanzas and poems which give at least some indications of
                       what kind of nature the satori experience has.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">The Japanese Zen
                       master Bassui Tokusho, whose teachings are not only exceptional pure 
                      and deep but actually among the best explanatory Zen teachings due to 
                      his eloquent and poetic style has a somewhat clear description of what 
                      the experience of a satori is.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Normally, 
                      explaining Zen always somehow destroys the no-meaning of Zen, but Bassui
                       really tackles the difficult task of conveying insight into the corners
                       of satori via his exegesis. In some ways he resembles Zen master 
                      Hui-neng as regards clarity and simplicity but combines the clarity of 
                      Hui-neng with a living and poetic style of teaching.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Bassui also 
                      demonstrates how Zen masters consequently modify more or less 
                      philosophical Mahayana doctrines into pure phenomenology, that is to 
                      say, into the concept of Mind. Bassui transforms the philosophical 
                      notion of the “supernatural powers of the Buddha” into a Zen description
                       of the illumination of satori, since the core of Zen is the Trikaya, 
                      intuitive knowledge or Mind not ideas of external of powers.<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">A formidable 
                      mondo from Joshu points to Zen’s rejection of external, idealistic 
                      doctrines about supernatural powers; it goes like this:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">A 
                      monk asked, “T ‘a-erh San-tsang (Daiji Sanzo) tried to find the Natural 
                      Teacher three times, but couldn’t see him. It is not clear to me, where 
                      was the Natural Teacher?”</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">The
                       master said, “In Sang-tsang’s nose”</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Note</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><em>T ‘a-erh 
                      San-tsang was a monk who had  come from India and was proficient in the 
                      three classes of scriptures (San-tsang) and reputed to have the power to
                       read minds. Though he went to visit Nan-yang Hui-chung (Nanyo Echo), 
                      the National Teacher, he couldn’t penetrate his mind.</em><br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Comment</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">A person 
                      penetrating the mind of another is of cause an impossibility. The idea 
                      goes totally against Zen since it is a dual construction.There are no 
                      individual minds in Zen, hence it is not possible for San-tsang to carry
                       out this mind-reading. Nan-yang Hui-chung however, knows how to do it 
                      since he knows that his own original mind is the same as the original 
                      mind of San-tsang because there is only One Mind.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">To understand 
                      the logic of the “Mind reading” of the National Teacher one must 
                      recognize (realize) what Mind is:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">1. First one has
                       to grasp what emptiness is. It is not “emptiness”. True emptiness is 
                      not an idea but “not a thing”. This is demonstrated by the Zen masters 
                      through for instance twisting the nose of a monk. This is <em>realizing</em> emptiness, not talking about it, since there is nothing between the 
                      master and the monk.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">2. This “not a 
                      thing” between the master and the monk conveys a  directly experience of
                        what-is, namely the nose as <em>form</em>, not as a nose.  This is <em>realizing </em>what-is since the nose is what-is in the moment. The nose is thus 
                      realized intuitively not talked about.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">3. The pain of 
                      the nose is the function of the nose. The nose is realized through its 
                      function. This is realization of flow or change. The main point is that 
                      realizing the nose is realizing its “aliveness”, that is, its pain, its 
                      smelling ability, its joy, its dissatisfaction, its expectations etc. 
                      This is <em>realizing </em>the Mind of the nose and hence one’s OWN 
                      mind.<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Thus realizing 
                      emptiness, form and function of what-is in a flash is satori since it is
                       beyond words. It is:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Earth,
                       mountains, rivers – hidden in this nothingness.<br> In this nothingness – earth, mountains, rivers revealed.<br> Spring flowers, winter snows:<br> There’s no being or non-being, nor denial itself.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><em>- Saisho 
                      (circa 1490) Zen Poetry: Let the Spring Breeze Enter, p.32 Translated by
                       Lucien Stryk and Takashi Ikemoto</em><br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Note on 
                      the Poem<br> </strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">L1. emptiness<br> L2.form<br> L.3 function<br> L.4.satori</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">What Joshu 
                      points to is that since we all share this Mind, having realized one’s 
                      nose is the realization of any other nose. The National Teacher is “In 
                      Sang-tsang’s nose” because he knows the Mind of Sang-tsang.  Neither  
                      Sang-tsang nor the National Teachers have supernatural powers. What they
                       have is the illuminating Buddha-mind but only the National Teacher 
                      knows it. He is the true “mind-reader”.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Dogen is eminent
                       as a interpreter of awakening, since he is incredible gifted both as a 
                      Zen master but also as a poet. All his poems are Mind-poems which, 
                      through his use of the Zen concept of differentiation (wu-shieh in 
                      Chinese), convey pointers to enlightenment. Many see Dogen as a 
                      philosopher but he is actually not a philosopher, he is a One-Vehicle 
                      Dharma teacher and poet pointing to the One Mind. Not a word of Dogen is
                       outside Mind, since he is a Zen Buddhist and his writings aim at 
                      strengthening our intuition not our concepts as he formulates it here:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">When
                       you investigate the flowing of a handful of water and the non-flowing 
                      of it, full mastery of all things is immediately present.<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">What Dogen says 
                      is actually a pointer to satori since he points to the Nirmanakaya 
                      (flowing) within the Dharmakaya (non-flowing) and the energy or 
                      spirituality within this moving/not-moving. This within-ness, is the 
                      Sambogakaya, the creative potential, which awakens water either to flow 
                      or not to flow.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">It is also 
                      expressed here in this little mondo:<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">A 
                      monk asked, “What is the phrase that penetrates the dharmakaya?”<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Yuanmi
                       said, “A three-foot staff stirs the Yellow River”.<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Realizing such 
                      Buddha-functions intuitively is awakening to not only what one’s own 
                      Mind “is” but to the Mind of everything since there is only one Mind. 
                      There is no difference between these natural functions and human 
                      thoughts, hence the word Mind. An experience of such a personal and 
                      environmental unity is satori.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">As for useful 
                      concepts underpinning a more systematic interpretation of satori, there 
                      is Buddha-mind as defined by the Trikaya. Satori is actually a <em>realization</em> of Buddha-mind/Trikaya, hence it is possible to systematize the 
                      experience which may convey a better grasp of the nature of 
                      enlightenment. The Sixth Patriarch Hui-neng is very clear on what the 
                      basis of a satori is. It is first and foremost universal all-including 
                      knowledge:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">“The
                       knowledge like a mirror is purity of nature (the Dharmakaya,emptiness)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">The
                       knowledge of essential quality is mind without sickness (Sambogakaya, 
                      mind-essence)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">The
                       subtle observing knowledge sees without effort (Prajna wisdom, no 
                      relativity)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">The
                       knowledge of practicalities is the same as the mirror (the Nirmanakaya,
                       change, function)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Five
                       and eight, six and seven, transform in effect and cause (relativity, 
                      conditioning, precepts)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">If
                       you just use names and words, there’s no reality: (names, words create 
                      illusions)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">If
                       you do not keep feelings on the transformation. (detachment)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">You’ll
                       flourish and be ever in the dragon stability” (satori)<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">I have used the 
                      above verse of Hui-neng to systematize the Dogen poems and the short 
                      satori descriptions by Bassui to give an oversight and insight of a 
                      satori:</span></p>

                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">To grasp what 
                      satori means we must see all phenomena as the Trikaya, that is, with our
                       intuitive mind. We must see the emptiness of the phenomena, the 
                      spirituality and the manifestation of change. Seeing these three aspects
                       as one in suchness, in a flash, is experiencing or rather uniting with 
                      the universal reality which is our own Mind.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">A satori mirrors
                       that Mind is the world and the world is Mind. Hence, birds flying are 
                      your own thoughts flying, the vast forest is your own empty sitting, the
                       cry of the heron is your own voice. The storm arising is your own 
                      walking, the disappearance of the clouds are your own forgotten 
                      thoughts. We are not independent from what-is. We are no more than 
                      momentary what-is of emptiness, change and intuitive (spiritual) energy.
                       One could say we are situations reflecting all other situations in the 
                      universe, different yet the same.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Dogen says:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Mountains
                       do not lack the qualities of mountains. Therefore they always abide in 
                      ease and always walk. You should examine in detail this quality of the 
                      mountains walking. Mountains’ walking is just like human walking.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Comment</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Mountains 
                      walking and human walking are the same since walking is the Nirmanakaya 
                      body of Buddha (change, flow). Mountains always move (walk) due to the 
                      perpetual creation of reality which is the Nirmanakaya.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">For Zen, Mind is
                       one. There is no “holy Mind” or “secular Mind”. In a way we all make 
                      use of Buddha-mind in our daily lives, because we don’t analyze or 
                      interpret our thoughts and doings, we act naturally by using our 
                      intuition or Mind. The everyday is in a way full of small awakenings 
                      apart from we don’t notice it, hence Zen’s view of the importance of 
                      “everyday life” which are seen as the first step towards enlightenment. 
                      The only difference between the every day Mind and the Satori mind is 
                      actually the depth of non-verbal awareness as expressed by Bankei:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">“If
                       a gong rings outside the temple, you know it’s a gong, if a drum 
                      sounds, you know it’s a drum. Your distinguishing everything you see and
                       hear like this, without producing a single thought is the marvelously 
                      illuminating dynamic function, the Buddha Mind is unborn.”</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">The beauty of 
                      Zen is it’s systematic teaching and practice  of UNIVERSAL INTUITION. 
                      Other forms of Buddhism too easily lead us away from wordless intuitive 
                      understanding due to the emphasis on  sutra reading. Reality seems cut 
                      off when one attains a Buddhist world view constructed by doctrines. 
                      Buddhism becomes reality, not what it points to namely Buddha-Mind. As 
                      formulated below by Japanese Poet and Zen master Ikkyu:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Studying
                       texts and stiff meditation can make<br> you loose your Original Mind.<br> A solitary tune by a fisherman, though, can be<br> an invaluable treasure.<br> Dusk rain on the river, the moon peeking in<br> and out of the clouds;<br> Elegant beyond words, he chants his  songs<br> night after night.<br> </span></p>

                      mondo where inside the room is the study of scripture, far away from 
                      what-is; a small world of abstractions.</span></p>

                      monk asked Xuefeng, “Is the teaching of our ancestors the same as the

                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; color: green; font-size: 12pt;">Xuefeng
                       said, “The thunder sounds and the earth shakes. Inside the room nothing
                       is heard.”</span></p>

                      for me, a bit puzzling how simple Zen actually is and how complicated we
                       tend to grasp it. In reality there are only three aspects that must be 
                      grasped to get hold on the innocent beauty of Zen:</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">1. Emptiness<br> 2. Realization<br> 3.appearance<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">That’s it. One 
                      can nearly <em>see</em> the core:<br> </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Forms appear 
                      from emptiness through realization/spirituality and manifest their 
                      Buddha-nature in suchness. The empty flower knows when and how to 
                      realize and manifest itself when spring arrives. So grasping the pain of
                       the nose is grasping what-is.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Zen is 
                      all-including simplicity with just three Trikaya aspects that is, the 
                      body of Buddha. If Zen didn’t had this simplicity, knowing by intuition 
                      would be impossible. This all-including approach actually generates Zen 
                      phrases very easily. Here are some <em>heuretic</em> examples.( I’m not 
                      trying to be a poet)</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">The pain of the 
                      nose, are the songs of the birds, the sound of the pines and the walking
                       of the mountains.(the function of Buddha).</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Sitting is the 
                      empty sky, the stillness of the forest and the quite bird.( the 
                      emptiness of Buddha)</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">The mountain 
                      dances, the river sings and the pines bow, the clouds are painting the 
                      vast sky. (the bliss of Buddha, joyful energy)</span></p>
