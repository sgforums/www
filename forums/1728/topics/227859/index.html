            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Well I think many of the young generations are beginning to have their doubts on Buddhism than the older generations irregardless the highly educated or illiterate ones. Why so? From time to time, this is a question mark in my head. The only answer I can find, All these are happening due to misinterpretation or mis-representation of what should be the teaching of True Buddhism.<br><br>I liken this World as a Big Ocean with many fishes. In this Big Ocean, there are many kinds of fishes &amp; other living creatures. One good example &amp; specie will be the "Rough Eye Rockfish", who live much longer than humans. In Alaska, they have been known to reach the ripe old age of 205 years. This longevity is so rare in the animal kingdom that makes them a "centenarian species" which none is comparable to them. To be able to distinguish a True "Rough Eye Rockfish" is as difficult as "Finding a needle in the sea" for most of the people. Seeing it, Even putting a name to a face isn't as easy as it seems. Just distinguishing 30 of the 100 rockfish species found around the world which is the True "Rough Eye Rockfish" is not really possible to the Mass Public. Why so? Well its because many of these fish look alike. Recognition of Which is the Truth is often muddled by Illusion created by some. All I can say "Rockfish: More Than Meets The Eye".<br><br>I feel this is the most appropriate analogy to be shared in here. This will let others have a chance to think &amp; ponder on What is the Truth? Back to the Main Topic in here, In short Buddhism is a Religion for more than 2,500 years, many factions or school of thoughts of Buddhism has been surfaced over time. However not all really are following the Teachings of the Buddha which is True Buddhism. I shall not go into the details on the Teachings of the Buddha which cannot be explained in mere words. In laymen terms, True Buddhism is based on certain core teachings which are "Unique" &amp; none can be comparable to it. Just like only a True  "Rough Eye Rockfish" possess such longevity which many sub-species tried to imitate "Externally" however they can never be on par in term of life span no matter how similar they in their outlook. In term of Buddhism, Many who seemingly "Preach" to be that of a True Buddhist are not really so, beneath their so called Buddhist Way may be "More Than Meets The Eye". So we come to the point of What is "Orthodox Buddhism" &amp; What is "NOT"? Well many of the younger generations are misled due to External Influences or Warped Teachings planted by Others into their mind with material stuffs behind a Faux smokescreen. I would like to bring your attention to these REAL HAPPENINGS that are going on not only in HERE but in this SOCIETY we are in. What is the TRUTH seems to be in a Fog created by Others. there is no transparency or simply can longer be seen. We do not only see things with our Eyes, we need to see things with our Heart. Do not attempt to cover the TRUTH with a SHAM. This only mark down to INTERGRITY of One is seriously of Doubts. At times the TRUTH hurts when it come to light but not matter how dark it is, Darkness can never cover the LIGHT of TRUTH. It takes a Great Man to be able to admit their faults. The sad irony is that although such facts are too obvious to be ignored by even the most ignorant, they continue to be ignored by the most intelligent. Why? Simply because it is convenient for many to invest in false hopes or promises rather than expose the futility of failure. Instead of admitting the obvious, they chose to invest in false hopes or promises of Salvation by UNORTHODOX Teachings which is not TRUE BUDDHISM. If you pronounce you lead a life of a True Buddhist, it must not only be in your Words but your Actions. Your Words &amp; Actions must be Coherent. Do not preach something You do not even apply in your Actions or daily lives. That is an Illusion, A Web of Deceit you spin not only for yourself but Others. Remember its YOUR OWN DOINGS, only yourself is ANSWERABLE to your OWN ACTIONS. Buddha is Omnipresent. No matter what lies or deceits, it can never cover the TRUTH, not all are blind. If Blind Lead Blind, all will fall in the Ditch.<br><br>Personally I do not see myself as a True Buddhist although I do apply certain Buddhist Teachings in my daily life. I am here to share &amp; learn, Great Wisdom is Boundless &amp; never selfish. Only Flawed Human Natures are, Imperfection can be a beauty if we are able to accept &amp; admit our Flaws. Attempting to cover Flaws with Deceit is Despicable. It does great harm not only to yourself but Others who placed their trust in you. Sins or Karma is highly subjective. Good or Bad its yours to take, only you, yourself know.<br><br>Last but not least, these are my personal views in my own words which I am sharing in here. Pardon my poor writing, forgive my long passages. With so much on-going happenings, I feel a need to address these to fellow Dharma Brothers &amp; Sisters not only in here but all. Many may start to think &amp; ponder more perhaps. Maybe its time to educate not only the younger generation but all on the True Teachings of Buddha. Just like a glass of Pure Juice, as you add more water to it, it becomes diluted. Diluted is still fine, you may not get the Pure thing but the core is still there just you are getting less of the REAL THING. What can be worse when you put in other additives like liquor, it can look the same but it can never taste or work the same? Its worse than most Venomous Poison. Perhaps its the doing what we call "Three Poison" in Buddhism.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no such thing as True or Fake Buddhism at the summit or the epic center of Buddhism. You will recognise it when you have reached it. Those that have gone before can only guide you as you make the journey.<br><br>It is your own journey. It is your own effort. Nobody can take credit when you have reached the destination.<br><br>If it were possible for an external source to bring you into the epic center, many more would be there. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the perspective of whether you are looking from the outside or you are looking in, the journey is your own.<br><br>The good thing about this then is that, unlike dogmatic religions, you can actually reach the destination through guidance from an internet forum. You see, it is your own effort and not somebody's teaching. (There is a duality here. It is 100% effort and 0% effort. That is not important. For now you have to take it as 100% effort.)<br><br>Since it is your own effort, what would be the problem if you received "bad" guidance? Whatever "guidance" you received has to pass through you. It is your effort, it is your journey. You have to work it out for yourself what is "good" and what is "bad" anyway.<br><br>You have to test it. You have to taste it. The "bad" teaching can open your eyes to what is bad and that is as important as knowing what good is; if you are to reach the epic center.<br><br>It then follows that there is no "fake" Buddhism at all. That which is fake will teach you what "fake is" and that which is "true" you cannot accept anyway unless you yourself know it to be true after you have tested it and tasted it.</div>

Unfortunately, the authentic Buddha's education is rare nowadays, and difficult to encounter.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The second type of Buddhism is the religious Buddhism</span>. Originally, Buddhism was not a religion, but now it has become one. We can no longer deny that there is a 'Buddhist religion' because everywhere we look, Buddhism is displayed as a religion. Unlike the monasteries in the past which held eight-hour classes per day and provided another eight hours for self-cultivation, today's Buddhist 'temples' no longer uphold such a perseverance of the Buddha's Teachings. Today we mainly see people offering to the Buddha statues and praying for blessings and fortune. In this way, Buddhism has been wrongly changed into a religion. (However time has changed many have buck up and start to spread dharma)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>The third type of Buddhism is the <span style="color: darkred;">philosophical study of the Buddha's teachings.</span> Many universities today open courses on the study of Buddhist Sutras, considering the teachings as a philosophy. The content of the Buddha's education is actually a complete university of knowledge and wisdom. Philosophy is only one of its courses. Just as it is wrong to recognize an university as a single course, it is also inappropriate to think of and limit the Buddha's education as only a philosophy. The Buddha's education can help us resolve our problems - from family difficulties to the great issue of life and death. <span style="color: darkred;">The Buddha's teachings are deep and vast, and teach us the truths of life and the universe. It should not be mistaken as only a philosophy.  </span><br><br>The fourth type of Buddhism we see in our world today is the <strong>deviant and externalist Buddhism.</strong> This is an <strong>extremely unfortunate affair which only came to be in the past 30-40 years. </strong>We must know that the religious <strong>Buddhism persuades people to be decent, and the philosophical Buddhism pursues truth, neither cause much harm to the society</strong>. <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">If Buddhism is changed into a deviant and externalist path, using the weakness of the human nature to cheat and harm living beings; disturbing the peace and safety of the society, then this conversion of Buddhism has gone too far.</span> </span>The speech and actions of these deviant and externalist paths can be very attractive and enticing. One should be very careful as not to be mislead by these deviant ways, or regretting it would be too late.<br><br>These four types of Buddhism exist in our society today, <strong>we should recognize them as they are and think carefully as to which way is most beneficial to us, and the one we will ultimately follow. </strong><br><br>Latest development of Buddhism ...<br><br>Buddhism is gaining wide appeal across the globe. The large international membership of the World Buddhist Sangha Council is clear evidence. There are a growing number of internet sites that offer information about Buddhism. Many companies produce music, videos, and multi-media educational material on Buddhism. Buddhism has even influenced pop culture and permeated into the psyche of the masses. In Singapore too, Buddhism has not only retained its relevance, but is gaining popularly. Between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of Singaporeans above 15 years old who are Buddhists increased from 31% to 43%, the largest increase amongst all major religions. Dharma talks in Singapore are now also conducted in English, to reach out to young Singaporeans, including professionals. Devotees today do not just visit the temples to pray. They are eager to delve deeper into the Buddhist scriptures and reflect upon their philosophical and spiritual significance<br><br><a href="http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm</a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
