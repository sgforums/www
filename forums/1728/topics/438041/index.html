              <p>Tibetan Buddhism follows the Indian tradition and all Indian traditions take for granted belief
              in rebirth. Even if traditional Buddhist seekers do not have a deep understanding of what takes
              rebirth or how rebirth works, still they have grown up with the idea of rebirth as a cultural
              given. They need merely to have their understandings refined, but do not need to become convinced
              in the existence of rebirth. Therefore, texts on the graded stages of the path (<em><span class="tool" title="lam-rim:Graded path; graded stages of the path; graded stage of motivation; graded stages of pathway minds. A course of training in the Mahayana sutra teachings through which one makes progress by developing graded stages of motivation, which act as pathway minds leading to enlightenment.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: stages of the path)">lam-rim</span></em>) do not even mention the topic of gaining conviction in the existence of
              rebirth.</p>
              <p>Without rebirth, the discussion of <span class="tool" title="mind:The cognitive activity of merely giving rise to an appearance or mental hologram of something knowable and cognitively engaging with it.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: verb: think [in the sense of have an opinion]; contemplate; noun: mind; consciousness; thought; continuum)">mind</span> having no beginning and no end becomes meaningless.
              Without beginningless and endless mind, the entire presentation of <span class="tool" style="cursor: pointer;" title='karma:(1) In all Tibetan Buddhist systems except Vaibhashika and Gelug Prasangika, equivalent to a subcategory of the mental factor (subsidiary awareness), an urge. It is the mental factor that brings the mind in the direction of a specific physical, verbal, or mental action. (2) In the Vaibhashika and Gelug Prasangika, with respect to mental karmic actions, it is the mental factor of the urge that brings the mind in the direction of that action. With respect to physical or verbal karmic actions, it is (a) the revealing form of the physical impulse of the physical action or the sound of the words of the verbal action, plus (b) the nonrevealing form of the subtle invisible "vibration" of the action, which continues during and after the action. Some translators render the term "karma" as "action." (3) A general term used loosely for behavioral cause and effect. Also called: karmic impulse.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: action; act; deed; predisposition (established by a deed); work; [ablative particle:] from; by reason of)'>karma</span> falls apart. This is

Without the presentation of karmic <span class="tool" title="cause:A nonstatic phenomenon able to bring about the production or arising of something.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: cause; [as verb]: wander; move; go; [following a verb, indicates]: to be done)">cause</span> and effect over the span of

Also translated as "dependent origination."|(Jeffrey Hopkins: dependent-arising)'>dependent arising</span> likewise falls apart.</p>
              <p>Moreover, in terms of the three scopes of lam-rim <span class="tool" style="cursor: pointer;" title="motivation:When used in Western languages, a state of mind that entails two mental factors (subsidiary awarenesses): a motivating aim and a motivating emotion.

How can we sincerely aim for enlightenment and the
              ability to help others gain liberation from rebirth without belief that rebirth is a fact?</p>

              uncontrollably experiencing them if we do not believe that bardo and rebirth occur?</p>
              <p>Thus, it is clearly evident that rebirth is a cornerstone for a large and crucial portion of the
              <span class="tool" title="dharma:(1) Preventive measures which, if one puts into practice or achieves, prevent the experience of future suffering. (2) Buddha's teachings.

              <p>Most Westerners come to Dharma without prior belief in rebirth. Many approach the study and
              practice of Dharma as a method for improving the quality of this lifetime, especially in terms of
              overcoming psychological and emotional problems. This <span class="tool" title="attitude:A mental factor that takes its cognitive object by regarding it from a certain point of view.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: awareness; knowledge; mind; intellect; intelligence. cognition)">attitude</span> reduces Dharma to an Asian form of
              psychotherapy.</p>
              <p>I have coined the term 
              <em>Dharma-Lite</em> for this approach to Buddhist Dharma, analogous to "CocaCola-Lite." It is a
              weakened version, not as strong as "The <span class="tool" title="real:A nontechnical term for what actually exists.">Real</span> Thing." The traditional approach to Dharma - which
              includes not only discussion of rebirth, but also the presentation of the hells and the rest of the

              <p>There are two ways to practice Dharma-Lite.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>We may practice it with acknowledgment of the importance of rebirth in Buddhism and the sincere
              <span class="tool" style="cursor: pointer;" title="intention:The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) to obtain any object, to achieve any goal, or to do something with the object or goal once obtained or achieved.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: aspiration)">intention</span> to study the accurate teachings on it. Thus, we aim to improve this lifetime with the
              Dharma methods merely as a steppingstone on the way to working to improve our future rebirths and
              to gain liberation and enlightenment. Thus, Dharma-Lite becomes a preliminary step on the graded
              path to enlightenment, a step prior to the initial scope. Such an approach is completely fair to
              the Buddhist tradition. It does not call Dharma-Lite "The Real Thing."</li>
              <li>We may practice it with the <span class="tool" title="recognition:The mental factor (subsidiary awareness) of distinguishing an object as being something specific, such as when studying the Dharma, oneself as being a sick person, one's spiritual teacher as being a doctor, and the Dharma as being medicine.|(Jeffrey Hopkins: discrimination)">recognition</span> that Dharma-Lite is not only the actual Dharma, but
              also the most appropriate and skillful form for Western Buddhism to take. Such an approach
              shortchanges and is grossly unfair to the Buddhist tradition. It easily leads to an attitude of
              cultural arrogance.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Therefore, we need to proceed with great care if we find that, at our present level of spiritual
              development and understanding, Dharma-Lite is the drink for us.</p>
