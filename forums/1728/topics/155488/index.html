However, we must be distinct in what kind of powers is that. That is spiritual powers, not the kind of powers you attain through meditation and cultivation.<br><br>As I have posted earlier in other topics, there are 5 kinds of eyes. What are they?<br><br><a href="http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html</a><br><br>The eye of ordinary sentient beings<br>The heavenly eye<br>The eye of an arhat<br>The eye of a bodhisattva<br>The eye of the Buddha<br><br>The 'Spiritual' eye is in between the Fleshy (ordinary) eye and Heavenly eye.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Have you ever seen a ghost or a god? Normally people can't see things that are too far, near, big, or small. But some people borrow the power of a ghost or other spiritual being, and gain spiritual vision. There are also cases of heavenly beings who are born into the human realm, who still retain some ability to see ghosts and spirits in the realms below. They can no longer see into the heavenly realm, nor can they see ghosts and spirits in the human realm.</span><br><br>----<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The ghostly or deva eye stands at a level between the fleshy and heavenly eyes. This phenomenon occurs when a spiritual being uses the eye of a human being as a medium. People who have experienced this believe that they have been endowed with great spiritual powers, but it is really the power of the spiritual being at work. There is a book about a spirit called Seth who used a woman's body to talk to people in this world. He could only talk through her.<br><br>I have a Dharma brother who has such powers. He was once sitting on a train, and suddenly he saw all the people sitting around him as pigs and dogs and other animals. He could see the changes that these people went through in various past lives, but he could see no further. This is not really his power, but that of a spiritual being working through him. I asked him if he could see such things with his eyes closed, and he answered no, but there are people who have such powers.</span><br><br>---<br><br>Even if one has such visions one should not be overly excited or cherish such powers as treasure. Because spiritual beings, spirits/ghosts, come from the lower realm, being a human it is even better not to have anything to do with them (unless you are an enlightened being and can teach dharma to the spirits). Surely, you would not want to be reborned among the spirits the next life. This is generally what my dharma teacher's advise is. There are some cases of such people (having spiritual eyes and spiritual powers), other than the friend I mentioned above, in my dharma centre too.. but theirs is not those powers cultivated through Dhyana (meditation).<br></div>

But they also do not treat them with high regards or importance on the spiritual journey to enlightenment.<br><br>Not mixing with spirits of lower realms is not being arrogant at all. Because as a Buddhist the least we should is to be reborned in the higher realms, and not in the 3 lower realms: Animal realm, Spirit realm, Hell realm. This is the only way we can progress spiritually over lifetimes of cultivation, if we cannot achieve liberation within this life. There are many types of people... or spiritual mediums who communicate with spirits. This is against Buddhist practise, we do not do that. I know of a person who used to commune with spirits. At death, he sees all the spirits waiting to take him away into the spirit realms.<br><br>Spirits, and spirits-deities also have spiritual powers. In fact some of them were superstitious during their lives, superstitious about the spiritual realms, that is how they ended up in that realm themselves.<br><br>Even if someone has such powers, we should disregard its importance, and not be misled into the dark path. One should earnestly practise - and the goal of cultivation and practise is not to attain such powers. Even if you have such powers, we must not be attached to them or else the maras will delude us. Perhaps, the Shurangama Sutra will be a good read for you.</div>

There are 18 kinds of spirits listed in Buddhism. Different kinds of spirits also have different karmas. If one has done many misdeeds then it is possible that he will be reborned as a spirit... like e.g hungry ghost.<br><br>And sometimes, people are attached to all the mundane things in his life. His property, his family, spouse, etc. If he is attached and the 49 day opportunity for him to be reborned has passed, then he will be reborned in the spirit realms. Sometimes, such people still has some good karma. So they become 'spirit-deities' (gui3 shen2).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, this article is interesting. It's about the 7th month.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/bdigest.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/bdigest.htm</a><br><br>Volume 5 no 1<br><br>Feature<br><br><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/vol5img1.jpg"><br><br>Ullambana Dharma - not Festival of Hungry Ghosts<br>By Venerable Shen-Kai<br><br>According to a popular Chinese superstition, ghosts are released from hell in the 7th month of the Chinese calendar for a one-month break in the human world. In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?<br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2. 	Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.<br><br>When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.<br><br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2.

The Buddha explains that when our world system disintegrates, as it regularly does after extremely long periods of time, the lower sixteen planes are all destroyed. Beings disappear from all planes below the seventeenth, the plane of the Abhassara gods. Whatever beings cannot be born on the seventeenth or a higher brahma plane then must take birth on the lower planes in other remote world systems.<br><br>Eventually the world starts to re-form. Then a solitary being passes away from the Abhassara plane and takes rebirth on the plane of Maha Brahma. A palace created by his kamma awaits him there: "There he dwells, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And he continues thus for a long, long time." After ages pass, he becomes lonely and longs for other beings to join him. It just so happens that shortly after the brahma starts craving for company, other beings from the Abhassara plane, who have exhausted their lifespans there, pass away and are reborn in the palace of Brahma, in companionship with him.<br><br>Because these beings seemed to arise in accordance with the first brahma's wish, he becomes convinced that he is the almighty God: "I am the Great Brahma, the Vanquisher... the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being." The other brahmas, seeing that he was already present when they took birth in his world, accept his claim and revere him as their creator.<br><br>Eventually this misconception of a Creator God spreads to the human plane. One of the other brahmas passes away and is reborn here. He develops concentration and learns to recollect his previous life with Maha Brahma, but none of his lives before that. Recollecting that existence he recalls that Maha Brahma was considered the "father of all that are and are to be... permanent, stable, eternal." As he is unable to remember further back, he believes this to be absolute truth and propounds a theistic doctrine of an omnipotent Creator God (Net 69-70, 155-66).<br><br>The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, <strong>he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying.</strong> Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.</span></div>

The handing out of punishments and rewards are not the job if the bhuddhist Gods.<br><br>AEN: you mean <strong>of</strong> the Buddhist gods? Well - there are Buddhist, or Non-Buddhist gods. Many gods have taken refuge in Buddha after learning the dharma. But heaven is so huge, that there are bound to be so many gods that are not Buddhist. Yes, the Maha Brahma happens to be a Buddhist who have taken refuge in the Three Treasures - Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, at some point of his life when he met the Buddha (I think you read about it before). The Maha Brahma mentioned belongs to the 1st Brahma heaven. I believe you have heard about the Brahma elsewhere in other religions too. Beyond the 1st Brahma heaven, there are still 7 other jhanic heavens. The highest 4 levels of heavens are Formless - without body, i.e Infinite Space, Infinite Consciousness and so on. The highest level is Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception. Most religions do not have such detailed description of the 28 heavens. Even the Maha Brahma were not aware of any heavens higher than his prior to meeting the Buddha.<br><br>2. ANd there is an Almighty God in Bhuddhism. In thailand, they call him Chinana.<br><br>AEN: There is absolutely no Almighty God in Buddhism. In Thailand, the Buddhism there might be mixed with Brahmanism traditions. (i.e 4 face buddha) However it does not mean Buddhism accept any almighty God. If you ask the monks, they would also not admit it. We should never mix local culture and traditions with what scripture says.<br><br>3. As for the savior concept, bhuddhism teaches that suffering can be liberated if one accepts the Noble truths and practice the eightfold path.<br><br>AEN: Yes, obviously, all religious teachings do teach a way to be 'saved'. However, this is what the Buddha said: <span style="font-style: italic;">"One is indeed, one's own savior, for what other savior could there be? When one is in control of oneself, one obtains a savior difficult to find."</span> It is only through practise and cultivation that we can attain Buddhahood. No God or gods can ever grant us enlightenment and liberation.</div>

Even if it is found in Thai Buddhism I believe it is a 'cultural pickup'. And.. definitely it is not Supreme God. Buddhism rejects the theory of creatorism.<br><br>Oldest religion (in our age)..? Brahmanism/Hinduism in India... as far as I know. Abrahamic religions may claim to be older - perhaps 6000, 7000 years, I don't know, since I am no expert in Abrahamic religions.<br><br>But scriptually speaking, Buddhism is the oldest religion, because prior to this age, there were previous Buddhas. Buddha Shakyamuni is the 5th to appear in our world. And not to forget - infinite Buddhas in the past worlds. We currently live in a degenerated age. In the far future, there will be an age where there is no disease, long life span, high technology, 4 planets under one rule, that is the time where Maitreya Buddha (6th Buddha) appears. He is currently teaching the gods as a Bodhisattva in Tusita Heaven. The life during that time (of Maitreya Buddha) is being described in scriptures, it is definitely not now or any time soon.<br><br>If you have read the other post about how Buddha chose his birthplace, one of the reason is because India is more spiritually advance at that time. But it does not mean that Buddha was a Hindu/Brahmanist, in fact, he is more of a reformist. He has rejected many many teachings from other religions. There were more than 60 religions/practises during his times. He himself experienced alot of spiritual practises before, even reaching to the 7th and 8th Jhana prior to his enlightenment under another Guru, but eventually abandoned them all.<br><br>In the scriptures, many gods have taken refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and attained Insights (into no-self).. attaining Stream-Entry (1st stage of sainthood) and higher.</div>
