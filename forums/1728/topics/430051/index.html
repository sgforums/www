              <h1>About Buddhism in America</h1>
              <dl><dt><strong>"Buddhism is a 'pagan' religion"</strong> </dt><dd>"Paganism" is usually used to refer to belief in a god or gods other than the normally accepted Christian God. However, Buddhists don't concern themselves about God or god(s). Buddhists concern themselves with the <em>Dharma,</em> which is not a god or gods. It is "truth" or "reality." Thus, when sad or tragic events occur in our lives or the lives of our loved ones - as they inevitably will - Buddhists don't have to ask "Why did this happen?" This is because Buddhists don't hold onto the belief that there is a god "looking out" for his or her welfare. Buddhism is really an attitude of accepting the inevitable changes or impermanence of life, and of being grateful for every moment we are alive.<strong><br></strong></dd><dt><strong>"All Buddhists believe in reincarnation"</strong> </dt><dd>This misconception is understandable, given that Tibetan Buddhists (such as the Dalai Lama), who do believe in a form of reincarnation, are perhaps the most "visible" of the many sects of Buddhism. Also, watching recent movies like <em>Little Buddha,</em> <em>Seven Years in Tibet</em> or <em>Kundun,</em> might lead one to believe that Tibetan Buddhism is "representative" of Buddhism in general. However, Shin Buddhists generally treat belief in reincarnation in the same way we treat belief in a god: We don't give it much thought. What's important is not which Buddhists believe in reincarnation and which don't, but that <em>all</em> Buddhists do strive to awaken to one central teaching: The universal truth of the impermanent and interdependent nature of all life. As our awareness of this truth awakens, so does our awareness of compassion.<br></dd><dt><strong>"Buddhists welcome suffering"</strong> </dt><dd>This misconception is perhaps due to the perception that a Buddhist is only true and sincere if he or she is somehow suffering, poor, etc. This might be true, but only partially so. The truth is that Buddhists don't in any way "look forward" to suffering; to do so would be masochistic. Instead, a Buddhist tries to look upon suffering not as something necessarily "bad," but as an opportunity to learn and grow. In that sense, it might be said that Buddhists try to look upon suffering and difficulties as something potentially positive, as a kind of "teacher."<br></dd><dt><strong>"All Buddhists wear robes"</strong> </dt><dd>This may have come into being during the era when the "Hare Krishna" group was very visible. There was a time during the 70's and maybe 80's when they seemed to be everywhere: on TV, at airports, etc. Many Americans may have thought they were Buddhists. Of course, Tibetan Buddhists and others, who are living the life of a monk or priest (following in the footsteps of the Buddha himself), do in fact wear religious robes. However, while our Shin Buddhist ministers do wear official robes during the service, the members of the temple simply wear casual clothes.<br></dd><dt><strong>"Buddhists must endure 'grueling' meditations"</strong> </dt><dd>Some Buddhist sects, such as Zen, do of course emphasize meditation. However, whether it is "grueling" or not depends on one's point of view (and one's flexibility). In our Shin Buddhist sect, the closest we come to meditation is that for about 10 minutes of our services, while seated in chairs, we collectively "chant" the <em>sutras</em> (which are the teachings of the Buddha). Of course, even if a certain meditation were "grueling," the point is that the goal of achieving "awakening" or enlightenment, which is the same for all Buddhists, completely justifies the means.<br></dd><dt><strong>"When Buddhists 'gassho' (put their hands together and bow their heads), they are 'praying' for good fortune"</strong> </dt><dd>This probably has a lot to do with the historical mixing of Buddhist and Christian traditions here in 20th century America. In fact, the belief that the Buddhist act of gassho is like a prayer is not only held by Christians, but probably by more than a few Buddhists as well! However, the truth is that the act of gassho is not a prayer at all. It is probably best described as an expression of humility, of realizing with gratitude, how much one has to be thankful for. It is not a "wish" for anything for oneself.<br></dd><dt><strong>"Shin Buddhism in America is for Japanese or Japanese-Americans only"</strong> </dt><dd>This belief is understandable, since even here in California (the so-called "melting-pot of the world"), when you walk into the typical Shin Buddhist temple, you tend to see a predominantly Japanese-American membership. Also, when you participate in the typical Shin Buddhist service, you'll typically sing a Japanese song or two and the minister himself (unfortunately, it is rarely a "she") may be more comfortable speaking Japanese than English. In addition, many of the Shin Buddhist temples in America are in areas with relatively high concentrations of Japanese or Japanese-Americans. However, this is merely because historically, it was the Japanese immigrants who brought the Shin Buddhist teachings with them to America. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the underlying truth of Buddhism itself. The Buddha himself certainly wasn't Japanese. Fortunately, things are slowly changing in many American temples today. There is a move, particularly by the younger generations, to make the services less "ethnic" and more universal. If you are interested in Buddhism, the ultimate test of whether it is indeed universal or not, is to read the teachings of the Buddha, Shinran Shonin, and others for yourself, as represented here in this and other websites (see our Library and Links). We hope you'll agree that Buddhism is a wonderful and precious teaching for everyone.</dd></dl>

                                That site is spreading the misconception that reincarnation is not central to Buddhism. Rebirth (better term than reincarnation since rebirth does not imply a soul) is a CENTRAL teaching of Buddhism. If you do not believe in rebirth and karma, you are not considered Buddhist. Unfortunately many Americans choose to filter out certain central doctrines of Buddhism, ending up teaching a false view. This is strictly an American thing.... never has any form of Asian Buddhism promoted the annihilistic view that there is no rebirth.

              <p>Non Buddhists thought Buddha was an ordinary human being. Their
                                    concept is how can an ordinary human being be more powerful than
                                    god. In actual fact, Buddha was enlightened, different from
                                    ordinary human being.</p>

              <p><br> Yes. Perhaps it is good to discuss what is 'ordinary human being': 'ordinary human beings' are beings that are deluded, who are attached to the notion of a Self, who are attached to things, who cannot perceive the nature of reality, and experiences craving, anger, fear, sorrow, suffering, and all manners of passionate feelings. How has Buddha transcended the human condition while living as this human body? It is the realization of the nature of reality (the twofold emptiness, of self and objects) and the transcendence of the source of craving itself. In fact the Buddha was not the only one who has transcended the human conditions: countless has done the same since him, even today.</p>
              <p>Gods have not overcome their 'human/god condition' which is to be entrapped in craving, attachments, ignorance. Only aryas (enlightened beings) have.</p>
              <p>As for fcukpap: that is right, and I'd go on to say that Buddhism has the most indepth understanding of the human condition, what are the conditions for humans to experience suffering, and the way to overcome suffering/the human condition. How to end the source of suffering, how to end war, murder, torture, rape, domestic violence, corruption, suffering, sorrow, anger, desire, fear, and so on by the eradication of those passionate cravings and attachments and delusions.</p>

              <p>This is not a misconception. Buddha did incalculate some of the Hindu teachings into Buddhism. Don't forget he learnt from various Brahman teachers (hindu teachers) on his spiritual journey.</p>

              <p>And what specific Hindu teachings are you talking about?</p>
              <p>Even the teachings of 'reincarnation' (that supposes a soul) and 'karma' (which is deterministic in hinduism) is different from Buddhism's rebirth and karma.</p>
              <p>In terms of love, compassion, and some moral values, of course Buddhism and other religions - not just Hinduism but also Christianity, Islam, etc, share.</p>
              <p>But that doesn't mean Buddhism absorbed certain teachings from Hinduism.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is a very unique teaching. In some sense Buddhism is 180 degrees diametrically opposite of Hinduism (for example: atman and anatta).</p>

              <p><br>In that era 3000 years ago, indeed, in the course of searching for the true liberation from suffering for all beings, Buddha embarked on the journey to learn from any "tom dick harry" whoever commanded great respect and awe from the King down to commoners, for the true source of origin. It is only the right approach to do his research with Brahmans then as they were super ascetic practitioners that achieved super high level of meditational peace, which linked them to various six-realms of phenomena. Unfortunately, Buddha practiced together with them and achieved the same level still could not satisfy his path of liberation, until he let go whatever he has learned and practiced by ceasing all his thoughts and ponder. Somehow or rather, the stars he pondered on work, it twinkled to the his enlightenment, and delivers the Flower Adornment replendent virtue of all beings in his meditational stance under the bodhi tree.</p>
              <p>Anything that is against joys &amp; bliss is misconception, likewise to bliss against serenity. The most unscrupulously misconception is that living beings and any idolized statues are not buddha. At the end of the moment, it just Ah/\Ha...have a good laugh...hahaha</p>
