              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">NAKHON
              PATHOM, Thailand — On a rural road just after daybreak, villagers young and old
              kneel reverently before a single file of ochre-robed women, filling their bowls
              with rice, curries, fruits and sweets. In this country, it's a rare sight.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thailand's
              top Buddhist authority bars women from becoming monks. They can only become
              white-cloaked nuns, who are routinely treated as domestic servants. Many here
              believe women are inferior beings who had better perform plenty of good deeds
              to ensure they will be reborn as men in their future lives.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Yet with
              the religion beset by lurid scandals, female monastics or
              "bhikkhunis" are emerging as a force for reform, not unlike activists
              in the Christian world seeking gender equality including ordination of women as
              priests in the Catholic Church. They are growing in numbers and appear to be
              making headway.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thailand
              has some 100 bhikkhunis who were ordained in Sri Lanka, where women are allowed
              to become monks. They and their monasteries are not legally recognized in
              Thailand, and don't enjoy state funding and other support the country's 200,000
              male monks are granted.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Living
              spartan lives, the women are governed by 311 precepts from celibacy and poverty
              to archaic ones like having to confess after eating garlic. Their ranks and
              those of hundreds of aspirants — there are five stages before ordination —
              include a former Google executive, a Harvard graduate, journalists and doctors,
              as well as village noodle vendors.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"It
              is our right, our heritage, to lead a fully monastic life. We are on the right
              side of history," says Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, an author, former university
              professor and the first bhikkhuni in Thailand from the Theravada branch of
              Buddhism, which is dominant in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. Using her
              religious name of Venerable Dhammananda, she contends that the Buddha 2,500
              years ago built the religion as a four-legged stool — monks, nuns, laymen and
              laywomen — but "we are now sitting on just three legs."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
              male-dominated religion has been blighted in recent years by crimes and gross
              violations of vows, just as widespread sex abuse and Vatican financial scandals
              have damaged the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Monks in
              Thailand have been convicted of everything from murder to wildlife trafficking.
              Sexual depravity is frequently reported. One former abbot, fugitive Wirapol
              Sukphol, faces charges of drug use, money laundering, fathering a child by an
              underage woman and illegally amassing millions of dollars. A photograph shows
              him seated in a private jet wearing aviator sunglasses.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
              Supreme Sangha Council, the religion's ruling body, is under fire over the
              mishandling of corruption allegations against prominent abbots, including one
              of its own members. The allegations include embezzling funds intended for the
              cremation of an abbot's predecessor and the investment of $1.2 million from
              donations into the stock market.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">With
              Buddhism so intimately tied to Thai identity — more than 90 percent adhere to
              the faith — these misdeeds and what is termed "checkbook Buddhism"
              have spurred calls in Parliament for curbing the almost total authority the
              council wields over the clergy and the corruption-stoking $4 billion in annual
              donations to monasteries. A proposed Patronage and Protection of the Clergy
              Bill would impose stiff penalties for those who break the religion's cardinal
              rules and set up a panel to monitor donations. Corruption within Buddhism may
              also be dealt with in Thailand's next constitution, now being drafted.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The role
              of women in Buddhism has also aroused national-level debate.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
              Sangha council has urged the government to ban Sri Lankan clergy from coming
              into the country following what Dhammananda calls a "rebel
              ordination" in Thailand of eight bhikkhunis last November by Sri Lankans.
              That drew broad criticism of the council itself.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"The
              clergy can no longer insist on operating in a closed, feudal system that
              violates universal norms and values," said an editorial in the
              English-language Bangkok Post. Instead of trying to crush women's aspirations,
              it said the "clergy should concentrate on cleaning up its own house to
              restore declining public faith."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">No
              scandal has emerged among Thailand's female clergy. Dhammananda said she has
              seen no misbehavior in her monastery beyond a few nuns who had used their
              mobile telephones to excess.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"I
              think that many nuns see themselves as exemplary. They are, and they're carving
              a new role for themselves that didn't exist," said Juliane Schober, an
              expert on Southeast Asian Buddhism at Arizona State University. "That that
              puts pressure on the Sangha doesn't surprise me."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Women
              clergy interviewed at three monasteries said it was essential to maintain a
              high moral ground so as not to give opponents an excuse to stop their movement.
              Some cast them as Western-educated feminists out to undermine traditional
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"They
              can be a force for change in Buddhism," said Phramaha Boonchuay Doojai, a
              leading activist monk at Chiang Mai Buddhist College.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"If
              everything is in the hands of men, it is as if Buddhism was just the way of a
              father, not mother. But you need both," he said. "Mothers have some
              unique feelings that men do not share. They may have more loving
              kindness."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Proponents
              of ordination like Boonchuay say bhikkhunis originated with Buddha himself; the
              first was an aunt who raised him. Opponents argue that the lineage of the
              Theravada bhikkhuni order, under which women could be ordained, died out long
              ago and cannot be restored. The Mahayana branch of Buddhism practiced in East
              Asia has historically ordained women.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"We
              simply follow the rules. The ordination of female monks was allowed in the Lord
              Buddha's time. But as time passed, the lineage of bhikkhuni disappeared,"
              Phra Tepvisutthikawee of the Buddhism Protection Center has said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Despite
              conservative opposition, bhikkhunis are gaining ground with the general public
              in Thailand.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"It
              is a movement now. When I was struggling by myself it was just this crazy woman
              who wanted to be a monk," says Dhammananda, who was ordained in 2003.
              "Now people don't feel strange when they see a female monk in the streets.
              We don't have problems with people, with society."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Aside
              from spiritual pursuits, the 15 monastics at her Songdhammakalyani Monastery
              visit prisoners, aid the poor and infirm and maintain other links with the
              surrounding community near Nakhon Pathom in central Thailand. Regularly they
              make alms rounds, a timeless tradition of food offerings by the faithful who
              are then blessed by the monks.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">To the
              north, in the shadows of the country's highest mountain, hundreds of civil
              servants, businessmen, villagers and others regularly flock to an idyllic
              monastery to hear talks by Venerable Nandanyani, a bhikkhuni and onetime
              mathematician. Families attend a weekend religion "camp" on the
              monastery grounds. A bhikkhuni leads a group of men and women in the slow
              motions of walking meditation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Seated
              below a statue of the Buddha, the abbess energetically explains why ordination
              of women is vital, punctuating her words with thumbs-up gestures. It enables
              individuals to probe Buddhism's depths and live the full monastic life, she
              says, and also allows intimate communication between female clergy and laywomen
              unhindered by the barriers of sex and traditional propriety between women and
              monks.</span></p>

              must wait," she says. "Slowly but surely it will come."</span></p>
