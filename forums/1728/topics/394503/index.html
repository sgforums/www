              <p>Recently there was an Sri Lankan Buddhists uproar over American's rapper Akon MTV "sexy chick" which show bikini clad girls dancing infront of Buddha's statue. Many Sri Lankans considered this scene to be "blasphemous" to Buddhists and result in a violent riot where locals threw stones at the office of Akon's promoter.</p>
              <p>There was also a facebook group created "We hate Akon" and inside there were members (unfortunately Buddhists) cursing and calling names on Akon and others who are calling for calm and cessation to violence, while claiming they are "defending" Lord Buddha.</p>
              <p>I mean wow since when buddhists turned to hatred and intolerance for others in the name of "defending" buddhism and certainly this is not what Buddha had taught us. This incident could had been better managed and be use as an golden opportunity for others in the world to better understand Buddhism through its acts of tolerance and forgiveness but instead violent acts marred this only chance and understandings of the Buddha's teachings. An sad day indeed for all Buddhists.</p>
              <p><em> "The Buddha was sitting under a tree talking 
                              to his disciples when a man came and spit on his face. He wiped it off, 
                              and he asked the man, “What next? What do you want to say next?” The man
                               was a little puzzled because he himself never expected that when you 
                              spit on somebody’s face, he will ask, “What next?” He had no such 
                              experience in his past. He had insulted people and they had become angry
                               and they had reacted. Or if they were cowards and weaklings, they had 
                              smiled, trying to bribe the man. But Buddha was like neither, he was not
                               angry nor in any way offended, nor in any way cowardly. But just 
                              matter-of-factly he said, “What next?” There was no reaction on his 
                              part.""</em></p>

              <p>Personally I don't find it offensive. I think the Sri Lankans are too sensitive over these things. I just watched the MTV to confirm my suspicions <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzNR9c82XLg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzNR9c82XLg</a> - It also reminded me of other places that have images of Buddha like the Buddha Bar. Though I feel there were better choice of venue to film this MTV, I don't think the main thing about the video is about the Buddha. The Buddha remained at the background and wasn't intentional. It just so happens that the 'club' had this decorative item (which I feel is unfortunate and there were many other more appropriate decorations they could have thought of), but I'm sure you won't find Buddhists complaining in the U.S. about it.</p>
              <p>It reminds me of another incident in another forum, where a Sri Lankan messaged me in quite a threatening tone and told me how offensive it is to have Buddha as my forum display picture. I just don't buy into his arguments at all, but he was very serious about it and from his posts I had the impressions that the Sri Lankans all take this very seriously as they are taught this way. I had to respectfully decline him, as I have no intentions of removing Buddha as my forum DP.</p>
              <p>The song is pretty good so was the video, and I don't see anything disrespectful about it.</p>

              <p>Actually my opinion is abit for the Sri Lankans and abit for tolerance. </p>
              <p>I think the girls dancing in front of Buddha will send a bad signal or image for people who are not Buddhists, it sort of degrades the image of Buddha in the public consciousness.  One of the reason why we have such beautiful temples and such beautiful statues and so on are to upgrade the sanctity of Buddha in the hearts of Buddhists and also for all visitors.  Somehow such a sub-conscious imprint esp in the minds of the young may sort of remove or at least lower the sense of respect for Buddha thereby leaving them with less chances to accumulate merit. (Even respect thru mind accumulates merit)</p>
              <p>In general, we go by the philosophy of Buddhism, then attachment leading to violence or threats etc is only a future cycle of suffering.  I think that is unnecessary. But Buddhists shd definitely make some noise and object firmly. Without any kind of aggression of course.</p>

              <p>Yes they should voice their concern, though I think their actions might be a bit extreme. I won't boycott Akon if he comes to Singapore, and certainly won't 'hate' him for that.</p>
              <p>But such things do increase awareness of such issues and I'm sure others will make an effort to avoid such provocations in the future.</p>

              <p>Pardon them, these people know nothing about Buddha, talk less about respecting Buddha. They also do not know that behaviour will determine their next rebirth. If people behave like animals, they will be reborn in the animals realm and so forth. These people do not believe in these kind of things, they believe  there are also bikini and sex party in heaven.</p>
              <p>Buddhists have to voice out our unhappiness. I pity their ignorance. By behaving in this way, who has something to lose ? Definitely not Buddha, Buddha is not affected at all by their behaviour. They are the ones who are going to answer for their behaviour.</p>
              <p>May be it will take them many many rebirths to dance in bikini again. So, happy dancing Akon and gals.</p>

              <p>Akon video with Buddha statue in background whether is intentional or not. It does not make a difference to Buddha! Have we forgotten that Buddha was tempted by Mara daughter under the Bodhi tree. Do you think Mara daughter was fully cloth or seductive clad. I think maybe they were naked. However, Buddha was neither angry or tempted, they become dust before his eyes. <br><br>Beside, in Ang Kor Wat Buddhist temple (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat"><span style="color: #3b5998;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat</span></a>), there are woman statue which are cladly dressed showing the breast at times. How come no one is angry about it when it is presented in A BUDDHIST TEMPLE.<br>Perhaps it was to depict to human, how we are easily bound by lust and greed.</p>
              <p><br>Of course, when you reach the inner temple you will see Buddha statue in a calm meditation position. Because he has overcome the temptation of the world.<br><br>As for Akon's mtv, it just show the humanside of mankind. He is exuberated by the Sexy Chick. LOL<br><br>No worries, Sri Lanka pals, I think the MTV can be a good teaching tool to draw the parallel between Buddha and mankind. If you use it wisely. Don't you think so....</p>

              <p>Actions of both parties stems from ignorance. It is disrespectful to dress and act erotically in front of a religious icon, it is also not appropriate  to hate and threaten violence. There should be a more dignified way of expressing unhappiness. </p>

              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>We, because we are practising buddhists, can take the dancers as illusion, as mara's daughters, as anything. Now only worry is it cause Buddha's image to be downgraded in the eyes of others who dun know better.  It's realy for benefit of the greater masses that these things be avoided.  It cause much suffering in the world, when the general respect for Buddha drop too, it cause general level of merit of beings to drop and therefore will have more problems and less happiness.  Therefore Buddhists always have responsibility to uphold the dharma.  Uphold not just mean teach the dharma, it means other things like set good example, and also try to give good impression of Buddhism and also help more beings. So i find Sri Lankans not wrong in principle, just wrong in action and maybe too emotional, haha...</p>

              <p>How do you guys quote other people's posts? i can't find any function to do that.</p>
              <p>AEN,</p>
              <p>Wow, you mean your master attained Buddhahood. I thought the mara daughters who come down to stop those who are on the verge of complete enlightenment.  Who is your master, any teachings to read?</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>We, because we are practising buddhists, can take the dancers as illusion, as mara's daughters, as anything. Now only worry is it cause Buddha's image to be downgraded in the eyes of others who dun know better.  It's realy for benefit of the greater masses that these things be avoided.  It cause much suffering in the world, when the general respect for Buddha drop too, it cause general level of merit of beings to drop and therefore will have more problems and less happiness.  Therefore Buddhists always have responsibility to uphold the dharma.  Uphold not just mean teach the dharma, it means other things like set good example, and also try to give good impression of Buddhism and also help more beings. So i find Sri Lankans not wrong in principle, just wrong in action and maybe too emotional, haha...</p>

              <p>I agree with you that we Buddhists should show our unhappiness in a peaceful manner. If we were to keep quiet about it, these people will carry too far. We Buddhists are non violence but we are not voiceless and no push over.</p>
