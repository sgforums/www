              <p>I am writing to see if you can shed some light on something that confounds my rational mind.<br><br>It
               is to do with taking energy from other people.  It happens to me 
              several times a week.  It involves a feeling of an energy vacuum or hole
               appearing in my chest, and a corresponding gain of energy from the 
              nearest person.  This usually results in them taking a sudden intake of 
              breath, or suddenly coughing.  It starts as an unconscious process (I 
              can never initiate it myself), where the energy vacuum appears in my 
              chest, but continues as a conscious process, where I choose to continue 
              with this 'grab' of energy.<br><br>So, in effect, I can cause people to 
              lose their breath, and breath in suddenly, or suddenly cough, all 
              because of this channel that occurs.<br><br>I have tried searching 
              Google for any clues to see what this, and have only found a website 
              about energy vampires.  That website wasn't accurately describing what 
              happens for me.  <br><br>This phenomenon can't be interpreted through 
              physics or science, which is why I am writing to you, to see if you can 
              explain what is happening, why it is happening, and to point me in the 
              right direction to learn more about things which can't be described by 
              the rational mind and science.<br><br>I appreciate any help you can provide.</p>

              <p>Hi SRD,</p>
              <p>The workings of Karma confound rational mind or ordinary science and logic. I suggest you learn more about Karma. It will be endlessly useful to you in both your ordinary life and spiritual pursuits.  Buddha did not create the law of karmic cause-and-effect, it is simply cosmic physics, a universal law of balance and interaction.  There is no one who lives as a lone island. All our actions, thoughts etc affect others and have repercussions.</p>
              <p>Actually stealing people's energy, or doing it as a fantasy or doing it in dreams, or even the notion of doing it  builds up negative mental propensities (ie bad karma) and will not be good for you in the long run. Whatever effect is wrought on others, will bounce back on you, sometimes manifold times.  So when you are conscious of such phenomena of stealing others' energies, whether it is actually functioning or not, you should refrain from doing it anymore, you should wish for it not to happen.  Your entire being should try to be against harming others or taking advantage of others in any way.  This is my view of your situation.  Harming others will only bring further harm to you. Giving unhappiness or suffering to others will only bring suffering to oneself. </p>
              <p>If you study more into karma and its workings very deeply, you will see that it applies to every single facet of your life and helps you to achieve happiness, help others to achieve happiness. No matter what happens to you, good or bad, suffering or happiness, you have a greater ability to remain contented, unperturbed and accept it. </p>
              <p>Hope it helps.</p>
