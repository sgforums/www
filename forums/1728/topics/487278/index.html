              <p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   '>Oxford, UK</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '> -- A Buddhist monk sits in front of a classroom of children in a
                                  small town in rural Myanmar. He chants lines which the students dutifully
                                  repeat, as they do every week at these Buddhist ‘Sunday school’ classes. The
                                  monk teaches Buddhist values, regales students with stories of the Buddha’s
                                  previous lives, and talks about Myanmar’s history as a Buddhist nation.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">How should we interpret this scene? Is it simply an innocent
                                  example of imparting religious values to the next generation or another
                                  worrying indication of the insidious spread of anti-Muslim nationalism in
                                  Myanmar? Frustratingly, the answer might be both, which makes it difficult to
                                  know how to respond or intervene. In periods of rapid transition and
                                  modernisation, people develop an intensified concern regarding the loss of
                                  their cultural identity and traditions. These anxieties were present in
                                  colonial Burma in the first decades of the twentieth century and galvanised the
                                  nationalist movement at the time; they are also pervasive in contemporary
                                  Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The outside world has
                                  focused almost exclusively on the admittedly worrying anti-Muslim orientation
                                  of the Buddhist nationalist movement in Myanmar, but another emerging aspect of
                                  contemporary Buddhist practice in Myanmar demonstrates that the relationship
                                  between religion and nationalism is complex and must be analysed carefully.
                                  Since about 2010, different organisations have been creating networks of
                                  Buddhist Sunday schools in an attempt to instill Buddhist values in children,
                                  who, they are worried, will not grow up with the same religious understanding
                                  or devotion of previous generations. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The rapid expansion of these classes has seen some organisations
                                  teaching tens of thousands of students in hundreds of locations across the
                                  country. Where they are centrally organised, the level of top-down control
                                  varies. MaBaTha (the Organisation for the Protection of Race and Religion, that
                                  has been promoting a series of discriminatory laws connected to religion)
                                  merely sells a curriculum book and invites interested lay people to develop
                                  their own classes. At the other end of the spectrum, a group called the Dhamma
                                  School Foundation has a much greater level of organisation, with a detailed
                                  teacher training curriculum, the involvement of monks in teaching, and regular
                                  evaluations including site visits. Nowhere do these classes supplant the public
                                  education that children receive, but, as might be expected in a Buddhist
                                  majority country, the line between the two is not always clear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some might be concerned that these informal schools will simply be
                                  vehicles to inculcate children in an increasingly virulent anti-Muslim
                                  nationalism. But the curricula for most are relatively innocuous, teaching
                                  exactly the kinds of values one would want to promote among Buddhists in
                                  Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Does this mean we can champion these schools as an effective
                                  response to religious conflict in the country? Unfortunately, the answer is
                                  probably no, at least not until there also develops an alternative
                                  understanding of the appropriate ways to promote and protect Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The dominant framework within which most Buddhists in Myanmar at
                                  the moment are interpreting the notion of protecting their religion is against
                                  the external threat of Islam. Teaching materials themselves may not be
                                  problematic but when they are used by monks who also spread misinformed rumours
                                  and negative images of Muslims, the message children get is not that Buddhist
                                  values should be promoted to make Myanmar a more peaceful country but that
                                  Buddhist identity is under threat and must be secured against an outside enemy.
                                  More worryingly, even when these classes are not linked to explicit anti-Muslim
                                  rhetoric, students and teachers are likely to interpret their lessons within
                                  the context of the currently dominant narrative of Buddhism in Myanmar in
                                  danger of being overwhelmed by Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Well-intentioned but incautious outside voices seeking to address
                                  Myanmar’s religious conflict have at times exacerbated tensions. For example,
                                  the Time magazine article about hardline Buddhist monk U Wirathu merely
                                  resulted in a circling of the wagons. A critique of one monk’s reprehensible
                                  preaching was interpreted as an attack on Buddhism writ large.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhist Sunday Schools are part of a (in many ways laudable)
                                  response by Burmese Buddhists to the anxieties they are facing regarding the
                                  opening up of their country to outside influences. Some even emphasise the
                                  kinds of inclusive and tolerant practices that will be a necessary foundation
                                  of a religiously plural Myanmar. Criticising or dismissing them as simply
                                  vehicles for the spread of religious bigotry would be counterproductive,
                                  alienating many Buddhists whose main engagement with a group like MaBaTha might
                                  be in its pro-Buddhist guise rather than its anti-Muslim orientation. But one
                                  aspect cannot be easily separated from the other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It will be necessary to clearly communicate to Burmese Buddhists
                                  that, while their attempts to promote the best values of their religion are
                                  admirable, unless the narrative that posits Buddhism as under threat from Islam
                                  is altered, there is a danger that their efforts could actually encourage an
                                  ignorant and violent intolerance that is the very opposite of what the Buddha
                                  taught.</span></p>
