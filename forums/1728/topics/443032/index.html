              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Most of us would have read articles by advance practitioners of Buddhism in their writings relating to their personal realization and experience of the Blessed One teaching of Not-Self or the doctrine of Emptiness. There are also some very useful, helpful and insightful guides and information available on how to go about achieving it as well. The question here is:</span></span></p>

One is that, jhÄ�na is not necessary for any of the four levels of Awakening and that there is a class of individuals called "dry insight" meditators who are "discernment-released" based on a level of concentration lower than that of jhÄ�na. A second position believes that concentration is mastered only on the level of </span><a id="anagami-3f" name="anagami-3f"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #111111;">non-returning</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> and that jhÄ�na is necessary for the attainment of non-returning and </span><a id="arahant2-3f" name="arahant2-3f"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #111111;">Arahantship</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">, but not for the lower levels of Awakening. The third position states that the attainment of at least the first level of jhÄ�na is essential for all four levels of Awakening. </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So, is jhana necessary for mental unification in order to hold the five hindrances at bay and aid in the eventual attainment of insight knowledge?<span>  </span></span></span></p>

              Muse over this -
               the 8th fold path or ... did it precede Buddha's awakening or as a consequence of his awakening?
              Sutras,scriptures or .. concepts are no different from worldly knowledge - one has to beware the traps!

              <p>Right knowledge is seeing things as they really are by direct experience, not as they appear to be, nor as the practitioner wants them to be, but as they truly are. A result of Right Knowledge is the tenth factor - Right liberation.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1728/topics/#cite_note-57"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>These two factors are the end result of correctly practicing the noble eightfold path, which arise during the practice of right concentration. The first to arise is right knowledge: this is where deep insight into the ultimate reality arises. The last to arise is right liberation: this is where self-awakening occurs and the practitioner has reached the pinnacle of their practice.</p>

              <p>back to the topic, i think it's tag along with realisation eventually. can say it's automatically sync to realisation eventually. like paramita. as taugh by old master, if one is into generosity, practice it ALL the way, eventually, one will have all the paramita including transcendental wisdom. if u find that u prefer to practice loving-kindness, then master it ALL the way to the very core, and u will get all the paramita. if u are into renunciation, do it ALL the way, then one day u will also realise transcendental wisdom. it's like our fingers all link back to the palm. all the parimitas are link into one. why u think it does not link is because one has yet to practice to the core of it, u are still at the finger potion. the key is also about focusing.</p>

              <p>back to the topic, i think it's tag along with realisation
                  eventually. can say it's automatically sync to realisation
                  eventually. like paramita. as taugh by old master, if one is into
                  generosity, practice it ALL the way, eventually, one will have all
                  the paramita including transcendental wisdom. if u find that u
                  prefer to practice loving-kindness, then master it ALL the way to
                  the very core, and u will get all the paramita. if u are into
                  renunciation, do it ALL the way, then one day u will also
                  realise transcendental wisdom. it's like our fingers all link
                  back to the palm. all the parimitas are link into one. why u think
                  it does not link is because one has yet to practice to the core of
                  it, u are still at the finger potion. the key is also about
                  focusing.</p>

              Muse over this ;
              A pickpocket who was trailing a gem merchant and wanted very much to get hold of this gem - he tried all means and ways and to no avail and was still trying; all this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into the pocket of the thief. 
              After a lapse of some moments, the pickpocket out of his frustration blurted out that he was a professional in pickpocketing and queried where is the gem as it could not even find it in the merchant!
              To that the merchant replied - I put it where u would least look for it - in your pocket!
              This allegory illustrates the predicament of searching in the ''wrong'' places and hoping to find .... 
              
              Eg :When I practice a particular .... thinking that I am a particular .... looking for a particular ... eg merits or to arrive someday somewhere I m merely spinning on my fictional self - I am playing mind games!  
              That was before and that which is now and that which may appear is all happening in the nowhere.

              <p>I'll just type it out:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Suhrllekha comments:</p>
              <p>Wisdom does not arise without concentration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Bodhicharyavatara states:</p>
              <p>Knowing that insight arises from tranquility</p>
              <p>And clears the defilements of the mind</p>
              <p>One should first achieve tranquility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similar comments are made in the Sravakabhumi, the Bhavanakrama, and the Prajnaparamitopadesa. Those who rely upon this approach say that the stages of meditation necessitate the attainment of tranquility as a priori to the achievement of insight. They reason that one does not achieve tranquility without perfect ease. Without achieving tranquility and perfect ease one cannot realize insight and the attendant perfect ease. This approach is incorrect because one can experience both tranquility and insight without achieving perfect ease. Why is this so? As the Bodhisattvabhumi, the Abhidharmasamucchaya, and the Prajnaparamitopadesa state, the nine stages for achieving tranquility, beginning with the quieting of the mind, constitute the stage of tranquility, whereas the four insights achieved through the determination of aspects of reality comprise the stage of insight. it is hard for beginners at the early stage of tranquility and insight to achieve perfect ease. Furthermore, they believe there can only exist an ultimate kind of tranquility and insight, and perfect ease must accompany both. By extension, this position would only allow for the existence of one ultimate path.</p>
              <p>The Samdhinirmochana-sutra and Prajnaparamitopadesa state:</p>
              <p>If this is so, how is it that meditations unaccompanied by perfect ease are not meditations of tranquility and insight?</p>
              <p>The preceding was intended to be a yardstick for measuring the realization of ultimate tranquility and insight. Were it not so, many internal contradictions and fallacies in terms of Buddha's words and logic would arise. The statement that one should meditate upon insight by relying on tranquility was intended for individuals on the gradual path. As there are those who relaize insight without even achieving tranquility, the Abhidharmasamucchaya says:</p>
              <p>Some achieve insight without tranqulity, and through insight they attain tranquility.</p>

              <p>Oh yes what you said is perfectly consistent with my experience.</p>
              <p>What I meant is this: it is not difficult to experience jhana/tranquility. But it is not as easy to *master* jhana/tranquility, which requires disciplined practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I mean by mastery is ability to enter samadhi the moment/the very second you sit down. Thusness and my Taiwanese teacher can do this, I can't. And this tranquility becomes a base in your daily experience.</p>
              <p>But even right now, I can enter into a sort of mini samadhi through the six sense entries in daily life... owing certain insights.</p>
