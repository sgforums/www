              <p>In terms of method, the progressive stages of Metta meditation are good for inculcating Compassion. </p>
              <p>First, direct loving-kindness to oneself, then to those whom we care 
              for, extend it to people we are neutral to, and finally to those to whom
               we bear grievances or who are "less lovable".</p>

              I think I'm compassionate but not enough when i encounter people whom I have negative feelings of. 
              
              I try metta meditation but I find it very difficult to direct metta.  I just can't feel it.  I can mentally say may all beings be well and happy but those are just from my mind.  I just know deep down inside, I don't feel it.
              
              Any advice?  I heard metta meditation seem east but to really feel the compassion is very very difficult.

              <p>Start of with directing metta to yourself.  It shouldn't be too hard to send good wishes to yourself and those whom you care for.  Slowly, bit by bit as the weeks and months go by, extend that compassion to even those who hurt you.</p>

              <p>Thanks Novice. You are correct, one needs to have wisdom or it is difficult to have compassion for all. Buddhas and Boddhisattva have the wisdom, that is why they can do it.</p>

              <p><br>with my limited knowledge, it depends on your motivation. Your motivation is you wants to help her finacially. But the problem is you cant possibly give her money everyday.</p>
              <p>So now compassion had taken place, that why now is wisdom. If the motivation is strong, maybe can research does this lady actually really needs the money. Presuming she really do, it will better to research what type of help is available eg welfare centre, mcys etc and help her in getting these grants and getting the right person to help care and monitor her... in this case in not the $2 but you will be actually giving much much more then the daily $2.</p>

              <p><br>with my limited knowledge, it depends on your motivation. Your motivation is you wants to help her finacially. But the problem is you cant possibly give her money everyday.</p>
              <p>So now compassion had taken place, that why now is wisdom. If the motivation is strong, maybe can research does this lady actually really needs the money. Presuming she really do, it will better to research what type of help is available eg welfare centre, mcys etc and help her in getting these grants and getting the right person to help care and monitor her... in this case in not the $2 but you will be actually giving much much more then the daily $2.</p>
