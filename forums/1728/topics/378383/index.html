              <div id="cnnSCByLine">By Stephanie Chen<br> CNN</div>
              <p><strong>RIVERDALE, Georgia (CNN) </strong>--
              In his darkest moment, Kenneth Brown lost it all. His wife and kids,
              the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he
              was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.</p>
              <p>Trapped in his gloomy
              cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown,
              then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His
              eyes were shut. His body did not move.</p>
              <p>Brown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.</p>
              <p>"I
              try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me
              from getting lost," said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and
              Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.</p>
              <p>"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison," he said.</p>
              <p>Eastern
              religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies,
              20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the
              1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of
              unlikely followers behind prison bars.</p>
              <p>The inmates say meditation
              -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters
              relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.</p>
              <p>"Mostly, the people in <a class="cnninlinetopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/buddhism">Buddhist</a> community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of
              mouth gets from one inmate to another," explained Gary Friedman,
              communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains
              Association. "It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison
              environment."</p>
              <p>There is no group tracking the number of inmates
              converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But
              programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are
              sprouting up across the country.</p>
              <p>Meditation can help the convicts
              find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The
              practice provides them a chance to reflect on their <a class="cnninlinetopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/crime">crimes</a>, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.</p>
              <p>In
              the past five years, books like the "Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for
              Zen Buddhism" and "Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison" have
              emerged.</p>
              <p>"This is transformative justice, as opposed to
              punitive," said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one
              of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and
              Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>Since its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma
              Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist
              principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with
              2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.</p>
              <p>For the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.</p>
              <p>Some
              inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and
              meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist
              practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of
              hours of meditation in a short period of time.</p>
              <p>Buddhism has
              gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming
              the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and
              Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on
              Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves
              Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to
              the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2
              million self-identified Buddhists.</p>
              <p>Some inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and followBuddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.</p>
              <p>The
              practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002.
              The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in <a class="cnninlinetopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/alabama">Alabama</a>,
              was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including
              several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that
              required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.</p>
              <p>One
              inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary "The Dhamma Brothers,"
              said Vipassana was harder than the 8½ years he had spent on death row.
              More than 120 men in Donaldson have gone through Vipassana at least
              once. <span class="cnnembeddedmoslnk"><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/tabs/video.gif" border="0" alt="Video" width="16" height="14"><a href="http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Prison+inmates+go+Zen+to+deal+with+life+behind+bars+-+CNN.com&amp;expire=-1&amp;urlID=412326202&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2009%2FCRIME%2F10%2F09%2Fprison.meditation%2Findex.html&amp;partnerID=212106#cnnSTCVideo">Watch a clip of "The Dhamma Brothers" »</a></span></p>
              <p>"They
              don't feel so close to exploding," said Jenny Phillips, director of the
              film. "They aren't afraid to have conversations with people and to
              express themselves. They aren't always on edge."</p>
              <p>Critics,
              including some prison officials, doubt that meditation works. They
              worry that it may be a tactic to convince parole boards to lighten a
              sentence.</p>
              <p>In areas that are heavily Christian, some wardens are
              uncomfortable with introducing Eastern religions. Alabama prison
              authorities were initially skeptical about meditation but next year
              will designate an open dormitory for inmates going through Vipassana,
              said Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment for the Alabama Department of
              Corrections.</p>
              <p>He said corrections officers have seen lower levels of violence among Donaldson inmates who meditate.</p>
              <p>In
              California, a state where the swollen prison population has resulted in
              dangerously overcrowded prisons, teaching conflict management is
              critical, said Anne Seisen Saunders, a Zen Buddhist instructor who was
              raised Christian.</p>
              <p>Her Prison Meditation Project, based near San
              Diego, began a decade ago in one prison yard. Today, the program has
              expanded to five prisons, with an average of 20 inmates participating
              in each location.</p>
              <p>Last week, the autumn sky transformed from a
              deep purple to light blue outside Kenneth Brown's meager studio
              apartment. Inside, Brown sat on his bed, barefoot and deep in
              concentration, in front of a makeshift altar holding books a photo of
              the Buddha. Traces of incense billowed in the air.</p>
              <p>Brown, now 62,
              resides in Georgia to be near his family. He says he was wrongfully
              convicted of arson. In 2005, a Massachusetts appeals judge reduced his
              sentence from 20 years to nine.</p>
              <p>His body was motionless, his eyes closed and the palms of his hands facing upward.</p>
              <p>These
              days, Brown's practice of mediation helps him tackle the challenges of
              being unemployed with a felony record. The college graduate has been
              rejected from jobs catching stray dogs and cleaning hotel rooms.</p>
              <p>But he's got a lot to be thankful for: His daughters, his grandchildren -- and meditation, he said.</p>
              <p class="cnninline">"I finally feel at peace."</p>
