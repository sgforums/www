              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">i listen to this interesting radio interview of this lady who had é˜´é˜³çœ¼ (Yin Yang Eyes) which serve as a good info of clearly some misunderstanding of ghosts/spirit realm for Buddhists. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">spirits are not only avaliable at night/7thmonth, they can also be avaliable in the day time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">they don't float like in the movie, they walk similarily like human, although they are light, she did saw one that flew from a tree to another tree. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">the look of ghosts are retain after their death. i.e. those who die in bed due to illness, and reborn in ghost realm, they will retain the look. and for those who die in car accident/murdered, they will also be pretty bloody. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">in Buddhism, we say human are 30% scare of ghosts, but ghosts are 70% more afraid of human, other than those who have resentment toward certain ppl.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">it also teach us not to be attach/greedy, etc etc. greed is the main cause in reborning in ghost realm. non believer might think that there's no such thing as ghosts, but we buddhists do believe they exist. </span></p>

              <p><br>i think it's the yin and yang energy they emiting. Human more yang, they are more yin.  so if a person at some point, his/her chi become weak, they can harm you. Buddhas and bodhisattvas' emit even more powerful lights.</p>
              <p>What they do? Too vast to say. Mostly to do with attachment when they are human and suffering from their karma.</p>
              <p>Can they go back to the house they once live in? If there's attachment to the house, yes.</p>
              <p>Where do they go if they can't? They can, and they can also go anywhere. Ghost can pass thru human walls, but cannot pass thru ghost wall. We the other way around.</p>
              <p>Do they spend the night out roaming? Do they talk? Do they walk in groups? yes and no, depends on their attachment.</p>

              <p>As in Proper Dharma Mindfulness Sutra<br> <br> 1. Energy feeding ghost: if one's body is weak or seriously ill,
                                      unless look after by another person, and were to allow these ghosts
                                      to suck away one's energy, one will die.<br> 2. Dharma feeding ghost: they get full when listening to people
                                      preaching good deeds or Dharma.<br> 3. Water feeding ghost: live by drains or river side, water as
                                      their food. so infants and kids should not play near drains or
                                      river side.<br> 4. Blood feeding ghost: often dwell at slaughtering house or wet

                                      women with menstruation. Hence women should be more careful when
                                      cleaning and disposing, so as to avoid affinity with them.<br> 5. Vomit feeding ghost: often approach people who drink alcohol.
                                      Even more love those that are drunk, so as to feed on their
                                      vomits.<br> 6. Dung (smell) feeding ghost: often hide near dark places where
                                      there are pile of excrement.<br> 7. Spit feeding ghost: love to stay closed people who have the
                                      habits of spitting phlegm. Gets excited when people cough, gargle,
                                      or clearing throat.<br> 8. Hair feeding ghost: Live around barber store, Love infant's
                                      hair, or hair of young ladies who are not married.<br> 9. Can't feeding ghost: often look for things/food to feed, but
                                      don't know what to feed, hence often live in hunger.<br> 10. Wicked hoping ghost: Hope that people can cultivate wicked
                                      deeds, and such spirit of wickedness is their satisfaction.<br> 11. Meat feeding ghost: Love to feed on dead smelly animal

              <h3>Miracles</h3>
              <p>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God's name and that the fact
                  that this happens proves that God exists. This is an appealing argument until it is looked at
                  a little more closely.</p>
              <p>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the blind could see, the
                  deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow in producing
                  evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians are so anxious to prove that
                  miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often gets lost in a flood of
                  wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious lies.</p>
              <p>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to explain do sometimes happen
                  during religious events - but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. all
                  claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity certainly does not
                  have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name prove the
                  existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of numerous other
                  gods must likewise prove that they too exist.</p>
              <p><strong>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles occur in other
                  religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the best way to counter
                  this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his enemies accused him of
                  doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the sick results in
                  good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself (Mk 3:22-26).
                  Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, Jews or Sikhs. If
                  these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?</strong></p>
