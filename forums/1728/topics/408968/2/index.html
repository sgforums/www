              <p>IMO, all religions are wonderful as they rise to heaven in this lifespan. Buddhism is a teaching to recover back Buddha nature same as Buddha Sakyamuni. Many master always reminded practitioners to only compare ourselves with Buddha, the highest achiever. Like when we take a flight and look down on earth, earth or ourselves is so small and unnoticeable. My thinking is that if one converts or more appropriately and sweetly to state that other aspects of teachings is best suited him/her aptitude/root, all students of God/Buddha ought to respect their decision and must not brought it up openly. This is not helpful in general.</p>
              <p>Usually ying yang's eyes people is born with it, no problem for them as it is already a norm. What they probably wanted to understand is the rationale of this ghost realm. Ghost was human before they passed away, when they were human, people loves them, but when their karma brought them to ghost realm, the love towards them turns into doubts. It is still matter related to proper education so that all human never will be rebirth into ghost realm to atone their deeds :) May all ghosts in contact with great teachings and be liberated to the land of ultimate bliss.</p>

              <p>I am sure buddhist friends here do not oppose to your learning of Buddhism.<br><br>However, if you really want to know about Buddhism, it is best you can complete a course on it, as there will be more knowledgable teachers there compared to those of us here who are not as well-versed in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>I am not sure what Christians consider satanic. If you find the book that Dawnfirstlight recommends unsuitable, then I assume Christians cannot read religious texts of other religions or their writings as well? But if you learn Buddhist teachings from us here in the forum, is it considered prohibited too?<br><br>If you can't attend a course on Buddhism and can't read Buddhist sutras and books, it will be difficult for you to understand the whole picture about Buddhism by asking on the forums, although we will do our best to help you understand.</p>

              <p>stardust, i don't think religions are contradicting or different. It is the practitioners who can't see the whole picture. Actually there is just one picture, not many pictures, but everyone see just some part of it.  Even within each religion, there are many pictures, many views and sects.  Every fragment seem to be different from the other, but if you have true understanding or realisation or omniscience, there is absolutely no contradiction.</p>
              <p>During the dharma assemblies of Buddha, all the different gods from all the religions appeared.  Some buddhist practitioners also make offerings to the Christian God.  As Buddhists, we do not disrespect your God at all. On the contrary, some masters who have been teaching in America also pray to the Jesus, Mary and the other saints to help them.</p>
              <p>Personally, i believe in things like angels, fairies and the western stuff and respect them too... I don't think you know what is Buddhism. If you know what is Buddhism, then you won't try to compare.  It is pointless.  Christianity is part of Buddhism and Buddhism is always there in Christianity. If you know how to see.</p>
              <p>Even more pointless is comparing healing... healing is like medicine. Does medicine belong to any religion?  Is anti-biotics, ginseng or any kind of medicine belonging to a God or religion?  Think clearly and then you won't have to make u-turns in later part of your life as i think you still go a long road to go, right?</p>

              <p>I don't think ghosts have physical body. They have a mental stream of consciousness and a subtle mental form that can be perceived in a certain state of consciousness.</p>
              <p>Mental energies can interact with the physical via intention. For example, when you intend to do something, the body moves. But the thought or intention is not a physical thing - it is a process of consciousness, the process of mental consciousness is mutually dependent and interactive with the physical in a certain way, but it is not caused by the physical body.</p>
              <p>Ghosts have supernatural powers - they can do things that humans can't do, they can read minds, etc, travel to different places via will of thought, which are beyond classical physical laws - but when you consider things like<a class="l" href="http://twm.co.nz/hologram.html"> The Universe as a Hologram</a>, then it all seems entirely possible.</p>
