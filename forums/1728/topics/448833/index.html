              <div class="content">Infinity, Eternity, &amp; Immortality in Dogen’s Existence-Time<br><br>When
               the abstract speculator posits a gap between existence and experience, 
              they simultaneously divide existence from time. As the Zen practitioner 
              perceives existence (sees what they are seeing), so they also exist in 
              time. Dogen, who consistently maintains the Mahayana tenet that all 
              dharmas are mind, frequently reminds us that we only experience 
              (perceive) real thoughts and things at specific places (of existence) 
              and definite moments (of time). <br><br>As “time” is inherent to all 
              experiences, “place” (or space) is inherent to all existences. This is a
               principle that corresponds to Dogen’s refrain about the unity of “true 
              form” and “true nature.” For Dogen, every particular expression of 
              Buddha nature is a manifestation of existence-and-experience, thus of 
              existence-and-time. More specifically every dharma (thing, being, 
              instance, etc.) is a particular manifestation of existence-time (uji), 
              not existence “plus” time, but a singular unit of existence-time. Here 
              we is where we encounter Dogen’s view of “eternity.” <br><br>Dogen, like
               all Mahayanists, firmly denied the existence of any kind of an eternal,
               unchanging self. One of the first laws of Buddhism is that all things 
              are impermanent. While this assertion usually ends right there, Dogen 
              urged us to look deeper and ask, what then, is impermanence? To clarify 
              this, consider these words from the important Bussho fascicle of 
              Shobogenzo:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is constantly 
              saintly is impermanent and what is constantly ordinary is impermanent. 
              The view that those who are just ordinary people and not saintly ones, 
              and thus must lack Buddha Nature, is a foolish opinion held by some 
              folks who are small-minded; such a view constitutes a narrow perspective
               which their intellect has conjectured. For the small-minded, ‘Buddha’ 
              is a body and ‘Nature’ is its functioning, which is the very reason why 
              the Sixth Ancestor said, “What is impermanent is, of course, Buddha 
              Nature.” <br><br>What seems constant has simply not yet undergone 
              change. ‘Not yet undergone change’ means that, even though we may shift 
              our perspective to our subjective self or shift it to the objective, 
              outer world, in both cases there are no signs of change to be found. In 
              that sense, it is constant. As a consequence, grasses and trees, as well
               as thickets and forests, are impermanent and, accordingly, they are 
              Buddha Nature. It is the same with the human body and mind, both of 
              which are impermanent and, accordingly, they are Buddha Nature. The 
              mountains and rivers in the various lands are impermanent, so, 
              accordingly, they are Buddha Nature. Supreme, fully perfected 
              enlightenment is Buddha Nature, and hence it is impermanent. The 
              Buddha’s great entry into nirvana was impermanent, and hence it is 
              Buddha Nature.<br>Shobogenzo, Bussho, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>Dogen’s
               explanation of the meaning of “constant” (eternal, unchanging, 
              non-changing) is elucidated by Hee-Jin Kim in his Flowers of Emptiness 
              as follows:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">That is, permanence 
              means the steadfast quality of the Buddha-nature which exerts itself 
              totally and drops itself off completely in each and every situation. In 
              this respect, the impermanent is permanent, the permanent is 
              impermanent.<br>Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.91</span><br><br>Eternity
               (constancy, permanence) for Dogen is not unending time; eternity is 
              only and always “now.” This is not the same “now” that is professed by 
              new-age philosophers, nor is it the now of the “present” in the 
              categories of “past, present, and future,” this now is the eternal 
              itself in which is contained the entirety of the past, present, and 
              future. Nor is it the “eternal self” that is posited by some 
              naturalists, like the Shrenikans (a school of naturalism in India), 
              which is imagined as a self (and, or a universe) of symmetrically 
              organized unchanging perfection, or undifferentiated oneness. As is 
              clear from Dogen’s refutations of such notions, such a self would not be
               eternal at all; it would only be a static (and stagnant) existence, 
              conceptually cut-off from time, which, in Dogen’s Zen would not qualify 
              as a real existence at all.<br><br>As the inevitable result of 
              speculatively abstracting “existence” from existence-time, “time” too 
              loses its significance by becoming antithetical to existence. As an 
              “eternal self” would be nothing more than a stagnant petrifaction in the
               absence of time, so time in the absence of existence would be an 
              unbounded, unimaginable obscurity whose only possible symbols would be 
              impenetrable darkness and insanity. Such abstract notions of time have 
              led to equally abstract, and often horrific, notions and interpretations
               of karma and causality that are on a par with the darkest fatalistic 
              visions of determinism and predestination.<br><br>The eternity seen 
              through the Dharma-eye, on the other hand, reveals that real time is 
              only and always clearly and distinctly perceptible. When Dogen 
              delineates time in general aspects, like “past, present, or future,” we 
              need to remember his position regarding “generalization” (i.e. “general 
              dharmas” do not exist). Failing this, we might, for example, try to 
              imagine some time “after” the future or “before” the past – all such 
              notions amount to abstract conceptualization which has no significance 
              to practice-enlightenment here and now. Such theorizing only leads to 
              biases and ungrounded assumptions. Dogen’s explanation about the 
              significance of the Buddhist doctrine that “form is emptiness” also 
              applies to time and eternity. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Although
               in the statement, “Material form is the same as being empty,” material 
              form is not being forced into becoming empty, and emptiness is not being
               split up to manufacture material form, the ‘being devoid’ of which he 
              spoke is that of ‘being devoid is what emptiness means’. The  ‘being 
              devoid’ of ‘being devoid is what emptiness means’ is synonymous with 
              Master SekisÅ� Keisho’s calling it “a stone in space.” So, this is how 
              the Fourth and Fifth Ancestors inquired into and talked about the 
              non-possessing of Buddha Nature, about the emptiness of Buddha Nature, 
              and about the existence of Buddha Nature.<br>Shobogenzo, Bussho, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>That
               the “past,” for instance, is “eternal,” does not mean that past 
              dharmas, like “last night’s moon,” or “the ‘I’ that crossed mountains 
              yesterday,” have been transformed, blended, or merged into eternity, nor
               was the eternal somehow divided up, or broken into pieces like “last 
              night’s moon,” or “the ‘I’ that crossed mountains yesterday.” In other 
              words, last night’s moon, and the “I” that crossed mountains yesterday, 
              are eternity itself; last night’s moon is not tonight’s moon, each are 
              particular instances of the whole of eternity itself, not just “bits” or
               “pieces” of eternity. Here, eternity appears as last night’s moon, 
              there, eternity appears as Dogen departing Japan for China. When Dogen 
              is illumined, the moon is darkened, when the moon is illumined, Dogen is
               darkened. <br><br>In Shobogenzo, Uji, Dogen defines uji 
              (existence-time) as meaning “that time is unmistakably ‘existence’ and 
              ‘existence’ is invariably ‘time’” (Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.224). 
              Note the implication of the term “invariably” here in connection with 
              Dogen’s elucidation of “constancy” mentioned a moment ago. For Dogen, 
              each dharma (thing, being, instant, etc.) is, as it is, the whole of 
              eternity.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“…we should see that every event, every thing in this entire world is a time.”<br>Shobogenzo, Uji, Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.224-225</span><br><br>The
               “every event” and “every thing” that are considered by Dogen as “a” 
              time, are not general events, or general things, they are actual, 
              specific dharmas – the very events and things manifesting before us at 
              this present, eternal moment. Here we see how the “existence” of myriad 
              dharmas and the ceaselessly (constant) “experience” of the self (the 
              true person) are two perspectives of a unified, dynamically entangled, 
              actualization of the universe (genjokoan); the one perspective is the 
              “eternal,” the other perspective is the “infinite.” Thus:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The self arrays itself and sees itself in array. This is the principle of the self being time.<br><br>We
               should learn that, because of this principle, myriad phenomena and 
              countless things exist throughout the entire earth, and that each and 
              every particularity, be it of a thing or of phenomenon, exists as the 
              entire earth. Such a consideration is the beginning of training…<br><br>Because there is no other time than this very moment, “existence-time” is always entire time.<br>Shobogenzo, Uji, Hee-Jin Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, p.225</span><br><br>Dogen
               tells us that the “ordinary (unawakened) person,” being “untutored in 
              the Buddha-dharma continues to have his/her own view of time,” which he 
              sums up as, “The mountains and rivers [I experienced in the past] are as
               separate from me as heaven from earth” (Kim, Flowers of Emptiness, 
              p.225). <br><br>Such views arise from abstract theories based on 
              speculations of “eternity” as consisting of “never-ending” time, and 
              equally speculative notions of “infinity” as a “never-ending” number of 
              “things,” “space,” or “events.” Attaining the goal of Buddhism 
              (liberation, nirvana, Buddhahood, etc.) is, in Dogen’s teachings, 
              contingent on overcoming these narrow, limiting viewpoints, by learning,
               practicing, and verifying the vision depicted by the Buddha Dharma, 
              which “is the beginning of training.” <br><br>While the self of the 
              “ordinary person,” being a false construction to begin with, dies with 
              the present body-mind, the self of the “Buddha ancestor” (Zen 
              practitioner), being the one true person to begin with, survives as the 
              entirety of the universe (koan) that he or she has actualized (made 
              actual, expressed, manifested). This means, according to Dogen, that all
               expressions of truth, of genuine wisdom, and real compassion are 
              eternal, while all falsity of views, imitative or automatic (routine, 
              unthinking) activity, and abstract notions vanish, or rather, are never 
              really actualized. <br><br>As experience is existence, the measure of 
              which each individual is eternal is the measure of which they 
              authentically experience eternity. Thus, in Dogen’s view, immortality is
               not envisioned as the endurance, or the extinguishment, of the 
              individual in an undifferentiated oneness, a divine essence, life force,
               or any other kind of homogenized energy, nature, or being. Eternity, or
               the eternal, for Dogen, only and always refers to actual, specific, 
              particular expressions of truth.<br><br>As “time,” for Dogen always 
              means existence-time (uji), “existence” too, is always existence-time; 
              and as time is always specific, existence is always particular and 
              definite also.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Face-to-Face 
              Transmission of the great Full Enlightenment and the Mind seal will 
              involve a particular moment in a definite place.<br>Shobogenzo, Menju, Hubert Nearman</span><br><br>Now
               “place” indicates the fact that existent things (real dharmas) occupy 
              specific locations, which means that things are forms or bodies in 
              space. That is, the “existence” of existence-time means “bodily 
              existence in space.” The “Dharma-position” occupied by each and every 
              real dharma is a specific existence-time. All particular things, from 
              mountains and rivers to hallucinations and fleeting thoughts are dharmas
               (things, beings, events) that occupy specific Dharma-positions. That 
              lamp, this tea, that birdsong and every other specific dharma is, as it 
              is, the whole of existence-time coming forth as this or that particular 
              dharma. One actual chirp of a cricket, for example, is a specific 
              coordinate (Dharma-position) of the whole of space-time. To hear that 
              particular chirp with the “whole body-mind” (in zazen) is to 
              “experience” the whole of existence-time, and is to experience the true 
              person (our own true self) – we illumine the Buddha mind by hearing that
               chirp, while simultaneously that chirp advances and confirms us (our 
              true self). There are no dharma experiences apart from the body-mind, 
              and there is no body-mind apart from dharma experiences. Thus, in 
              Dogen’s Buddha Dharma:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the 
              truth of Buddha and in the house of Buddha, we just illuminate the mind 
              by seeing forms and realize the truth by hearing sounds; there is 
              nothing else at all. A state that is like this, being already in the 
              Buddha’s truth, should preach, “To those who must be saved through this 
              body, I will manifest at once this body and preach the Dharma.” Truly, 
              there is no preaching of Dharma without manifestation of the body, and 
              there can be no salvation that is not the preaching of Dharma.<br>Himitsu-shÅ�bÅ�genzÅ� (Secret ShÅ�bÅ�genzÅ�), Butsu-kÅ�jÅ�-no-ji, Gudo Nishijima &amp; Mike (Chodo) Cross</span><br><br>Thus,
               in Dogen’s view of the nonduality of existence and time, we find that 
              the principles concerning time (and eternity) also apply to existence 
              (and infinity). When we speculate on abstract notions of time, time 
              seems to extend from an unknowable beginning to an unknowable future. 
              Likewise, our view of existence (or space) stretches outward around us 
              to an unbounded horizon. Thus, to the “ordinary person,” who cuts time 
              and existence into two, both appear vague, obscure, and mysterious. <br><br>The
               fact that to the unawakened eye, the “infinity of existence” and the 
              “eternity of time,” appear indefinite, has led to numerous ill-conceived
               “explanations” of reality, Buddha nature, Zen, enlightenment, true 
              nature, etc. as being “unexplainable” (incommunicable, indescribable, 
              ineffable, and other negative terms). According to Dogen, however, seen 
              through the Dharma-eye, the infinite is never indefinite, the eternal 
              never concealed. Infinity and eternity, being two aspects of the unity 
              of existence-time is “infinitely-eternal” and therefore, the eternal 
              experience (time) of infinite space (existence) is always and only
