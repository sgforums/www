              practices come in countless different forms, so what I am covering is
              limited and general. Also, I have written on the importance of Right
              View (near the bottom) that is required for the arising of Prajna
              wisdom, the insight into Emptiness (Stage 6 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>). </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Much of the following post is based on what Thusness/PasserBy have said. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><strong><br>Self Inquiry</strong><br><br>Some
              practices are very helpful in giving an initial glimpse of Presence.
              The I AMness can be experienced through practices where the object of
              concentration is the Self. One of such practices is self-inquiry. This
              is most widely practiced throughout Advaita Vedanta but also practiced
              in some some Zen/Ch'an (as Koan practice), Tibetan (Mahamudra and
              Dzogchen), Theravada (Thai Forest tradition) traditions of Buddhism.
              Through this practice the practitioner can experience the I AMness (see
              Stage 1 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>, where Thusness experienced I AMness through the Self-Inquiry of <em>"Before Birth, Who am I?"</em>).
              It can be a question "Who am I" that leads one to the experience of the
              subject-object becoming one, i.e. attaining absorption. Till a point
              the practitioner simply experiences a pure sense of existence. This
              leads to a deep and ultimate conviction, that certainty beyond doubt of
              your very own existence -- "I AM". Though it is important to have
              certainty of our luminosity, this pure sense of existence as being
              ever-present and never lost, such mode of experiencing has no
              understanding of its non-dual luminous clarity and its nature as Anatta
              (Buddhist term for No-Self) and Sunyata (Buddhist term for Emptiness.)<br><br>Apart
              from recommending the practice Vipassana (insight meditation), Thusness
              sometimes (depending on conditions and the practitioners' inclinations)
              also recommend the practice of self-inquiry to practitioners (sometimes
              he would ask them to contemplate on questions such as, <em>“Without using any languages, ‘I’, ‘me’ or any signs or symbols, how is ‘I’ experienced?”</em>). However, this practice does not provide further insights into the non-dual and Empty nature of Presence.<br><br>Although
              having glimpses of this Presence is important, it cannot be
              misunderstood as the final aim. It cannot even be treated as any sort
              of arising insight that liberates us from suffering. It's nature tends
              to be misunderstood, and hence appears to the practitioner as a
              void/formless background witness, an Eternal Witness, or a Self/Atman.
              It's nature as No-Self and Emptiness (not 'Void', but as Dependent
              Origination) isn't realised.<br><br>(Related: Also see a good youtube video by Vishrant on the downside of self inquiry -- <a title="Satsang with Vishrant  self inquiry" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQMhKJ_nPMk">Satsang with <strong>Vishrant self inquiry</strong></a>.
              He too implied that Self-Inquiry can lead to the I AM experience (he
              calls it awareness turning on itself) but that realisation/experience
              of "awareness aware of itself is really only the beginning, it is not
              the end, it is only the first day in kindergarten". Yes, of course,
              because that is only Stage 1 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>.
              He also talks of the downside of Self-Inquiry as potentially being
              misused into avoiding painful/unpleasant experiences by turning
              awareness upon itself and avoid/escape everything, and also on the
              'technique' he prefer -- the 'surrendering to/allowing' whatever
              appearing, and thus dissolving the self.)<br><br><strong>Dropping/Dissolving and Mindfulness/Naked Awareness/Bare Attention</strong><br><br>The key point about the practice of mindful awareness (see <a href="http://www.budsas.org/%7Eanson/ebud/mfneng/mind13.htm">Chapter 13: Mindfulness (Sati)</a> of 'Mindfulness In Plain English' by Venerable Henepola Gunaratana, on
              the practice of Mindfulness and its relation to Vipassana/Insight
              Meditation) is there is no keeping of the mind on anything (including
              on the I AM as in the case of self inquiry) and by not resting on
              anything, it fuses into everything; therefore it cannot be
              concentrated; rather it is to relax into nothingness empty of self,
              empty of any artificial doing so that the natural luminosity can take
              its own course. There is no focusing, there is only allowing the mirror
              bright clarity to shine with its natural radiance. In essence there is
              no one there, only the phenomenon arising and ceasing according to
              conditions, telling their stories.<br><br>As Longchen/Simpo wrote, <em>"No
              subject-object division is the true nature of existence. The method of
              realising this insight lies in the dissolving of the 'sense of self'.
              This often involves the continual and correct letting go of mental
              grasping."</em> (<a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-misinfo.html">The misconceptions surrounding Transcendental Non duality</a>)<br><br>So,
              drop and dissolve away into vivid non-dual luminosity. Dissolve
              completely and arise as the scenery, sound, taste, smell, thoughts,
              touch sensations.<br><br>The ultimate purpose of dropping is to allow non-dual experience to arise.<br><br>There
              are certain types of people who advocate on the uselessness of practice
              (particularly the Neo-Advaitins), and that asking people to 'do
              practices' simply strengthens their sense of self. However, what is
              being spoken here is essentially not a 'doing'. It can more accurately
              be known as a 'non-doing'.<br><br>Nothing needs to be done here, as
              every single moment is it, and so there is no striving towards a
              'better state' -- every state is equally pure, equally the expression
              of Buddha-Nature. This is It! Hence, as Longchen/Simpo wrote,<br><br></span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: small;">...However,
              there can be no progressing from a dualistic state into a non-dual
              state. Every single moment is it! There is no one state better than the
              rest! Every moment is as it is.<br><br>There is absolutely no need to
              do anything. Even if the efforting or anything arise, let it be! The
              effort arises automatically too... no-self there too!<br><br>By doing nothing, everything arises and passes away on its own accord.<br><br>Actually, there cannot be a 'doing nothing'... There can only be 'what is' at any single moment."</span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br>Thusness/PasserBy said,<br></span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: small;"><br>"...it
              seems that lots of effort need to be put in -- which is really not the
              case. The entire practice turns out to an undoing process. It is a
              process of gradually understanding the workings of our nature that is
              from beginning liberated but clouded by this sense of ‘self’ that is
              always trying to preserve, protect and ever attached. The entire sense
              of self is a ‘doing’. Whatever we do, positive or negative, is still
              doing. Ultimately there is not-even a letting go or let be, as there is
              already continuous dissolving and arising and this ever dissolving and
              arising turns out to be self-liberating. Without this ‘self’ or ‘Self’,
              there is no ‘doing’, there is only spontaneous arising.<br><br>(source: <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462">Non-dual and karmic patterns</a>)</span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br>As
              mentioned earlier, this is not a form of exercise in concentration or
              focused attention, but dropping and only Dharma spontaneously arising.
              (Also see </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/09/six-stages-of-dropping.html">Six Stages of Dropping</a></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> by Thusness)<br><br>Awareness
              or Buddha-Nature is not the same as focused attention or concentration.
              Awareness is effortlessly happening right now, whether you like it or
              not, and whether you are paying attention or not. When causes and
              conditions is, manifestation is, when manifestation is, Awareness is.
              Naturally, sounds are </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">effortlessly</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> being heard, smells are </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">effortlessly </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">being
              smelled, even if the smell or sound is unpleasant and you try to avoid
              it, it's being awared. While paying attention to the breath, something
              still hears sounds. That is Buddha-Nature. It is the sum of all our
              parts, that which sees, hears, feels and tastes all at once as One
              Reality. Before you think that this awareness is a 'thing' -- a Mirror
              or a Witness, it's not separate -- it's just sound hearing, scenery
              seeing, it's not a something tangible (a Mirror or a Witness) yet is
              vividly manifesting.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">So as Toni Packer said, </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><em>"There
              is no need for awareness to turn anywhere. It's here! Everything is
              here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no
              one who does it. Awareness and the sound of a plane are here with no
              one in the middle trying to "do" them or bring them together. They are
              here together! The only thing that keeps things (and people) apart is
              the "me"-circuit with its separative thinking. When that is quiet,
              divisions do not exist."</em> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br><br>Joan Tollifson ("student" of Toni), "This
              open being is not something to be practiced methodically. Toni points
              out that it takes no effort to hear the sounds in the room; it's all
              here. There's no "me" (and no problem) until thought comes in and says:
              "Am I doing it right? Is this 'Awareness'? Am I enlightened?" Suddenly
              the spaciousness is gone—the mind is occupied with a story and the
              emotions it generates."<br><br>Also very helpful in the practice
              of mindful awareness is to contemplate (means, to experience in direct
              awareness) on certain pointers and instructions that the Buddha gave.
              For example, one can meditate based on the Bahiya Sutta (see </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html">The Buddha on Non-Duality</a></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">),</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> <strong><br><br></strong></span> <span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><strong>In seeing, there is only the seen,</strong><br><strong>In hearing, there is only sound</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">,</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> <strong><br>In sensing, there is only sensation</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">,</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> <strong><br>In thinking, there is only thought</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br><br>By contemplating as such, insight into Anatta (No-Self) can arise.</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">What
              should be noted also is that whatever said is really “already is”. In
              seeing, there is always only the seen. In hearing there is always only
              the sound. Never was there a seer or hearer. All “already is”. Anatta
              is not just a non-dual experience, it must be regarded as a dharma
              seal, </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">the ever-present nature of reality. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">That
              all along the dichotomy of a observer and observed duality is an
              illusion created by due to our deeply rooted inherent and dualistic
              tendency of seeing things.<br><br>From the comments section in </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">,</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br><br><em><strong>...If
              a practitioner were to feel that he has gone beyond the experiences
              from ‘I hear sound’ to a stage of ‘becoming sound’ or takes that ‘there
              is just mere sound’, then this experience is again distorted. For in
              actual case, there is and always is only sound when hearing; never was
              there a hearer to begin with. Nothing attained for it is always so...<br><br></strong></em></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">....This is the seal of no-self and can be realized and experienced in all moments; not just a mere concept...</span> <span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br><br>Next,
              in thinking, only thought: but what is thought? In your direct
              awareness you can notice that it is a kind of phenomena just like
              sound, sight, etc, but a different kind of phenomena. In Buddhism,
              there are 6 senses instead of the commonly accepted 5 senses within
              Science. Everything is the same, except that we include 'mind' in it.
              Thought is not seen with eyes, it is not heard with ears, yet the
              thought is undeniably present when it arises. Images are recalled,
              mental reasoning arises, relating, pondering, mental images and words
              appearing and then disappearing and then another appearing. But what is
              more important is that it is a 'knowing' or 'luminous' phenomenon. All
              along the transience rolls and knows; no watcher is real or needed.
              This thought, and another thought, and another thought, each thought is
              a complete and luminous manifestation of Buddha-Nature.</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br><br>If
              we fail to see that each thought is a self-luminous/'knowing'
              manifestation, the tendency is to push, to relate to a 'center', a
              Self, a source, a background Knower/Witness, a void and limitless
              container. We think that Buddha Nature is not a thought, it is not the
              transience, it is the invisible Witness of thoughts, the void
              background wherein thoughts arise from and return to, itself
              unchanging. And that is a mistake. When we fail to see that there is no
              separation, we choose to stay as a Witness/Source, not realising All
              Appearances are the equally the Source/Witness, there is nothing to
              choose. So this 'practice' is really about 'choiceless awareness'.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">See:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.deepspring.org/library_dharma_talks_basic_talks/Basic_Talks_04.htm">Choiceless Awareness and Non-Fixation</a></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"> by Aaron</span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: small;"><br>Choiceless
              awareness means to rest in whatever is present, understanding the
              conditioned nature of its arising and that whatever has arisen is an
              expression of the pure heart/mind, an expression of God. Seeing that,
              you cease to take a dual stance against that which has arisen, but let
              it point you back into the ground of your being, the divine core. Here
              equanimity is present, equanimity with arising, neither grasping or
              pushing away. For this "choiceless awareness" to be truly choiceless,
              everything that arises must be seen as divine play, divine expression.
              No exceptions. The difficulty is that you do make exceptions, taking
              stance against that which you judge as "other-than," the fear, anger,
              desire. Even this "other-than" judgment is not what fogs in your peace.
              Delusion grows from the belief that this arising thought is true and
              from the contractions that form about it.</span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br>When
              we know our nature as empty-luminosity, we'll see all as "ME". The "I
              AM" is not more "ME" than a passing thought, a passing sound, a moment
              of sensation when the feet touches the ground. There is no Self apart

              one must feel the difference between "In thinking just thought" and the

              each thought is unsupported, discrete and complete yet... and hence
              there is no chaining of one thought to another. Same goes to sight,

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Is
              there in you an entity which you call the 'I' or the 'mind' or the
              'self'? Is there a co- ordinator who is co-ordinating what you are
              looking at with what you are listening to, what you are smelling with
              what you are tasting, and so on? Or is there anything which links
              together the various sensations originating from a single sense -- the
              flow of impulses from the eyes, for example? Actually, there is always
              a gap between any two sensations. The co-ordinator bridges that gap: he
              establishes himself as an illusion of continuity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In
              the natural state there is no entity who is co-ordinating the messages
              from the different senses. Each sense is functioning independently in
              its own way. When there is a demand from outside which makes it
              necessary to co-ordinate one or two or all of the senses and come up
              with a response, still there is no co-ordinator, but there is a
              temporary state of co- ordination. There is no continuity; when the
              demand has been met, again there is only the unco-ordinated,
              disconnected, disjointed functioning of the senses. This is always the
              case. Once the continuity is blown apart -- not that it was ever there;
              but the illusory continuity -- it's finished once and for all.<br></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Your
              movement of thought interferes with the process of touch, just as it
              does with the other senses. Anything you touch is always translated as
              'hard', 'soft', 'warm', 'cold', 'wet', 'dry', and so on. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">You
              do not realize it, but it is your thinking that creates your own body.
              Without this thought process there is no body consciousness -- which is
              to say there is no body at all. My body exists for other people; it
              does not exist for me; there are only isolated points of contact,
              impulses of touch which are not tied together by thought. So the body
              is not different from the objects around it; it is a set of sensations
              like any others. Your body does not belong to you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Perhaps
              I can give you the 'feel' of this. I sleep four hours at night, no
              matter what time I go to bed. Then I lie in bed until morning fully
              awake. I don't know what is lying there in the bed; I don't know
              whether I'm lying on my left side or my right side -- for hours and
              hours I lie like this. If there is any noise outside -- a bird or
              something -- it just echoes in me. I listen to the "flub-dub-flub-dub"
              of my heart and don't know what it is. There is no body between the two
              sheets -- the form of the body is not there. If the question is asked,
              "What is in there?" there is only an awareness of the points of
              contact, where the body is in contact with the bed and the sheets, and
              where it is in contact with itself, at the crossing of the legs, for
              example. There are only the sensations of touch from these points of
              contact, and the rest of the body is not there. There is some kind of
              heaviness, probably the gravitational pull, something very vague. There
              is nothing inside which links up these things. Even if the eyes are
              open and looking at the whole body, there are still only the points of
              contact, and they have no connection with what I am looking at. If I
              want to try to link up these points of contact into the shape of my own
              body, probably I will succeed, but by the time it is completed the body
              is back in the same situation of different points of contact. The
              linkage cannot stay. It is the same sort of thing when I'm sitting or
              standing. There is no body.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Can you
              tell me how mango juice tastes? I can't. You also cannot; but you try
              to relive the memory of mango juice now -- you create for yourself some
              kind of an experience of how it tastes -- which I cannot do. I must
              have mango juice on my tongue -- seeing or smelling it is not enough --
              in order to be able to bring that past knowledge into operation and to
              say "Yes, this is what mango juice tastes like." This does not mean
              that personal preferences and 'tastes' change. In a market my hand
              automatically reaches out for the same items that I have liked all my
              life. But because I cannot conjure up a mental experience, there can be
              no craving for foods which are not there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Smell
              plays a greater part in your daily life than does taste. The olfactory
              organs are constantly open to odors. But if you do not interfere with
              the sense of smell, what is there is only an irritation in the nose. It
              makes no difference whether you are smelling cow dung or an expensive
              French perfume -- you rub the nose and move on.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">..............</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">You
              have a feeling that there is a 'cameraman' who is directing the eyes.
              But left to themselves -- when there is no 'cameraman' -- the eyes do
              not linger, but are moving all the time. They are drawn by the things
              outside. Movement attracts them, or brightness or a color which stands
              out from whatever is around it. There is no 'I' looking; mountains,
              flowers, trees, cows, all look at me. The consciousness is like a
              mirror, reflecting whatever is there outside. The depth, the distance,
              the color, everything is there, but there is nobody who is translating
              these things. Unless there is a demand for knowledge about what I am
              looking at, there is no separation, no distance from what is there. It
              may not actually be possible to count the hairs on the head of someone
              sitting across the room, but there is a kind of clarity which seems as
              if I could. </span></p>

              when you are introduced (to your own intrinsic awareness), the method

              <p>Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything. </p>

              in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own condition

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><br>Right View</strong><br><br>Right
              View is indispensible in Buddhism, it is the 1st of the 8 fold path.
              And that view essentially, is Emptiness/Dependent Origination.<br><br>In
              Buddhism, the path (naked awareness of everything as it is) alone
              cannot lead to fruition (liberation), having right view (Emptiness) is
              necessary and crucial. That is, only through having the right view with
              the right practices (path) then fruition of liberation can arise.<br><br>Even
              after the arising of non-dual insight, there is a period of desync
              between what is experienced and the existing paradigm we used to
              orientate the world. It is a de-synchronization between views and
              meditative experience. That is, a practitioner will find great
              difficulties when trying to express the experience based on a
              subject/object dichotomy. It can be quite frustrating and the
              practitioner may get himself confused during the process.<br><br>In
              Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate ourselves
              non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of Emptiness. It is a raft but
              it is the antidote for the conventional mind to orientate itself in a
              non-dual and non-local context. It also led to the amazing insight that
              ‘duality’ is really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’.<br><br>In the practice of non-conceptuality, the firm establishment of right view is not a problem.<br>In the practice of thoughtlessness, thought is not a problem.<br>In the practice of selflessness, self is not a problem.<br><br>Experiences
              of our non-dual nature can still surface intermittently even when the
              tendency to see things dualistically is still strong. At times when the
              layer that divides is temporary suspended, non-dual is most vivid and
              clear and practitioners may wrongly conclude that ‘concepts’ are the
              problem because the presence of ‘concepts’ divides and prevent the
              non-dual experience. This seems logical and reasonable only to a mind
              that is deeply root in a subject/object dichotomy. Very quickly
              ‘non-conceptuality’ becomes an object of practice. The process of
              objectification is the result of the tendency in action perpetually
              repeating itself taking different forms like an endless loop. This can
              continue to the extent that a practitioner can even ‘fear’ to establish
              concepts without knowing it. On the other hand, the continuous enquiry
              can also lead an inquirer into a situation of utter confusion to the
              extent that he/she doubts even his/her own existence.<br><br>It is not
              uncommon to find practitioners totally giving up this attempt to
              synchronize "views" and experience and conclude that it is an absolute
              futile endeavor to do that. They prefer to rest fully in naked
              awareness.<br><br>By doing so, the practitioner will miss something valuable -- the insight of the importance of "non inherent existence".</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
              fact, dualistic view is merely a subset of seeing things 'inherently'.
              Further understanding will also reveal that the bad habit of
              'searching' is the result of seeing things 'inherently'. Our inability
              to sustain a non-dual experience is also the result of it. The
              formation of a 'center' that we are so unwilling to give up is merely a
              natural phenomenon of our deeply held 'inherent' views.<br><br>Like
              a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front of an observer,
              the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in
              actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species
              (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an attribute of the
              mind... and in Buddhism we recognise that there are other realms'
              beings who can see something completely different. If given a “quantum
              eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no
              attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void
              with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are
              dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or
              fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet
              empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective existence. What
              gives rise to the differences of colours and experiences in each of us?
              Dependent arising... hence empty of inherent existence. This is the
              nature of all phenomena. They are empty of any inherent objective
              existence in a 'really-out-there' kind of way.<br><br>As you've seen,
              there is no ‘The Flowerness’ seen by a dog, an insect or us, or beings
              from other realms (which really may have a completely different mode of
              perception). ‘'The Flowerness' is an illusion that does not stay even
              for a moment, merely an aggregate of causes and conditions. Analogous
              to the example of ‘flowerness’, there is no ‘selfness’ serving as a
              background witnessing either -- pristine awareness is not the
              witnessing background. Rather, the entire whole of the moment of
              manifestation is our pristine awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of
              inherent existence. This is the way of ‘seeing’ the one as many, the
              observer and the observed are one and the same. This is also the
              meaning of formlessness and attributelessness of our nature. But this
              does not mean that awareness is void or nothing, it is full of forms,
              full of colours, as Emptiness is Form... just empty of 'inherent
              existence'. So Emptiness, in Buddhism, strictly means Dependent Arising.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">...Apophaticism
              rests on the idea that ultimate nature is somewhere else, than the
              realm in which we live. Utterly removed from, and different from, the
              realm of experience, ultimacy can then only be accessed through a step
              by step process which disengages me from this realm in which I dwell.
              In other words, apophaticism and mysticism are dualistic, creating a
              division in existence, minimally between the conceptual and ultimacy,
              and in extreme cases between ultimacy and everything which I experience.<br><br>My
              understanding of the Dharma does not regard the realm in which I dwell
              as removed from the ultimate nature of Interdependent Transformation.
              Ultimacy does not exist somewhere else. It is not a matter of
              contacting some other domain in order to access ultimacy. Rather it is
              a matter of shifting our attention so that I can perceive and
              comprehend the actuality of things. From this perspective, my
              understanding of existence is misconstrued and my perception of things
              is askew. The purpose of Dharma study and practice is to correct these
              misunderstandings, both conceptually and perceptually, to overcome
              ignorance and the habits that give rise to this ignorance. When that is
              done, the ultimate nature of all existing things and existence itself,
              stands forth as the Interdependent Transformation nature which
              permeates all of existence, unlocated, ever present, never far.<br><br>I
              realize that this way of comprehending the Dharma sets me at odds with
              those traditions which regard the ultimate nature of existence, Buddha
              Nature, Nirvana, as something which can not be accessed through study
              and thinking. I can only say that at one time I agreed with this view,
              but that my undersanding has now moved to a view which encompasses
              thought, conceptuality, study, and thinking within the domain of
              ultimacy without ejecting anything else from that domain. To set
              thought aside, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation,
              makes no more sense than asking someone to set aside hearing, or to set
              aside seeing. Just as all visual phenomena have the nature of
              Interdependent Transformation, just as all sonic phenomena have the
              nature of Interdependent Transformation, so also all thoughts, all
              concepts, also have the nature of Interdependent Transformation. For
              this reason rejecting thoughts and concepts means limiting the extent
              of the play of ultimate nature. But Buddha Nautre as Interdependent
              Transformation marks all existing things. Marking all existing things,
              this nature marks all thoughts. Marking all thoughts and concepts,
              thoughts and concepts, when comprehended in their totality, and as
              Interdependent Transformations, graciously display the true nature of
              all existing things. Words also have a luminously clear nature.
              Thoughts also sparkle with elemental transformative energy. Concepts
              also shimmer with the ever flowing and present energy of all things.
              Rejecting nothing, the words of the Dharma compassionately guide me to
              ultimate realization...</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><br>Because
              liberation is empty of the four extremes (existence, non-existence,
              both existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence),
              it is difficult to see. It is better and safer to practice with the
              firm establishment of right view as taught by Buddha. When we practice,
              the path of practice should be non-conceptual whether in bare attention
              or surrendering or dropping. When we have certain direct and
              transcendental experience, the experience must be validated with the
              right view. If both views and practices coincide and liberation is
              experienced from moment to moment, the holding of ‘right view’ will
              naturally dissolve in its own accord as it is fully authenticated in
              real time from moment to moment.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When
              the view and experience are harmonized, the practitioner can progress
              further. He rests neither in concepts nor non-conceptuality.<br><br>Of
              course, having the right view without right practice will also not bear
              fruit and simply remains an intellectual view/understanding. Right view
              (1st of the 8 Fold Path), right practice (remaining 7 of the 8 Fold
              Path), then fruition.<br><br>(Also see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/thusnesss-reply-to-longchen-at.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/thusnesss-reply-to-longchen-at.html</a>)</p>
