            <div class='col-md body'>it is not very advisable. because owning pets = creating ignorant affinity. perhaps some day they might become ur sons and daughters. some people even love their pets more than their parents, not so good... u can shower and bathe ur pets when its sick... when ur parents get old and sick will u do the same?<br><br>nevertheless i am personally not against pets and animals. lama zopa rinpoche recommend that we rename our pets to a buddhist name, e.g Om Mani Padme Hum. this will make the pet create karmic seeds of dharma. next life might become Buddhist who knows.</div>

Animals belong to the ignorant catergory, which is quite obvious why, that is why I said that.<br><br>When you marry, it creates the affinity that binds u and her under samsaric rebirth together.

It seems that animals are regarded differently in Tibetan Buddhism. I remember a para in the book which says something like: a lama can be reborn to fulfill a certain purpose, and to fulfill that purpose, he could be reborn either as a human being or as an animal, if being an animal could better serve that purpose. Hence, it seems to imply that animals aren't regarded as from the lower realm, which sometimes kind of makes sense when you see some lucky pets which are being treated like bao bei in the family and leading a very good life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Any view on this?<br></div>

The tibetans depend on their animals for a lot of things. Whether they are lama reborn or not I am not so sure, but most animals, and your pets, most likely are not lama or some enlightened sages reborn one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for Bodhisattvas, it is not only in Tibetan Buddhism that bodhisattvas can manifest in various forms. In Chinese Mahayana it is also noted that Bodhisattvas can appear/reborn in all kinds of forms (if you read lotus sutra chapter on Guan Yin it gives detailed examples) to help save sentient beings.</div>
