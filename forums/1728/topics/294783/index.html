As the scorpion was washed closer to the tree, the old man stretched himself out again on the root that branched out into the river and reached out to rescue the scorpion. As soon as he touched it, the scorpion stung him. Instinctively, the old man withdraw his hand. A minute later, he regained his balance, he stretched out again on the roots to save the scorpion. This time the scorpio stung him so badly with its poisonous sting that his hand become swollen and bloody and his face contorted in pain. At that moment, a passerby saw the old man stretched out on the roots struggling with the scorpion and shouted: " Hey stupid old man, what wrong with you? Only a fool would risk his life for the sake of an ugly evil creature. Don't you know you would kill yourself trying to save the ungrateful creatures?." The old man turned his head. Looking into the stranger's eyes he said calmly, " My friend, just because it is the scorpion's nature to sting, that does not change my nature to save it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Gift of Insults</strong><br><br>There once lived a great warrior. Though quite old, he still was able to defeat any challenger. His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him.<br><br>One day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village. He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move.<br><br>Much against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior's challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master. He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed.<br><br>Somewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. "How could you endure such an indignity? How did you drive him away?"<br><br>"If someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it," the master replied, "to whom does the gift belong?"</div>

It would be something that the family could cherish for generations.

"I asked you to write something down that could bring happiness and prosperity to my family. Why do you give me something depressing like this?"<br><br>"If your son should die before you," the master answered, "this would bring unbearable grief to your family. If your grandson should die before your son, this also would bring great sorrow. If your family, generation after generation, disappears in the order I have described, it will be the natural course of life. This is true happiness and prosperity."</div>

The old thief agreed and that night took his son to burglarize a large house. While the family was asleep, he silently led his young apprentice into a room that contained a clothes closet. The father told his son to go into the closet to pick out some clothes. When he did, his father quickly shut the door and locked him in. Then he went back outside, knocked loudly on the front door, thereby waking the family, and quickly slipped away before anyone saw him. Hours later, his son returned home, bedraggled and exhausted. "Father," he cried angrily, "Why did you lock me in that closet? If I hadn't been made desperate by my fear of getting caught, I never would have escaped. It took all my ingenuity to get out!" The old thief smiled. "Son, you have had your first lesson in the art of burglary."</div>
