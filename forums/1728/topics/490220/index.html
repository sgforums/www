              and neglected than right concentration. Yet right concentration is an integral
              part of the Buddha's path to awakening. It is, for instance, one of the
              qualities cultivated on the eightfold path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In general, Buddhist teachings can be divided into three parts: <em>sila</em>,
              <em>samadhi</em>, and <em>prajna</em>: ethical conduct, concentration, and wisdom.
              Or to put it into the vernacular: clean up your act, concentrate your mind, and
              use your concentrated mind to investigate reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha thus makes it clear that a concentrated mind is necessary for
              the proper examination of reality. The <em>jhanas</em> are the method he taught
              over and over again for developing such a mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The word <em>jhana</em> literally means "meditation.'' In the sutras,
              there are four jhanas and four immaterial states. In modern times these eight
              states are simply called the eight jhanas. Thus the jhanas are eight altered
              states of consciousness, brought on via concentration and each yielding more
              concentration than the previous. Upon emerging from the jhanas—preferably the
              fourth or higher—you begin doing an insight practice with your jhanically
              concentrated, indistractable mind. This is the heart of the method the Buddha
              discovered. It reminds us that these states are not an end in and of
              themselves—they are simply a very useful way of preparing your mind, so you can
              more effectively examine reality and discover the deeper truths that lead to
              liberation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The method for entering the jhanas begins with generating access
              concentration. The phrase <em>access concentration</em> means concentration
              strong enough to provide access to the jhanas. It is distinguished from
              momentary concentration—which is less concentrated—and from fixed or
              one-pointed concentration, which is the stronger concentration associated with
              the jhanas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>You begin by sitting in a comfortable, upright position. It needs to be
              comfortable, because if there is too much pain, the unwholesome mental state of
              aversion will naturally develop. You may be able to sit in a way that looks
              really good, but if your knees are killing you, you will be in<strong> </strong>pain and
              you will not experience any jhanas. So you need to find some way to sit that is
              comfortable. But you also need to be upright and alert, because that tends to
              get your energy flowing in a way that keeps you awake. On the other hand, if
              you are too comfortable, you might be overcome by sloth and torpor, which is
              also an unwholesome mental state that of course is totally useless for entering
              the jhanas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So the first prerequisite for entering the jhanas is to put your body in
              a position that you can hold for the length of the meditation period. If you
              have back problems or some other obstacle that prevents you from sitting
              upright, then you need to find some other alert position you can maintain comfortably.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Now, this is not to say you cannot move. It may be that you have taken a
              position and you discover something: “My knee is killing me; I have to move
              because there is too much aversion.” If you have to move, you have to move.
              Just be mindful of the moving. The intention to move will be there before the
              movement. Notice that intention; then move very mindfully, and then resettle
              yourself into the new position; finally notice the mind working to get back to
              that place of calm it had before you moved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This process encourages you to find a position you can keep, because
              you'll notice the amount of disturbance that even a slight movement generates.
              And in order to become concentrated enough to have the jhanas manifest, you
              need a very calm mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Generating access concentration can be done in a number of ways. A
              common means for doing so is through following the breath, a practice known as <em>anapanasati.</em> The first word of this Pali compound, <em>anapana</em>, means "in-breath and
              out-breath," while the word <em>sati</em> means "mindfulness." The
              practice is therefore "mindfulness of breathing." When practicing
              anapanasati, you put your attention on the physical sensations associated with
              breathing. It is extremely important to not control the breath in any way—just
              pay attention to the breath as it naturally occurs. If you control the breath,
              it does make it easier to focus. But it makes it too easy, so you won't
              generate sufficient concentration to enter the jhanas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is probably better if you can observe the physical sensations at the
              nostrils or on the area between the nose and the upper lip, rather than at the
              abdomen or elsewhere. It is better because it is more difficult to do;
              therefore, you have to concentrate more. Since you are trying to generate
              access concentration, you take something that is doable, though not terribly
              easy to do, and then you do it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When noticing the natural, uncontrolled breath at the nose, you have to
              pay attention very carefully. In doing so you will notice the tactile
              sensations, and then your mind will wander off. Then you'll bring it back, and
              it will wander off; then you'll bring it back, and it will wander off.
              Eventually, though maybe not the next time you sit in meditation, maybe not
              even tomorrow or next week or next month, you'll find that the mind locks onto
              the breath. Any thoughts you have are relegated to the background. The thoughts
              might be something like, "Wow, I'm really with the breath now," as
              opposed to, "When I get to Hawaii, the first thing I'm going to do
              is…"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Whatever method you use to generate access concentration, the sign that
              you've gotten to access concentration is that you are fully present with the
              object of meditation. So if you are doing <em>metta</em> (lovingkindness
              meditation), you're just fully there with the feeling of metta; you're not
              getting distracted. If you're doing the body-sweeping practice, you're fully
              there with the sensations in the body as you sweep your attention over the
              body. You're not thinking extraneous thoughts; you're not planning; you're not
              worrying; you're not angry; you're not wanting something. You are just fully
              there with whatever your object is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you start to become concentrated, you might notice various lights and
              colors even though your eyes are closed. These are signs that you are starting
              to get concentrated. There is generally nothing useful that can be done—just
              ignore them. When you actually do get quite concentrated, the random blobs and
              laser shows will disappear. They might be replaced by a diffused white light,
              which is a sign of good concentration. It always appears for some people, it
              never appears for others, and many people find it sometimes appears and
              sometimes does not appear. But again, there's nothing you need to do with that
              sign either—it's just a sign. Remain focused on your meditation object.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Not everyone who undertakes jhana practice becomes proficient in this
              skill, but the only way to find out if it is something that works for you is to

              <p>Somebody that keeps meditation to oneself is just egoistically deluded about what the dharma may be. 'You' again, since 'you' are so stuck up in 'your' personality-based opinions about what a sangha may be, 'your' sangha, or 'my' sangha, you are at best falling prey to conceptual thinking about what sangha also ought to be. This is feeling, that is perception, which is fine, when you recognise that 'this is feeling' you forgot that was father, when you recognise that 'this is perception' you forgot that was mother. If you forget what was and may stll be father and mother, what's the point of recalling a Buddha when you forgot 'you' were a human being?</p>
              <p>People that forget, like I did and still do, starts hurling defensive questions in the name of Buddhism. Thank you for a job not so skilfully done again.</p>
