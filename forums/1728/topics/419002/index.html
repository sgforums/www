In the way the vast expanse of the sky is present but may be obscured by clouds, we too are obscured by habitual patterns that we mistake for ourselves. The practice of the Five Warrior Syllables is a skillful means that can support us to release our negative and limiting behavioral patterns of body, speech, and mind, and make room for a more spontaneous, creative, and authentic expression. In this practice, we recognize, connect with, and trust what is already there. There are five warrior syllables - A, OM, HUNG, RAM, and DZA - and each syllable represents a quality of realization. They are referred to as "seed syllables" because they possess the essence of enlightenment. These five syllables represent the body, speech, mind, virtuous qualities, and actions of enlightenment,<br><br>Rinpoche writes: "The term warrior refers to the ability to conquer the forces of negativity. Sacred sound has the power to eliminate obstacles, emotional blocks, and mental obscurations that prevent us from recognizing the nature of mind and from being our authentic self in any given moment." Each syllable corresponds to a chakra, which is activated while chanting the sound. A corresponds to the third eye; OM to the throat chakra and HUNG to the heart chakra. It is also the heart chakra where the Four Immeasurables are located. These Four Immeasurables are the enlightened qualities of love, compassion, joy and equanimity that reside in that chakra, waiting to be energized. The last two syllables are RAM, located in the naval chakra, and DZA, which corresponds to the "secret chakra."In chanting the syllable while visualizing the corresponding chakra and its color association, it is possible to conquer obstacles and negativity.<br><br>In chanting the syllable while visualizing the corresponding chakra and its color association, it is possible to conquer obstacles and negativity. One replaces the old vibration with, for example, joy that already exists within, but might need some coaxing to come forth. That is where the sound healing comes in. There were enlightened individuals who themselves awakened in those sounds, who realized the power of those mantras, and saw how they could benefit sentient beings. They then developed whole cycles of teachings and practices related to those mantras. In essence, though, it is much deeper. Energetically, each individual sound is produced by its own root, which is beyond time and space.<br><br>Physical sound originates directly in the physical body. The quality, energy, and vibration of sound relate to the pranic level. The essence of sound is the nature of mind, one's very being. But does working with one level work with all? That has to do with your level of awakening. You might be aware of the gross sound, but the nature of the sound, the deep quality of the sound can be obscured. When you say the sacred syllable A, it is easy for the ear to hear the gross sound, but to recognize the deeper energetic vibration, you need greater sensitivity.<br><br>The Mother Tantra describes specific sound practices to treat physical ailments such as headaches, chest pain, and other problems. The right sounds create balance between the five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space. These elements, present in nature, are also present in each one of us. Our own particular balance of the elements strongly affects our mental and physical states - so maintaining this balance is essential to good health. There are practices of chanting certain sounds, certain syllables, which activate or pacify each of the elements. These have a subtle but potent effect on our organs, and on our mental and spiritual states. There is a beautiful commentary called "The Birthless Sphere of Light." It says, "From the body of the unborn essence arises the sphere of light, and from that sphere of light arises wisdom. From the wisdom arises the seed syllable and from from the seed syllable arises the complete mandala, the deity and the retinue."<br><br>Historically, there were enlightened individuals who themselves awakened in those sounds, who realized the power of those mantras, and saw how they could benefit sentient beings. They then developed whole cycles of teachings and practices related to those mantras. In essence, though, it is much deeper. Energetically, each individual sound is produced by its own root, which is beyond time and space.<br><br>You can look at sound in three different ways. First, on the ordinary level, one should become aware of one's use of words and how these choices affect oneself and others. Secondly, on an energetic level, one may connect with the sounds themselves. These seed sounds contain elemental qualities that vibrate different parts of the body and different chakras, as I mentioned before. As our chakras are affected in this way, a higher vibration may be activated. Thirdly, and ultimately, the role of sound for the practitioner must be for self-realization.<br><br>It is my sincere desire that this simple and elegant practice of the Five Warrior Syllables, which is based on the highest teachings of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of which I am a lineage holder, will benefit many beings in the West. Please receive it with my blessing, and bring it into your life. Let it support you to become kind and strong and clear and awake. --- Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, Tibetan Sound Healing</p></div>
