              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There are three American brands that Nigerians patronide
              hugely: Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder of Facebook, is an atheist; Bill
              Gates, founder of Microsoft, is an agnostic (neither believes nor doubts the
              existence of God); Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, was a Zen Buddhist. Yet,
              Nigerians love them and patronise their products hugely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">If these three men were Nigerians who professed atheism,
              agnosticism and Zen Buddhism publicly, how would many Nigerians react to them?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Last week, Zuckerberg visited Nigeria and many Nigerians were
              drooling over him for walking and jogging in Lagos. He left for Kenya and was
              pictured eating ugali and tilapia with his bare hands. Many Nigerians shared
              the photograph and captioned it, “Zuckerberg enjoying Nigerian meal with his
              bare hands like a true Nigerian.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It seemed Aso Rock was not happy that the young billionaire
              visited Nigeria without paying a visit to the Nigerian seat of power; for a day
              after leaving Nigeria for Kenya, he returned to Nigeria and visited Abuja, took
              groupies with President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. The
              President and the Vice-President were full of smiles in the pictures they took
              with Zuckerberg.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">What if Zuckerberg were an atheist and a Nigerian? Or what if
              Zuckerberg were an adherent of the African Traditional Religion, which we
              arrogantly call paganism or idolatry?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In Nigeria there are ONLY two religions: Christianity and
              Islam. Other religions are treated with contempt by most Nigerians. Even the
              government at all levels discriminates against other religions. That is why
              different levels of government sponsor only Christian and Muslim pilgrims. The
              Federal Government also gives Christians and Muslims special concessionary
              dollar rates during pilgrimages, while leaving companies that manufacture goods
              to source their dollars at the prevailing market rates, leading to the shutting
              down of many companies and loss of thousands of jobs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Imagine if a person was told to pray at a gathering of Nigerian
              politicians or business executives in Abuja and the person began to call on
              “Amadioha” or “Ogun” and the ancestors. Those in attendance would not wait for
              him to finish before protesting and stopping the prayers. But if the person had
              prayed the Muslim way, the Christians would say “amen” at the end of the
              prayers, even though they don’t understand the Arabic spoken by the Muslim and
              don’t share the beliefs of the Muslims. In the same vein, if a Christian had
              prayed, the Muslims would say “amen” even if the Christian ended his prayer
              with “through Jesus Christ our Lord”: it would not matter that Muslims don’t
              believe in the godhead of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Similarly, if a Muslim offers a Christian meat from the ram
              killed during sallah, the Christian would eat. If a Christian offers a Muslim
              the meat from the goat killed during Christmas or Easter, the Muslim would
              accept and eat. But if an adherent of the ATR offers a Nigerian Muslim or
              Christian meat from a ram killed during the festival of Ogwugwu or Sango, he
              would most likely reject it or quietly throw it away as “meat from an animal
              sacrificed to idols.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Therefore, the Nigerian Christian and Muslims have been
              conditioned to view each other’s faith as acceptable religion, even though that
              has not stopped the decades of religious violence that has marked the religious
              practice in Nigeria in the country. Any other religion outside these two is
              viewed with contempt or outright opposition. Professing a lack of belief in God
              is even given worse treatment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">An atheist is viewed in Nigeria as an embodiment of the devil
              and everything evil. He is believed to be an enemy that must not be associated
              with to avoid infecting others with the “curse” he carries. He is not expected
              to succeed in life. He is not expected to be wealthy. Even if he acquires
              wealth or success “by mistake,” he is expected to lose it soon, because it is
              seen as a gift from Satan. Any tragedy that befalls him is seen as a punishment
              from God, and he gets little or no sympathy. Girls would not be eager to marry
              him because he is an atheist or has a different religion from Christianity and
              Islam. If he has a product or service, many would refuse to patronise him, so
              as not to contract the “atheist curse” that they believe he bears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But Nigerians hypocritically drool over Zuckerberg. They want
              to be like him: young, handsome, intelligent, super-rich. They forget that he
              is an atheist. When they wake up, the first thing they do is to open their
              phone and visit Zuckerberg’s business, Facebook, to read the latest gossip and
              news and exchange pleasantries and quarrels with friends and foes. If they are
              not on Facebook, they are on WhatsApp or Instagram, also owned by the same
              atheist, Zuckerberg. If Zuckerberg were not married, many would throw
              themselves at him even before he proposed. If he were to even decide to settle
              in Nigeria and become a polygamist, many Nigerian ladies would gladly accept to
              be second, third or 20th wife, if he decided to acquire a harem, despite all
              his atheism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the same vein, Nigerians resume in their different offices
              and spend all their day solving problems with Microsoft and making money
              through it. They do not remember that Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is
              an agnostic, and that his faith or lack of it has not prevented him from being
              the world’s richest man and one of the greatest philanthropists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Similarly, Nigerians flaunt their iPads and iPods and iPhones
              without remembering that Steve Jobs was a Zen Buddhist, who – as reported by
              his authorised biographer, Walter Isaacson – renounced his Christian faith
              after seeing the July 1968 Life magazine with the cover photograph of starving
              Biafran children. In Nigeria, Zen Buddhism would be seen as “idol worship”
              because of the statues of Buddha. If Jobs were a Nigerian and had died of
              cancer, many would have sneered that “God had visited him with cancer for
              rejecting Christianity and embracing idolatry.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">However, because these people are not Nigerians, whatever
              they do does not matter to many Nigerians. Just like it does not matter if a
              25-year-old CNN broadcaster calls our President – past or present – “Mr Buhari”
              or “Mr Jonathan” or “Mr Obasanjo.” Our President so addressed would accept it
              with a smile. But let a Nigerian broadcaster address our President – past or
              present – as “ordinary Mr” and all hell would be let loose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“How dare you address a whole army general or PhD holder as
              ordinary Mr?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">We have an intolerant attitude towards religion. We assume
              that only those who practise religion exactly the way we do have any right to
              be happy and successful. Some even believe that only those who practise their
              own brand of religion have a right to live.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But religion should be a private affair. Each person is
              supposed to practise his or her own religion without hindrance or discrimination
              while also allowing others to practise theirs without any disturbance or
              discrimination. Our lives should be the gospel people read, not our words
              posturing.</span></p>
