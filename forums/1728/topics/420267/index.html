              <p>I don't think is wise to slander a Dharma master despite of the fact that you disagree with Venerable Ching Kung teaching.</p>
              <p>No worries, I am not a Pureland practitioner. I do have my own personal opinon and reservation about some of the talk but I do not find it a necessity to succumb to a public slander against him.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I am not an accomplished practitioner therefore I do not have the proper insight to pinpoint the issue. Secondly, there are certain truth in his talk such as learning, reciting and practising based on a sutra. As I have know of people within my buddhist group who manage to cross over hurdle of life with single minded practice of chanting å�—ç„¡å¦™æ³•è“®è�¯ç¶“. Thirdly, such act might indirectly destroy our field of good merits.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one can consider discuss about the doctrine differences then slandering the master. Which is more beneficial to the people in the forum.</p>

              <p>Let me quote u å�°é¡ºå¯¼å¸ˆview on this issue.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Confucianism stresses the need for mental and
                  physical cultivation. Above all, it is concerned with a great political ideal. It is
                  common, down to earth, takes human affairs seriously and pays honour to rationality. All
                  these are principal elements in the culture of China. I agreed with their philosophies and
                  even praised them, but they were unable to fill in the emptiness in my unsettled heart.
                  Others thought that I had become more pragmatic, but the fact is that I experienced an
                  increasing emptiness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now that I reflect on it, I find that this
                  experience was due to the fact that Confucianism gives little emphasis to religion. To the
                  ordinary people, the practices of Confucianism seem common, and down to earth. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                  establishment of one’s virtue, merit, and teachings solely for this life cannot be
                  constructed into an imposing and glorious blueprint for living. Such a plan is lacking in
                  foresight. It cannot bring people into a state where their minds and hearts are at
                  peace(i.e. a state in which they are unmoved by gain or loss, suffering or joy, life or
                  death</strong></span>) and in this state stride forward along the path of glory."</span></p>
              <p>So why use a plan lacking in foresight as entry and foundation to Buddhism? Go straight, learn and practice Buddhism instead of going one big round of detour. Life is short and precious.</p>

So I am pasting from my previous posts to you.<br><br>Dhamma was a term for "teachings" not a word unique for Buddhists only. The same goes for the word "Sangha", monastics from jainism were also called sanghas and their teachings of Mahavira are called Dhamma. <br><br>As a Buddhist, I too think that the "dhamma" of Laozi, Mohd, Jesus and Confucious are good and well taught. Nothing wrong with giving apparsial to the wisdom n values to a non buddhist religion. But that does not equate to us bringing all the "goodies" into Buddhism mixing and match to our own taste. <br><br>As Buddhist, we should only honestly follow what the Buddha taught and Enlightenment is ours, since the Buddha never taught dizigui and taishangganyinpain and is capable of leading others to enter Buddhism, who are you to add on these non buddhist texts to Buddhism as entry? <br><br>UNLESS you agree with what Ven CK says that <strong>in this modern era, Buddhism is no longer enough to uplift the moral standards of the society, only by reviving confucian and taoist teachings and combining them into Buddhism then only we are able to change to downhill morals of modern era people. <br><br>Important qns, so is Buddhism alone sufficient? If you recongise that Buddhism alone not enough and the Buddha has not fully taught the entry to the Dharma, the buddha's teachings were lack of entry so now got to use non buddhists texts as entry to buddhism. If you agree with this, then i think i will have no arguments.<br><br></strong>Also from the basic point of Buddhism, we can and should always recongise the goodness and values of another faith, may it be taoism, christianity, confuscious etc, there is no truth in Buddhism condemning another religion or their teaching just because it is not taught by the Buddha. However, we need to make clear that respecting and honouring/ spreading them are different. When Venerable Jing Kung crossed the line to start preaching and spreading non buddhist stuffs, he is polluting Buddhism.<br><br>Do not mistake me, I see the absolute goodness and value in Di Zi Gui and Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian but sorry I do not agree with Buddhists promoting them and practising them, esp when Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian's "Karmic" system of a personal deity above one's head compiling one's goodness and deeds does not comply with the Karmic system of Buddhism.<br><br>Namo Amituofo ~</p></div>

              <p>I don't think is wise to slander a Dharma master despite of the fact that you disagree with Venerable Ching Kung teaching.</p>
              <p>No worries, I am not a Pureland practitioner. I do have my own personal opinon and reservation about some of the talk but I do not find it a necessity to succumb to a public slander against him.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I am not an accomplished practitioner therefore I do not have the proper insight to pinpoint the issue. Secondly, there are certain truth in his talk such as learning, reciting and practising based on a sutra. As I have know of people within my buddhist group who manage to cross over hurdle of life with single minded practice of chanting å�—ç„¡å¦™æ³•è“®è�¯ç¶“. Thirdly, such act might indirectly destroy our field of good merits.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one can consider discuss about the doctrine differences then slandering the master. Which is more beneficial to the people in the forum.</p>

              <p><br>I am already living in hell, why should I fear retribution? All I am stating is that chanting vulgarities is no different from chanting scriptures. The main basic understanding that one should not bring about anger and confrontation when chanting when one is chanting whether one is from Hindu, Buddhist or Taoist path. I can be from the vulgar path but at least I am on a path.</p>
