              <p><br> I am already living in hell, why should I fear retribution? All I
                      am stating is that chanting vulgarities is no different from
                      chanting scriptures. The main basic understanding that one should
                      not bring about anger and confrontation when chanting when one is
                      chanting whether one is from Hindu, Buddhist or Taoist path. I can
                      be from the vulgar path but at least I am on a path.</p>

              <p>You live in your own hell, the one you created. It could get worse! </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you  don't feel stupid when beginning to chant, and able to devote yourself to chant singlemindedly, feel free to share your experience.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, there are meanings attached to the mantra, symbolism of the visual deities, also we attach a sense of  sacredness and holiness to the mantra, making the mantra more resonant and intense than your chant.  </p>
              <p>So when we chant we begin with a sense of sacredness and devotion. This way we create our own field of peace and stillness.</p>
              <p>You can get out of your hell and negativity, you understand in some sense how it works, only that you are too cynical or too world wise. </p>

              <p>You live in your own hell, the one you created. It could get worse! </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you  don't feel stupid when beginning to chant, and able to devote yourself to chant singlemindedly, feel free to share your experience.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, there are meanings attached to the mantra, symbolism of the visual deities, also we attach a sense of  sacredness and holiness to the mantra, making the mantra more resonant and intense than your chant.  </p>
              <p>So when we chant we begin with a sense of sacredness and devotion. This way we create our own field of peace and stillness.</p>
              <p>You can get out of your hell and negativity, you understand in some sense how it works, only that you are too cynical or too world wise. </p>

              <p>Yeah, I believe you are living in hell. Only those who are living in hell will curse and swear. I have no comments if that is the path you choose but please don't cross your path to heaven. When you are in Rome, do what the Romans do. When you are in wisdom bliss, speak what we speak, don't speak hell language here.</p>

              <p>Sorry if I offend u. I am the type of person who is indecisive. I buy PC game for example take one hour to chose the sets. My family nt rich buy one PC game only mah.</p>
              <p>Yes I do switch my religion beliefs.</p>
              <p>I am more comfortable with christianity.</p>
              <p>I never go around telling people I am a buddhist.</p>
              <p>Christianity, the door of forgiveness is also open until u drop dead. God will forgive u even if u leave christian and later on convert back. Even many times u keep changing, God will still forgive u as long as u repent and believe in God again. The door of christianity is alway open too.</p>
              <p>I am quite a firm believer in Christianity now.</p>
