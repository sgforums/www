              <p>Yes, I think the 'disillusionment' is one major factor. People are beginning to realize that they are not 'Buddhist' after all! This should explain why there's a big drop in numbers.</p>
              <p>The other factor is... Buddhism is not doing enough to inform people what exactly Buddhism is and why they should practice Buddhism.</p>
              <p>These are basically the two big reasons.</p>

              <p>I think Buddhism suits both 'reason based' and 'faith based' inclined people.</p>
              <p>The 'faith based' may find more interest in Pure Land. The 'reason based' may find more interest in Theravada and Zen. Vajrayana can be a mix of both.</p>

              <p>The view that there is no need for spiritual practice because there is no afterlife is a false view cos there is afterlife... according to the Buddha, numberless practitioners who can remember past lives (but you can too).</p>

              <p>on the contrary, i think some/most are also detered by the idea of cause and effect or that we are once an animal; reincarnation. and mostly, they think buddhists are too restrictive, they want to have fun, enjoy life; why waste it. so i tell u it's also materialism.</p>
              <p>kind of remind me of Tusita heaven inner court, where Maitreya bodhisattva is preaching. in the outer court, heavenly beings still enjoy their life.</p>

              <p>Maybe we could support or sponsor more printing of buddhist books, especially those introducing buddhism, arrange or coordinate more dhamma talks.. all these create more opportunities for people to know buddhism.</p>
              <p>Like my mum, she keeps thinking buddhism includes praying for good luck.. i told her not true.</p>
              <p>I've even seen ppl praying to Buddha for 4d number.. lol</p>

Got dharma talk every week or not? I dun think so. Some have many dun have. If dun give dharma speech, then how to spread the dharma? Only do some fa hui æ³•ä¼š that will do??</p>

              <p>Lets take fu hui welfare services (located in northeast area, around punggol, sengkang area) for example. Do they have dharma talk every week? Nope. They do have mobile medical services, old age home, etc. The fu, they did well. But how about hui, wisdom? No need wisdom??? Thats my disillusionment about our local buddhist scene. Most not keen in having weekly or more dharma talk... é›¶é›¶æ˜Ÿæ˜Ÿã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</p>
              <p>(Note: Every week fu hui welfare services they do have two courses running i think. but thats not dharma talk. its different. some people might not have the time to attend courses. but a dharma talk every week, no registration require, just come in, sit and listen, thats just more convenient than taking a full course.)</p>

              <p>thing is, too shallow knowledge of Buddhism also got problem, as i mentioned. they will be detered by the idea of cause and effect and or reincarnation after reading the information on the internet. think there must be some affinity for people to have the urge to want to know more about life, about truth.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Problem is also with the attitude of Buddhist devotees. Many are only interested in blessing services, mantras, chanting and the path of 'easy practice with instant enlightenment'. So, they shunned Dharma talks or courses on Buddhism. I recalled seeing full house on the night when they practised chanting of the Great Dharani Mantra (Da Bei Zhou), then the following night when there was Dharma talk, less than 20 people turned up. Basic problem is that Buddhist devotees do not realize or were NOT told that without a good solid understanding of the Dharma, all other practices will not lead to any benefit for the practitioner , let alone liberation.</p></div>

              <p>Oh really?  I didn't know ppl had that view. </p>
              <p>My first ever contact with Buddhist concepts was from my lower secondary literature text.  From there I first learned about the concept of <em>nirvana</em>.  I used to think it's a very faraway concept, reserved only for select individuals with very special affinities.  Actually even till now, this impression still sticks, but AEN has assured us it's not that unattainable.</p>

              <p>Oh really?  I didn't know ppl had that view. </p>
              <p>My first ever contact with Buddhist concepts was from my lower secondary literature text.  From there I first learned about the concept of <em>nirvana</em>.  I used to think it's a very faraway concept, reserved only for select individuals with very special affinities.  Actually even till now, this impression still sticks, but AEN has assured us it's not that unattainable.</p>

              <p>May be Buddhism emphasise too much on reincarnation and karma which non Buddhists misinterpret and cause misunderstanding.</p>

              <p>Lets take fu hui welfare services (located in northeast area, around punggol, sengkang area) for example. Do they have dharma talk every week? Nope. They do have mobile medical services, old age home, etc. The fu, they did well. But how about hui, wisdom? No need wisdom??? Thats my disillusionment about our local buddhist scene. Most not keen in having weekly or more dharma talk... é›¶é›¶æ˜Ÿæ˜Ÿã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</p>
              <p>(Note: Every week fu hui welfare services they do have two courses running i think. but thats not dharma talk. its different. some people might not have the time to attend courses. but a dharma talk every week, no registration require, just come in, sit and listen, thats just more convenient than taking a full course.)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm from Fu Hui Auditorium.  I think nobody judges the fu and hui like this. And lastly, dharma talk is quality not quantity.</p>

              having dharma teachers dont necessary mean buddhism will grow rapidly.
              
              for example you have invented something good... but does that mean you can sell it? may not. u must find a way to attract customers and spread it far and wide.
              
              buddhism is likewise. how can we attract more ppl to buddhism, how can we attract the youths like some churches are doing? evangelism is also a skill but of cos must be skiklful. evne buddha and his sangha evangelise so should we. the buddha told us to, so we shouldvdo our job. otherwise its like finding jewels but dont know how to share with others

                  Actually the amount of information and resources are quite a lot in this day and age,
                  the problem is most people are too "busy", have no "time",  always putting religion in the backburner when things are going smoothly. 
                  
                   It is normal for people,that only when they encounter difficulties , go an "chiu shen pai fo",
                  that how usually affinity for religion starts.
              There is an article citing increased interest in during financially trying periods. Will post the article when I remember the title.

              <p><strong><em>The crux of the challenge is : Are Buddhist leaders committed to rectifying the misunderstanding of the Buddha's teachings through quality Dharma lessons and living examples of the teachers, or are they more interested to increase their 'market share' of devotees and financial gains by offering devotees the things they 'feel good' about, such as supernatural and mystical practices (blessing prayers, mantras, chanting, horoscope, fortune reading, ancestor worship and geomancy.) Skillful means can become addiction like 'drugs'.</em></strong></p>
