              <p>I asked myself many times after that Refuge taking ceremony. Am I ready to be a Buddhist in mind and body? I don't really know, cos it was done due to my grandfather, who was bed-ridden for 2 years and had asked to be formally recognised as Buddhist. I just followed my mother, my grandmother and my aunt in taking refuge in the triple gems. Well, part of me wanted to be a Buddhist of course, but there is still something that tells me I'm not ready...I still don't know what it is after asking myself in my head many times.</p>
              <p>Okay, maybe there are some reasons which I THINK might contribute to me believing in Buddhism despite having studied for ten years in a Christian school and finally becoming a Buddhist a year ago.</p>
              <p>I find some peace in understanding that we have many previous lives, living in different eras. I may have been a good person at one lifetime, hence I'm not born into a poor family or in a war-torn country. I may have been a bad person at one life time, hence I find myself being very, very slow in understanding many stuff that normal people would know through 'common sense'.</p>
              <p>I find some peace in knowing the cause of my loneliness and helplessness in my present life. According to one karma effect mentioned by the Buddha in one particular sutra, that people who are lonely and helpless in their present lifetime were once people who constantly resented against others, or regarded people's fortunes or abilities with jealousy throughout their lives. Or they had constantly plotted or manipulated people to achieve their own selfish gains. Self-help books attribute this to my lack of interpersonal skills, sincerity and patience...but only what Buddhism has taught could satisfy my doubt on a much deeper level.</p>
              <p>I find peace knowing that heaven and hell is not eternal. And that despite not believing in the concept of a Creator God or that the Jesus's crufication will free all men from their sins, I will not go to hell for that. It is ultimately the deeds and the true intentions of those deeds that bring to you to heaven or hell. There is no one to judge unless you belong to those whose good or bad deeds are weighing upon each other in disequilibrium.</p>
              <p>I find peace in knowing that I will one day attain perfect peace and freedom from all suffering and doubts when I realise my own Buddha nature. And most importantly, all living beings can be Buddhas themselves through diligent practice of the methods and paths taught by Buddha and will go on to help others become Buddhas too.</p>
              <p>Dear fellow buddhists, do you mind sharing with me what circumstances led you to start getting interested in Buddhism and finally take Refuge in the Triple Gems?</p>

              <p>Became a Buddhist when I took refuge at the age of 2. I can't remember already, but I was told that my master smiled when he saw me, and gave me a blessing. Before that I can't speak in full sentences.. only broken words (I am a v slow learner for that age), immediately after that I speak in full sentence.</p>
              <p>I started attending dharma talks when I was around 12 or 13, which was about 5 years ago... and am convinced of the benefits and truths in dharma.</p>

              Dont be anything? Be nothing.
              "I am a Buddhist".
              "I took 5 precepts".
              
              Be careful this kind of statement,before it creat a stronger ego in you.
              Why Buddha make the 5 precepts? Do you know?
              Let me ask you a question?
              You were in the forest sitting under a tree.A rabbit ran and hide behind you.A minutes later,a hunter with a gun came and ask you,"did you see a rabbit run pass here".
              What is your answer to the hunter?
              Tell me!

              <p>I think you know the answer if you have read or come across this above Buddhist story. I agree with what the Buddha did, which was to tell a white lie to save the rabbit from immediate death and the hunter from sowing bad karma due to taking lives.</p>
              <p>How about you? What would you do? Are you a Buddhist or someone interested in Buddhism? If you are not, then AEN or any moderators would be the more suitable people to answer you on your doubts about Buddhism.</p>
              <p>I'm just a beginner Buddhist. :)</p>
