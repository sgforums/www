              <p>After he retire... he can do that.. LOL</p>
              <p>I personally know of quite a few Buddhists who are successful...</p>
              <p>Anyway, just do your best in life and not worry so much.</p>
              <p>I
              received this from a forummer yesterday, asking him for advise on
              certain things... Don't think you will know who he is, he seldom posts
              in the Buddhist forum anymore.</p>
              <p>Excerpts:</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...when you realise that everything is empty and there is no
                                      permanent "better" or "worse", what you do is to make the best of
                                      each and every moment....</p>
              <p>... when you can make the best out of each and every situation
                                      (like if you can make the best of jail time if you are in jail)
                                      then you are truly enlightened!</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... everything is "empty" remember? So you should just go with
                                      your passion and live <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">in</span></strong></em></span> reality but live
                                      <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>for</strong></em></span> ideals...</p>

              <p>unfortunately, our life is like one way journey, no way back, we cannot do anything help what we regret, about the reborn, i personally don't have any experience relate with that,help convince that it happen indeed.

              <p>And you look at the photo, you no longer feel the happiness you felt, but it didn't vanish, it become your memory in your brain.And if you reborn you become something or someone totally different,you already cannot say that you reborn, because it's so different unrelated to you.</p>

              <p>Don't look at yourself this way.  You can be very successful as a human too.  Maybe not in terms of monetary rewards, but in the spiritual way.  I think that is more important, because money cannot bring us eternal happiness.  The heart sutra already tells us that the 5 skandhas are empty; in fact, everything is illusionary.</p>
              <p>I used to be ambitious when younger, but having gone through the ups and downs of life, I've realised contentment is bliss. </p>

              <p><br>On the contrary, i think my memory is very real. I know what have happen, maybe sometimes what happen in dream is also real, but not so real as reality. In fact, we have to review the past, see what we done right and wrong, avoid the wrongfulness,continue the right, and i think some memory or past experience make what we are today. Someone said there is a soup called å­Ÿå©†æ±¤ï¼Œbut it's just a fairy tale,Maybe there is time machine, so that we could go back to the past, and fix what we screw up,</p>

              <p>Let's get back to topic... there's an article which I like, by Toni Packer which discusses on No-Self. Toni Packer was introduced to me by Thusness few years back who appreciated Toni's deep insights on No-Self/Non-Duality, and I love her books very much and can recommend them highly. Her books bring one to a silent wondering Presence.</p>

              <h4>What Is The "Me"?</h4>
              <p><em>The following article was adapted from a talk by Toni Packer on Day 4 of the August 1997 retreat.</em></p>
              <p>A somber day, isn't it? Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and
                      windy. Amazing, this whole affair of "the weather!"
                      We call it "weather," but what is it really? Wind. Rain.
                      Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just
                      this darkening, blowing, pounding, wetting, and then lightening
                      up, blue sky appearing amidst darkness, and sunshine sparkling
                      on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be frost,
                      snow and ice-covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing water
                      everywhere. On an early 
                      spring day the dirt road sparkles with streams of wet silver.
                      So — what is "weather"  other than this incessant change
                      of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings, and
                      undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and
                      elation. Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever changing stream
                      of happenings abiding nowhere. No entity "weather" to
                      be found except in thinking and talking 
                      about it.</p>
              <p>Now — is there such an entity as "me,"
                      "I," "myself?" 
                      Or is it just like the "weather" — an ongoing, ever
                      changing stream of ideas, images, memories, projections, likes
                      and dislikes, creations and destructions, which thought keeps
                      calling "I," "me," "Toni," and thereby
                      solidifying what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what
                      do I think and believe I am? Are we interested in exploring this
                      amazing affair of "myself" from moment to moment? Is
                      this, maybe, the essence of retreat work? Exploring ourselves
                      minutely beyond the peace and quiet that we are seeking and maybe
                      finding. Coming upon clarity about this deep sense of separation
                      which we call "me," and "other people," without
                      any need to condemn or overcome.</p>
              <p>Most human beings take it totally for granted that
                      I am "me," and that "me" is this body, this
                      mind, this knowledge and sense about myself which so obviously
                      feels separate from other people. The language in which we talk
                      to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate "me's,"
                      and "you's" all the time. All of us talk "I" and "you"
                      talk, we think it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely
                      any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense 
                      of "I," "me," separate from others. Isolated.
                      Insulated. Not understood. How is one to come upon the truth if
                      separation is taken so much for granted, feels so common sense?</p>
              <p>The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness,
                      true 
                      being, is here all the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Daylight
                      is here in spite of cloud cover.</p>
              <p>What makes up the clouds?</p>
              <p>Can we begin to realize that we live in conceptual,
                      abstract ideas about ourselves? That we are rarely directly in
                      touch with what actually is going on? Can we realize that thoughts
                      about myself — I am good or bad, I'm liked or disliked — are nothing
                      but thoughts — and that thoughts do not tell us the truth about
                      what we really are? A thought is a thought, and it triggers instant
                      physical reactions, pleasures and pains throughout the bodymind.
                      Physical reactions generate further thoughts and feelings about
                      myself — "I'm suffering," "I'm happy," "I'm
                      no good." Feedback that implies that all this is me, that
                      I have gotten hurt, or somehow feel good about myself, or that
                      I need to defend myself, or get more approval and love from others.
                      When we're protecting ourselves in our daily interrelationships
                      we're not protecting ourselves from flying stones or bomb attacks.
                      It's from words we're taking cover, from gestures, from colorations
                      of voice and innuendo.</p>
              <p>Just now words were spoken, ". . . we're protecting
                      ourselves,  . . . we're taking cover." In using our common
                      language the implication is constantly created that there is someone
                      real who is protecting and someone real that needs protection.</p>
              <p>Is there someone real to be protected from words
                      and gestures, or are we merely living in ideas and stories about
                      me and you, all of it happening on the stage of the on-going audio/video
                      drama of ourselves?</p>
              <p>The utmost care and attention is needed to follow
                      the internal drama fairly accurately, dispassionately, in order
                      to express it as it is seen. What we mean by "being made
                      to feel good" or "being hurt" is the internal enhancing
                      of our ongoing me-story, or the puncturing and deflating of it.
                      Enhancement or disturbance of the me-story is accompanied 
                      by pleasurable energies or painful feelings and emotions throughout
                      the organism. Either warmth or chill can be felt at the drop of
                      a word evoking memories, feelings, passions. Conscious or unconscious
                      emotional recollection of what happened yesterday or a long ago
                      surge through the body-mind, causing feelings of happiness or
                      sadness, affection or humiliation.</p>
              <p>Right now words are being spoken, and they can be
                      followed literally, intellectually. If they are fairly clearly
                      and logically put together they can make sense intellectually.
                      Perhaps at first it's necessary to understand what is going 
                      on in us intellectually. But that's not the whole thing. The words
                      that are spoken point to something that may be directly seen and
                      felt, inwardly, as the talk proceeds. And as we go along from
                      moment to moment, now and after the talk is over, (and after retreat)
                      can we experience freshly, wakefully, directly, when hurt or flattery
                      are taking place? What 
                      is happening? What is being hurt? And what keeps the hurt going?
                      Can there be some awareness of defenses arising, fear and anger
                      forming, or withdrawal taking place, all accompanied by some kind
                      of storyline? Can the whole drama become increasingly transparent?
                      And, in becoming increasingly transparent, can it be thoroughly
                      questioned? What is it that is being protected? What is it that
                      one thinks got hurt? Me? What is me?</p>
              <p>It is amazing. A spark of awareness witnessing one
                      spoken word arousing pleasure or pain all over. Can the connection
                      become clear? The immediacy of it, and no 
                      I-entity there directing it, even though we say and believe we
                      are doing all that. But we also say that we don't want to do that.
                      Words and reaction proceed along well-oiled pathways and interconnections.
                      A thought of loss comes up and the solar plexus tightens in pain.
                      Fantasy of love-making occurs and an ocean of pleasure ensues.
                      Who does it? Thought says, "I do!" To whom is it happening?
                      Thought says, "To me of course!" But, where and what
                      is this I, this me, aside from all the thoughts and feelings,
                      the palpitating heart, painful and pleasurable energies circulating
                      throughout the organism? Who could possibly be doing it all with
                      such amazing speed and precision? Thinking about ourselves and
                      triggering physiological reactions take time, but present awareness
                      brings the whole drama to light instantly. Everything is happening
                      on its own. No one is directing the show!</p>
              <p>Right this moment wind is storming, branches are
                      creaking and leaves quivering. It's all here in the listening — but whose 
                      listening is it? Mine? Yours? We say, "I'm listening"
                      or, "I cannot listen as well as you do" and these words
                      befuddle the mind with feelings and emotions learned long ago.
                      You may be protesting that "my hearing isn't yours. Your
                      body isn't mine." We have thought like that for eons and
                      behave accordingly, but presently, can there be just the sound
                      of swaying trees and rustling leaves and fresh air blowing through
                      the window cooling the skin? It's not happening to anyone. It's
                      simply present for all of us, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Do I sound as though I'm trying to convince you
                      of something? The passion arising in trying to communicate simply,
                      clearly, may be misunderstood for a desire to influence people.
                      That's not the case. There is just the description of what is
                      happening here for all of us. Nothing to be sold or bought. Can
                      we simply listen and test out on our own what is being offered
                      for exploration from moment to moment?</p>
              <p>What is the "me" that gets hurt or attracted,
                      flattered, time and time again, the world over? In psychological
                      terms we say that we are identified with ourselves. In spiritual
                      language we say, that we are attached to ourselves. What is this
                      "ourselves?" Is it feeling myself existing, knowing
                      what I am, having lots of recollections about myself — all the
                      ideas and pictures and feelings about myself strung together in
                      a coherent story? And knowing this story very well — multitudes
                      of memories, some added, some dropped, all inter-connected — what
                      I am, how I look, what my abilities and disabilities are, my education,
                      my family, my name, my likes and dislikes, opinions, beliefs,
                      etc., etc. The identification with all of that, meaning, "This
                      is what I am." And the attachment to it, meaning, "I can't let go of it."</p>
              <p>Let's go beyond concepts and look directly into
                      what we mean by them. If one says, "I'm identified with my
                      family name," what does that mean? Let me give an example.
                      As a growing child I was very much identified with my last name because
                      it was my father's and he was famous — so I was told. I liked
                      to tell others about my father's scientific achievements to garner
                      respect and pleasurable feelings for myself by impressing friends.
                      I felt admiration through other people's eyes which may not even
                      have been there. It may have been projected. Perhaps some people
                      even felt, "What a bore she is!" On the entrance door to our apartment there
                      was a little polished brass sign with my father's name on it and
                      his titles: Professor, Doctor Phil. The Phil impressed me particularly,
                      because I thought it meant that my father was a philosopher, which
                      he was not. I must have had the idea that a philosopher was a
                      particularly imposing individual. So I told some of my friends
                      about it and brought them to look at the little brass sign at
                      the door. This is one meaning of identification — enhancing one's
                      sense of self by incorporating the ideas about other individuals
                      or groups, or one's possessions, achievements, transgressions 
                      —  anything — and feeling that all of this is "me." Feeling
                      important about oneself generates amazing, addictive energies.</p>
              <p>To give another example from the past: I became very
                      identified with my half-Jewish descent. Not openly in Germany,
                      where I mostly tried to hide it rather than display it, but later
                      on after the war ended, telling people of our family's fate, and
                      finding welcome attention, instant sympathy, and nourishing interest
                      in the story. One can become quite addicted to making the story of one's life impressive
                      to others and to oneself, and feed on the energies aroused by
                      that. So that's a bit of what identification and attachment are
                      about. And when that is disturbed by someone not buying into it,
                      contesting it or questioning it altogether, there is sudden insecurity,
                      physical discomfort, anger, fear, hurt, whatever.</p>
              <p>Becoming a member of the Zen Center and engaging
                      in spiritual practice, I realized one day that I had not been
                      talking about my background in a long while. And now, when somebody
                      brings it up — sometimes an interviewer will ask me to talk about
                      it — it feels like so much bother and effort. Why delve into old
                      stuff? I want to talk about listening, the wind, and the birds.
                      [Laughter] Are you listening too, interviewer? Or are you more
                      interested in identities and stories?</p>
              <p>At times people bring up the question about why
                      I don't call myself a teacher when I'm so obviously engaged in
                      teaching. Somebody actually brought it up this morning — the projections
                      and mental as well as psychological associations aroused in waiting
                      outside the meeting room and then entering nervously with a pounding
                      heart. The images of teacher and student offering themselves automatically
                      like clothes to put on and roles to play in these clothes. In
                      giving talks and meeting with people the student-teacher imagery
                      is not there — it belongs to a different level of existence. If
                      images do come up they're in the way like clouds hiding the sun.
                      Relating without images is the freshest, freest thing in the universe.</p>
              <p>So, what am I and what are you — what are we with-
                      out images clothing and hiding our true being? It's un-image-inable,
                      isn't it? And yet there's the sound of wind blowing, trees shaking,
                      crows cawing, woodwork creaking, breath flowing without need for
                      any thoughts. Thoughts are grafted on top of what's actually going
                      on right now, and in that grafted world we happen to spend most
                      of our lives.</p>
              <p>And yet, every once in a while, whether one does spiritual
                      work or not, meditating or not, the real world shines wondrously
                      through everything. What is it when words fall silent? When there
                      is no knowing? When there is no listener and yet there is listening,
                      awaring, without any separation?</p>
              <p>A moment during a visit with my parents in Switzerland
                      comes to mind. I had always had a difficult relationship with
                      my mother. I was very afraid of her. She was a very passionate
                      woman with lots of anger. But also love. Once during that visit
                      I saw her standing in the dining room facing me. She was just
                      standing there, and for no known reason or cause I suddenly saw
                      her without the past. There was no image of her, and also no idea
                      of what she saw in me. All that was gone. There was nothing left
                      except pure love for this woman. Such beauty shone out of her.
                      And our relationship changed, there was a new closeness. It just
                      happened.</p>
              <p>Someone said that seeing a shattered image caused
                      grief. But the shattering of self-image need not cause suffering.
                      Truly seeing that the "me" is nothing but a habitual
                      mental construct is freeing beyond imagination.</p>

              <p>In the end, it all boils down to the realisation of emptiness, which makes all conditioned phenomenon impermanent. Such realisation is really very difficult to be put into words. As much as the various scriptures are trying to describe.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it depends on the practitioner's personal cultivation and training in one's awareness and mindfulness. Probably Buddha is by far the only one who can realise such state and eloquent enough to use apt analogies to transmit His experience.</p>
              <p>CEO, director and investors, probably are busy with their schedules, or having their reasons to keep their little 'secrets of success' for themselves. Heh.</p>
              <p>Just kidding, anyway we cannot undo whatever we did in our previous lives, chances are, we don't remember what we had done, however, there are still room for improvements.</p>
              <p>This is because all conditioned phenomenon are impermanent in the first place. Against all odds, one can only strive harder in comprehending and integrating the ten wholesome deeds and the six paramitas into one's life. This is the only way out to make tangible changes.</p>
