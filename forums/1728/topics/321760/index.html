              <p>The Buddha goes on to point out explicitly that "if a Bodhisattva has a
                      mark of self, a mark of others, a mark of living beings, or a mark
                      of a life, he/she is not a Bodhisattva". The four marks described here
                      are elaborated as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>A mark of self: belief in the existence of independent and permanent self </li>
              <li>A mark of others: belief in the existence of independent and permanent being with respect to the self </li>
              <li>A mark of sentient beings: belief in the existence of a
                      species, a race, a clan or a class of beings which is different from
                      others </li>
              <li>A mark of a life: belief in the existence of a permanent entity that would migrate from a rebirth to the other rebirth </li>

              <p>A more thorough explanation of 'lifespan', a post by Longchen in the Soul topic recently:</p>
              <p> <a href="320007">"soul" rebirth lifespan</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By 'authentic experience', i meant meditate to directly
                                          experience the timeless Presence (Buddha Nature) which is your true
                                          nature.</p>
              <p>Once, you have that direct experience, you will know, without
                                          any doubt, that the true nature is forever.</p>
              <p>"Soul' is very subjective... All kinds of teaching will say all
                                          kind of things that are contradictory to each other. And where does
                                          soul starts and you the personality end? You get what i mean?</p>
              <p>To me, the closest match to the word 'soul' is the subconscious
                                          mind.</p>
              <p>But, then you only will experience the sensate reality. If you
                                          do not experience it, then it does not exist for you.</p>
              <p>That is why 'emptiness' in Buddhism is such a profound truth.
                                          For people who doesn't realise it, they will alway think that there
                                          is something 'beyond' their existence.</p>
              <p>For in truth, there is no something beyond what is being
                                          experienced. For example, if you meditate and experience the
                                          'soul', then the soul only exist for you at that moment. That
                                          moment is just right for the conditions of the 'soul' to be
                                          experienced.</p>
              <p>By that definition, 'soul' is nothing but that experience of
                                          pure 'intent' that is being experienced at that moment.</p>
              <p>Through this way of understanding, you will know that there is
                                          no separate entity elsewhere that is call the soul. It is just
                                          another altered state of your own consciousness.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Once, this is known, the lifespan of the soul becomes a
                                          meaningless question.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Do you get what i mean?</p>

              <p>To practice non attachment to the 4 forms is important, but to say 'wu' means non attached is not quite it. It is a form of insight and realisation, that all along the true nature is empty (of self/other, 'inherently existing' phenomena, etc). Of course, prior to such insights and realisation, we should continue to practice non-attachment.</p>

              <p>Every moment, is a new 'self' or experience being born. Nothing remains. The seeming continuity of a personality, and our bodies which changes slowly, and so gives rise to the impression that there is a perpetuation of a fixed entity.</p>
              <p>In actuality, every moment is there only when there is causes and conditions for the appearances. The continuation of personality (i.e. habits, behavior, and so on) are due to imprints, tendencies in our 8th consciousness that keeps on manifesting.</p>
              <p>But it does not mean that there is fixed entity, it is just means the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tendencies</strong></span> are there. The tendencies are not inherently bad, but we have to be always aware of them in order not to be 'overpowered' by our momentum. Some imprints are good (i.e. good habits), some are bad (i.e. bad habits, like smoking, drinking, etc). They can change. They are not a 'self'. And good thing they are not our 'inherent self', otherwise we cannot change our bad habits, or build good habits.</p>
              <p>As for our body, we all know that every 7 years our cells are completely renewed, there is no part of the body that is unchanged after 7 years. But due to our genetic and various conditionings our body may still appear to look similar. Still, they will slowly age... if you compare a baby with a old person, you'll see.  Our body is also not 'self', it is an impersonal functioning that changes moment to moment.</p>
              <p>So there is not a thing that is fixed, there is not a thing that has not arisen due to causes and conditions, they are all empty of inherent existence, empty of a self, empty of other. Dependently arisen.</p>

              <p>De-tachment is important, an important aspect that is necessary to lead to awakening. But to awaken, just practicing detachment is not enough.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is the nature of reality, 'wu' is our true essence of mind.</p>
              <p>If we take Shamatha-Vipashyana (æ­¢è§‚) for example, and almost all practices are a varying form or extention of this essential practice that leads to liberation...</p>
              <p>æ­¢ -- Shamatha -- is to train our mind not to wander, to remain one pointedness and undistracted... to remain detached. So practicing Shamatha, we can gradually let go and relinquish our attachments to ego, money, sex and so on. But the positive momentum built up through shamatha, to go beyond symbols and thoughts and attachments, is itself not enough to awaken... but still, a necessary component.</p>
              <p>è§‚ -- Vipashyana -- is necessary to develope insight into the nature of reality. To practice Vipashyana we have to have certain 'base' in shamatha as well, as a wandering mind cannot really stop and observe the nature of our experience well to develope deep insights and liberation</p>
              <p>So in Vipashyana, what we practice is we observe our moment-to-moment experience... what are they? They are impermanent, suffering and empty (void of self and other). (æ— å¸¸è‹¦ç©º) Through constant mindfulness/awareness of our experience we can gain insights into the true nature of reality, and as a result attain liberation. And what is è§‚? è§‚ = è§‰è§‚, è§‰ç…§. This is essential. è§‰ is essential in Vipashyana (è§‚), they are not two. Ultimately all insights gained is only on Awareness and the nature of Awareness (Emptiness), which is our Mind-Essence.</p>
              <p>An important point to mention is that æ— å¸¸è‹¦ç©º should be fully experienced, and not just place a conclusion on phenomena arising. I will post later.</p>
              <p>And as Thusness mentioned to me today, all practices are directed to this moment of experiencing in terms of intensity of the luminosity and emptiness nature. There is nothing else.</p>

                                      chatting with Thusness.<br> <br> Ck: john, how to practise vipassana in daily life?<br> Thusness: just observe every sensation.<br> Thusness: until one day u are able to experience "emptiness as
                                      form".<br> Thusness: then it becomes effortless.<br> Thusness: Truthz u cannot imagine the bliss when one clearly
                                      experiences that.<br> Thusness: but there is no point to over stress anything.<br> Thusness: <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br> Ck: Thusness just observe every sensation... give me an eg?<br> Thusness: when u breath, u don't have to care what is the right way
                                      of breathing, whether u breath hard or soft, smooth or fine...just
                                      experience as much clarity as u can...just that
                                      experience...regardless of what it is like.<br> Thusness: same for all other experiences.<br> Ck: wot abt sound? hows it?<br> Thusness: when u hear, just the sound...the totality of the sound.
                                      There is no how but just to do away with all abitary thoughts. Hear
                                      the sound as clear as u can be.<br> Ck: then wot abt thots?<br> Ck: thots r v sticky <img title="Sad" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"><br> Thusness: thoughts seldom arise if the practice is correct. If it
                                      arises, then not to chase after its meaning. Not to answer urself
                                      what it means, not to dwell in 'what'...then u will resort to just
                                      the moment of awareness.<br> Ck: when i try to be just openly aware, i notice that i jump from
                                      sense to sense<br> Ck: like one moment hearing, then touch, etc<br> Thusness: that is okie.<br> Thusness: our nature is so.<br> Ck: wots the rite way to do it<br> Thusness: don't think that u should concentrate.<br> Thusness: ur only duty is to sense with as much clarity as
                                      possible.<br> Ck: and for all the sensations, i dun dwell in the 'what'?<br> Thusness: ur mind is looking for a way, a method<br> Thusness: but what that is needed is only the clarity.<br> Thusness: however because our mind is so molded and affect by our
                                      habitual propensities, it becomes difficult what that is direct and
                                      simple.<br> Thusness: just stop asking 'how', 'what', 'why'.<br> Thusness: and submerge into the moment.<br> Thusness: and experience.<br> Thusness: i perfer u to describe.<br> Thusness: not to ask how, what, why, when, where and who.<br> Thusness: only this is necessary.<br> Ck: ok<br> Thusness: if u practice immediately, u will understand.<br> Thusness: if u entertain who, what, where, when and how, u create
                                      more propensities and dull ur own luminosity.<br> <br> Ck: i shuffle btw self inquiry, observing sensations n thots, being
                                      aware... its ok rite<br> Thusness: yes<br> Ck: means start work i'll hv even more propensities...<br> Thusness: that is when u do not understand what awareness, but it
                                      is true to certain extend. <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>If cells are in the state of everchangingness, there is nothing fixed and no 'self' can be found in the body.</p>
              <p>Our body is only an <strong>appearance</strong> due to causes and conditions, ultimately empty, and no 'self' can be found.</p>
              <p>The consistencies is simply due to the perpetuation of causes and conditions, the conditions are there to manifest, they are simply <strong>tendencies</strong> and <strong>NOT actuality, </strong>and hence there is no inherent existence or<strong> </strong>a fixed entity.</p>
              <p>I can assure you that if a person die now and reborn, and start to learn everything again from a different cultural condition, his behavior and personality will be very different from this life.</p>
              <p>OR if a person get hit by a car, suffer amnesia and forget everything... and relearn everything. His personality may be quite different from before.</p>
              <p>Hence the various conditionings that forms his personality and behavior can change any moment and are not 'self'.</p>
              <p>Of course past life 'seeds' can still affect, but the conditionings from his present lifetime's family, friends, and social circle plays a larger role. Past life he can't remember already. In any case, it is just conditionings, but empty.</p>
              <p>There is no inherent self to be found in the body, or the mind, or the personality, or even beyond. It simply cannot be found. Of course, go practice yourself and observe... become enlightened then you'll see with absolute clarity.</p>

              <p>å£½ is longevity.  When we cling on to this life and wish for it to be extended infinitely, we become attached.  So it is with this desire for longevity that we remain in samsara life after life.</p>

              <p>cell renew every 7 years, does not means we are complete new or different, it's still who we are, i think we cannot change the inherent self.And probably it's good for us to follow and stick to the inherent self. We are happier to stay who we are.Yes there is nothing fixed, but within the life span of ourself, we are consistent, we have die anyway, finally become some ash. But according to someone we have walked in the world, and left something, maybe some magnetic wave.</p>

              <p>I look at it this way.  When I looked at my photos I took years ago, that person in the photo seemed so distant.  He may look like me, but do I experience what he was experiencing at that time?  I may know he look happy, but in my current state, I no longer can feel that happiness.  Therefore, I am not the same person as in the past.</p>
              <p>When we die, is the person who is reborn the same person who lived previously?  The answer is again no.  If it's the same, we would remember our previous lives, and we would retain our traits, but we did not.  Therefore we are not the same people as in the past.</p>
              <p>So where is the self if it's ever changing?</p>

              <p>unfortunately, our life is like one way journey, no way back, we cannot do anything help what we regret, about the reborn, i personally don't have any experience relate with that,help convince that it happen indeed. In fact what's transcendental didn't happen on me, what's dharma teaching for me is so real, and i personally don't experience such thing mystic in buddhism.</p>
              <p>And you look at the photo, you no longer feel the happiness you felt, but it didn't vanish, it become your memory in your brain.And if you reborn you become something or someone totally different,you already cannot say that you reborn, because it's so different unrelated to you.</p>

              <p>I'm curious.  Who is Thusness?  I only know he's a moderator of this forum but how come he's not around to post?  Pardon me as I did not join for long.</p>

              <p>A friend I met in the Buddhist IRC channel I think 4~5 years back, was introduced by another friend who I also met from the internet (Truthz, the guy who was asking Thusness on Vipassana). Met both a few times.</p>
              <p>Can say we're friends... but because I have learnt so much from Thusness, he's also like a teacher to me :)</p>
              <p>He seldom post here cos he's a very very busy man (he's CEO, directors and investors of many companies, part-time lecturer, etc...)... but I was just chatting with him a few minutes ago, asking him on programming things... on MSN.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. he's retiring soon.. he's only 40 but he definitely earned more than enough, LOL</p>

              <p>IMO,</p>
              <p>Lots of time, how successful and the conditions of a person's life is dependent on past merits and karma.</p>
              <p>Of course, personal attributes play a part too.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the conditions of the rebirth can be 'planned' too...
                                      not for all people though.</p>
