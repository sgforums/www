              Worrying About the Future: On Trusting in Uncertainty
              
              
              by Lori Deschene
              
              â€œWorry pretends to be necessary but serves no useful purpose.â€� ~Eckhart Tolle
              
              The other day my good friend from back home called me hysterically crying. She felt certain she just blew a second job interview, and sheâ€™d hit a breaking point.
              
              Sheâ€™d been struggling for months, just barely paying her bills and wondering if she could afford to keep her apartment.
              
              Every purchase had become an exercise in extreme deliberation. In fact, Iâ€™m fairly certain that when I visited last, I saw her stressing in the grocery store about whether she really needed that box of Twinkies that beckoned from the shelf.
              
              Now here she was, hyperventilating, recounting in explicit detail all the things sheâ€™d done wrong in this interview.
              
              The interviewer looked disgusted, she saidâ€”he was probably thinking she was incompetent. He asked her questions in an abrupt wayâ€”he was trying to trip her up. He didnâ€™t respond when she made conversation on the way to the doorâ€”he most likely hated her and couldnâ€™t wait to get rid of her.
              
              Having gone through countless interviews with multiple companies after sending out dozens of resumes, she was just plain exhausted and starting to feel desperate.
              
              As she recalled the anxiety she felt in this encounter, I visualized her sitting vulnerably in front of his desk, and my heart went out to her. I imagined she felt a lot like Tom Smykowski from Office Space when he was interviewing with the efficiency experts to save his jobâ€”pre-Jump-to-Conclusions mat.
              
              â€œI deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers donâ€™t have to! I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people! Canâ€™t you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people!?â€�
              
              Twenty minutes out of the pressure cooker, she was drowning in fears about what it would mean to not get an offer. She may have to move back in with her parents. Sheâ€™d need to ask her also unemployed boyfriend for financial help. Sheâ€™d have to develop a taste for spam, ramen noodles, or maybe even cat food.
              
              Worst of all, when she inevitably failed, sheâ€™d have to acknowledge it was all her fault for blowing this interview.
              
              About 10 minutes in, I realized that comforting her was not an option.
              
              She didnâ€™t believe me when I told her sheâ€™d done her best and she shouldnâ€™t be hard on herself. She felt sure there was no other way to look at the situation; the interviewer was sitting in his office stroking his handlebar mustache laughing maniacally about the inept woman he had no intention of hiring.
              
              She was talking herself in circles, alternating between statements of certaintyâ€”that all had been lostâ€”and asking me what I thought might happenâ€”as if perhaps there was still hope if only an outsider would verify it often enough.
              
              But whenever I suggested that itâ€™s never over until itâ€™s over, she plummeted back into prophetic despair, convinced her inadequacy only allowed for one disappointing outcome.
              
              Just then, between tears and speculative conclusions, call waiting beeped in. She got the job.
              
              I could feel her immense relief. From 3,000 miles away, I felt her heart rate slow down, her erratic thinking simmer, and her narrow vision of doom expand into a blend of shock, euphoria, and excited anticipation.
              
              I felt it all along with her. Iâ€™d been an accomplice to her panic attack, after all.
              
              As I thought about how unnecessary all of the worrying had beenâ€”and how I wished she didnâ€™t put herself through thatâ€”I realized Iâ€™d been in her shoes before. There have been many times when Iâ€™ve felt overwhelmed by a sense of powerlessness, and desperate to feel some type of control.
              
              There have been times when Iâ€™ve asked people for their opinions and then felt unsatisfied until I heard exactly what I wanted to hear. When Iâ€™ve made assumptions about negative things to come, and then obsessed over what I could do to prevent it, or what I should have done to avoid it.
              
              In retrospect, all that mental busy work did very little to change what was coming.
              
              It wasnâ€™t even slightly useful or productive, and it definitely didnâ€™t soften the blow if my fears came true and something went wrong or didnâ€™t pan out.
              
              In fact, it only exacerbated the situation because worrying essentially began the disappointment retroactively.
              
              If you worry and nothingâ€™s wrong, youâ€™ve wasted precious time over nothing. If you worry and something is wrong, youâ€™ve still wasted precious time.
              
              Every time we use the present to stress about the future, weâ€™re choosing to sacrifice joy today to mourn joy we might not have tomorrow. It may seem like weâ€™re creating solutions or somehow protecting ourselves from pain, but in all reality, weâ€™re just causing ourselves more of it.
              
              Perhaps the key is to challenge that instinctive sense of fear we feel when we start thinking about uncertainty. When I look back at the most fulfilling parts of my life, I realize most of them took me completely by surprise.
              
              I may not have gotten everything I wanted, but Iâ€™ve wanted what Iâ€™ve gotten more than often enough to compensate. The unknown may have provided some heartache, but itâ€™s also provided adventure and excitement.
              
              For every time Iâ€™ve felt disappointed, thereâ€™s been another moment when Iâ€™ve felt a sense of wonder. Those are the moments we live forâ€”when all of a sudden we see the world through new eyes in a way we could never have known to predict.
              
              Uncertainty is the cost of that deeply satisfying, exhilarating, spontaneous sense of awe.
              
              It would be easy to say that mindfulness is the answer to worrying. If youâ€™re truly immersed in the present moment, there wouldnâ€™t be any reason to fixate on what might be coming. But I suspect that itâ€™s inevitable weâ€™ll do that from time to time. Weâ€™re only human, after all.
              
              Maybe a better suggestion is a combination of being in the moment and trusting in the one to follow.
              
              We canâ€™t always control what it will look like, but we can know that more often than not, it will lead to something good if weâ€™re open to it. When it doesnâ€™t, weâ€™ll get through itâ€”and faster if we havenâ€™t already overwhelmed ourselves with what-ifs and worst-case scenarios.
              
              On the other side of worry, thereâ€™s trust. We canâ€™t always trust in specifics, but we can trust in ourselves.
