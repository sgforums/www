              <p>Is there any book which teaches you or act as a guide to guding you to reciting Amitabha.</p>
              <p>How do you all practise reciting Amitabha.</p>
              <p>Just now I read one thing from what sanath posted that a practising bodhisattva may regress to the 2 vehicles if they retrogress. Thats scary man</p>

              <p><br>Think you might have read this?</p>
              <p><strong>The Commentary on Vasubandhu's Treatise on the Pure Land states:</strong></p>
              <p>Reverently contemplating the Commentary on the Ten Bodhisattva Stages of Bodhisattva Nagarjuna, I find it stated that there are two paths by which bodhisattvas seek the stage of non-retrogression - the path of difficult practice and the path of easy practice.</p>
              <p>With the path of difficult practice, it is seeking non-retrogression in this world of five defilements at a time when there is no Buddha that is difficult. This difficulty appears in many ways; I will indicate what is meant by roughly listing several of them.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The apparent good practiced in non-buddhist ways is confused with the dharma of the bodhisattva. </li>
              <li>The sravaka's concentration on self-benefit diverts a bodhisattva's practice of great compassion. </li>
              <li>Evildoers lacking self-reflection subvert the excellent merits of others. </li>
              <li>The results of good acts undertaken with inverted thinking nullify the bodhisattva's pure practice for enlightenment. </li>
              <li>The path of difficult practice is based solely on self-power and lacks the support of Other Power. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Such problems as these, which may be seen everywhere, are examples of the difficulty. Thus the path of difficult practice may be compared in its hardship to journeying overland on foot.</p>
              <p><em>In the path of easy practice, one aspires to be born in the Pure Land with solely one's entrusting oneself to the Buddha as the cause, and allowing oneself to be carried by the power of the Buddha's Vow, quickly attains birth in the land of purity. Supported by the Buddha's power, one immediately enters the group of the truly settled of the Mahayana. The stage of the truly settled is none other than the stage of non-retrogression. Thus the path of easy practice may be compared in its comfort to being carried over waterways in a ship.</em></p>
              <p>This treatise, the Upadesa on the Sutra of Immeasurable Life, indeed holds the ultimate of the Mahayana; it is a sail with which to catch the favorable wind toward non-retrogression.</p>
              <p>"Immeasurable Life" is a name of the Tathagata of the Pure Land of happiness. Sakyamuni Buddha, while residing at Rajagrha and Sravasti, taught the assembly about the virtues that adorn the Buddha of Immeasurable Life. The Buddha's Name forms the essence of those sutras. Later, the sage Bodhisattva Vasubandhu, reverently heeding [Sakyamuni] Tathagata's greatly compassionate teaching, composed a gatha of aspiration for birth in the Pure Land based on these sutras.</p>

              <p>It's not scare tactics, it's telling you to stop your rubbish! Seriously, as a friend i will also tell you the same thing. You have the right not to believe in Pure Land Buddhism, but you do not have the right to post sarcastically and confuse everyone here, since most of us replying in this thread are Pure Land Buddhists. Have you got nothing better to do?</p>

              <p>And if you have time, i think you should spend that time learning Dharma and improving and reflecting on your karmic actions. Why should what Ven Chin Kung say or do affect you. What he says, it's his karma. Even if he states "wrongly", it'll be his karma. Surely you don't have to add it in to yours?</p>
