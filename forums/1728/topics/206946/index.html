            <div class='col-md body'>The Sutra on the Eight Realizations of Great Men (T17.0779.715b)<br>Translated by the Parthian Tripitaka Master An Shi-gao (安世高<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> of the Latter Han Dynasty (25-220 ad).<br><br>[This was spoken] for the sake of the disciples of the Buddha. They were constant in their ultimately sincere recitation and remembrance, both day and night, of the eight realizations of great men.<br><br>First, one realizes: that the world is impermanent, that oneÂ’s country is a fragile entity, that the four great elements are freighted with suffering and are themselves empty, that the five aggregates are devoid of self, that they are subject to change and transformation through production and cessation, and that they are empty, false, and devoid of any [subjective] agent. [One realizes also that] the mind is a source of evil and that oneÂ’s physical form is [like] a thicket in which karmic offenses are created. One carries on analytic contemplation in accordance with these [realizations] and gradually abandons [cyclic] birth and death.<br><br>Translation Â© 2005 Bhikshu Dharmamitra<br>www.kalavinka.org</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Second, one realizes that an abundance of desire is [the basis of] suffering, that the laboriousness and weariness arising in the sphere of [cyclic] births and deaths arises from desire, and that it is in less desire and [the associated experience of] the unconditioned that the body and mind experience sovereign independence.<br>Third, one realizes that the mind is insatiable and prone to ever greater seeking and to the proliferation of the evils associated with karmic offenses. The bodhisattva is not this way. He is constantly mindful in knowing when enough is enough. He establishes himself in circumstances akin to poverty, and guards [the practices which accord with] the Path, [realizing that] it is wisdom alone which constitutes the Path.<br><br>Fourth, one realizes that indolence is associated with falling [into unfortunate circumstances]. Thus one is constant in the practice of vigor and the destruction of the evils associated with the afflictions. One conquers the four demons [of the four great elements] and escapes from the prison of the aggregates and [sense] realms.<br><br>Fifth, one realizes [the nature of] delusion and [cyclic] birth and death. The bodhisattva remains constantly mindful of this and, being broad-ranging in his studies, possesses much learning. He increases his wisdom, perfects eloquence, teaches and transforms everyone, and thereby brings great happiness to all.<br><br>Translation Â© 2005 Bhikshu Dharmamitra<br>www.kalavinka.org</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sixth, one realizes that poverty, suffering, and an abundance of adversaries makes for the sudden and tragic development of conditions associated with evil. Thus the bodhisattva practices giving and, [in doing so], is equally mindful of both adversaries and close relations. He does not hold in mind evils from long ago, and does not detest people who are evil.<br><br>Seventh, one realizes the faults and disastrousness associated with the five desires. Even though one may still be a layperson, he does not allow himself to become defiled by worldly pleasures. He bears in mind those Â“vessels of DharmaÂ” who possess the three robes and the bowl. He becomes determined to leave behind the home life and to guard [the practice of] the Path in pristine purity. Thus he becomes lofty and far-reaching in the brahman conduct (celibacy, etc.) and acts out of loving-kindness and compassion for all [beings].<br><br>Eighth, one realizes that [cyclic] birth and death are as if ablaze and are connected with countless sufferings and afflictions. Thus one generates the mind associated with the MahÃ¢yÃ¢na [which is determined] to rescue all [beings]. He vows to substitute for beings in the taking on of their incalculably many sufferings and [vows to] cause all beings to develop the most ultimate form of great happiness.<br><br>Eight matters such as these are realized by all buddhas and bodhisattvas, those who are great men. They are vigorous in the practice of the Path and are imbued with loving-kindness and compassion as they cultivate wisdom. They go aboard the ship of the Dharma body and thereby arrive at the shore of nirvÃ¢ṇa. They then repeatedly return to the sphere of [cyclic] birth and death to bring about the liberation of beings.<br><br>They resort to the above eight matters in their instruction and guidance of everyone. Thus they influence beings to awaken to the sufferings of [cyclic] birth and death, influence them to abandon the five desires, and influence them to cultivate the mindÂ’s path of the Ã‚ryas. If a disciple of the Buddha recites these eight topics, he thereby extinguishes countless karmic transgressions and advances along towards bodhi. He will swiftly ascend to the right enlightenment, thus eternally cutting off [cyclic] births and deaths and abiding forever in happiness.<br><br>[End of] The Sutra on the Eight Realizations of Great Men<br><br>Translation Â© 2005 Bhikshu Dharmamitra<br>www.kalavinka.org</div>
