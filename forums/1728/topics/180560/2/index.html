            <div class='col-md body'>here's a more detail one :<br><br><blockquote>Why Did the Buddha Enter Nirvana? Lecture by the Venerable Master Hua<br><a href="http://dharmabliss.org/Why%20The%20Buddha%20Enter%20Nirvana.html#g7zmaster3" rel="nofollow">http://dharmabliss.org/Why%20The%20Buddha%20Enter%20Nirvana.html#g7zmaster3</a><br><br>When people get to the point that they do not even care about their own lives as they seek the Buddhadharma, there is a response of the Way because of their extreme earnestness. At that time, Shakyamuni Buddha and the Sangha assembly of Bhikshus and Bhikshunis all appear together on Spiritual Vulture Mountain. Thus Great Master Zhi Zhe of the Tiantai School entered the Dharma Flower samadhi when reciting the Dharma Flower Sutra, and he personally saw the Dharma assembly on Spiritual Vulture Mountain still taking place--it had not dispersed. He obtained the "Dharani of a Single Revolution." That proves that even now the Buddha is still present on Spiritual Vulture Mountain, speaking the Dharma, teaching and transforming living beings. He has not passed into extinction. But using clever expedient devices, he manifests "extinction" and "nonextinction." He speaks of and manifests birth and passing into extinction, but they are not real. For living beings in other lands, those who are reverent, faithful, and longing to see the Buddha, he speaks the supreme Dharma.</blockquote>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Ito_^:<br><strong>maybe buddha wasn't [b]that</strong> enlightened as his disciples claimed to be?[/b]</blockquote>My answer is the number one thing about this way of life is that it is not judgemental. In other words I will not judge you for your shortcomings because we are on differant paths. I will help you, and support you for kindness sake. Buddhism teaches personal responsibilty (Kamma) for one's own actions.<br><br>1) There is no God at the center of Buddhism to make you good.<br><br>2) There is no Devil to make you evil.<br><br>You are good or evil depending on yourself and yourself alone. The western way of thinking is such that we may find that disheartening at first. We like to think in terms of others cause and we get the effect.<br><br>Buddhism also explains the differant levels of success and good fortune of people in life. Other religions do not even attempt that one. As far as salvation is concerned if we only have one shot at it then we should all start off on the same footing.<br><br>Another positive thing I have found is that your patience and compassion will grow. In my case to just see these things in my nature are good enough for me. Tolerance and respect for others beliefs is taught. You will even notice if you stay in the practice that others opinions about you will not affect you because that is the first fetter broken (the view of self).<br><br>You will undertand when the time comes that Buddhism is all about Great Compassion. I did not realize this until the first fetter was broken.<br><br>This Dhamma is about the truth and the search for the truth. I will tell you that it is foolish to go through life believing what others tell you is the truth. That is to include the one's you love also. It is your responsibilty to seek for your path to the truth nobody elses. It is also your responsiblity to learn that path and follow it.<br><br>Buddhism will tell you:<br>"Come, listen and test what I tell you is the truth."<br><br>Other Religions will tell you:<br>"Come, listen and believe what I tell you is the truth."<br><br>You are always free to walk away without condemnation or guilt.<br><br>As you seek for the truth you will find that unlike other religions Buddhism is ritual free and dogma free. This should give you comfort.<br><br>In the stories of Buddha less importance is given to the events surrounding the Buddha. The focus is more on the message that he was giving. Therefore I have to say that true wisdom comes in these writings because over time people would add Super-events to each story if that is where the importance stood (i.e. walking on water ect.) leaving way for scrutiny in the message itself.<br><br>You will find that in the simple messages from the Buddha that there is a subtle and quiet rain of wisdom, heart-felt love and warmth that will encapsulate you in it. I can not put into words exactly what you will experience. I am confident that if you give this Dhamma a chance you will stand in the showers of a universal explosion of change and awakening unlike anything you have ever experienced.<br><br>Buddhism is not about miracles and marvels of a man. It is about the journey to find the truth. The truth is that we are sick see the symptoms, understand how the symptoms come about, tell of the cure, and show the way to produce a cure.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
