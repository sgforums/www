Ancient robes wasn't just orange colour either, it can be of various colours.. and notice the Buddha was meditating with his eyes closed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The story was told by Venerable Mahinda of Aloka Foundation, at a private meeting.<br><br>The picture was taken by an Australia (if my memory does not go wrong), who was not a believer. When he saw people bowing to the Bodhi tree, he didn't take that seriously, and he thought 'if you are real, then show me'. Then he took a camera to take a picture of the tree.<br><br>After the picture was developed, to his surprise, he saw the image.<br><br>There was a very young boy in Sri Lanka, who was known for his ability to recite very ancient scriptures at very young age. Then he was discovered to remember them from his previous existence. And he had been a human being at the time of the Buddha, so he had met the Buddha. When Venerable Mahinda met this person, he showed him that image, and this person confirmed that the Buddha did look like that. - an e-sangha moderator</span><br><br>Also, interestingly, is the mudra of the Buddha in the picture. His hand gestures is his way of saying 'hi' to the photographer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Buddha's upraised right hand is turned outwards at the level of his heart, his fingers pointing skyward. This gesture is known as the abhaya mudra. Abhaya in Sanskrit means fearlessness. Thus this mudra symbolizes protection, peace, and the dispelling of fear.<br><br><strong>This mudra, which initially appears to be a natural gesture, was probably used from prehistoric times as a sign of good intentions - the hand raised and unarmed proposes friendship, or at least peace; since antiquity, it was also a gesture asserting power, as with the magna manus of the Roman Emperors who legislated and gave peace at the same time. Buddhist tradition has an interesting legend behind this mudra:</strong><br><br>Devadatta, a cousin of the Buddha, through jealousy caused a schism to be caused among the disciples of Buddha. As Devadatta's pride increased, he attempted to murder the Buddha. One of his schemes involved loosing a rampaging elephant into the Buddha's path. But as the elephant approached him, Buddha displayed the Abhaya mudra, which immediately calmed the animal. Accordingly, it indicates not only the appeasement of the senses, but also the absence of fear.</span></div>
