              <p>hi longchen,</p>
              <p>Just read your comments. surprised that you visit my website. heh...</p>
              <p>Thanks for your interpretation. True to certain extent, regarding what the individual dream elements represent, but I think you missed the ending of my dream about the lift suddenly appearing for me to go up. The background of my current real-life experiences will also explain how the dream links up. :) The seemingly beautiful shore is really not the ideal destination, no matter how attractive they look, as that's just 'normal desires and wants' that most people automatically aim for, even if that's not for their highest good.</p>
              <p>Yeah, it's a very challenging time now for me. My latest post yesterday talked about it. I know it's not in line with the general beliefs on this forum, but I'm certain everyone will go through what I'm currently experiencing, from next year onwards, if they have not already begun to. Though everyone will experience it differently.</p>

              <p>Yeah... i missed the part about the lift... sorry</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lift is a modern symbolism for planes/realms of dimensions.The traditional symbolism is flight of staircases.</p>
              <p>Going down the lift means accessing lower realms such as hell. Going up is vice versa.</p>
              <p>From my understanding and experience, the dream is a symbolic representation of what is going on within the deep subconscious mind. In the new age term, this will be the 'Higher self'. This aspect often has a set of priorities that is different from the conscious personality. My experience is that the symbolism will take about 2 weeks to a month to manifest its effect in the physical world.</p>
              <p>Before, i came back into the fold of Buddhism, I have a Western teacher who taught me how to read meditation and dream visions. I have used this technique as a way to uncover karmic patterns. It was a very tough method that accelerated karmic manifestation.</p>

              <p>Hmm interestingly... Daniel Ingram is now reading up on dream yoga. He also suggest (I think?) that after awakening, dreams are easier to interpret.</p>

                          noticed that as my practice has progressed the awareness in dreams has 
                          become noticeably like the awareness when awake, and have noticed the 
                          transition from being awake in the ordinary sense to dreams and back to 
                          being awake has become much more fluid and sometimes it all seems 
                          exactly the same, just with different rules for how the dream and awake

                          straightforward and their archetypal and thematic aspects being much

              <p>IMO, the Dream Yoga of Dzogchen is of a level that is entirely different... from that of dream interpretation.</p>

              <p>I know you don't believe in channeled messages, so you may not believe what I have to share, but actually, dreams are not always messages from Higher Self, though they can be. They don't always have to be meaningful messages, but if they are meant to carry important messages, they could be from any being from spiritual realm, including deceased relatives.</p>
              <p>The only way to truly find out who sent the message and the exact message is through channeling. As I was sure I knew the message meant for me, verified at 11.22pm that night, so I didn't bother to do channeling to further verify. After all, I feel channeling should only be done on a need-to basis, not as a hobby. :) It's like an off-line 'speed' mode vs on-line 'detailed' mode, of receiving messages. </p>

              <p>Hello Seotiblizzard,</p>
              <p>Nice to hear from you again. :)</p>
              <p>I am OK... but financially not as good as during full time lecturing days. In fact, that is an understatement.. ha ha..</p>
              <p>But, i never regret quiting. It is a balance...</p>
              <p>Now, in between part time lecturing and taking on projects, I have more time for spiritual practice.</p>
