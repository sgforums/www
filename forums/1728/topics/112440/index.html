            <div class='col-md body'>I have received this e-mail a few days ago. This is quite shocking as we seldom receive warnings just like that. If anyone has done research on California, one would have known that the next earthquake will probably be very major, more than richter 7, maybe 8+. Destruction will be devastating.<br><br>This e-mail is received from authentic source through a Buddhist newsgroup.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">&gt; Friends,<br>&gt; I know that this news is pretty shocking....the only<br>&gt; other thing I have<br>&gt; to compare this with was when the Nechung Oracle<br>&gt; (State Oracle of<br>&gt; Tibet) told the Tibetan Gov't in exile led by HH the<br>&gt; Dalai Lama that if<br>&gt; they didn't do something fast and strong there would<br>&gt; be a devastating<br>&gt; earthquake that would destroy Dharmsala. His<br>&gt; Holiness had his Lamas<br>&gt; recommend rites and rituals for the monasterys and<br>&gt; the laity to do and<br>&gt; everyone got very busy. The earthquake when it came<br>&gt; was very mild.<br>&gt; We have never seen Lama Zopa do something like this<br>&gt; before.<br>&gt; May our beautiful California and its people be<br>&gt; protected.<br>&gt; prema<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Friends,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche has been checking the possibility of a<br>&gt; Californian<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; earthquake for some years now and thinks a big<br>&gt; one can happen in<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2005. Rinpoche says it is difficult to stop an<br>&gt; earthquake but things<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; can be done to minimise it.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1 Taking 8 Mahayana Precepts<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2 Reciting the Ksitigarbha mantra as much as<br>&gt; possible (see below) as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; well as hanging a picture of Ksitigarbha<br>&gt; (available at Land of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Medicine Buddha) in a prominent place in your<br>&gt; house.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 3 Reciting the reqesting prayer to Padmasambavha<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; There are also 2 practices which will be done by<br>&gt; qualified monks:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1 A fire puja<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2 Reciting of the Kangyur, two times<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; These practices will be organised by the local<br>&gt; centers. However, we<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; will be asking for donations to help cover the<br>&gt; costs of doing these<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; practices. Once we have more details of the exact<br>&gt; costs, we will let<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; you know, so you can have the opportunity to<br>&gt; donate.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche is advising us how to prevent and lessen<br>&gt; the damage, - the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; practices need to be done as much as possible and<br>&gt; as widely as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible. This information is not to cultivate<br>&gt; fear, but to help us<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to prepare.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche said last night that we need to let as<br>&gt; many people as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible know about the practices they can do to<br>&gt; help reduce the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; effects of the earthquake, even if they aren't<br>&gt; Buddhist, because<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone does not want to suffer.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche also said that its better to do<br>&gt; everything as soon as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible and to cultivate as many people as<br>&gt; possible to participate<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; because the earthquake could be earlier and would<br>&gt; be very<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; unfortunate if we didn't do these things in time.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Consequently, we have organised a full day of<br>&gt; practice at Land of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Medicine Buddha on Sunday, January 16. This day<br>&gt; will include<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; practices to help minimise the effect of the<br>&gt; earthquake, as well as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; prayers for World Peace and for the victims of<br>&gt; Tsunami. Please try<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to bring as many friends along as possible to<br>&gt; participate. You are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; welcome to participate in all, or part of the<br>&gt; day.

Most of the people left on the 22nd of Dec. They should be back by 23 Dec in Singapore. I was still in India till end of the year.

Let us do our little bit to help the victims reduce their negative karma.<br><br>One incident about natural disasters happening to one of my teachers happened in the states. Geshe Sopa who stays in Deer Park in Wisconsin was on his way home when the area there was struck by tornado. The whole area in Wisconsin was badly struck and Geshe Sopa was on the road back home. The police stopped their car but Geshe Sopa was worried about his monks and students staying there. Geshe Sopa explained to the police that he was going home and the police then found out that Deer Park was a tibetan monastery. He then said that the tornado miraculously went aroung the monastery and destroyed everything around it. The houses around were destroyed but not the Park. By the pure practice and morality of the monks the disaster was averted.<br><br>Please let more people know about the advice. Even if you do not believe it, please pass it on.

The Kopan monks and nuns in Nepal (over 500 of them) did the recitation last week and that seems to have a good effect already! See the lastest message from Rinpoche.<br><br>The good news is with Kangyur recitations etc... the situation for earthquakes doesn't look so serious for this year 05 any more. But still good to do these practices (of Ksitigarbha and Guru Rinpoche prayers).<br><br>Lama Zopa Rinpoche is helping to sponsor one recitation of the Kangyur. You are most welcome to contribute to the second recitation. The cost is US$1332.42. This includes offering meals and a small money offering to the Kopan Sangha. You can make your contribution to LMB, please indicate that it is for Kopan Kangyur recitation.<br><br>We are planning another practice day on Janurary 30, for the victims of the tsunami, world peace and for prevention of serious damage from natural disasters such as earthquake, and also disaster from other elements of water and fire, especially to the West Coast of USA.<br><br>The schedule will be as follows:<br><br>6:30am             Taking 8 Mahayana Precepts<br>8.00am             Medicine Buddha Puja<br>9:30-11:30am    Mantra recitation &amp; Requesting Prayers<br>11:30am           Precept lunch will be served<br>1:30-3:00pm      Sutra of Golden Light recitation<br>4:00-5:30pm      Mantra recitation &amp; Requesting Prayers<br><br>Please call the office 831 462 8383 by Friday, January 28 to order lunch.<br>Please see below for other announcements...<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Tsomo<br>Land of Medicine Buddha</div>
