              Clash of Civilisations in South and South-East Asia?  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Ananth Krishna Jun 01, 2017
              Swarajya</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              Myanmar to Thailand and all the way to Sri Lanka, one of the oldest conflicts
              of Asia seems to be turning more violent by the day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddhist and the Islamic worlds seem to be increasingly in conflict in south
              and south-east Asia. In Myanmar and Sri Lanka, Buddhist nationalist organisations
              are in open conflict with Muslims; in Thailand, Islamist insurgency has
              resurrected itself in the Patani region; In Indonesia, tensions between the
              Muslim majority and Buddhist minority have surged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              conflicts between the Muslims and Buddhists in the region represent a clear
              faultline between two cultures, as theorised in Samuel Huntington’s Clash of
              Civilizations. As Islamic invasions made their way towards the east, the
              repression and persecution that came in their wake ransacked Buddhist temples,
              destroyed the famous Nalanda University, as well as the Mahabodhi temple in
              Bodhgaya, Bihar. Other regions in this part of Asia like Sri Lanka, Burma and
              Thailand were spared from this brute force of the Islamist invasions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Indonesia, Islam made its entry only in the 13th century through traders. The
              province of Aceh served as an entry point for Muslim traders, and through them,
              their religion slowly spread to the rest of the archipelago. By the beginning
              of the 19th century, there were only a few pockets of Buddhist or Hindu
              influence left in Indonesia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              a historical standpoint, the clash between Buddhists and Muslims seems to be a
              continuing conflict. What is new, however, is the militant response that
              Theravada Buddhism has had against Islamism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Myanmar</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Myanmar, for example, a self-styled militant monk, Ashin Wirathu, has given
              shape to a “969 Movement” to “Safeguard the country from Islam”. The figure 969
              is meant to be numerological opposite to the Islamic 786 by local Buddhist
              beliefs . In that country, Buddhist nationalists voice their concerns regarding
              the fast-changing demography of the Rakhine state, which is also at the centre
              of the Rohingya refugee crisis. The Buddhist nationalists believe that if not
              checked, the Rakhine Buddhists of the state would be overrun by Rohingyas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              current conflict can be traced back to the late 1940s, when Muhammad Ali Jinnah
              refused to include the Rohingya-dominated Buthidaung and Maungdaw regions in
              east Pakistan, even when encouraged by Rohingyas themselves. In response, a
              Mujahideen movement was born against the Burmese government. The insurgency,
              which faded out by the late 1970s, was replaced by less violent but a more
              political Rohingya movement starting in the 1990s which was encouraged by the
              overseas Rohingya community. This aimed at creating a separate Rohang state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              series of events, combined with the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhist
              statues, the anti-Islamist opinions post 9/11, and the 969 Movement have all
              led up to the conflict reaching a crescendo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddhist response, however, was repressed in the early 2000s, with Ashin
              Wirathu being jailed in 2003, only to be released nine years later in 2012,
              with a host of other political prisoners. Since his release, Wirathu has been able
              to capture the national and international imagination (TIME magazine featured
              him on their cover, as the “Militant Monk”).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thailand</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thailand,
              much like Myanmar, has a long history in dealing with Islamist violence. In
              South Thailand region, the Malaya inhabitants used to pay tribute to the
              Siamese kings despite being ethnic Malay Muslims themselves. The region was
              incorporated into the Thai Siamese Kingdom through the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of
              1909. Originally, Patani enjoyed autonomy for itself but this changed after the
              constitutional reforms of 1932. This was followed by a process of
              ‘Thaification’ which resulted in repression of the local Jawi language and
              culture. After the Second World War, influenced by Nasserism, a Patani
              nationalist movement grew, which recast itself into a militant separatist
              movement by the beginning of the 21st century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              insurgents targeted and continue to target local Buddhist businessmen, monks
              and pork vendors, but avoid a direct conflict with the some 60,000 Thai troops in
              the region. Buddhist monks are specially on their radar as they are seen as the
              symbols of the Thai government.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Unlike
              Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalists are at the forefront of an anti-Islamist
              campaign, in Thailand the mantle is taken up by the state, with Buddhist monks
              becoming increasingly reticent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mirroring
              the tension between Buddhists and Muslims in other south-east Asian nations,
              Islamists in Indonesia too have targeted Buddhist temples, allegedly in
              retaliation to the treatment of Rohingyas in Myanmar. The values of religious
              harmony in Indonesia are now increasingly under threat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Malaysia, (where Islam is the state religion), the pan-Malaysian Islamic Party
              has been promoting Islamism. Islamic law is already in force in some
              conservative parts of the country, and Buddhist religious activities are
              already restricted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sri Lanka</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              history of conflict between Buddhism and Islam in Sri Lanka is however unlike
              that of the countries mentioned above. Having been under the strife of Tamil
              separatism till recently, Buddhist nationalists in that island nation have
              entered into a conflict with Muslims only recently. The Sinhalese-Buddhist
              nationalist Bodu Bela Sena (BBS) has similar aims to that of the 969 Movement
              in Myanmar, and is led by (the now absconding) Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara.
              Sectarian strife has increased in Sri Lanka over the course of the last few
              years, with riots in 2014, and recent incidents of violence against mosques and
              Muslim-owned businesses. During this period, the BBS was successful in getting
              the halal certification system abolished in the country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gnanasara
              alleges that Buddhist heritage sites are being destroyed by Muslim settlers,
              and declares his fight to be against Islamic radicalisation, much like Wirathu
              in Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thus
              in a Buddhist and transnational anti-Islamist effort, the 969 and the BBS
              movements struck up a pact in 2014 during a meeting in Colombo.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              the immediate sources of conflict in south and south-east Asia between
              Buddhists and Muslims are local and have their own histories, some Buddhists
              are now adopting a coordinated counter-approach to what they perceive as
              growing Islamic fundamentalism in their countries.</span></p>

Dominquez added that “because of pressure on the business front, the group has chosen to become ‘ISIS wannabes’” by taking control of Marawi. This would mean that radical Islam is used by the Maute group as a pretext to conceal their drug trade operations.</p>

Dr. Araral notes that ISIS is looking towards Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country as a viable base for spreading their ideology. Indonesia could serve as a “hornet’s nest” for ISIS if the conflict drags on.</p>
