            <div class='col-md body'>I have been learning/practising martial arts (chinese wushu) for over a year and a half now. I'm able to say that I'm moderately passionate about this art.<br><br>Although martial arts is also know as the arts of 'self-defense', I've realised that many of the moves taught during lessons are not only purely meant for defending oneself. For example, besides learning how to block or avert our opponent's attacks, we are also taught to counter-attack and hit our opponent's vita areas (i.e. groin, throat, chest, etc).<br><br>Also, during practices, we are taught that visualisation is very important. We have to visualise/imagine someone attacking us and how we are going to counter their moves.<br><br>Will this in the long run leave an aggressive nature in us? Will it leave an imprint in us such that when we somehow got ourselves into a 'confrontation' (e.g. robbery), we are unable to prevent ourselves from going beyond just defending ('shou xia bu lu qing')?<br><br>But anyway, I guess the army is teaching about the same thing.<br><br>And also, the place where my wushu training is held is full of ants! It is unavoidable that during practices, we'll hurt the ants. However, since martial arts is a sport that talks about discipline, we can't really do much about these ants...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Where there's defence, there will be attack... you can't possibly just defend ONLY.<br><br>I only can say you have to exercise your rights PROPERLY. That means no hitting of vital parts if one should attack. That means no hitting of groin, neck, head, eye, etc.<br><br>All this requires some discipline... it will take a while before you are able to resist all temptations to hit vital parts.<br><br>As for visualization... hmm... for my art, we don't practise that... because violence is not encouraged. We do have real practicals where we really hit each other to learn how to apply, but even that have some restrictions so we don't injure each other.<br><br>As for the ants issue... just be careful ba...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think i can speak from experience. I practised the same thing for ard 5 years. My shifu go for dhamma class at Hui Yan one. Though now i no more practise liao. My focus is on Buddhism and I am a full time buddhist worker.<br><br>Sometimes attack is the best form of defence which explains why you must learn the techniques. Learn the stretching, breathing and movements. It can help in your meditation. Wushu can also boost one's self-confidence when you know u have better mastery of your body. For me Wushu also taught me about chinese culture and how to communicate with children. I used to lead class at CC.<br><br>There is this saying Yi Dan, Er Li, San Gong Fu (Guts, Strength and Technique). This has become one of my guiding principles in life.</div>
