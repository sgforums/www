              being charged with fraud. A lay Buddhist in Singapore wrote to Ajahn
              Brahm seeking advice on how to deal with the inappropriate behaviour of
              some Buddhist monastics. Here is Ajahn Brahm's response ..<br> <br> Dear .......,<br> <br> Thankyou for your recent email regarding how to deal with the
              inappropriate behaviour of some monastics. It would be wonderful if all
              Buddhist monks and nuns were fully enlightened but, of course, that is
              not the case. When a person becomes a monk or a nun, they begin a
              training. They are not all holy from the time that they first have
              their head shaved.<br> <br> So what should the ordinary Buddhist do about this problem?<br> <br> First of all, it would be helpful to learn more about the rules binding
              on all monks and nuns, from all traditions, that were laid down by the
              Lord Buddha. When the lay Buddhists know more about these rules, then
              they will not be confused. Some of my own articles on Vinaya, the
              Buddhist monastic code, can be found on our web site here.<br> <br> Secondly, it is recommended to distinguish between misbehaviour that is
              a serious problem, and misconduct that the monastics will be able to
              correct by themselves. Serious misbehaviour includes illegal activity,
              such as fraud, that tarnishes the reputation of Buddhism. In Thailand,
              a monk is automatically disrobed before he enters the courtroom for his
              trial. If found innocent, then he may put on his robe again. Such a law
              is designed to distinguish Buddhism from the behaviour of the monk.<br> <br> Other serious misbehaviour is sexual intercourse. The very first rule
              that is binding on monks and nuns from all Buddhist traditions is that
              one who commits sexual intercourse (with the exception of being a
              victim of rape) is by that very act no longer a monk or nun. Lay people
              should be aware of this.<br> <br> Then there is the misbehaviour of monks and nuns who receive and keep
              money, have bank accounts, and other non-monastic possessions. The
              Buddha made it clear that this is unacceptable (Nissaggiya Pacittiya
              23). Unfortunately few Buddhist monks and nuns keep this rule these day
              but, at the very least, they should have few possessions and little
              money. The very meaning of the word monk implies one who lives simply.
              A monk on a big salary, with an expensive apartment and substantial
              savings does not deserve to be called "monk".<br> <br> Once the lay Buddhists know the conduct that is expected of a Buddhist
              monk or nun, then they should speak out at misconduct. It is because
              people either did not know what a monk or nun is allowed to do, or
              because they were too timid, that there are now monks on trial in
              Singapore! Speaking out earlier could have nipped the problem in the
              bud.<br> <br> However, your correctly point out that speaking out could cause
              disharmony and a crisis of faith if done in the wrong way. So, before
              criticising the misbehaviour of a monastic:<br> <br> 1. Make sure that you have your facts correct.<br> <br> 2. Choose the right time and place. For example, it is not advisable to
              criticise the monastic publicly. It should be done in private, if
              possible.<br> <br> 3. Be kind when you criticise. Your intention is to help the monastic
              to be a better person and to support Buddhism, so it should be easy to
              be kind with such an intention.<br> <br> 4. Put the criticism in context by using the sandwich method. Comment
              on all that you admire about the monastic first. Then point out the
              faults.<br> <br> 5. Emphasise that your still respect the monastic which is why you have
              taken the time to speak to him. This way, you do not come across as
              someone trying to destroy that monk or nun, but someone sincerely
              wanting to help.<br> <br> 6. Lastly, always remember to criticise the act, not the person. Never
              say something like "You are a bad monk for committing fraud". Instead
              say "Fraud is a bad thing to do".<br> <br> If you follow such advice, then we can all protect the peace, wisdom
              and compassion of Buddhism and help our monks and nuns be better
              leaders at the same time.<br> <br> I hope that this helps,<br> <br> With metta, Ajahn Brahm.</div>

              well said, I agree with what venerable said.
              
              By the way, do you have his email address as I got something to email to the venerable?

              If the Buddha said its not acceptable to possess money for monks, I think monks should adhere to the precept whichever tradition the monks belong.
              
              There should be a person (layfollower) in the temple that can help the monk by safekeeping the money in a savings account which lay followers donate to the monk. If the monk need something, that person can just use the savings account to buy for that monk. Anyway a monk shouldn't have many world possessions, except for the robe he is wearing, toothpaste, toothbrush, toiletries etc. If a devotee were to donate a condo or car to a monk, I think the monk should reject it as he does not need that.

              I dunno what to say when a monk charges 1k for funeral services to the bereaved family.
              
              Once I saw a monk driving a merc to the funeral and I was told the family of the deceased paid 1k to the monk to conduct funeral rites.
              
              When my auntie passed away many years ago, all I did was to invite 4 monks to the funeral. The temple had a volunteer driver to drive the monks to the wake. After chanting, only red packets (voluntary) were given to the monks as appreciation and they were driven back to the temple by the volunteer driver. I think the red packets did not amount to $100, probably lesser.

              There are many monks and nuns in this world and not all of them are real. Some become monks to take money from devotees and public. Some even deviate from the Buddha's teachings and create an off shoot from Buddhism.
              
              Those who monks who practises are the ones adhering to the vinaya, like not taking food after 12 and does not possess money. When they conduct funeral rites for the deceased family, they usually partake the meals prepared by the deceased family and even if they are given ang bao as appreciation, I think they will channel the money back to the temple and not for himself.
