What we ought to know about preparations before and after death were well taught and touched on in great details. I now have a better understanding and am more confidence in handling death matters, and also to help others when approaching death to seek rebirth in Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land. This is a “must attend” course for all Buddhists, for the benefit of oneself and others. Looking forward to receiving “The Pure Land Passport”! Thanks for your untiring efforts in propagating the Dharma to benefit all beings. Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!’ Amituofo, <strong>Ivy</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16.8000011444092px;">‘Dear Shi’an, I just finished attending your “Destination Pureland” class. Thank you vey much!  It was very enlightening.’ <strong>– Karen</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16.8000011444092px;">‘Destination Pureland’ is indeed a great course to prepare every sentient being systematically for good rebirth. Thanks for sharing the “what to and what not to do’s” in the crucial moments before, during after after dying. It is a well thought idea, to have a “documented passport”, so that all necessary steps are faithfully practised and followed. I would highly encourage all Buddhists to attend this course since death is certain, with no single escapee. Upon understanding and adopting the right practices to help the dying, we are exhibiting our inner Bodhisattva-nature to aid others in liberation from the vicious cycle of rebirth. If not, at least a better rebirth. Thanks once again for another great class! With Metta, <strong>Bro. Tuck Khuen</strong></p>

There were many insights shared that I was not previously aware of. Most fear death, due to  not knowing where we go after death, and try to avoid discussing about it. Yet, death can come suddenly. However, if we have Faith and Aspiration, and practice wholeheartedly and diligently, we will reach Pure Land. Thank you, Bro, for your sharing. It is truly an amazing course. I will encourage more devotees and friends to attend it. I wish to attend more of such courses from you. Once again, thank you, Bro. Shi’an.’ Amituofo, <strong>Vivienne</strong></p>

It has been enlightening for me.’<strong> – Freddie</strong></p>

The class comes alive with plenty of inspirational testimonials from participants. Bro. Shi’an, your class is interesting. I am looking forward to the next course.’ – Amituofo,<strong>Lawrence &amp; Shirley</strong></p>

Your explanations given to us were clear and logical, which helped us to dispel myths on handling death. Overall, I find that this course is very useful as it not only lets mw know what to expect when facing death, it also equips me with the knowledge for helping others.’ – Thanks, <strong>Mee Nah</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16.8000011444092px;"><span id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption">‘This course helped my ex-boss in preparing the last journey for his father.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16.8000011444092px;">‘I saw a beautiful poster titled “Destination Pureland”. As I am interested to know more about Pure Land practice, I decided to register. I called my sister, thinking it might be a useful course for her and her husband, for learning Nianfo. After attending the course, I found it well covered. We were given lots of beneficial notes. The course is applicable for both Pure Land practitioners and beginner Buddhists. We learnt that life is impermanent and death can strike suddenly, and how we can prepare to handle the dying moments – for ourselves, family, friends, acquaintances and even strangers. I gained a better understanding of accepting death. It is during the crucial moments before death that our right efforts can facilitate a smooth and blissful transition to a good rebirth – the best of which in Amituofo’s (AmitÄ�bha Buddha) Pure Land. I now have better understanding of Amituofo and how we can connect to him by Nianfo, and how he can share his blessings with us with his immeasurable compassion and wisdom… The knowledge I gained strengthened my faith in Amituofo.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16.8000011444092px;">We learnt the importance of the Three Provisions of unshakeable Faith in Amituofo, unwavering Aspiration to reach his Pure Land, and the utmost sincere Practice of being mindful of his name. I have a clearer concept now. Pure Land practice of being mindful of Amituofo is not only for our last moments, but for benefiting one and all in everyday life too. It is the fine-tuning of ourselves towards our Buddha-nature and the Buddha’s blessings, through which we naturally become attuned to the fuller avoidance of all evils, the greater doing of all good, and the more thorough purification of our minds. The Dharma teacher is sincere and earnest in delivering the course. He is a knowledgeable and good teacher. His lessons are interesting and lively, using clear and simple language, showing passion in his teaching.’ – Amituofo :] <strong>Sharol</strong></p>
