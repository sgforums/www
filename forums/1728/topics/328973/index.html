Singer<br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Charlie Singer was born in Brussells, Belgium, in<br>1952.  he received a B.A. degree in General Arts and Sciences from Penn<br>State University in 1973, and from 1976-1978 was a student in the Tibetan<br>Studies Program at the Nyingma Institute in Berkeley, California.  Since<br>1980, he has been studying Tibetan Buddhism at the Yeshe Nyingpo Center<br>in New York City, the seat in North America of the late H.H. Dudjom<br>Rinpoche, Supreme Hoead of the Nyingmapa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br>Dedicated to:<br><br>     The Late H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche<br>     H.E. Shenpen Dawa Rinpoche<br>     Ven. Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche<br>     Ven. Ngor Thartse Khen Rinpoche<br>     Ven. Khenpo Paiden Sherab Rinpoche<br>     Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche<br>     to my late Father, Samuel Singer,<br>     and to my Mother, Paulette;<br>     and Jeanine N. and Tina F.<br><br>     In the history of ideas, there is perhaps no idea more unusual than the<br>Buddhist concept of anatman, or `no-self'.  This idea of anatman, or `no-self',<br>was taught by the historical Buddha, Buddha Sakyamuni, as being one of the<br>"three marks of existence", along with duhkha, or dissatisfaction, and anitya,<br>or impermanence.  These "three marks of existence" are regarded in Buddhist<br>thought as being the three fundamental conditions which pervade the human<br>condition.  The latter two "marks of existence", of dissatisfaction and<br>impermanence, have been much written about in the Buddhist literature now<br>available in the English language, but the notion of anatman, or `no-self' has<br>been little understood, and represents one of the most unusual, and yet<br>important, ideas to arise in the history of ideas.<br><br>     Common to all schools or forms of Buddhism, is the idea of anatman or<br>`no-self' nature of the individual or person (or actually of all beings endowed<br>with consciousness).  The Buddha was born into the Hindu religious culture,<br>and one of the fundamental tenets of the Hindu religion has always been that<br>all beings are endowed with the nature of (having an) atman, or `soul' or<br>actually a `self', which is ultimately identical with, or actually partakes of, the<br>nature of Brahman, or the creator aspect of God, in Hindu tradition. <br>Although the Buddha never explicitly affirmed or denied the existence of<br>God, encouraging his disciples to study and practice his teachings until they<br>themselves had attained the level of a perfectly enlightened being, or a<br>Buddha, at which point they would have a direct understanding of this and<br>other such metaphysical questions, the Buddha made it quite clear in one of<br>his first teachings, that in regard to the notion that beings are endowed with<br>an atman, or permanent `self', that this notion is ultimately erroneous, and that<br>in fact, the condition of having `no-self' is an underlying "fact-of-life" or<br>principle of existence.<br><br>     This idea of there being `no-self' can be analyzed in different ways, but<br>from one point of view, we might say that the idea of `no-self' means that<br>when investigate the nature of the individual or person, if we investigate what<br>is involved carefully enough, we would find that ultimately, there isn't<br>actually a `self', or the one we refer to as `I' or `me', as a truly-existing `being'<br>who `inhabits' our body and mind, in a concrete, ongoing, and permanent<br>way.  In common sense thinking, and even in traditional philosophies and<br>religious and scientific thinking, there is a sense in which people have always<br>accepted the belief that there is, in fact, a `self' who inhabits our body and<br>mind, who is the one we refer to as `I' or `me'.<br><br>     This attitude, or underlying presupposition or existence, can well be<br>summed up by the statement of the French philosopher, Descartes, that "I<br>think, therefore I am".  From the point of view of Buddhist philosophy,<br>however, this sort of statement partakes of the nature of delusion.  We might<br>*assume* that there is a `self' who `inhabits' our body and mind, and is "the<br>one who does our thinking", but if we were to investigate this state of affairs,<br>we would find, according to Buddhist philosophy, that this is, in fact, not the<br>case.  Our thoughts and thinking processes might *seem* as if there is an<br>actual `I' who is generating or thinking our thoughts, saying and hearing the<br>thoughts that arise in `our minds', but if we were to investigate what is<br>actually involved, we might find that, in fact, this notion of an ongoing `self'<br>or `I' is only an erroneous assumption.  This idea of there being a `self' is so<br>deep-seated, that it may seem completely unquestionable, and a `given' factor<br>of experience and existence, but ultimately, according to Buddhist<br>philosophy, the belief in a `self' or `I', but ultimately, there is a sense in which<br>"there may not be anybody there!"  What is involved might be said to be like a<br>case of "the talk in our heads" *pretending to be" a "somebody who is having<br>thoughts".  Although the common sense belief may be that "I am the one who<br>creates the thoughts", it may be, in fact, that our thinking our thoughts<br>actually help to create the belief that there is a `self' or an `I' who truly exists<br>as `the one who does our thinking!'<br><br>     Although it is possible to `unravel' what is involved in regard to the<br>nature of the `thinker' and the `thoughts' through practicing different kinds of<br>Buddhist meditation, such as meditation in which we attend to the nature of<br>our thoughts and how they arise in our mind, developing calmness, and direct<br>insight into what is actually involved, it will not be the purpose of this book to<br>discuss the subject of formal meditation, as this is a complicated subject, and<br>because formal meditation is best learned from a qualified meditation teacher.<br><br>     Rather, we will next focus on the notion of `no-self' as it relates to our<br>sense-perceptions.  It is said in Buddhist tradition, that the sense of hearing is<br>the easiest of our sense-perceptions by which we can come to an<br>understanding of the nature of `no-self', and in fact it is said that the<br>Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the personification of the compassion of all the<br>Buddhas (the reader is reminded that in Buddhist tradition, anyone who has<br>attained the level of a completely enlightened being, or Buddha, is designated<br>as being a Buddha, and so there have actually been many Buddhas), attained<br>the enlightenment by following the advice of Manjushri, the personification of<br>the wisdom of all the Buddhas, and attending to the true nature of the<br>sensation of hearing, or sound.  If we consider the nature of an ongoing<br>sound, such as a waterfall, or even any sounds such as music, we can ask<br>ourselves - which part of this sound, or audial presentation, is the actual<br>sound, and which part is the `self' or `I' who is the one who is `doing the<br>hearing'?  More specifically, where do we `cut-up' this audial-sensation into<br>the separate components of the one who `hears' and `that which is being<br>heard'?  It may be, as with our act of thinking, that we have wrongly assumed<br>the idea of a solid, permanent `self' who acts as an agent or subject,<br>interacting with our sense-perceptions, here being our perception of sound. <br>That is, we regard our `selves' as being a separate subject which interacts with<br>sensations we regard as being truly-existing and separate from `us', in a way<br>that the sensation is regarded as a separate and independent object.<br><br>     As the reader may have noticed, it is very difficult to speak of the non-<br>existent nature of a `self' without discussing the nature of our world of `things'<br>and sensations.  Although the idea of the ultimate non-existence of the `self' is<br>a central idea in all forms of Buddhism, of the divisions of Hinayana,<br>Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism, in the latter two forms of Buddhism,<br>along with the idea of the ultimate non-existence of the `self', there is also the<br>idea that in addition to the non-existence of a `self', that what we regard as<br>being the world of `things' and sensations, also partakes of the nature of<br>`anatman' or `no-self'.<br><br>     As we have seen in the analysis of sound, such as a waterfall or of<br>music, it is very difficult to separate the sensations into a separate subject who<br>is having or experiencing the sensation, and a separate object, that is, the<br>sound being heard.  In the literature of the Abhidharma, rather than accepting<br>the common sense notion that there is a `self' who is a concrete, permanent,<br>truly-existing agent which acts as the subject of our sensations, such as seeing<br>and hearing, sensations were analyzed or `broken-down' into their apparent<br>component parts.  For example, rather than saying that "I see a thing", in the<br>Abhidharma analysis, it would be stated that in the act of visual sensation, it<br>is necessary to have three separate components: an agent of seeing, visual<br>consciousness, and an object of sight.<br><br>     Whether we analyze `things' and sensations as being sensed or<br>perceived by a central `self' who perceives all the various sensations of the<br>different senses, or analyze them according to the Abhidharma view,<br>according to the view of the philosophical school of Madhyamika, a<br>Mahayana Buddhist school founded by the second-century philosopher,<br>Nagarjuna, which was based upon the Prajnaparamita Sutras of the Buddha,<br>the `things' and sensations in our world also partake of the nature of `anatman'<br>or `no-self', in the same way that persons or individuals partake of the `no-self'<br>nature.<br><br>     As we have said, the nature of the hearing sensation may be the easiest<br>means by which to understand the relationship between a perceiving subject<br>and the object of perception, or actually, to recognize that they are both<br>equally non-existent, ultimately.  Rather than being the case that a subject (or<br>a specific variety of sense consciousness, according to the Abhidharma)<br>interacts with and senses (or "grasps", as it is said in the Buddhist<br>philosophical literature) an object of perception, it may be that sensations<br>arise in a way that there is ultimately no subjective pole of experience<br>interacting with a separate objective pole.  Because sensations arise beyond<br>the realm of an independent or separate subjective pole and an independent or<br>separate objective pole, and thus without any interaction between a subjective<br>and an objective pole or dimension, all our sensations, according to the view<br>of Madhyamika philosophy, partakes of the anatman or `no-self' nature.  The<br>technical term used in the Madhyamika literature, is that all our sensations,<br>visual, audial, and all others, are "shunya" or "empty", or that they partake of<br>the nature of "shunyata" or "emptiness".  In the interest of being fair to the<br>Madhyamika system, however, it must be pointed out that the philosophy of<br>Madhyamika is so adamant in not taking any position in regard to "the way<br>things really are", that even the position that things and sensations partake of<br>the nature of anatman, or `no-self', is not beyond critique.  Yet there is a sense<br>in which in the traditional parlance of the nature of anatman, or `no-self', as<br>referring to the same truth of `things' and sensations as being "shunya" or<br>"empty".   What they are `empty of', is the status of being inherently or `truly-<br>existing'.  We might say that although in perceptual situations we are faced<br>with some kind of an epistemological-object, or an apparent object of<br>knowledge or perception, `its' status as an ontological-object, or as a `truly-<br>existing object' is that it is "empty" of an ontological status, or of the nature of<br>having the nature of being an inherently and `truly-existing' object.<br><br>     This is true of the objects of all our sensations, but it is the visual<br>sensation and the `object of sight' that we need to analyze in more detail<br>because although all the senses taken together and our thinking work together<br>to enforce or create the view of a separate `self' interacting with a world of<br>`truly-existing things', in a sense it is our sense of sight, among all our senses,<br>which is perhaps the most important sense used in analyzing or understanding<br>our world, along with, of course, our thinking, which in Buddhist philosophy<br>is regarded as being a separate type of consciousness.<br><br>     We are confronted with all kinds of different `objects' or `things' in our<br>world everyday.  There are `objects' of all different sizes, shapes, and colors,<br>in natural settings and in rooms which are in buildings, which are themselves<br>a type of object, and also other beings such as animals and other human<br>beings, which in a sense are another type of object which we as an apparent<br>subject or `self' can interact with.<br><br>     It may be possible to establish through some kind of logic, the non-<br>existence of a solid, permanent `self' who acts as the agent of our visual<br>sensation.  For example, we can try to posit the existence of such a `self' by<br>referring to "the one who sees".  But by further stating that "the one who sees,<br>sees", it would be like establishing an agent with a double action, as we have<br>already `accounted for' the act of seeing in the statement of "the one who<br>sees".  And as it is not possible to have an agent with a double action, the<br>statement of "the one who sees, sees", would not be logically coherent.  But<br>the use of some kind of logic may not be very useful in trying to understand<br>directly the non-existence of a `self' who acts as an agent in regard to the<br>visual sensation (as well as the other sensations), as it is necessary to develop<br>a more experiential understanding of what may actually be involved.<br><br>     In regard to the so-called subjective-pole, or the `self' dimension in<br>visual sensation, we might say that there is a deep seated tendency to believe<br>that there is `someone inside us' looking out onto the world of `things' and<br>appearances from a stable vantage point `in our head' and `behind our<br>eyeballs'.  We believe that there is an ongoing-individual or `self' who `looks-<br>out' from the stable vantage point, such that there is a concrete and solid<br>subject who looks out at all the various appearances, or `things' or `objects' in<br>our world.  But this is regarded in Buddhist philosophy to be an erroneous<br>presupposition, or a deluded view.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p><br>     Through developing insight into what may actually be involved, we may<br>find that this notion of `someone on the inside looking out' is in fact a<br>mistaken belief, based upon the belief in a `truly-existing self', and that in<br>fact, the visual sensation has nothing to do with a dimension of a `self' or even<br>consciousness or mind `going out' to interact with or `grasp' an object of<br>perception.<br><br>     As for the objective pole of these `things' or `objects', although there<br>appear to be very many types of `things' or `objects', there is a sense in which<br>all of these `objects' are alike in being a mere appearance before us. <br>Wherever we are, there is always some type of appearance before us, and<br>people and the appearances before them always arise together in an<br>inseparable manner.<br><br>     In common-sense thinking, we regard the appearance before us as<br>being truly-existing `things'.  That is, that they are things which really `exist'<br>in a `really-out-there' kind of way.  We regard them as solid `things' that are<br>so real that we think that "they would look like that even if we were not<br>looking at them".  We regard the world as being like some sort of container<br>for a collection of spread-out `things' that we can interact with here and there,<br>and that these things are `solid things' `out-there' from which we are separated<br>by space, and that there `things' have insides which are also `solid' and `real'.<br><br>     <br>     The Madhyamika philosophy is a very unusual system of philosophy, in<br>that, rather than taking any position in regard to what is actually the case with<br>this world of `things', it takes the approach of refuting other positions that<br>might be taken in analyzing `the world'.<br><br>     Still, it may be possible to `hint-at' what may be involved in an accurate<br>analysis of the nature of appearances, the so-called `world of things'.  As we<br>have said, people (and other beings, of course) and the appearances before<br>them, always `arise together' inseparably.  The key to understanding the true<br>nature of these appearances seems to be to be aware of the dimension in<br>which the so-called form or appearance before us and the *awareness* of this<br>form or appearance, are completely inseparable.  It is as if the awareness of<br>consciousness and the form-aspect are `completely intermingling at every<br>point' and as if the consciousness and form aspects are completely and totally<br>integrated to create an apparitional-like appearance.  Although we might say<br>that ultimately there is no interaction between a subjective pole of<br>consciousness, or mind, and an objective pole of separately-existing form, it<br>may still be useful to *point-to* the way that `things' might really be, using<br>terms like `awareness' and `form' being `completely-integrated' `beyond<br>duality'.<br><br>     Also, we might say that the `mind' or `consciousness' does not `go-out'<br>to a so-called `object', but that it is as if the appearance before us has a `built-<br>in' dimension of awareness.  It is not that the so-called `appearance before us'<br>is doing the `knowing' rather than the person.  But we might say that<br>appearance bears `a knowing dimension' beyond the realm of a subject<br>sensing an object.  All appearances are, in fact, non-dual (advaya).  That is,<br>they are present in the manner of an apparition, having nothing to do with any<br>kind of truly-existing (as a separate dimension) subjective pole, or `self' or<br>`consciousness' interacting with an `acutally-out-there' objective pole or<br>`truly-existing-thing'.<br><br>     It is because of this dimension of awareness and form being so<br>completely integrated *beyond the realm of a subject interacting with a truly<br>existing object*, that we can say that these appearances or so-called `things'<br>are `shunya' or `empty' of self-nature, or of the nature of being `truly-existing'.<br><br>     When we say that things are `appraritional' in nature, we mean that it is<br>as if these `apperances before us' are ultimately present as if they were like a<br>reflection in a mirror, rather than being present in a concrete, `really-out-<br>there' kind of way.  What we call `things' are really more like `apparitional-<br>like appearances' which are present beyond the realm of a subject interacting<br>with an independent, `truly-existing' `object', and which are, more<br>specifically, actually like a `surface-like apparition'.  By `surface-like<br>apparition', we mean that there is a sense in which all appearances are<br>*always on the surface*.  <br><br>     Consider, for example, a common object like a box of cereal.  We are<br>presented with what we might call "a patch of color-form", a mere apperance<br>arising within the realm of our awareness.  This form is completely integrated<br>with our awarenss of `it', and is ultimately present as if it were like a<br>reflection in a mirror.<br><br>     Another dimension involves a sense in which we assume that the box is<br>a solid object with an inside that has true objective existence.  But we need to<br>develop an understanding in which "all you see is all there is" in a completely<br>integrated situation of `completeness'.  of course, we can `reveal' further<br>dimensions of an apperance, but the act called "opening the box and pouring<br>out the contents", but it is important to keep in mind that this will actually be<br>a further or separate non-dual visual presentation `complete' in itself, and<br>arising beyond a subjective pole and an object interacting, which we can<br>connect in our mind to the appearance we call the `outside of the box'.  But it<br>is very important to recognize that this principle of `connecting' visual<br>presentations over time (which also partakes ultimately of the nature of being<br>`empty' of inherent or true-existence) is only applicable at the level of<br>conventional common sense, and that the dimension of non-dual visual<br>presentations arising in a manner of `completeness' (with a `built-in'<br>dimension of `timelessness') is the ultimate manner in which appearances<br>arise.<br><br>     Likewise, we might assume that when looking at `the front of the box'<br>that there is a `behind' or `underneath' part of the box that is presently not<br>visible but which actually `exists' and `looks the way it does'.  But as it is with<br>`the inside of the box', so it is with the `behind' or `underneath parth'.  We can,<br>as with the `inside', `reveal' the `behind' or presently `hidden' part of `the box',<br>but the ultimate nature of the so-called `box' is the surface-like apparitional-<br>like presentation which is present in the manner of a reflection in a mirror - a<br>non-dual appearance beyond the realm of being a `truly-existing thing'.  <br><br>     Let us now consider an example of the situation we might call "a person<br>going over to their car parked across the street".  From the common sense<br>point of view, we are `over here', and we see the car which is `over there'. <br>We are the subject and the car is the object that we see, and we are separated<br>by space.  At a conventional level, we think that we can get closer to `it' by<br>`walking towards it', until we `get there' and then `pull the door handle' and<br>`get inside the car'.<br><br>     Ultimately though, the apperance we call `our car' is completely<br>inseparable from our awareness in a non-dual way, like a miraculously-<br>appearing apparition.  `We' are completely integrated with `the appearance<br>before us' at the so-called `first-sighting', and there is a sense in which we are<br>never separated by `space' from `the appearance before us'.  And so in the<br>situation called `walking over to the car', because the appearance is<br>completely integrated with our awareness at the so-called `first-sighting' and<br>at so-called `subsequent-sightings' as `we get closer to the car'.<br><br>     Similarly, the concept of `open-space' as separating `us' from `the<br>appearance before us' is ultimately also an illusion arising from not being<br>aware of the sense in which `the appearance before us' is like a non-dual<br>apparition, completely integrated in the realm of awareness.  If there is no<br>distance between our so-called `consciousness' and the so-called `object',<br>there is no such thing as `invisible space' separating `us' and `the car'.  Also, in<br>light of the appearance we call `our parked car' being completely integrated<br>with non-dual awareness (keeping in mind all the different dimensions<br>involved in the manner that has been discussed), there is a sense in which the<br>car is not a solidly existing `thing' with an `inside' and `outside' belonging to<br>an `it' that can be said to `truly-exist' as "a thing with an inside and outside of<br>its own".<br><br>     There is also a sense in which, by not recognizing the dimension of the<br>non-dual awareness which is aware of the `empty' - `no-self'  - nature of<br>`ourselves' and `things', that by thinking that `we' and `our car' are separately<br>existing `things' or `objects' (the word "object" can be broken-down<br>etymologically to mean "thrown-against") and not being aware of non-dual<br>awareness, known as vidya in Sanskrit Buddhist terminology, we actually<br>create or enforce the illusion that we are a separate, truly-existing `thing',<br>bound by skin, walking around and regarding the world as a collection of<br>`things' to interact with.  By believing that we are "walking over to our car<br>and getting inside this thing", it is as if we solidify or actually create the belief<br>that we are a truly existing `thing' which exists as `just another thing' which is<br>separated from the appearance before us.<br><br>     Ultimately, the scientific notion of people (and other beigns with<br>consciousness, such as animals) as being *organisms* which interact with an<br>environment which is separated from them, is completely erroneous,<br>according to Buddhist philosophy.  It is true that, in a sense, as people, we are<br>an "embodiment of mind".  But this mind is a completely open-ended<br>continuum which is so open-ended, that in a sense, it is as if the mind has the<br>ability to `take on the form' of `whatever happens to appear before it', that is,<br>the appearances which we regard as being `truly-existing things'.  Although<br>from the ultimate point of view, this `mind' is as `empty' of true or inherent<br>existence as is the `self' or `things', it may still be useful to talk about our<br>being an "embodiment of a mind" which becomes `terminated' by<br>appearances in a non-dual way, beyond the realm of a subject interacting with<br>an object, in order to `point-to' the way things may be ultimately.<br><br>     Also, the idea of the environment of `the world of things' as being a<br>realm separate from the `beings in the world', as if `the world of things' was<br>`standing around' separately, `waiting to be interacted with', needs to be<br>analyzed more carefully.  Consider, for example, the idea of famous<br>landmarks such as the White House and the Kremlin.  We might say that<br>there are, in conventional thinking, regarded as actually `taking up space in a<br>certain place' and having the status of "really being there and `standing<br>around' looking like they look" and having the status of a `truly-existing thing<br>in a truly existing place'.  It may be possible to undermine this notion of<br>`things' and `places' `waiting for us' in a separate manner.  We might be able<br>to end up with a more sophisticated understanding of how it is with these<br>`people', `places', and `things' in a manner that goes beyond the realm of<br>organisms interacting with a solid world of things that `stand around' as a<br>separate environment.  From the point of view of what may actually be<br>involved in the situation called "an American looking at the Kremlin" or "a<br>Russian looking at the White House", if we understand this idea of ourselves<br>as an `embodiment of mind' which becomes `terminated' by an appearance in<br>a completely non-dual way, beyond the realm of a subject and object, it may<br>be necessary to completely rething our ideas of analyzing the world as being<br>made up of separate `categories' or `people', `places,' and `things', which<br>would also have far-reaching ramifications in the socio-political realm.  And<br>if, in this light of our being an "embodiment of a mind" which becomes<br>terminated by an appearance in a non-dual way beyond the realm of subject<br>and object, we consider that, for example, in a subject such as the history of<br>warfare or aggression, we are dealing with soldies of different nations who, as<br>embodiments of mind whose minds, from a higher point of view, become<br>`terminated' in a non-dual way by the appearance referred to at a common-<br>sense conventional level, as "other soldiers who are the enemy," the<br>implications are shocking, in a manner that goes beyond, and yet<br>encompasses, the realm of moral considerations.<br><br>     As for the active aspects of this non-dual awareness which is beyond<br>the realm of subject and object, or vidya, this is termed jnana, and as opposed<br>to vijnana, or ordinary dualistic consciousness, in which the subjective and<br>objective poles are regarded as being actually inherently existing, with jnana,<br>one is aware of the non-dual nature of people and appearances.  If we use an<br>example of "two people and their parked car", we might say that the person<br>using vijnana regards the car as a truly-existing thing that he or she can `walk<br>over to and get inside of', while the person jnana is aware of the non-dual<br>dimension in which the `individual' and the `thing' are both `empty' of being<br>actually-existing things which are interacting with each other.  From the point<br>of view of the person whose awareness is characterized by vijnana (which can<br>be broken down etymologically to mean "knowing-apart"), there are three<br>separate things involved in this example: that is, two people, plus one car. <br>From the point of view of the person whose awareness would be<br>characterized by jnana, however, this is not the case.  But what `actually is the<br>case' may be beyond the realm of being expressed in the ordinary language of<br>`people and things' as separate objects to be `added up', and of "two people<br>interacting with the one same thing".  Of course, the person using jnana is still<br>aware of the sense in which things like cereal boxes and cars appear to exist<br>at a conventional level, that is, the way that they seem to exist from the point<br>of view of `other people using vijnana', but he/she is never separated from the<br>non-dual awareness of vidya, and this is what is said to characterise the<br>awareness of the Buddhas.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><br> <br>      If we mistake the appearances before us as being `truly-esisting',<br> `actually out there' types of `things' with true, inherent existence, we fall into<br> deep error, according to Buddhist thought, setting up a fictitious realm of an<br> individual separated from the world of appearances (so-called `things') in a<br> deep-seated way.  This is known as the realm of samsara, the world of<br> "running around and around in circles", chasing after `things' we regard as<br> `really-existing' that we would like to have, while avoiding `the things that we<br> don't like'.  But these emotions or `emotional filters' of attachment, or desire,<br> and aversion (combines with irritation, as a sort of `complex') as well as the<br> other basic emotions of pride and jealousy, all arise from dualistic-ignorance,<br> or "not knowing how it really is with people and things".  It is said that this<br> realm of samsara and its `flip-side' of nirvana, exist nowhere else than in our<br> mind: when our mind is pervaded by emotional and intellectual obscurations<br> about `the way things are', we are caught up in samsara; but when this same<br> mind is completely freed from those obscurations, we attain nirvana.  So<br> nirvana is not some other-worldly realm in which we would see different<br> things than other people see, but our same world as seen differently, that is,<br> pervaded by the non-dual awareness of vidya.<br> <br>      Also, our mind in union with the ultimate nature of apperances is<br> actually the Dharmakaya, the so-called "body of Truth" of a Buddha, which is<br> one of the "three bodies of a Buddha".<br> <br>      Although we begin with the common sense view of `people' and things'<br> as truly-existing separate entities interacting with each other, after we hear<br> about or read about the `empty' or `no-self' nature of people and things, we<br> may begin to engage in the process known as asraya paravritti, or "the turning<br> over in the mind", by which we begin to `tune-into' the ultimate, `empty'<br> nature of `people' and `appearances'.  Little by little, we can deepen our<br> awareness of this dimension until it becomes more and more a part of our<br> nature, and eventually, it may be possible to become a true embodiment of<br> this non-dual awareness, or vidya.<br> <br>      When the Buddhist texts were first being translated in tibet, the term<br> vidya, or non-dual awareness, was translated into Tibetan as rig-pa.  But<br> rather than translating the negation of this non-dual awarenss of vidya<br> (avidya) as rig-med, which could indicate a complete negation of rig-pa, it<br> was translated as ma-rig-pa, indicating a *qualitative* drop in the level of rig-<br> pa, or non-dual awareness.  So we can see that from one point of view, our<br> awareness of the nature of `people' and `things' is not completely confused,<br> but that it needs to be transformed so that it will be `in-tune-with' `the way<br> things really are'.                <br> <br>      Although in Hinduism, the different yogas are practiced in order to<br> attain union with God, in Buddhism, we might say that `emptiness-yoga', that<br> is, trying to attain union with the ultimate `empty' (-apparitional) nature of<br> people and appearances, is practiced.  The teachings on the `empty' (-<br> apparitional) nature of `people' and appearances (so-called `things') are<br> fundamental teachings of Mahayana Buddhism which are also very important<br> in the offshoot of the Mahayana, Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism.  But even<br> though the teachings on the `empty' or `no-self' - nature of `people' and<br> `things' are fundamental teachings of the Mahayana, at the highest level of<br> Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism known as Dzogchen, or the "Great<br> Perfection", it is in fact the continual contemplation of the non-dual<br> awareness of vidya which is said to constitute the main practice of this highest<br> mystical system of Dzogchen.<br> <br>      It is regarded as being very important to cultivate the awareness of the<br> non-dual nature of `people' and `things' in regard all manner of appearances,<br> deepening our understanding of what this means until it becomes a part of our<br> being at a very deep and completely integrated level.  When we being trying<br> to understand the meaning of shunyata or the `empty' (-apparitional) nature of<br> appearances, it may seem as if it is easier to recognize this dimension of<br> apparitionalness in regard to some `things' in a more readily comprehensible<br> way than with other `things'.  We may find it easier to be aware of this<br> apparitional dimension of appearances in regard to `objects' which appear to<br> partake of a `shiny, liminous' dimension, such as cans of food from the<br> supermarket, or perhaps magazine covers.  But we should eventually tru to<br> understand this `empty', apparitional nature of things in regard to *all*<br> appearances, although we may find it useful to "practice" using objects where<br> we find this non-dual awareness more (potentially, if not actually) apparent.<br> <br>      Along with the idea that appearances are `shunya' (or partake of the<br> nature of shunyata or `emptiness') or `empty of inherent existence', in the<br> manner that has been discussed, in the Vajyrayana or Tantric teachings, it is<br> said that along with this dimension of so-called `things' being `shunya' or<br> `empty', `they' also partake of a luminosity dimension (prabhasvara).  That is,<br> that these `empty' - appearances partake of a dimension of a shiny, luminous,<br> light-like nature.  Also, these appearances may be characterized as pataking<br> of the nature of "non-dividedness".  That is, that they are completely "non-<br> divided" in regard to the subject and object, or more precisely, "non-divided"<br> beyond the realm of a supposed subject and object.<br> <br>      As a footnote to these three dimensions of appearance, we might<br> consider the myth of *Lucifer* in the Judeo-Christian tradition.  Lucifer<br> means the "light-bearer", and if we examine this myth from the proper angle,<br> we might find that this myth of the fall of Lucifer may actually refer to the<br> "fall of man" from being in union with the ultimate, `empty' *luminous*<br> dimension of non-dual awareness, into the realm of individuals regarding<br> these appearances as being truly existing in a `real', `out-there' kind of way.<br> <br>      In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, although the term<br> tathagatagarbha can be taken in general usage to refer to the enlightened -<br> Buddha- nature inherent in all beings, existing as a potentiality that needs to<br> be activated and actualized, in another sense it refers to the process by which<br> Being itself is led back to attaining its true state.  Since this level of<br> attainment is beyond the level of a `self' who has attained this level of<br> realization, there is a sense in which the realization or attainment belongs to<br> Being itself, rather than to a `self' or "I".<br> <br>      Then it may be possible to understand such notions as that what is<br> behind the nature of `people' and `appearances' is nothing more than the<br> playful nature (lila) of Being itself.  It seems that Being has the ability to `set-<br> up' apparitional - like appearances, but it must be understood that these<br> appearances are completely `empty' of true or inherent existence, in the<br> manner that has been discussed.  The nature of these appearances is the<br> completely miraculous display or manifestation of Being, by which it `mirrors'<br> or `looks-at' itself, but as regards their status of being truly-existing `things',<br> they are alike in never having come into actual existence, ultimately.  Or as<br> the famous Tibetan poet-lama Milarepa expressed it:  "Things appear, but<br> they don't really exist!"<br> <br>      If we were to attain this level of being a true embodiment or a "holder"<br> of the non-dual awareness, or a vidyadhara, developing this awareness to ever<br> increasing levels until we embody this awareness to a level of total-<br> realization, while of course being able to act in a completely skillful and<br> compassionate manner with these apparitional-like appearances of `people'<br> and `things', it is said that there is nothing further to attain or realize; nothing<br> higher that we would need to aspire to.<br> <br>      As the famous Tibetan lama of the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan<br> Buddhism, Longchen Rabjam, has said: "Since everything is but an<br> apparition, perfect in being what it is, having nothing to do with good or bad,<br> acceptance or rejection, one may well burst out in laughter!"<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> ---<br> Nam kay tar tug ta yay sem chan nam<br> <br> May all beings, whose number is as infinite as the sky,<br> <br> ---<br> Ma bed zhin du ku sum ngon gyur te<br> <br> Realize the Three Bodies of the Buddha<br> <br> ---<br> Pa ma dro drug sem chan ma lu pa<br> <br> May my parents who are all the sentient beings of the Six realms of rebirth<br> without exception<br> <br> ---<br> Cham chig dod may sa la chin par shog<br> <br> Come together in the Primordial Original State (which is enlightenment<br> itself).<br> ---<br> (a Tibetan prayer)</p></div>

              <p>The 'No-Self' concept is one of the Buddha teachings which I never
                  really understand. But I am begining to notice something which has
                  always been with me but I never notice or pay little attention to.</p>
              <p>This may sound silly to you but this is what I just noticed:</p>

                  I am awake right now, typing this reply, I have a form thinking, just
                  named it "logical thinking". If I am to question myself "Who am I?". I
                  can easily answer "My name is ..., I am a 25 years old Singaporean
                  Chinese male ..." with my "logical thinking".</p>
              <p>BUT, if I am able
                  to ask myself the exact same question "Who am I?" when I am totally
                  unconcious (while dreaming or mediating?), it is impossible to answer
                  this question without my "logical thinking".</p>
              <p>To me, the reason
                  behind this experience is simple (this experience applies to you as
                  well), while you are unconcious, you do NOT have this "logical
                  thinking", therefore the concept of "I am" does not exist.</p>
              <p>In
                  fact a lot of attributes which we easily understood with our daily
                  "logical thinking" does not exist while we are unconcious. A very good
                  example which I believe you can comprehen is that the concept of "Time"
                  does not exist while we are unconcious.</p>
              <p>In another words, you

              <p>Yes, the entire idea of a 'self' is learnt. We learn it from young, that we have a name, that we are this and that. And because a baby doesn't know this but is fully conscious, we can savely say that what we know is not who we are. But our beliefs become a hypnotic spell, like a dream which we believe to be absolutely true. The sense of identity we know is actually acquired/learnt, it isn't natural, it's not our natural state.</p>
              <p>More importantly we divide ourselves, into a subject perceiving an outer world. In the dream we separate ourselves from the dream objects and perceive 'me/the experiencer' dealing with 'truly existent dream objects', only to realise when we wake up that it's a phantasm.</p>
              <p>One who realises no-self sees no separation, there is no perceiver apart from perceived, whether awake or in dream. In hearing there is just sound, no hearer. In thinking there is just thoughts, no thinker. Seeing, just scenery, no seer. There is no objects existing in a 'really-out-there' manner, and neither is there an experiencer in here watching. The sense of separation is an illusion, is the cause of all sufferings of samsara.</p>

              <p>It's all part of the process. The baby doesn't know 'no-self', but he hasn't learn 'self'... and so the sense of separation isn't present or strong. But he has to go through the process of learning self, everyone has to, and by any good karma he meets Buddhism, he can then begin to investigate whether this 'self' is true or not. Then the insight into Emptiness can arise.</p>
              <p>What is the self that we all think is real? Can it be found?</p>

              <p><br>I think the baby's experience is different. For most of us, 'no-self' can only be realised through practice and I guess sleeping is not one of them.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>

              <p>If you know the correct way of practice, you can practice in walking also, not necessary confined to sitting, and in activities as well. But this does not mean sitting meditation is unimportant. Try to start by sitting at least 30 minutes a day. Then try to practice as much as possible in daily activities as well.</p>
              <p>The way to develope insights is through mindfulness. Without mindfulness, there is no way you can be able to penetrate the true nature of reality.</p>

              <p>From the same book: <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe1-4.html">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe1-4.html</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br> <strong>Chapter 1</strong><br> <br> <strong>Meditation: Why Bother?</strong><br> <br> Meditation is not easy. It takes time and it takes energy. It 
                                    also takes grit, determination and discipline. It requires a 
                                    host of personal qualities which we normally regard as unpleasant 
                                    and which we like to avoid whenever possible. We can sum it 
                                    all up in the American word 'gumption'. Meditation takes 'gumption'. 
                                    It is certainly a great deal easier just to kick back and watch 
                                    television. So why bother? Why waste all that time and energy 
                                    when you could be out enjoying yourself? Why bother? Simple. 
                                    Because you are human. And just because of the simple fact that 
                                    you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness 
                                    in life which simply will not go away. You can suppress it from 
                                    your awareness for a time. You can distract yourself for hours 
                                    on end, but it always comes back--usually when you least expect 
                                    it. All of a sudden, seemingly out of the blue, you sit up, 
                                    take stock, and realize your actual situation in life.<br> <br> There you are, and you suddenly realize that you are spending
                                    your whole life just barely getting by. You keep up a good
                                    front.
                                    You manage to make ends meed somehow and look OK from the
                                    outside. But those periods of desperation, those times
                                    when you feel
                                    everything caving in on you, you keep those to yourself.
                                    You are a mess. And you know it. But you hide it beautifully.
                                    Meanwhile,
                                    way down under all that you just know there has got be
                                    some other way to live, some better way to look at the
                                    world,
                                    some
                                    way to touch life more fully. You click into it by chance
                                    now and then. You get a good job. You fall in love. You
                                    win the
                                    game. and for a while, things are different. Life takes
                                    on a richness and clarity that makes all the bad times
                                    and humdrum
                                    fade away. The whole texture of your experience changes
                                    and you say to yourself, "OK, now I've made it; now I will 
                                    be happy". But then that fades, too, like smoke in
                                    the wind. You are left with just a memory. That and a vague
                                    awareness
                                    that something is wrong. <br> <br> But there is really another whole realm of depth and sensitivity 
                                    available in life, somehow, you are just not seeing it. You 
                                    wind up feeling cut off. You feel insulated from the sweetness 
                                    of experience by some sort of sensory cotton. You are not really 
                                    touching life. You are not making it again. And then even that 
                                    vague awareness fades away, and you are back to the same old 
                                    reality. The world looks like the usual foul place, which is 
                                    boring at best. It is an emotional roller coaster, and you spend 
                                    a lot of your time down at the bottom of the ramp, yearning 
                                    for the heights. <br> <br> So what is wrong with you? Are you a freak? No. You are
                                    just human. And you suffer from the same malady that infects
                                    every
                                    human being. It is a monster in side all of us, and it
                                    has many
                                    arms: Chronic tension, lack of genuine compassion for others,
                                    including the people closest to you, feelings being blocked
                                    up, and emotional deadness. Many, many arms. None of us
                                    is entirely
                                    free from it. We may deny it. We try to suppress it. We
                                    build a whole culture around hiding from it, pretending
                                    it is not
                                    there, and distracting ourselves from it with goals and
                                    projects and status. But it never goes away. It is a constant
                                    undercurrent
                                    in every thought and every perception; a little wordless
                                    voice
                                    at the back of the head saying, "Not good enough yet. Got 
                                    to have more. Got to make it better. Got to be better." It
                                    is a monster, a monster that manifests everywhere in subtle
                                    forms.<br> <br> Go to a party. Listen to the laughter, that brittle-tongued 
                                    voice that says fun on the surface and fear underneath. Feel 
                                    the tension, feel the pressure. Nobody really relaxes. They 
                                    are faking it. Go to a ball game. Watch the fan in the stand. 
                                    Watch the irrational fit of anger. Watch the uncontrolled frustration 
                                    bubbling forth from people that masquerades under the guise 
                                    of enthusiasm, or team spirit. Booing, cat-calls and unbridled 
                                    egotism in the name of team loyalty. Drunkenness, fights in 
                                    the stands. These are the people trying desperately to release 
                                    tension from within. These are not people who are at peace with 
                                    themselves. Watch the news on TV. Listen to the lyrics in popular 
                                    songs. You find the same theme repeated over and over in variations. 
                                    Jealousy, suffering, discontent and stress.<br> <br> Life seems to be a perpetual struggle, some enormous effort 
                                    against staggering odds. And what is our solution to all this 
                                    dissatisfaction? We get stuck in the ' If only' syndrome. If 
                                    only I had more money, then I would be happy. If only I can 
                                    find somebody who really loves me, if only I can lose 20 pounds, 
                                    if only I had a color TV, Jacuzzi, and curly hair, and on and 
                                    on forever. So where does all this junk come from and more important, 
                                    what can we do about it? It comes from the conditions of our 
                                    own minds. It is deep, subtle and pervasive set of mental habits, 
                                    a Gordian knot which we have built up bit by bit and we can 
                                    unravel just the same way, one piece at a time. We can tune 
                                    up our awareness, dredge up each separate piece and bring it 
                                    out into the light. We can make the unconscious conscious, slowly, 
                                    one piece at a time.<br> <br> The essence of our experience is change. Change is incessant. 
                                    Moment by moment life flows by and it is never the same. Perpetual 
                                    alteration is the essence of the perceptual universe. A thought 
                                    springs up in you head and half a second later, it is gone. 
                                    In comes another one, and that is gone too. A sound strikes 
                                    your ears and then silence. Open your eyes and the world pours 
                                    in, blink and it is gone. People come into your life and they 
                                    leave again. Friends go, relatives die. Your fortunes go up 
                                    and they go down. Sometimes you win and just as often you lose. 
                                    It is incessant: change, change, change. No two moments ever 
                                    the same.<br> <br> There is not a thing wrong with this. It is the nature of the 
                                    universe. But human culture has taught u some odd responses 
                                    to this endless flowing. We categorize experiences. We try to 
                                    stick each perception, every mental change in this endless flow 
                                    into one of three mental pigeon holes. It is good, or it is 
                                    bad, or it is neutral. Then, according to which box we stick 
                                    it in, we perceive with a set of fixed habitual mental responses. 
                                    If a particular perception has been labeled 'good', then we 
                                    try to freeze time right there. We grab onto that particular 
                                    thought, we fondle it, we hold it, we try to keep it from escaping. 
                                    When that does not work, we go all-out in an effort to repeat 
                                    the experience which caused that thought. Let us call this mental 
                                    habit 'grasping'. <br> <br> Over on the other side of the mind lies the box labeled 'bad'. 
                                    When we perceive something 'bad', we try to push it away. We 
                                    try to deny it, reject it, get rid of it any way we can. We 
                                    fight against our own experience. We run from pieces of ourselves. 
                                    Let us call this mental habit 'rejecting'. Between these two 
                                    reactions lies the neutral box. Here we place the experiences 
                                    which are neither good nor bad. They are tepid, neutral, uninteresting 
                                    and boring. We pack experience away in the neutral box so that 
                                    we can ignore it and thus return jour attention to where the 
                                    action is, namely our endless round of desire and aversion. 
                                    This category of experience gets robbed of its fair share of 
                                    our attention. Let us call this mental habit 'ignoring'. The 
                                    direct result of all this lunacy is a perpetual treadmill race 
                                    to nowhere, endlessly pounding after pleasure, endlessly fleeing 
                                    from pain, endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. 
                                    Than wondering why life tastes so flat. In the final analysis, 
                                    it's a system that does not work. <br> <br> No matter how hard you pursue pleasure and success, there are 
                                    times when you fail. No matter how fast you flee, there are 
                                    times when pain catches up with you. And in between those times, 
                                    life is so boring you could scream. Our minds are full of opinions 
                                    and criticisms. We have built walls all around ourselves and 
                                    we are trapped with the prison of our own lies and dislikes. 
                                    We suffer.<br> <br> Suffering is big word in Buddhist thought. It is a key term 
                                    and it should be thoroughly understood. The Pali word is 'dukkha', 
                                    and it does not just mean the agony of the body. It means the 
                                    deep, subtle sense of unsatisfactoriness which is a part of 
                                    every mental treadmill. The essence of life is suffering, said 
                                    the Buddha. At first glance this seems exceedingly morbid and 
                                    pessimistic. It even seems untrue. After all, there are plenty 
                                    of times when we are happy. Aren't there? No, there are not. 
                                    It just seems that way. Take any moment when you feel really 
                                    fulfilled and examine it closely. Down under the joy, you will 
                                    find that subtle, all-pervasive undercurrent of tension, that 
                                    no matter how great the moment is, it is going to end. No matter 
                                    how much you just gained, you are either going to lose some 
                                    of it or spend the rest of your days guarding what you have 
                                    got and scheming how to get more. And in the end, you are going 
                                    to die. In the end, you lose everything. It is all transitory. 
                                <br> <br> Sounds pretty bleak, doesn't it? Luckily it's not; not at all. 
                                    It only sounds bleak when you view it from the level of ordinary 
                                    mental perspective, the very level at which the treadmill mechanism 
                                    operates. Down under that level lies another whole perspective, 
                                    a completely different way to look at the universe. It is a 
                                    level of functioning where the mind does not try to freeze time, 
                                    where we do not grasp onto our experience as it flows by, where 
                                    we do not try to block things out and ignore them. It is a level 
                                    of experience beyond good and bad, beyond pleasure and pain. 
                                    It is a lovely way to perceive the world, and it is a learnable 
                                    skill. It is not easy, but is learnable.<br> <br> Happiness and peace. Those are really the prime issues
                                    in human existence. That is what all of us are seeking.
                                    This
                                    often is
                                    a bit hard to see because we cover up those basic goals
                                    with layers of surface objectives. We want food, we want
                                    money,
                                    we
                                    want sex, possessions and respect. We even say to ourselves
                                    that the idea of 'happiness' is too abstract: "Look, I 
                                    am practical. Just give me enough money and I will buy all the 
                                    happiness I need". Unfortunately, this is an attitude
                                    that does not work. Examine each of these goals and you
                                    will find
                                    they are superficial. You want food. Why? Because I am
                                    hungry. So you are hungry, so what? Well if I eat, I won't
                                    be hungry
                                    and then I'll feel good. Ah ha! Feel good! Now there is
                                    a real
                                    item. What we really seek is not the surface goals. They
                                    are just means to an end. What we are really after is the
                                    feeling
                                    of relief that comes when the drive is satisfied. Relief,
                                    relaxation and an end to the tension. Peace, happiness,
                                    no more yearning.<br> <br> So what is this happiness? For most of us, the perfect happiness 
                                    would mean getting everything we wanted, being in control of 
                                    everything, playing Caesar, making the whole world dance a jig 
                                    according to our every whim. Once again, it does not work that 
                                    way. Take a look at the people in history who have actually 
                                    held this ultimate power. These were not happy people. Most 
                                    assuredly they were not men at peace with themselves. Why? Because 
                                    they were driven to control the world totally and absolutely 
                                    and they could not. They wanted to control all men and there 
                                    remained men who refused to be controlled. They could not control 
                                    the stars. They still got sick. They still had to die.<br> <br> You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, 
                                    there is another option. You can learn to control your mind, 
                                    to step outside of this endless cycle of desire and aversion. 
                                    You can learn to not want what you want, to recognize desires 
                                    but not be controlled by them. This does not mean that you lie 
                                    down on the road and invite everybody to walk all over you . 
                                    It means that you continue to live a very normal-looking life, 
                                    but live from a whole new viewpoint. You do the things that 
                                    a person must do, but you are free from that obsessive, compulsive 
                                    drivenness of your own desires. You want something, but you 
                                    don't need to chase after it. You fear something, but you don't 
                                    need to stand there quaking in your boots. This sort of mental 
                                    culture is very difficult. It takes years. But trying to control 
                                    everything is impossible, and the difficult is preferable to 
                                    the impossible.<br> <br> Wait a minute, though. Peace and happiness! Isn't that what 
                                    civilization is all about? We build skyscrapers and freeways. 
                                    We have paid vacations, TV sets. We provide free hospitals and 
                                    sick leaves, Social Security and welfare benefits. All of that 
                                    is aimed at providing some measure of peace and happiness. Yet 
                                    the rate of mental illness climbs steadily, and the crime rates 
                                    rise faster. The streets are crawling with delinquents and unstable 
                                    individuals. Stick you arms outside the safety of your own door 
                                    and somebody is very likely to steal your watch! Something is 
                                    not working. A happy man does not feel driven to kill. We like 
                                    to think that our society is exploiting every area of human 
                                    knowledge in order to achieve peace and happiness.<br> <br> We are just beginning to realize that we have overdeveloped
                                    the material aspect of existence at the expense of the
                                    deeper emotional and spiritual aspect, and we are paying
                                    the price
                                    for that error. It is one thing to talk about degeneration
                                    of
                                    moral and spiritual fiber in America today, and another
                                    thing to do something about it. The place to start is within
                                    ourselves.
                                    Look carefully inside, truly and objectively, and each
                                    of us
                                    will see moments when "I am the punk" and "I 
                                    am the crazy". We will learn to see those moments,
                                    see them clearly, cleanly and without condemnation, and
                                    we will
                                    be on our way up and out of being so.<br> <br> You can't make radical changes in the pattern of your life until 
                                    you begin to see yourself exactly as you are now. As soon as 
                                    you do that, changes flow naturally. You don't have to force 
                                    or struggle or obey rules dictated to you by some authority. 
                                    You just change. It is automatic. But arriving at the initial 
                                    insight is quite a task. You've got to see who you are and how 
                                    you are, without illusion, judgement or resistance of any kind. 
                                    You've got to see your own place in society and your function 
                                    as a social being. You've got to see your duties and obligations 
                                    to your fellow human beings, and above all, your responsibility 
                                    to yourself as an individual living with other individuals. 
                                    And you've got to see all of that clearly and as a unit, a single 
                                    gestalt of interrelationship. It sounds complex, but it often 
                                    occurs in a single instant. Mental culture through meditation 
                                    is without rival in helping you achieve this sort of understanding 
                                    and serene happiness.<br> <br> The Dhammapada is an ancient Buddhist text which anticipated
                                    Freud by thousands of years. It says: "What you are now 
                                    is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will 
                                    be the result of what you are now. The consequences of an evil 
                                    mind will follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls 
                                    it. The consequences of a purified mind will follow you like 
                                    you own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own purified 
                                    mind-- no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined 
                                    mind brings happiness".<br> <br> Meditation is intended to purify the mind. It cleanses the thought 
                                    process of what can be called psychic irritants, things like 
                                    greed, hatred and jealousy, things that keep you snarled up 
                                    in emotional bondage. It brings the mind to a state of tranquility 
                                    and awareness, a state of concentration and insight.<br> <br> In our society, we are great believers in education. We believe 
                                    that knowledge makes a cultured person civilized. Civilization, 
                                    however, polishes the person superficially. Subject our noble 
                                    and sophisticated gentleman to stresses of war or economic collapse, 
                                    and see what happens. It is one thing to obey the law because 
                                    you know the penalties and fear the consequences. It is something 
                                    else entirely to obey the law because you have cleansed yourself 
                                    from the greed that would make you steal and the hatred that 
                                    would make you kill. Throw a stone into a stream. The running 
                                    water would smooth the surface, but the inner part remains unchanged. 
                                    Take that same stone and place it in the intense fires of a 
                                    forge, and the whole stone changes inside and outside. It all 
                                    melts. Civilization changes man on the outside. Meditation softens 
                                    him within, through and through.<br> <br> Meditation is called the Great Teacher. It is the cleansing 
                                    crucible fire that works slowly through understanding. The greater 
                                    your understanding, the more flexible and tolerant you can be. 
                                    The greater your understanding, the more compassionate you can 
                                    be. You become like a perfect parent or an ideal teacher. You 
                                    are ready to forgive and forget. You feel love towards others 
                                    because you understand them. And you understand others because 
                                    you have understood yourself. You have looked deeply inside 
                                    and seen self illusion and your own human failings. You have 
                                    seen your own humanity and learned to forgive and to love. When 
                                    you have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for others 
                                    is automatic. An accomplished meditator has achieved a profound 
                                    understanding of life, and he inevitably relates to the world 
                                    with a deep and uncritical love.<br> <br> Meditation is a lot like cultivating a new land. To make a field 
                                    out of a forest, fist you have to clear the trees and pull out 
                                    the stumps. Then you till the soil and you fertilize it. Then 
                                    you sow your seed and you harvest your crops. To cultivate your 
                                    mind, first you have to clear out the various irritants that 
                                    are in the way, pull them right out by the root so that they 
                                    won't grow back. Then you fertilize. You pump energy and discipline 
                                    in the mental soil. Then you sow the seed and you harvest your 
                                    crops of faith, morality , mindfulness and wisdom. <br> <br> Faith and morality, by the way, have a special meaning in this 
                                    context. Buddhism does not advocate faith in the sense of believing 
                                    something because it is written in a book or attributed to a 
                                    prophet or taught to you by some authority figure. The meaning 
                                    here is closer to confidence. It is knowing that something is 
                                    true because you have seen it work, because you have observed 
                                    that very thing within yourself. In the same way, morality is 
                                    not a ritualistic obedience to some exterior, imposed code of 
                                    behavior.<br> </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br> The purpose of meditation is personal transformation. The you 
                                    that goes in one side of the meditation experience is not the 
                                    same you that comes out the other side. It changes your character 
                                    by a process of sensitization, by making you deeply aware of 
                                    your own thoughts, word, and deeds. Your arrogance evaporated 
                                    and your antagonism dries up. Your mind becomes still and calm. 
                                    And your life smoothes out. Thus meditation properly performed 
                                    prepares you to meet the ups and down of existence. It reduces 
                                    your tension, your fear, and your worry. Restlessness recedes 
                                    and passion moderates. Things begin to fall into place and your 
                                    life becomes a glide instead of a struggle. All of this happens 
                                    through understanding.<br> <br> Meditation sharpens your concentration and your thinking power. 
                                    Then, piece by piece, your own subconscious motives and mechanics 
                                    become clear to you. Your intuition sharpens. The precision 
                                    of your thought increases and gradually you come to a direct 
                                    knowledge of things as they really are, without prejudice and 
                                    without illusion. So is this reason enough to bother? Scarcely. 
                                    These are just promises on paper. There is only one way you 
                                    will ever know if meditation is worth the effort. Learn to do 
                                    it right, and do it. See for yourself. <br> </span></p>

              <p>No-Self is not about not being in control and responding automatically. We still have to exercise our intentions to get things done.</p>
              <p>No-Self is saying, there is no separate agent, doer, controller, apart from the act, there is no separate observer/perceiver apart from perception.</p>
              <p>Deeds arise, action happens, and there is no separate doer or controller. Intention arise to get things done, but there is no thinker.</p>
              <p>And No-Self as I have said many times has nothing to do with 'just be what you are', it is not a practice, it is what Always Is, it is the nature of reality at all times whether you know it or not. This article is talking about a Dharma Seal, it is not a state that can be achieved. But insight into this as what Always Is can happen after years of practicing.</p>
