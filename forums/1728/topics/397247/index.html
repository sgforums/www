              <p>I highly recommend all to get the book 'Buddhism Is Not What You Think' by Steve Hagen.</p>
              <p>This is by far one of the most complete and clearest book on Buddhism that I and Thusness have found. Very well written, and Steve Hagen has definitely very deep insights into non-duality, anatta and emptiness.</p>

                  Beliefs; Meditation Now or Never; Buddhism Plain &amp; Simple</span>; 
                  and <span class="bold">How the World Can Be the Way It Is: An Inquiry 
                  for the New Millennium into Science, Philosophy, and Perception</span>. 
                  These are all outstanding and very highly recommended books, especially<span class="bold"> Buddhism Is Not What You Think.</span> Steve is one of 
                  the clearest and most articulate living Zen teachers I've come across. I
                   recommend him for his subtle understanding of emptiness, impermanence, 
                  and true nonduality, and also for his intelligent approach to meditation
                   and "practice." Steve is excellent at clarifying the distinction 
                  between conceptual thought and direct perception or awareness. He is 
                  excellent at exposing conceptual reifications, especially the most 
                  subtle and ubiquitous ones, which are so easily mistaken for reality. He
                   sheds light on the thinking mind's habitual tendency to try to grasp 
                  reality conceptually, and then to mistake the map for the territory. I 
                  especially appreciate how Steve talks about emptiness, not as a 
                  formless, nihilistic void or a big empty space, but rather, as 
                  thorough-going flux, the impermanence that "is <em>so</em> complete, <em>so</em> thorough, that nothing is formed in the first place to <span class="italic"><em>be</em></span> impermanent." This is the Zen 
                  understanding of emptiness or no-self. Emptiness is <em>everything</em>,
                   as it is -- the seamless wholeness in which there really are no 
                  separate, substantial, persisting, independent "things" to be found, 
                  except as ideas in conceptual thought. Steve teaches formal Zen practice
                   in a pretty bare, plain, stripped-down way, but it is still rigorous 
                  and ritualized. I'm not drawn anymore to this kind of strict, formal Zen
                   practice, so some aspects of Steve's approach don't resonate here, but 
                  the essencial core of what he says is outstanding. His book on 
                  meditation, <span class="bold">Meditation Now or Never,</span> has some 
                  chapters in it that are absolutely superb, and it's not just about 
                  meditation, it's about life. (Again, I don't resonate with the 
                  insistence on formal practice or with the necessity of certain forms, 
                  postures and hand positions, but if you can take that part lightly as 
                  simply suggestions and possibilities, then the essence of what he's 
                  saying about meditation and living life is right on the mark -- see 
                  especially chapters 17, 28, 33, 34, 10 and 2 in this book -- 
                  beautiful!). Steve is truly humble, down to earth, articulate, bright 
                  and very awake. A Zen priest in the lineage of Dainin Katagiri and a 
                  former science researcher, Steve heads the Dharma Field Meditation and 
                  Learning Center in Minneapolis, and if you're looking for a Zen center, 
                  this is a truly wonderful place. Norm Randolph, who also teaches there, 
                  is also wonderful. Books, tapes, excellent classes on CD, a newsletter 
                  that frequently includes articles by Steve and Norm, talks on-line and 
                  more information <a href="http://www.dharmafield.org/">here</a>.
                   Very highly recommended.</p>

                   are some excerpts from the book 'Buddhism Is Not What You Think' by Zen
                   teacher Steve Hagen. Thusness and I think the book is very well written
                   and very complete. Highly recommended. Thusness noted that many 
                  practitioners stop at the phase of non-dual, few penetrates indepth and 
                  see clearly the meaning of Anatta and Dependent Origination.<br><br>However
                   Steve Hagen is able to cover <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">all
                   the insights</a> that Thusness wrote, and be able to link One Mind to 
                  Emptiness. Not many people know how to link One Mind to Emptiness. That 
                  is, All is Mind due to its empty and luminous essence. All is talking 
                  about this moment of manifestation, yet many cling to Oneness and cannot
                   see the D.O. nature. As Thusness wrote to Longchen previously, <span style="font-style: italic;">This is also the understanding of why 
                  Everything is the One Reality incorporating causes, conditions and 
                  luminosity of our Empty nature as One and inseparable. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Everything as the One Reality should never be
                   understood from a dualistic/inherent standpoint.</span></span><br><br>Steve
                   Hagen is one of the few who are able to capture the essence of Buddhism
                   and explain it eloquently to his readers, urging them to <span style="font-style: italic;">SEE</span> (and not believe or

                    Very highly recommended.<br><br>------------<br><br>Quotations from 
                  'Buddhism Is Not What You Think':<br><br>...All things are like this. 
                  Indeed, it's impossible for any conceived object not to be like this. 
                  Nothing stands on its own. Nothing has its own being. Each thing is 
                  inseparable from, and inter-identical with, all that it's not.<br><br>Thus
                   perception is an objectless Awareness since, when we just see, what is 
                  truly seen involves not objects but the Whole. Nothing actually forms as
                   an object; nothing stands apart. No matter where we look, there's just 
                  this.<br><br>Here's another example of a foolish-sounding Zen question 
                  that is actually an expression of just seeing: What is the sound of one 
                  hand clapping? When we conceive of a hand, it's just a single, isolated 
                  hand, and we're puzzled at the question. To clap, we need two hands. But
                   this is approaching the question in our ordinary way - that is, 
                  conceptually.<br><br>With naked perception however, we see that a hand 
                  is not a separate and distinct hand. Everything is included with it. One
                   hand clapping is the sound of two hands clapping is the sound of ten 
                  hands clapping. It's the sound before and after two hands clap. It's 
                  also the sound before and after one hand claps.<br><br>Conceptually, we 
                  think that sound is sound and silence is silence. The two seem neatly 
                  separated and distinct - in fact, opposite of each other. But this is 
                  only how we think, how we conceptualize. This is not how Reality is 
                  perceived, before we put everything into neat, nicely labelled (but 
                  deceptive) little packages.<br><br>We think there only has to be sound 
                  for there to be sound. We overlook that there must also be silence for 
                  there to be sound. And because of sound, there is silence. Were there no
                   sound, how could there be silence?<br><br>Before you strike a bell, a 
                  sound is already here. After you strike the bell, the sound is here. 
                  When the sound fades and dies away, the sound is still here. The sound 
                  is not just the sound but the silence, too, And the silence is the 
                  sound. This is what is actually perceived before we parse everything out
                   into this and that, into "myself" and "what I hear."<br><br>The sound 
                  of the bell is inseparable from everything that came before and that 
                  will come after as well as from everything that appears now. This 
                  includes your eardrum, which vibrates in response to it. It includes the
                   air, which pulses with varying waves of pressure in response to it.<br><br>It
                   includes the stick that strikes the bell. It includes the 
                  metallurgists, past and present, and those who learned to extract metal 
                  from ore and those who fashioned the bell. And it includes that ancient 
                  furnace, that supernova obliterated long ago in which this metal formed.<br><br>Remove
                   any of these - indeed, remove anything at all - and there can be no 
                  sound of the bell. The sound of the bell is thus not "the sound of the 
                  bell." It is the entire Universe...<br><br>....<br><br>.....What 
                  Nagarjuna is pointing to is that believing things are impermanent 
                  invovles a contradiction. First we posit separate, persisting things (in
                   effect, absolute objects); and then we refer to them as impermanent 
                  (that is relative). What we fail to see is that we are still holding to a
                   view of substance. We don't really appreciate the thoroughgoing nature 
                  of change, the thorough-going nature of selflessness.<br><br>We don't 
                  really appreciate the thoroughgoing nature of change, the thorough-going
                   nature of selflessness. Nagarjuna makes it abudantly clear that 
                  impermanence (the relative) is total, complete, thoroughgoing, Absolute.
                   It's not that the universe is made up of innumerable objects in flux. 
                  There's Only flux. Nothing is (or can be) riding along in the flux, like
                   a cork in a stream; nothing actually arises or passes away. There's 
                  only stream.<br><br>..... That forms appear to come and go cannot be 
                  denied. But to assume the existence of imaginary persisting entites and 
                  attach them to these apparent comings and goings is delusion....<br><br>....<br><br>"The
                   Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness," a poem by the great Chinese Zen 
                  teacher Tung-shan, speaks of the very same Awareness that the Buddha 
                  pointed to. This image of a jewel mirror was used as a way to express 
                  the source from which all things issue. All the myriad things, thoughts,
                   and feelings we experience appear like images in a mirror: vivid yet 
                  insubstantial. The ungraspable mirror is what's Real, while the 
                  seemingly isolated things that appear in it are not.<br><br>Consider for
                   example, the simple act of smelling a rose. We see the rose, feel the 
                  rose, bring it close, breathe in through our nose. We "smell the rose," 
                  as we say, though this refers more to how we conceptualize our 
                  experience than it does to what is actually experienced. To say we smell
                   a frgrance would be closer to the actual experience.<br><br>But where 
                  does the act of smelling a fragrance takes place? If we attend 
                  carefully, we can see that all of our usual accounts of the experience 
                  start to break down.<br><br>Is the fragrance in the rose? If it was, how
                   could you smell it? you're here while the rose is "out there" 
                  somehwere. On the other hand, if the rose were removed, you surely 
                  wouldn't smell the fragrance. But if you were removed - or if the air in
                   between you and the rose were removed - you also wouldn't smell it.<br><br>So
                   is the fragrance in the rose? Is it in your nose? Is it in the air in 
                  between? Is it in the air if no one is around to smell it? If so, how 
                  could we tell?  Is the fragrance in your brain, then? And if it's in 
                  your brain, then why is the rose ncessary at all?<br><br>Ultimately, the
                   simple act of "smelling a rose" - or any other act involving a subject 
                  and object - becomes impossible to pin down and utterly insubstantial.<br><br>Gradually,
                   however, we can begin to appreciate what the experience of smelling a 
                  rose actually entails. It's of the nature of the mirror itself - that 
                  is, that the source of all experience is Mind. As such, the act of 
                  smelling - or seeing or hearing or touching or thinking - literally has 
                  no location. This non-locality is the very essence of Mind.</div>
