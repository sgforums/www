              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Praise From Previous Runs:</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">More than 10 years ago, I attended a fellowship session led by teacher Shi’an. The discussion happened to be based on a chapter in Shantideva’s ‘Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life’. References were also made to Venerable Thubten Chodron’s book ‘Working with Anger’. It was a short session, but packed with practical tips. In 2013, teacher Shi’an expanded the short session into the 4-session Project Patience course which I signed up for. I confess that when I signed up, I was wondering how he could expand the contents into a full course. That was just my ignorance as there was so much to cover that the 4 sessions were constantly fast-paced, and never with a dull moment. He filled the course with examples that one could relate to for application to daily life. It was certainly not mere theory or textbook teaching.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">A friend was somewhat surprised to see me at the course, remarking that I don’t seem to have anger issues. Though I probably appear patient to some, personally, I feel that this is a course suitable for all of us, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, good-tempered or ill-tempered. Who doesn’t have this feeling of anger, or its more ‘refined’ version of irritation arising in our hearts, even if it’s for only a thought moment, which often lasts longer? And how often do we feel that our anger is justified? The training of patience is a lifelong project (which usually spans many lives). Until we have perfected our patience, we all need to learn, and of course, practise it. <strong>– Joyce</strong></p>

Shi’an! Yes, I really did benefit much from your lessons! Thank you very much! What you shared was truly wise and I do see myself in some scenarios you mentioned.. Really want to improve my relationships with family and friends. *Guilty of having unnecessary quarrels with family :p* Really grateful to you for sharing and am doing my best to be a good student to practise what you taught. Sincerely hope to be a better person with patience, especially not easily angered. *Heartfelt thanks* Will share and encourage family and friends to attend such beneficial courses too. – <strong>Camilly</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Dear teacher Shi’an, I find your class very useful and interesting because you use a lot of everyday examples and meaningful quotes in your lessons. I will try to apply what I have learned in your class in my daily life. Thank you very much for conducting this meaningful course. Jiayou! With warmest regards, <strong>Vicky</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">How I have benefited… Excellent examples of how we can utilise the teachings in real life, which enables me to connect to my situations… The course was delivered and shared in a light-hearted manner which does not stress me out, and I look forward to every session. – <strong>Adeline</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">Thank you once again for the course. I benefited alot and I will learn to be more patient after attending these lessons. Amituofo, <strong>Albert</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">My patience was put to test soon after I attended lesson 2 of your class. Well, I should be glad that the opportunity came for me to put into practice what I have learnt. Honestly, at that moment, I was unable to dissolve my anger immediately. But I was mindful of it and knew that I had to do something about it. I quickly reminded myself of the techniques you shared with us in class. I was pleasantly surprised at how soon I managed to overcome my negative emotions and realised how foolish it was of me to get angry. Thanks, Bro. Shi’an, for starting this course. I truly benefited from it and am sure it will be of benefit to others too… Thank you for your tireless efforts in propagating the Dhamma. Hope to have the opportunity to attend more of your classes. With metta, <strong>Ivy</strong></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Learning Buddhism is to become Buddha, it is not "fight" anger. As all beings are having more and less anger or discomfort seeds with others from karma of past life, you can't expect other to be compassion or kind towards you. When you imagine yourself at the moon looking down onto earth, earth is too small to be of negativity concern in you. When you broaden your heart as big as cosmos, your awesome is inexplicable</p></div>
