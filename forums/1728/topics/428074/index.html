              <p><strong>Exploring Effort</strong></p>
              <p>The
                  custom here at IMS, is to take whatever posture is comfortable for you.
                  As you do that, see if this can become just a continuous part of your
                  practice. We stress continuity in practice; that's what really brings
                  this work alive. And it gives us something to inquire into a little
                  bitâ€•so how does this form become practice for us as well? Can listening
                  also be our practice?<br><br> What I am going to talk about this
                  evening is “right effort.” And, if you can kind of go into this
                  yourselves with me, then we'll be doing this a little bit together.
                  Speaking like this is a form of communication that has rather severe
                  limitations: it's an inefficient form of communication, I think. So, to
                  include your own interest and your own inquiry can liven it up a little
                  bit.<br><br>We're going to begin talking about right effort and wrong
                  effort and maybe get to the point where we ask the question, “Is any
                  effort at all, right effort?” Effort is something that has been talked
                  about for years and years. It's quite prominent; in terms of the
                  Buddha's teachings, it occupies a place, a step, on the Noble Eightfold
                  Path; it's found as one of the Five Spiritual Faculties; and it shows
                  up as one of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.<br><br>It's a burning
                  question that almost all of us have at one time or another. How shall I
                  practice? What effort do I put into this that facilitates my own growth
                  and journey on this path?<br><br>“ORDINARY MIND IS THE WAY” - Mumonkan, Case 18<br><br>Around
                  the year 796 or so, in China, a young man of about eighteen wandered
                  off into the mountains and came to a monastery of a very well known
                  teacher named Nanchuan. This eighteen year-old's name was Chao Chou and
                  he would stay with his teacher for forty years until his teacher died.
                  His teacher was probably in his late forties when Chao Chou entered the
                  monastery. Chao Chou then traveled around China with the attitude of
                  “If I come across someone who is quite well along the path and has
                  questions, I'll do my best to answer them. If I find a child who seems
                  to have something to offer, I'll immediately become his or her ardent
                  student.” And this he did for about twenty years. He finally settled
                  down at the age of eighty and taught for another forty years. He is
                  revered as one of the best-loved teachers in Chinese history.<br><br> This
                  conversation took place shortly after Chao Chou entered the monastery.
                  The living arrangement was such that teachers and students mingled
                  together; they lived together and worked together; and it was quite
                  acceptable to walk up to a teacher at any time and ask him a question.
                  So Chao Chou approached Nanchuan and asked, “What is the Tao?” To which
                  Nonchuan replied, “Ordinary mind is the Tao.” Chao Chou then asked,
                  “Shall I try to direct myself towards it?” Nanchuan replied, “If you
                  try to direct yourself, you betray your practice.” To which Chao Chou
                  said, “Well, if I don't direct myself, how shall I know it?” Nanchuan
                  replied, “The Tao is not subject to knowing or not knowing. Knowing is
                  delusion; not knowing is blankness. When you truly come upon the
                  genuine Tao, you will find it vast  and boundless like outer
                  space. How can this be talked about in terms of affirmation or denial?”
                  And at this, Chao Chou had a profound awakening, and then spent another
                  forty years with his teacher developing and deepening his understanding.<br><br>Chinese
                  Buddhism, as many of you probably know, incorporated much of Taoist
                  terminology. And the word tao came to mean bodhi, enlightenment,
                  wisdom, buddhadharma, the Buddha way. So Chao Chou is asking
                  essentially, “What's the most fundamental truth? What is most real?”
                  And Nanchuan replies in a way that was probably quite unexpected by
                  Chao Chou. He says, “Ordinary mind is the way.”<br><br>Now, “ordinary
                  mind” has several meanings. One is just your usual, common, day-to-day
                  mind. The other meaning of ordinary is, constant or eternal. So it's
                  pointing to something pretty interesting. Something that is ordinary,
                  that's quite common, and yet is fundamentally true, eternal, constant.
                  And then we get to what Chao Chou's real agenda is, which is, “So, how
                  do I get there?”<br><br>I would guess that most of us have a similar
                  question at one time or another. Probably no one in this room...I'll
                  speak for myself...I didn't come to this practice because my life was
                  just great; my relationships were wonderful, I was happy, everything
                  was going swimmingly. I came to this practice, as I think most of you
                  probably have, because something hurt; something felt unsatisfactory.
                  We're deeply troubled in some fundamental way; something about our life
                  presents a question that we can't answer. And it sticks in our craw and
                  it eats at us. It could be something that manifests itself
                  behaviorallyâ€•Why can't I ever have a good relationship with a partner?
                  Why can't I hold a job? Why does it seem like I'm always getting myself
                  into hassles with people? How come I'm so scared all the time?<br><br> So
                  these questions come up for all of us and we don't come to this
                  practice lightly. For most of us, this is not a game. This is, in some
                  ways, a matter of life and death. This is the only life we've got as
                  far as we can tell; whether you believe in reincarnation, in other
                  lives or not, right now this is it. And so, this is the one that we
                  have to make count. And we know that it will end. We don't know where
                  or how or when. It's one of the great mysteries that this could end at
                  any moment.<br><br>So Chao Chou wants to know, “How do I work with
                  this? How do I practice? What sort of effort should I make?” And
                  Nanchuan says, (and imagine for yourselves that if you approached one
                  of us and you've said, “Well how should I practice? What effort should
                  I make?” and we say to you,) “Any effort you make misses the mark.
                  There's no such thing as right effort.” Where do you go from there?
                  Well, Chao Chou went pursuing and pushing his teacher, “Well, if I
                  don't practice it, if I don't direct myself, what am I to do? How am I
                  to find freedom from this condition that is so deeply troubling to me?”
                  And that takes us into the realm of effort.<br><br> In some ways
                  it can be useful to look at what right effort is not, because as we
                  begin to identify that, we can be alert to when we're off the mark and
                  much of this work is about that. It's about seeing where we're off the
                  mark and, in that moment of seeing, we're back on the mark. It's in the
                  seeing that we are re-anchored. And it's in the seeing that there's a
                  potential for real freedom. The Buddha in the Bahiya Sutta, which is a
                  favorite of all three of us [teaching the retreat], gives a very, very
                  brief summation of his Dharma to a man named Bahiya. And he says,
                  “Bahiya, when in the seeing there's only the seen, in the hearing only
                  the heard, in the touching only the touched, in the smelling only the
                  smelled, and so on, then you are neither here nor there nor in between.
                  And if you're neither here nor there nor in between, there is no 'you'
                  and there is no suffering.” That's the kind of intimacy that is
                  possible when we're seeing when we're not clear and present in the
                  moment.<br><br>WRONG EFFORT <br><br>So, wrong effortâ€•wrong effort is
                  fairly easily identified by certain looks on the face. In Zen, they say
                  three things are required: great faith, great doubt and great effort.
                  In most of the pictures and paintings that you see of Japanese Zen
                  teachers and monastics in the Thai Forest tradition, folks are looking
                  pretty grim. There's a series of pictures of Thai Forest masters, and
                  the first impression you get is, they've not had their prunes in a long
                  time; and yet, from what I've heard, they often have a wonderful sense
                  of humor. So, what you see is not necessarily what you get!<br><br> But,
                  in this great effort, this tremendous striving, we can hurt ourselves.
                  It's not only uncomfortable, but we can actually damage ourselves, and
                  if we're working already with some sort of physical injuryâ€•a back a hip
                  or a neck problem, or just the simple aches and pains that come from
                  putting the body in a position and keeping it there for long periods of
                  time, and gravity doing its workâ€•the striving against that can only
                  make it worse. It just adds tension to the body, tension to the mind
                  and, tension added to pain and discomfortâ€•at least in my
                  experienceâ€•doesn't seem to help much. So, the hard muscular
                  effortâ€•that's one pretty clear give-away to when we're off the mark.<br><br> Effort
                  can become just more “selfing”. One of the things that Nanchuan is
                  saying to Chao Chou is, “You're setting up an artificial distinction.
                  You think there's some place to get to and you think that if you just
                  do it right, you'll get there.” Common? Yes? I think if we all took a
                  lie detector test, we'd have a certain blip on that screen. None of us
                  come into this without wanting something out of it; that's what gets us
                  on the path and it can keep us on the path but at some point it becomes
                  a major obstruction. “I want...” and that's just more selfing.<br><br>As
                  we've been teaching, a certain ability to focus the mind and allow body
                  and mind to begin to settle around the breath is really important.
                  Otherwise, sitting, many of us would just run screaming from the hall
                  and be done with it. So, a certain amount of focused practic is
                  important. We can develop great powers of concentration, which helps
                  the mind be stable; we can also develop natural concentration. Those of
                  you who are using sharp objects in the kitchen, without a certain
                  amount of focus and concentration you might unwittingly add a little
                  extra protein to the salad. Not a good ideaâ€•for you or the salad!<br><br> So,
                  this natural concentration is also important. However, concentration
                  and deep samadhi states are not wisdom, and those states don't teach us
                  how to live. These states are quite dependent on certain controlled
                  conditions. You know, we've all experienced what we would call a “good
                  sitting”, a wonderful sitting, calm, clear. And the car goes by or the
                  lawnmower starts up, or somebody walks in the hall and the whole thing
                  comes down like a house of cards. And then we're grumbling about it,
                  “oh, why did this go away? Why do they come late to the sitting?” I'm
                  not singling anyone out hereâ€•but, we ask, “Why did they come late to
                  the sitting?” and we get all revved up about it. Well, where did our
                  calmness go?<br><br> How many of us have had a nice sitting in the
                  morning, go get in the car, and in five minutes we're a raging demon
                  behind the steering wheel? If you live in the Boston area, this is a
                  common experience-I've had it frequently. But, if learning how to live
                  is of high value to us, then we must wonder how or if deep
                  concentration contributes to that. Concentration can begin to help the
                  mind be fit, be toned a bit, to bear up under the rigors of bare
                  attentionâ€•because bare attention is a rigorous practice. And in some
                  ways it is a very austere practice; it's a beautiful practice that has
                  great joy in it and we develop an appreciation of things as they are
                  that is quite lovely, and it's quite austere and quite rigorous. Facing
                  ourselves in this bare way, moment-to-moment, over the course of a
                  seven-day retreat, and being willing to do that at home, in the care,
                  everywhereâ€•that's a steep practice.<br><br>Concentration practice can
                  also create division between the object of concentration and the mind
                  that's concentrating (the concentrator), and it is fertile ground for
                  more judgmental selfing: good concentrator, bad concentrator; good
                  meditator, bad meditator. “Well, if I'm able to get to these deep
                  states of calm, I must be doing it right.”â€•more selfing. The Buddha
                  said at one point that, “Under no circumstances cling to anything as me
                  or mine. If you've heard that, you've heard the whole teaching. If
                  you've practiced that, you've practiced the whole teaching. If you've
                  understood that and actualized it, you've understood and actualized the
                  whole teaching.”<br><br> It's very easy to cling to concentration
                  states as me and mine; just as easy as it is to cling to anything else
                  as me and mine. Because they are often very pleasant, the mind is a
                  little more tenacious, and doesn't want to come to terms with how
                  things are, which is impermanent, fragile, falls apart, and is
                  ultimately unsatisfactory. I'm trying to think of other areas that will
                  let us know if we're sort of tilting toward a less useful direction in
                  terms of effort. If you can think of some yourself, I hope you're
                  keeping them in mind throughout the talk.<br><br>RIGHT EFFORT <br><br> So
                  what is right effort? For me, it gets a little slippery. I prefer to
                  think of right effort in terms of interest and, if you will, in terms
                  of love. If we're really interested in something, is there effort
                  there? Sure, we may have to look at not wanting to get to our writing
                  tablet every day; we may have to meet the resistance to that. We may
                  have a certain form of exercise that we just love, and there will be
                  daysâ€•you know, where “I don't want to do it” and that has to be met.
                  But, for the most part, if we love it and we're interested in it,
                  there's an ease and there's a natural interest. That becomes our
                  “effort”.<br><br> If we're with someone we loveâ€•there are times
                  that it can be difficult, the practice of relationship stirs things up
                  invariably, but, if we're with someone we love or if we're doing
                  something we love, there's often an ease, an effortlessness, a
                  rightness that just simply flows. Now, the “me” will get in the way of
                  that. The “me” is jealous; it's very possessive. It does not want
                  freedom. Fundamentally, it doesn't want easeâ€•real ease. It's powerfully
                  conditioned to maintain its own separate, “unique” status. It's somehow
                  hard-wired for survival. You look at the body, the body's hard-wired
                  for survival. The body will do what it needs to do to survive. It knows
                  what it needs in terms of water, in terms of exercise, food, etc.,
                  whatever it needs to do to protect itself, the body will do that. You
                  would think that the mind, the thinking, the “I” would also get it,
                  since its dependent on the body for its survival. If the body's gone,
                  then, where's the “I”? The “I” will do things that profoundly damage
                  the body. Right? We've all had intimate experience with that. So, the
                  “I”â€•when it works its way into what we love, it creates that kind of
                  separation and things can begin to go off the track.<br><br> So,
                  the effort that this practice requires, in some ways, has great ease to
                  it. As you're listening right now, you have no difficulty
                  distinguishing between the sound of the voice, the sound of somebody
                  moving, the sound of a bird. That takes no effort at all. There's a
                  direct, immediate, intimate, non-separated knowing that's neither easy
                  nor difficult. It just is. If I were to ask you, “What's your
                  name?”â€•right before that, were you conscious of your name? No. I
                  wouldn't think you'd be sitting there thinking, “I'm Bob. I'm Susan.
                  I'm Doug.” There's a stimulus that calls forth that conditioned 
                  response. Prior to that, there was no sense of a Doug, a “me”. There's
                  just listening. Were you aware before I ask you right now, “Are you
                  male or female?” I'm not sitting here saying, “I'm a man!” And you're
                  probably not sitting there thinking, “I'm a woman.” Those distinctions
                  are useful; they're important. But they are not fundamentally true.
                  What's fundamentally true, who we most fundamentally are, is that
                  presence of awareness that knows immediately. How can that be
                  practiced? We can begin to recognize it. And, as we recognize it, 
                  it seems to appear with greater frequency. What's there all the time,
                  we begin to know more and more.<br><br>When Nanchuan commented on Chao
                  Chou's question, “Well, if I don't direct myself, how can I know it?”
                  In addition to saying that you are creating an unnecessary and
                  misleading separation based in delusion, he's also alluding to
                  something vast and boundless that's not subject to the mind's
                  discrimination, the choosing, the for or against. <br><br>How can what
                  is vast and boundless like outer space be talked about at all? I mean,
                  if we're really interested in having some direct knowing of what's most
                  fundamentally true, interested in finding if there really is something
                  beyond thought, deeply interested in knowing who we really are,
                  interested in directly knowing the deathless, the unborn,
                  buddha-natureâ€•as more than just concepts, if we're interested in
                  freedom, then thinking has profound and clear limits; thought cannot go
                  there. Can thought take in vast, boundless space? Can thought know God?
                  Can the conditioned have a relationship with the unconditioned? I
                  personally don't see how that's possible.<br><br> So, we watch
                  Nanchuan walk through this really wonderful teaching, not answering
                  Chao Chou in the way the student expects to be answered, continuously
                  pointing to something that is literally under Chao Chou's feet. What is
                  ordinary mind? Vast and boundlessâ€•how do these two connect? Vast and
                  boundless exclude nothing, it's vast and boundless because it includes
                  everything. Awareness itself dos not discriminate, it just simply
                  knows. It doesn't choose for or against anything. There's an
                  intelligence in that awareness that immediately knows; there's a
                  clarity in that intelligence, which, if it's not clouded by the mind's
                  toxins, results in clear action, what could be called right action.
                  Ordinary mind: vast and boundless.<br><br> Nanchuan's saying,
                  “What you are looking for is right here. Don't look any further.” Don't
                  think you have come to become somebody through great effort. Or that
                  somehow, you're not already complete as you are. It's what each of us,
                  as teachers of the Dharma, is pointing to. You don't need anything.
                  Complete and perfect exactly as we areâ€•and maybe each of us needs a
                  little work. There's a balance there always. But, as Nanchuan points to
                  what's most fundamentalâ€•this is what we need. This moment is complete
                  exactly as it is; it holds everything we need to be free, and if we're
                  not going to be free now, when is it going to happen?<br><br> I
                  had the good fortune to speak with Vimala Thakar, a woman of about
                  eighty-six, this past summer, and she really got my attention in a very
                  fierce but wonderfully loving way. She made it very clear that any
                  effort at all was off the mark, and she made it clear in a way that
                  absolutely stopped me in my tracks. “You've been doing this for 30
                  years, why are you not yet free?” It's a good question, isn't it? What
                  is it that's holding us back? Why is it that we don't trust the
                  completeness, the wholeness of this present moment? Why are we looking
                  always for something else? Because it's a fool's errand; there is
                  nothing else. And yet, the “I” is always looking to confirm itself.
                  And, if it gets that it's work is done in a deep and complete way, that
                  it has no other service to renderâ€•this is a fundamental insult to the
                  thinking mind. But it's a question that each of us can ask ourselves.
                  It's a wonderful inquiry: ”Why am I not free right now?” What is it
                  that gets in the way? How am I not living the understanding that I've
                  already got, that in and of itself is freeing? This inquiry holds us up
                  against an edge of interest that has energy, and the right effort to
                  meet that will be there.<br><br>So we're working with this balance
                  depending on where we are in our journey, and no one, no one can tell
                  us what is most wise or skillful for us in this moment. We can make
                  suggestions; we can all make suggestions to one another. We can point,
                  but it's a wisdom that cannot be learned by way of someone else's
                  authority. It's learned by confronting those fundamental questions, one
                  of which is: “Why am I not free now?”<br><br>At the end of Chao Chou's conversation he had a deep realization. He worked on that for another forty years. Beautiful, huh? <br><br>I'll end with a poem that's attached to this story:<br><br>Spring comes with flowers,<br>Summer with the breeze,<br>Autumn with the moon,<br>Winter with snow.<br>When idle concerns <br>    don't hang in the mind,<br>This is your best season.</p>
