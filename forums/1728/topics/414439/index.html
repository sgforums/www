              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Christians said, believe in God and the Son of God, Jesus Christ and you will be forever saved in the arms of the Lord in Heaven when you died. How simple, how enticing, personal salvation is guaranteed. Of course, it has its commandments and punishment for sins committed as well.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">God send Jesus to earth to save all humans from their sins because he loves them all. To love God, is to love all human beings. The more you love God, the more you would love all humans and try to ‘save’ them by preaching to them to believe in Him. Because one’s salvation is already guaranteed in believing in God, the next natural progression is to love Him with all their hearts, which indirectly extends to all humans as well. It becomes inherent in the Christian faith to go out and carry out proselytizing to ‘save’ all humans. Because of the emphasis on love, the act of giving and charitable activities is also very predominant in the religion. To sum it all, it is a socially proactive religion.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddhist faith too, lays lots of emphasis on the cultivation and perfection (paramita) on love, generosity, and compassion, but ultimately, personal salvation is not a guaranteed, and one have to work on it to achieve it. It follows that the priority for the majority of Buddhist then, is to start off with the cultivation on self liberation first, with such cultivations as the Perfection of Wisdom and various types and ways of meditation taking precedent over other perfections. Frankly, acts of altruism from Buddhist organizations are few and far in between as compared with religion like the Christian faith. For most Buddhists, the religion becomes introspective and personal in nature. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well and good, if salvation is as simple as just believing in a creator. Well and good, if it is so easy to realized emptiness or experiencing impermanence, no-self or coming to a deep understanding of the doctrine of the four Noble Truths or about Buddhist understanding of Ignorance. But we know few will ever reach such state of self realization. Of course, it does not mean that we should stop our personal cultivation. What is needed is that, we should also spare some time for those who needs it.</span></span></p>

              <p>I think the Buddhist way of helping sentient is different. Christians who help and try to transform others because their teaching is such that only believers in Christ and God will be saved, and they believe in one life - so that will motivate them to want to help as many people as possible to go to Heaven.</p>
              <p>To Buddhist the only way to truly repay the kindness of sentient beings would be for one to be a Buddha and teach them to become Buddhas as well. Hence the focus in personal cultivation instead of physically helping them in other ways (besides teaching them the Dharma). In fact, many people who brought forth the Bodhi resolve have the altruistic intention to save all sentient beings, as part of the 4 great vows, the 1st being "Sentient beings are boundless I vow to save them all" shows the very altruistic motive that Buddhists should develop. This altruistic intention is not only limited to humans - also to sentient beings on the other paths of rebirth.</p>
              <p>Buddhists view life as impermanent, and so too will this world one day come to cessation. To Buddhists the gift of Dharma is the highest gift, as sentient beings could save themselves with this instead of keeping on relying on external aid - e.g. food clothing money etc. In order to provide the gift of Dharma, one need to have wisdom, hence the focus in personal cultivation.</p>
              <p>However, Buddhist organizations do try to help beings in other ways besides teaching Dharma and practicing on their own. Say for example Tzu Chi foundation which has branches worldwide helping the destitute. Firefly mission is a local group which also offer aid to those in need.</p>

              <p>Hmm... reading your articles made me think Buddhism and Christianity are very good religions... as well as many other good religions...  But why is the whole world filled with so many good religions and with so many believers, the world is still in such a mess than ever... I mean religion has not been here for a couple of years... they have been here long long long time enough to fill the world with overwhelming love... and the world already went through 2 world wars ....</p>
              <p>why do i look left and right, up and down, here and there, i see and observe... ppl who say they are christians or buddhists, are not that good at all.   And the excuse i hear is the same... say in different way that's all ... is that man is never 100% good.</p>
              <p>and i see again.  i see ppl who left their faiths whether buddhism, christianity or other kinda of spiritual practices...  they are able to pick up good ethical values and dump the wrong teachings... they are more rational and more kinder than i first assume... they have seriously tried to practice their faiths, but eventually find doubts with the belief system and hence left..</p>
              <p>and i look again to those who never been in any faiths before... they despise religion, but at their twilight of death, they adopt religion so fast like drinking a cup of coffee... then i realise why they despise religion.. they despise religion to make themselves feel right...</p>
              <p>and i conclude man is using religion to appease himself, be it in the form of charity or missions, that's all ... perhaps the world will mean to end because of religion, which is the means and ends to everyone.</p>

              <p>Dr. Schambaugh, of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Engineering, Final Exam question for May of 1997. Dr. Schambaugh is known for asking questions such as, "why do airplanes fly?" on his final exams. His one and only final exam question in May 1997 for his Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer II class was: "Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with proof."</p>
              <p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"First, We postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave.</p>
              <p>Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, then you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially.</p>
              <p>Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. Two options exist:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. </li>
              <li>If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>So which is it? If we accept the quote given to me by Theresa Manyan during Freshman year, "that it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep with you" and take into account the fact that I still have NOT succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then Option 2 cannot be true...Thus, hell is exothermic."</p>

              <p>Agree with much of what you said. Except that of course... Buddhism will never remove the 'inward/instropective' ways - without self contemplation, Buddhism can never be Buddhism. Just that we should also include the part of 'benefitting all sentient beings'.</p>
              <p>Also it is false that 'few will ever reach such realizations'. There are in fact many today who do reach such realizations, and in fact it shouldn't take more than 10 years if you have a good teacher to impart you the contemplative practice and right views. Of course relatively speaking the number of unrealized vs realized is still not big, but it is because the number of those who have an earnest interest in contemplative practice is not that much. It is not a case of 'inability' but 'willingness'.</p>

While in Taitung, she accidentally found a Japanese version of the Sutra of Lotus, and was pleased with what the book said. Later, she had a friend bring back a Japanese Sutra of Lotus (Myoho Renge Kyo) from Japan, and was immensely enlightened by the Mu Ryo Gi Kyo, (Sutra of U Liang Yi, or Sutra of Immeasurable Righteousness.) The serenity and clarity of heart derived from the book gave the Master tremendous Buddhist happiness (Fa Shi). According to the Master, the Sutra of Lotus is the culmination of the Buddha's teachings, while the Sutra of Immeasurable Righteousness (U Liang Yi) is the precursor to The Sutra of Lotus. The Sutra of Immesurable Righteousness deals with human problems, whether behavioral, psychiatric, psychological or spiritual.</span></span></p>

This is the teaching as stated in the Theravada tradition. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Basing on the few Bible quotes in your write up, I gather it is basically on the purification of virtues which would eventually leads the believers to God? Maybe, there are quotes on other forms of purifications that may be required as well?</span> </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Religion and its teachings are inherently good. That is why majority of people profess to believe in one. It gets mess up when its teaching is interpreted to suit a particular selfish cause or for some personal objective. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>There are philosophical systems that argue that all humans are born both Pure and Good, while others said that we all born totally Bad. Of course there are still others that said we are born with some Good and some Bad in us. My personal believe is that, Buddhism falls into the category that we are all born with both the Good and Bad in us.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The Buddha did commented, that there is Freewill, but there is Retribution, i.e., within the confine of the cycle of births and deaths. When there is a belief in rebirth, it follows that the seeds of goodness and badness would be carried forward into all our future rebirths, where, when conditions are right, it bears its fruits. There is also another aspect about religions, at least in Buddhism, that we all tend towards the Good, for if it is otherwise, than all beings will not be able to find their salvation and there would be no need for religion. It is not necessary to believe in a religion, you can be a Realist or a Sceptic or what have you and you can still be the most ethical person one can know. Really, it is up to the individual to choose and decide for himself how he wants to lead his life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To believe in a religion, or any religions, would initially requires a large dose of faith, as usually, there are many aspects of its teachings and doctrines that cannot be explained logically or scientifically and have to accepted purely on faith. It is usually with time and practices of what is been taught, that one will eventually come to accept those teachings that cannot be explained logically.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>Of course, for one whose faith is not so strong and do not have the patience, or for one who have a mind that is inclined more towards the validity of logical thinking and or scientific explanation, then maybe for such people, religions would not be their cup of tea. </span></span></p>

              <p>Just my opinion only.</p>
              <p>I think to enter the stream, an insight of no-self is required (plus a few other requirements). It should not just be an experience, it should be an insight. There is a difference here.  The insight will 'turn-around' the way we deal with experiences in the future... which i think is what starts the ball rolling.</p>
              <p>As for noise in meditation, dun have to fight it. For beginner, can try to meditate at a quiet place... but eventually the practice must be able to meet the different conditions of life.</p>

              <p>He said the advancements of science and technology must be in pace with
              society and culture, because they are mutually dependent.<br>According to Chien, in the human body, the essence of physiological
              regulation of body functions is the maintenance of the constancy of the
              internal environment, i.e., the physico- chemical properties of the
              fluids bathing the cells. <br><br>"This concept is called homeostasis.
              In the human race, the essence of our sustainability is the maintenance
              of the constancy of our external environment, i.e., the
              physico-chemical properties of the air, water and land we live in/on,
              which can also be referred to as the maintenance of homeostasis," Chien
              explained. <br><br>"Our biggest challenge today is to maintain the
              homeostasis of our external environment with the same dedication and
              wisdom used to maintain the homeostasis within our body," Chien
