              <p>The answer was stress on the concept of <strong>Not-Self</strong>.

              <p>Yeah,</p>
              <p>Buddha teach us to get rid of attachment, then some people don't know this, they detach from daily life and attached to Buddhism. this is only changing the object of attachment, not actually learning the true meaning of buddhism.</p>
              <p>it's the mindset that counts.</p>

              <p>PM Lee had said it before. previously he rejected it outright due to the evils of gambling. but then he relooked the matter and IR can help create a lot of jobs and tourists arrivals. the casino contribute just a little portion to the IR.</p>
