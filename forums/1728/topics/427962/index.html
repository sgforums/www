              <p>Some people under the unorthodox cult master Lu Sheng Yen claimed in this forum that Dharma and Wisdom eye means being able to have mastery of psychic powers. This is a deluded statement and they do not understand at all that 'Dharma Eye' simply means discerning the nature of dharmas. It has nothing to do with seeing past lives or seeing another universe or anything like that.</p>
              <p>I know many people, including many (orthodox) Masters, claim that Arhats must naturally confer mastery of psychic powers. They are not to be blamed because they have taught it based on commentaries or previous teachings by other teachers... however it is not, as far as I know, being taught by Buddha.</p>
              <p><strong>The statement that Arhats need to have psychic powers is a statement not supported by the Scriptures, and commentaries like Visudhimagga (which if I am not wrong has listed a few kinds of Arhants, one who is a dry insight practitioner and does not gain psychic powers)</strong></p>
              <p>That said, it so happens that almost all enlightened persons I personally know, including those in this forum, have some mastery of psychic powers, even though I do not publicly announce or discuss them here.</p>
              <p>Here is a Sutra that shows how Arhats do not need to have psychic powers.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Translator's note:</strong> This discourse is sometimes cited as proof 
                                                    that a meditator can attain Awakening (final gnosis) without having 
                                                    practiced the jhanas, but a close reading shows that it does not support
                                                     this assertion at all. The new arahants mentioned here do not deny that
                                                     they have attained any of the four "form" jhanas that make up the 
                                                    definition of right concentration. Instead, they simply deny that they 
                                                    have acquired any psychic powers or that they remain in physical contact
                                                     with the higher levels of concentration, "the formless states beyond 
                                                    forms." In this, their definition of "discernment-release" is no 
                                                    different from that given in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.044.than.html">AN 9.44</a> (compare this with the definitions for "bodily witness" and "released in both ways" given in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.043.than.html">AN 9.43</a> and <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.045.than.html">AN 9.45</a>).
                                                     Taken in the context of the Buddha's many other teachings on right 
                                                    concentration, there's every reason to believe that the new arahants 
                                                    mentioned in this discourse had reached at least the first jhana before 
                                                    attaining Awakening.</em></p>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="rajagaha" name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels' sanctuary. Now at that time the 
                                                    Blessed One was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage — a
                                                     recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, &amp; medical requisites for 
                                                    the sick. The community of monks was also worshipped, revered, honored, 
                                                    venerated, given homage — a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, 
                                                    &amp; medical requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects 
                                                    were not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage, nor 
                                                    were they recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medical requisites
                                                     for the sick.</p>
              <p>Now at that time <a id="susima" name="susima">Susima</a> the wanderer
                                                     was living in Rajagaha with a large following of wanderers. And so 
                                                    Susima's following of wanderers said to him, "Come now, friend Susima. 
                                                    Go live the holy life under Gotama the contemplative. When you have 
                                                    completely mastered the Dhamma, tell it to us; when we have completely 
                                                    mastered it, we will teach it to householders and then we, too, will be 
                                                    worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage; we too will 
                                                    become recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, &amp; medical requisites
                                                     for the sick."</p>
              <p>Responding, "As you say, friends," to his own following, Susima the 
                                                    wanderer went to Ven. Ananda and, on arrival, exchanged courteous 
                                                    greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; 
                                                    courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven.
                                                     Ananda, "Friend Ananda, I want to live the holy life in this Dhamma 
                                                    &amp; Discipline."</p>
              <p>Then <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> took Susima the 
                                                    wanderer to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the 
                                                    Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the 
                                                    Blessed One, "Lord, this wanderer, Susima, has said, 'Friend Ananda, I 
                                                    want to live the holy life in this Dhamma &amp; Discipline.'"</p>
              <p>"<a id="ordain" name="ordain">Then</a> in that case, Ananda, give him
                                                     the Going Forth." So Susima the wanderer gained the Going Forth in the 
                                                    presence of the Blessed One, he gained the Acceptance (into the 
                                                    community of monks).</p>
              <p>Now at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in
                                                     the Blessed One's presence: "We discern that 'Birth is ended, the holy 
                                                    life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of 
                                                    this world.'"</p>
              <p>Ven. Susima heard that "A large number of monks, it seems, have 
                                                    declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence: 'We discern that 
                                                    "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is 
                                                    nothing further for the sake of this world."'" Then Ven. Susima went to 
                                                    those monks and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with them. 
                                                    After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one 
                                                    side. As he was sitting there, he said to them, "Is it true, as they 
                                                    say, that you have declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence: 
                                                    'We discern that "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task 
                                                    done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world"'?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, friend."</p>
              <p>"Then, having known thus, having seen thus, do you wield manifold

                                                     was sitting there, he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he 
                                                    had had with those monks.</p>
              <p>[The Blessed One said:] "First, Susima, there is the knowledge of the

              <p>"No, lord."</p>
              <p>"Then, having known thus, having seen thus, Susima, do you dwell 
                                                    touching with your body the peaceful emancipations, the formless states

              <p>"No, lord."</p>
              <p>"So just now, Susima, didn't you make that declaration without having attained any of these Dhammas?"</p>
              <p>Then, throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One's feet, 
                                                    Ven. Susima said to the Blessed One, "A transgression has overcome me, 
                                                    lord, in that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, &amp; so unskilled as 
                                                    to go forth as a thief of the Dhamma in this well-taught Dhamma &amp; 
                                                    Discipline! May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my 
                                                    transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the future."</p>
              <p>"Yes, Susima, a transgression overcame you in that you were so 
                                                    foolish, so muddle-headed, &amp; so unskilled as to go forth as a thief 
                                                    of the Dhamma in this well-taught Dhamma &amp; Discipline. Suppose, 
                                                    Susima, that a robber, an evil-doer, having been caught, were shown to a
                                                     king: 'This, your majesty, is a robber, an evil-doer. Decree what 
                                                    punishment you want for him.' And so the king would say, 'Go and — 
                                                    having bound him with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against 
                                                    his back, having shaved him bald — march him to a harsh-sounding drum 
                                                    from street to street, crossroads to crossroads; evict him out the south
                                                     gate of the city and there, to the south of the city, cut off his 
                                                    head.' Then the king's men, having bound the man with a stout rope with 
                                                    his arms pinned tightly against his back, would march him to a 
                                                    harsh-sounding drum from street to street, crossroads to crossroads, 
                                                    evict him out the south gate of the city and there, to the south of the 
                                                    city, cut off his head. What do you think, Susima? Wouldn't that man, 
                                                    for that reason, experience pain &amp; distress?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"However much the pain &amp; distress that man would experience for 
                                                    that reason, Susima, the Going Forth of a thief of the Dhamma in this 
                                                    well-taught Dhamma &amp; Discipline is still more painful in its result,
                                                     more bitter in its result, in that it leads even to the lower realms. 
                                                    But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in 
                                                    accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For, Susima, it 
                                                    is a cause of growth in the Dhamma &amp; Discipline of the noble ones 
                                                    when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance 
                                                    with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future."</p>
