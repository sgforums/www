No spirits are humans although some may retain some form of human look. Some of them have some good karma and even respected by some people.. those are called 'Gui-Shen' (ghost deities). Spirits has a lot of varieties just as animals have a lot of varieties. It is also possible for human beings to be reborn in any of those realms if one has much evil karma.</div>

If I am not wrong, I think Tibetan Buddhism has similar approach with new age too. I mean visualization techniques. My master almost became a Lama when he was young. He was well trained in Tibetan Buddhism. He once taught one of our dharma brother to visualize a light beam column shining down from the Buddha onto his mother in order to heal her long-standing disease.
