The maras who seen him are happy, and calls him their patriarch. Some even claim that Maitreya Buddha has attained Buddhahood already.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha and Maras had bad ties in previous life due to some reasons which I cannot remember clearly now, the maras vowed to attack Shakyamuni Buddha, and although they could not do that after his Buddhahood, they continue attacking Buddhist disciples.<br><br>Maitreya Bodhisattva, however, was actually very friendly to Maras. They are friends, unlike Shakyamuni and the Maras. Shakyamuni Buddha sits in full lotus anti-mara posture, Maitreya Bodhisattva would put his legs up high when doing Dhyana in what is called the "Mara's Sitting", and maras love this.<br><br>So now you know why there are all kinds of cults about Maitreya nowadays, but in the future, those fake buddhism maras will also turn into real Buddhists <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Maras also have the same Buddha Nature as us.<br><br>In "THE MAITREYAVYANKARNA or "The Prophecy Concerning Maitreya", "Mara, the greatly powerful, will be there, and he also will salute the leader of the world, and praise him."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, my friend Sanath has posted this previously:<br><br><blockquote>A passage states that Mara will also protect Buddhists:<br><br>Chapter Thirteen, "Protecting Stupas," of the Sun-matrix Sutra, fascicle ten, states:<br><br>Then the mara Papiyas, surrounded in front and behind by eighty billion kinsmen, went to the place of the Buddha. On reaching it, he touched his head to the Buddha's feet and paid homage to the World-honored one. Then he stated in verse....<br><br>All Buddhas of the past, present, and future, with great compassion,<br>Accept my homage! I repent all my evil acts.<br>In the two treasures of dharma and sangha, in the same way.<br>I sincerely take refuge without any other thought.<br><br>May I, this day, make offerings to, revere,<br>And venerate the guiding master of all the world.<br>All evils I extinguish forever and will never commit;<br>To the end of my life, I will take refuge in the Tathagata's dharma.<br><br>The mara Papiyas, when he had finished stating this verse, said to the Buddha, 'O World-honored one! The Tathagata, possessing a mind of equality and nondiscrimination with regard to me and all sentient beings, is always filled with joy and with compassion and forbearance.";<br><br>The Buddha said, "So it is."<br><br>Then the mara Papiyas greatly rejoined and awakened the mind of purity. Again, before the Buddha, he touched his head to the Buddha's feet in homage. He then circumambulated the Buddha three times to the right, reverently placed his palms together, and withdrew to one side, where he stood gazing at the Buddha without wearying.<br><br>From the "Great Collection Sutra (Da Ji Jing)", copied from www.shinranworks.com</blockquote></div>

Some of these spirits are vengeful, wanting to take revenge on certain people (humans). Some of them want to take away their lives so that they can join them in the spirit realms (people with suicidal thoughts are more vulnerable to this). etc...<br><br>We do not term all such spirits as 'demons'.. Maras usually mean differently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not easy for spirits to be liberated. Some live thousands of years or perhaps longer. It requires immense merits - usually only a liberated person can liberate these spirits. The rest can attend ullabanadharma pujas, give offerings to the Sangha, and dedicate merits to the spirits in the 7th month. That would help the spirits also especially if they are there to witness the trasnference of merits.</div>
