I only mentioned methods which aid them in overcoming problems in studies. Firstly, they have to remember words are read left to right, not right to left and for signboards, top down. Next, they have to break the word into pronounciable portions which is a difficult trial and error job. Do not presume unless you are certain.</div>

The reading deficit should be sufficiently severe as to interfere with everyday activities requiring reading (e.g., schoolwork or employment). Finally, the reading deficit cannot be strictly due to a sensory disorder; for instance, it cannot be strictly due to vision problems that prevent an individual from seeing words on a page.<br><br></div>

Also when your thoughts come... don't take it seriously, just stop attending to it. I mentioned in the forum 2 days ago how I was so obsessed with the situation in my dream that I felt angry and stressed... like it seem so real. Suddenly it came to my mind it is all an illusion, all I have to do is to stop attending to it, and bring my attention to present moment awareness. True enough, when I stopped attending to it, I just woke up. As for sleepiness, it can be overcome if your mind is alert, and you are mindful.<br><br>Also, ever heard of the phrase 'Xin1 jing4 zi4 ran2 liang2' (when the mind is silent, naturally it is cool). I think this phrase is first said by Guan Shi Yin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.ksw0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.ksw0.html</a><br><br>13. "These are the six dangers inherent in laziness: saying, 'It's too cold,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too hot,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too late,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too early,' one does not work; saying, 'I'm too hungry,' one does not work; saying, 'I'm too full,' one does not work. With an abundance of excuses for not working, new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to waste."<br><br>That is what the Buddha said.<br><br>------<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thag/thag.03.05.than.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thag/thag.03.05.than.html</a><br><br>It's too cold,<br>too hot,<br>too late in the evening Â—<br>people who say this,<br>shirking their work:<br>the moment passes them by.<br><strong>Whoever regards cold &amp; heat<br>as no more than grass,<br>doing his manly duties,<br>won't fall away<br>from ease.</strong><br>With my chest<br>I push through wild grasses Â—<br>spear-grass,<br>ribbon-grass,<br>rushes Â—<br><strong>cultivating<br>a seclusion heart.</strong></div>
