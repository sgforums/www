              <p>Perhaps you should reflect on the hard work you put onto in your studies before relating matters to religious factor. Your attitude towards your studies is important and your focus, if having a mindset dependable on the conflict with Tai Sui, you will always have negative mindset on all the things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It 's like farmer putting hard work on the rice field and when harvest you see result. Confidence is important, you may want to learn how to relex the mind, ie meditation or exercise, it 's alright to have set back, and realise it, and you still can go for the repeat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do respect Toasim, and i do pray Tai Sui also, though i am in buddhism cultivation.</p>

              <p>I agree with maggot and bodhi hut that this has to do with individual effort than supernatural causes. There is an article related as taught by Buddha, <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2a.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2a.htm</a></p>
              <p>We will face failures throughout life, we should not take it too hard, let go of the past yet learn from the mistakes and try harder next time. Learning how to let go of gain and loss is part of practice. All the best...</p>

              <p>hello lowkks ,seems like you are also experiencing a same kind of issue as me</p>
              <p>financial issue and studies.</p>
              <p>In fact , if you remember Master Chin Kung in the Avatamsaka Sutra teaching.He mentioned that adversity is part of life .</p>
              <p>The reason why we have adversity is a lighter effect of the ripening fruits of karma</p>
              <p>You are born with the opportunity to practise Buddhism and have chance to study in Junior College ,then how do you compare yourself to those on the street with no arms and begging ?</p>
              <p>There is alot of intervening cause and conditions which we dun have the insight to know.</p>
              <p>You see , you must have the right condition to study in the Junior College.In secondary school ,you may be very good in studies,but seriously ,thats very light compared to A level which emphasis more on analytical approaches</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just keep on Reciting Sincerely in Amitabha Name .One day you will know the answer in your Chanting .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to share with you ,what 'fixes' i have</p>
              <p>1.Low tuition income for 2 month</p>
              <p>2.Not able to go out to eat at Cafe Cartel with friends</p>
              <p>3.Spent till the last cent on transport and zero savings for the whole 9 months</p>
              <p>4.No money to donate to any Buddhist temple generously</p>
              <p>5.Other source of income is pathetically negative</p>
              <p>I hope you are a happy young Buddhist.Try not to think too much and wallow in self miserly, think about you still have the opportunity to study ,compared to other who dont even able to enter Junior College at all .Due to incomplete limbs, deaf and mute and take a real hard path in life</p>

              <p>To add on to my previous post... I understand that it's quite difficult to appeal (for reasons such as if the school allows people to appeal then they will have to allow the whole other group of people to get promoted... and also it's the school wish that students get the foundational year right) But in any case I hope your appealing will work.</p>
              <p>If it doesn't though, try to take it as an opportunity instead, to make sure you get your foundation strong to prepare for your A levels. To pass and score well in A levels is not a piece of cake either... and that is what is most important... if you retain but do well then your time is not wasted.</p>

              <p>There are many causes and conditions that leads to a result. You have to ask yourself what else has happened that lead to this happening.</p>
              <p>Basic rule for Buddhist: We take refuge in only the Triple Gems - The Buddha,The Dharma and Sangha. Whenever we face a crisis we can always take refuge in the Triple Gems. It is also a good practice to take refuge in the triple gems on a daily basis. Some people prefer to refuge before they chant and meditate.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is also anti-supertistious. Buddhist do not believe burning paper money as such will help the dead - There is only taoism practice. Some people mix taoism as Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The Buddha also taught people to investigate whether does it truly help, is it based on hearsay and do not resort to blindly-believing.</p>
              <p><strong>Kalama Sutra</strong></p>
              <p><em>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the</em> <em>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you</em> <em>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do</em> <br><em>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is</em> <em>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and</em> <em>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is</em> <em>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."</em></p>

              <p>Hi lowkks,</p>
              <p>Whatever we do in life be it studies, work, duties, obligations etc we must put in our sincere and earnest efforts. No short-cuts.Then just sit back and accept the results. Sometimes there can be many unforseen obstacles that are not within our control, so the results may not be what we had hoped for. But if we think out of the box, we may find that certain "undesirable" results may not necessarily be that bad at all some time down the road.</p>
              <p>Things, situations, people, ideas, opportunities, everything is constantly changing. The good times can be turned into bad times, the difficult times can ride itself out one day and become good times again. One opportunity lost can means another new or even better opportunity gained. You are still young, there are many doors opened for you. There will be lots of meaningful things to explore in your life later!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> So the important thing is to always be responsible to yourself, disciplined, hardworking, then no matter what happens, you will have no regrets and be able to takes things in your stride.</p>
              <p>Jia you! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>ps. oh, don't go to mediums anymore. u may unknowingly stray from the dharma path.</p>

It is just not safe. By the way I don't think all Deva are Gui sheng types. There are also many differents level of celetisal beings. Some of them have taken refuge into the Triples and have also reached a certain level of enlightenment.</p>
              <p>I assume that you have consulted a taoist temple and promise something that you fail to deliver ? </p>
              <p>However, i also don't think you should jump into conclusion because of there and alot of bad things have happen. There are many causes and conditions that lead to a result.</p>

              <p><br>hi little brother lowkks ,</p>
              <p>think carefully, GP is a subject that requires a good insight on Current Affairs .If you have been study hard ,why do you feel frustrated ?Last time when I take General Paper ,I spent many hours in the Library just to understand the how to put facts into essays .and its more than 3 ,4 hours in the library.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eating meat is okie wad.if you start eating live seafood then its really bad .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to cut down on spending.dun let  your heart brings you to shop and start buying things you go home and find you have no need for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That boils down to yourself .</p>
              <p>How do you regard Buddhism as ? a religion to save yourself or its just a religion as a spiritual backup and morale recharging ?</p>
              <p>You must understand your action</p>
              <p>As what Buddha said</p>
              <p>Be mindful of our actions and our body ,speech and mind .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly try not to be too superstitious ..You wont end up having answers but more doubts</p>
              <p> We tends to blame on people on our unfortunate circumstances ,but have we seriously thought about what are the factors we never remind ourself to prevent things goes awry ?</p>

              <p><br>Take this opportunity as a learning cureve, as if this set back pull you to the ground, then there are many more awaiting you in the future...For your age, problems meant to be problems are still mild, when you grow older, you will have more problematic stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>today you have a set back, if yo brought forward this set back to tomorrow, then tomorrow you will have more set back. At this point your mind are being occupied by this set back, tactfully, you should change your pessimistic mindset to positive mindset, and if you could change it, it will result into bigger energy transformation, where it brings you greater confidence and strength, if you do not know how to switch over, then you mind will gradually weaken, as taken accord as this is the benchmark % of the set back you can take, imagine if the set back double the %, it will take you long long time to recover....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why not you empty this case and stop relating the result to your cultivation, and start enjoy your holidays, and this is also a good time for your to go for your cultivation retreat, like visiting temples, reading dharma books, watching dharma DVDs..etc..</p>

              <p>Karma plays a part but is only ONE part... there are other factors such as hard work etc. So we cannot attribute anything solely to karma because many other conditionings play a part.</p>
              <p>Karma plays a part because for example, some people are born as child prodigies, some people are quick learners, while some people are just slow to learn even though they are putting effort.</p>
              <p>No matter what, I believe that if we put enough effort anything is possible.</p>

              <p><br>Indeed karma play a big part....there are certain issue and factors which has been establish due to past karmic, which result in hinderance in our present life. It started when we are born, as in our life it also depend when the person realise it, usually people start o relate when they incontact if buddhism teaching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I m young, i have no dharma foundation, which i continue to plant more bad karmic seed, and this continue the process for the seed to be fruitful, once i am in dharma practising, i know that every issue now, is critical moments, has i should not continue to bring more karmic and result in future condition to happen. To turn things around, it is great hard work and determination...hard work will pay off, as we create our own condition for the future.</p>
              <p>To roughly gauge what your past life is, look at our present life, to establish better future life, it greatly rely presently.</p>

On the other hand when people say they don't exists and you follow and says they don't exists ---this is superstitious as well. One blindly believe they exist while the other blindly believe they don't exists. Then what's not superstition? It's when the Ultimate truth is understood and witness by oneself, then it's not superstition. How to go about understanding truth? By Noble Eightfold's Right Meditation.</p>
