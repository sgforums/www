We are caught up in this bizarre habit of assuming that there is an Â“I.Â” [b]Yet the definition of this seemingly permanent thing has to keep constantly changing to keep up the illusion in an impermanent world. This takes up a lot of mental time and is continually frustrating to the mind, as it takes so much constant work and effort.

And then warming<br>again, melting, oozing water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt<br>road sparkles with streams of wet silver. So - what is weather other than this<br>incessant change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings<br>and undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and elation.<br>Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever-changing stream of happenings<br>abiding nowhere. No real entity weather exists anywhere except in thinking<br>and talking about it.<br>Now, is there such an entity as me or I? Or is it<br>just like the weather - an ongoing, ever-changing stream of ideas, images,<br>memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creation and destruction, that<br>thought keeps calling I, me, Toni, and thereby solidifying what is<br>evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I merely think and believe<br>I am?<br>Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair<br>of myself from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of this work?<br>Exploring ourselves attentively, beyond the peace and quiet that we are<br>seeking and maybe finding occasionally? Coming upon an amazing insight into<br>this deep sense of separation that we call me and other people, me and the<br>world, without any need to condemn or overcome?<br>Most human beings take it for granted that I am me,<br>and that me is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense of myself that<br>feels so obviously distinct and separate from other people and from the<br>nature around us. The language in which we talk to ourselves and to each<br>other inevitably implies separate me's and you's all the time. All of us<br>talk I-and-you talk. We think it, write it, read it, and dream it with<br>rarely any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense of me,<br>separate from others. Isolated, insulated me. Not understood by others. How<br>are we to come upon the truth if separateness is taken so much for granted,<br>feels so commonsense?.....<br><br>(please go to the website for the whole article</blockquote>[/quote]</div>

Although I have yet to check them out maybe I should...<br><br>In regards to Buddhist insights, I am currently reading this book, it is free and available for download online:<br><br><blockquote>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha:<br><br><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Adobe%20Version.pdf</a> (pdf version)<br><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Word%20Version.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/Mastering%20Word%20Version.doc</a> (document format)<br><a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebuddha.com</a> (The website)</blockquote>I have posted certain parts I have just read, which I find very important, and hope you can take some time to read it (it's about 13 pages of the book altogether which I pasted): <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224020" rel="nofollow">The Three Characteristics of Existence (Must read!)</a><br><br>The author is very enlightened and I think that book is very suitable to serve as a guide to the understanding of the important teachings of the Buddha. Do enjoy reading <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Here's what I said about that chapter:<br><br><blockquote>One of the very core teachings of the Buddha about the nature of reality can be summarised in three points which are known as the Three Characteristics of Existence. When distinguishing whether a teaching is in accordance to the Buddhadharma (the teachings of the Buddha), whether it is true authentic Buddhist teachings, the 3 Dharma Seals serve as a very useful guideline. All true Buddhist teachings must be in accord with the 3 dharma seals. Why? Because the 3 dharma seals are the nature of reality, and if the teaching is not in accord with the nature of reality, it is falsehood. <strong>But not only that... the 3 Characteristics of Dharma is not only meant to be understood theoretically. The dharma seals must be directly experienced from moment to moment by all sincere practitioners, we must bear witness the Emptiness truth in action - the moment ceases as it arises, and there is no-self apart from this, and any identification of self, any sense of aversion and clinging, based on Ignorance, is Suffering.</strong><br><br>When Buddhism talk about Emptiness, it can also be understood in terms of the Three Characteristic of Existence, because of these Three Characteristics, all things are devoid of inherent, permanent, solid existence. Emptiness is the ultimate nature of all things and is essential for all Buddhists to not only understand it, but intuitively, directly experience this in every moment. This leads to freedom. Fully realising it is Enlightenment.<br><br>I shall share some very well written articles on the Three Dharma Seals, written by a modern Arhat (a person who has attained Enlightenment, Nirvana, and freedom from the samsaric cycles of birth and death), known as Dharma Dan. It is so essential that I think every Buddhist practitioner, insight meditators, but not only Vipassana - even if you do zazen, etc (there's something on that later) should take some time to read it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Enjoy.</blockquote>Eckhart Tolle's book is also great, but his emphasize is more about living in the present moment, not so much about the ultimate nature of reality. Oh and I believe they have it in Finland, in fact there is a Finnish translation of The Power of Now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
