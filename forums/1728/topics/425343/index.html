               grief  and worry, Dharma Master Cheng Yen talks to Tzu Chi volunteers 
              about the  magnitude 8.9 earthquake and tsunamis that devastated Japan 
              on March  11: <br> <br> "We must truly be on guard, and live each day  with a sense of piety 
              and vigilance. The disasters happening now are not  isolated events. 
              Nature is already out of balance." <br> <br> "We mustn't think, 'It happened in Japan. That's a  different country.
               It has little to do with me.' We all live under the same sky  and on 
              the same land. Oceans may separate us, but underneath the oceans, the  
              land is still connected. We may be situated on different tectonic 
              plates, but  each plate impacts the other—how can we really say we are 
              separate? Everything  is interlinked."<br> <br> "People today are well-educated, but despite  their knowledge, people 
              remain ignorant of life's principles. Mother Earth is  already 
              overburdened; each disaster is a wake-up call showing the signs of her  
              distress. All of us must truly awaken, reflect, and make changes in our 
               lifestyles. At this time, we really need to pray for our world. I hope 
              everyone  will do this most sincerely by taking up the vegetarian fast 
              and abstaining  from meat which will help mitigate global warming."</p>

              <h1>What Causes Earthquakes?</h1>
              <p>If you want to know more about the causes of earthquakes, read this article</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><br>When the earth shakes due to the movements of plates below the earth’s crust it is known as Earthquake. Earthquakes are natural disasters, which kill thousands of people in an instant and can destroy cities and countries- human habitation across miles. The vibration during an earthquake has the potential to wreak havoc and destruction, which is beyond imagination. The destruction is the maximum near the epicenter, the place from where the vibrations arise and spread. Of late there have been many such natural disasters, which can be associated with earthquakes like the Tsunami that hit the shores of India, Thailand and razed down buildings and annihilated many lives. It seemed like Mother Nature was avenging herself on us who have used all her endowments to the fullest extent without caring to rejuvenate them. Here we would try to find out the causes of earthquakes so that we can all contribute to the prevention of such things in our own small ways. Individual awareness would definitely lead to mass awareness.<br><br><strong>Causes of earthquakes </strong><br><br>If seen broadly we can say that earthquakes are caused due to two major reasons. The first reason is the eruption of volcanoes, which are sudden, and as is known volcanoes are seat of inner disturbance and can effect the plates which is the second cause of earthquakes. Earthquakes are caused due to disturbance in the movement of plates, which again can be caused due to various reasons like under crust waves or cracks in the plates. <br><br><strong>Plate Tectonic Theory</strong><br><br>The outer layer of the earth is divided into many sections known as plates, which are floating on the molten magma beneath the earth’s crust. Now the movement of these plates is determined by the convection current in the molten magma. The heat makes these plates rise and vice versa. Therefore after intervals there are plates that get submerged in the molten magma and there plates that rise upwards and at times even new crust is formed from the molten magma which in turn forms a new plate until it connects itself with the already existing ones. At times these plates and can be pushed up to form mountains and hills and the movement is so slow that it is really hard to comprehend that there is any movement at all. The movement and the results come out to be visible suddenly. Now these plates are the bases on which the continents stand and when these plates move the continents also move. Most of the earthquakes occur on the edges of the plates where a plate is under one or across. This movement disrupts the balance and position of all plates, which leads to tremors, which are called earthquakes.<br><br><strong>Volcanic Eruptions </strong><br><br>When volcanoes erupt it is because the molten magma under the crust of the earth is under enormous pressure and to release that pressure it looks for an opening and exerts pressure on the earth’s crust and the plate in turn. A place, which is the seat of an active volcano, is often prone to earthquakes as well because the pressure that is exerted by the magma exceeds the limit these plates move and that causes earthquakes. Earthquakes are also caused after a volcanic eruption since the eruption also leads to a disturbance in the position of plates, which either move further or resettle and can result into severe or light tremors.<br><br>The excessive exploitation of earth’s resources for our own benefits like building dams to store large volumes of water and blasting rocks and mountains to build bridges and roads is also the reason behind such natural disruptions.

              <p>Hi i am also quite interested to know how the defilements can lead to the natural disaster and perhaps if you know the name of the sutra which may explain more in details?</p>
              <p>Isn't the earthquake a natural disaster that occur due to some movement of the earth plates. In recent years, the natural disaster seems to be occurring very frequently. When tsuanmi occurs during 2004, scientist said Tsuanmi is a natural phenomenon that happens once in a hundred years but now tsuanmi is happening once in 7 years?</p>
              <p>There was a hypothesis which assumes that the galactic alignment in 2012 and the gravity pull of black hole may cause some major disruption to the sun and earth. Perhaps because we are approaching the galactic alighment that may pay a part  in encouraging the active movement of the plate. Personally i don't know if this is true but it is just a hypothesis so don't take it too seriously.</p>
              <p>Human beings are a part of this earth. We depend on one another and mother earth to survive. Our thought, speech and action also can affect one another.</p>

              <p><em>      As mentioned in previous chapter, the basic abstract elements or smallest matters (maha bhuta) in the cosmos are the following;</em></p>
              <p><em>Basic Abstract Elements &amp; Characteristics :-</em> </p>
              <p>(1) Abstract earth <em>(pathavi)</em> To harden and to soften</p>
              <p>(2) Abstract water <em>(apo)</em> To flow and to paste</p>
              <p>(3) Abstract Air <em>(vayo)</em> To expand and to contract</p>
              <p>(4) Abstract heat <em>(tejo)</em> To heat and to cool</p>
              <p><em> These abstract elements are permanent in existence and infinite in number. They cannot be destroyed. They have been existing since time without beginning and shall continue to exist in the infinite future. Although their number is infinite, yet no new one can be produced or made.</em></p>
