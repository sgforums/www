              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">The Dalai Lama - Is He Fighting a Losing
              Battle with the Chinese?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At
              82, Tenzin Gyatso the 14</span><sup>th</sup><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> Dalai Lama is still an international
              icon, but the future of his office and of the Tibetan people has never been
              more in doubt. He fled Tibet in 1959 at the age of 23. It has since been a long
              59 years. He advocated independence for Tibet from the 1960s to the late 1970s,
              and in 1988 proposed a sort of high-level autonomy in 1988 for the Tibet
              Autonomous Region within China, or extending the area of the autonomy to
              include parts of neighboring Chinese provinces inhabited by Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              the Dalai lama, greater autonomy generally refers to, as" Total
              autonomy" where they want a separate legal system, separate institution,
              separate identity, separate culture, separate language, separate religion from the
              rest of China. It would mean essentially rejecting the current leadership of
              Beijing and the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet's internal and religious
              affairs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              the Dalai Lama, and some Pro-Tibet foreigners, the present autonomy is not real
              because they are not independent from the PRC and it is not governed by ethnic
              Tibetan. To them, ethnic Tibetan people should rule Tibet which is their
              interpretation on the concept of "genuine autonomy". To some Tibetans
              in exile, such as the ‘Free Tibet Movement’ who are advocate of Total
              Independence, they are also strongly opposed to Han migration and settlements
              in Tibet itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              the Chinese, Tibet is already enjoying autonomy. They see the Dalai Lama as
              trying to build an independent nation within China. A Central government that
              have limited power over Tibet. This to the Chinese is seen as going against the
              current existing political system.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Of
              course with such differences in the interpretation of what autonomy means, the
              Chinese have been labelling the Dalai Lama as a "wolf in sheep's
              clothing" who seeks to use violent methods to establish an independent
              Tibet, a splittist engaging in dangerous anti-China separatist activities and
              has refused to negotiate or have anything to do with him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              problem for the Chinese is that, overseas, the Dalai Lama is a celebrated
              figure and among the Tibetans in Tibet and elsewhere in the world, he is very
              much a revered religious figure with tremendous influences. To the Chinese, he
              is a despised troublemaker.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              Occupied Tibet itself, it is easier for the Chinese to control the local
              Tibetan population. Any sign of loyalty to the Dalai Lama can be met with
              arrests, lengthy sentences, torture, violent crackdowns and 're-education'
              programmes. Despite more than 50 years of China's oppressive occupation, many Tibetans
              are still fiercely loyal to him especially of the older generations. It might
              not be so in future as the younger generations slowly but surely have to assimilate
              into the ‘sinicized’ programs set out by the current Chinese regime on their
              religion, culture or the restriction on their language, just in order to
              survive or to find a better life for themselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Externally,
              right from the beginning, the Chinese has always use threats, sanctions,
              rewards or incentives to try to pressure and prevent other governments from
              having anything to do with him. We are beginning to see more effective results
              for the Chinese in isolating the Dalai Lama now. As the Chinese economy grows
              in strength and the country get wealthier, politically and militarily more
              influential worldwide; they are exerting greater influence with many countries
              around the world and persuading them not to have any dealings with the Dalai
              Lama. This is especially so with countries that cannot afford to antagonized
              them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              order to try to isolate and diminished his importance further worldwide, it has
              in recent years gone to the extent of trying to disrupt and prevent his present
              in the international stage. It made use of religious institution such as the
              Dorje Shugden sect to demonstrate and try to disrupt events wherever the Dalai
              Lama is presents. It uses Chinese student bodies in oversea universities in the
              States, in Australia to dissuaded the school authorities from inviting the
              Dalai Lama from giving talks and speeches in their school.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              flow of refugees from Tibet to India, once running into the thousands, has
              slowed to a trickle. Many exiles have returned to Tibet, where urban and rural
              incomes have risen. And life for ordinary Tibetans in Dharamsala remains a struggle.
              As noncitizens in India, they still cannot own property.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              does not help much that the Indian government has now made it easier for the
              Tibetan living in India to obtained Indian citizenship. There are up to 150,000
              Tibetans currently residing there. Slowly but surely, all these Tibetans in
              India and those who have obtained citizens elsewhere around the world will
              within the next two or three generations slowly lose their true identity as
              Tibetan. This is so, as they assimilate and absorb the cultures, traditions and
              lifestyles of the people of their new homes. The assimilation would be even
              faster if there is also a change in their religious beliefs away from Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              seems the Dalai Lama knows that he is fighting a losing battle with the current
              Chinese government, from the issues of autonomy for Tibet to his personal
              reincarnation. The issue of autonomy is a foregone conclusion as the Chinese
              will only accept on their own terms and interpretation what autonomy means to
              them in relation to their national security and interest. It would be a non-negotiable
              issue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Dalai Lama is trying desperately to prevent the Chinese from deciding on the
              issue of his reincarnation by coming out with the options and direction he can
              take before his passing by mentioning on the possibilities and chooses he has,
              such as his reincarnate outside of Tibet, as a women or not at all. But it does
              seem that he is getting nowhere with all these available options. It is a
              forgone conclusion that eventually there will be two Dalai Lama after his death
              unless of course, like the position of the Kamapas, one decides to leave the
              monkhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              seems that even his younger brother thought his high office was past its
              sell-by date. The Dalai Lama has commented that all religious institutions,
              including the Dalai Lama, developed in feudal circumstances. Corrupted by
              hierarchical systems, they began to discriminate between men and women; they
              came to be compromised by such cultural spinoffs as Sharia law and the caste
              system. But, he said, ‘‘time change; they have to change. Therefore, Dalai Lama
              institution, I proudly, voluntarily, ended.’’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              ‘‘world picture,’’ as he saw it, was bleak. People all over the world were
              killing in the name of their religions. Even Buddhists in Burma were tormenting
              Rohingya Muslims. This was why he had turned away from organized religion,
              engaged with quantum physics and started to emphasize the secular values of
              compassion. It was no longer feasible, he said, to construct an ethical
              existence on the basis of traditional religion in multicultural societies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Looks
              like he has given up ever resolving the two very important issue which have
              been so dear to him for most of his life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              then again, there may be some hopes the option of discontinuing the Dalai Lama
              linkage while he is still alive may achieve some favourable result. This is an
              issue he and other leaders of Tibetan Buddhism is expected to take a call on when
              he is 90 years old. It was first mooted in 2011.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Perhaps
              he should bring this option forward to an early date for discussion, and discontinue
              the Dalai Lama linkage. He can then go into complete seclusion where nobody
              will be able to verify his passing away later. It would be interesting to see
              how the Chinese government will handle the whole issue of his reincarnation
              then. As when there is no death, there will be no reincarnation involved.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">  </span></p>
