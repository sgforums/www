              Dear All,
              
              I like to ask if I were to free some fishes that I buy from seafood resturant, where is the best water areas in Singapore that I can release these fishes? Can these fishes survive in sea areas such as East Coast? And how about those fishes like small gold fishes or guppies that can be purchased from pet stall? I like to uphold this practice freeing animals but I like to understand the conditions which they live in before doing that.
              
              Thank you!

              <p>I suppose if you release them in a proper place, it won't cause damage. Problem is many people put them in mistaken places and that cause harm and suffering to the animals and others.</p>

              <p>Hmm... I'm not sure how you question relates to the TS's question. I think whether your conscience is good or not, the least we should do is to make sure they are released in an environment in which they can survive well and not get torturted instead... putting fish in a wrong place is like putting a man in outer space without oxygen... can't survive up there, much suffering.</p>

              <p><br>this of course is a priority, but i mean then if one still worry if they can survive or not after releasing, then rather don't release. the mind don't feel at ease, then no point doing.</p>
              <p>then of course if one is so foolish until release in wrong place, yet feel good or with good intention,  also got its subsequent karma. karma is related to intention.</p>

              <p>Pease For all,</p>
              <p>Most of the fishes that you buy from seafood restuarant are from fish farms . They are not from the the sea - at fish farm they are use to air pumps and other things . Thus they are not suitable to be release back into any sea - most likely they will die a more slow painful death than you eat them in the restaurants.</p>
              <p>same as goldfish - they are form farms - they are use to air pumps and other stuff and cleaner water , release into the wild - they will also die a more slow painful death .</p>
              <p>You think buying them to eat it is your need for food - it is to feed hungry people.</p>
              <p>But you go buy them to release, it is to just to make you feel good ? - they die a more slow horrible dead -  add more sin !!!</p>

              <p>It depends. Make sure you know the fish you're getting. Certain live seafood is obtained from the sea using cyanide fishing abroad, e.g. wrasses. The local waters are very different and they may not survive.</p>
              <p>If you decide to release freshwater fish into the reservoirs, they will compete with the indigenous species for food and kill them off, as the former have no natural predators here and will breed in large numbers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are different advocates of releasing or not releasing animals, each has its merits. On one side all lives are precious and each deserves a chance of life if we can help it. The other,animals kept in captivity may not survive anyway, or if adaptive species, the destruction and competition caused by invasive species,  leading to suffering and extinction of indigenious fauna and flora!</div>

              For ornamental fishes, most are assumed to be bought for display, another category are fishes bred as fodder for ornamental fish such guppies, mosquito fishes and gold fishes, prolific breeders. The feral population of guppies and mosquito fishes are quite successful you see them everywhere, even in sea water! Goldfishes no so much,  but I have seen some condos with water features that keep fishes as mosquito control, perhaps you can convince someone to release them there!
              As for farm bred seawater fishes, it is a little more tricky, as we cannot tell how much survival instinct each fish has. If the wish to release seawater fishes remains, search for food fishes indigenious or  feral species already coexisting with local fauna. Never release them in a pristine environment, fresh water  or sea!
              First a stressed fish does when released is to seek cover to hide and a fish will need to feed after it settles down!
              So cover and food source are essential when releasing animals!

              <p>you can ask and do some search online before freeing animals / fishes. since in your initial post you had not indicated why you have to free animals, i guess if its to make you feel better, well there's many other thigns you can do to make you and otehrs feel better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you are not a full time vegetarian, maybe on the 15th you can join groups to eat vegetraian food for a change? just a suggestion.</p>

              <p>Agree.</p>
              <p>Please note that many local species are already in danger of extinction from foreign species.</p>
              <p>Another is the disease that are in the release species can exterminate an entire local population.</p>
