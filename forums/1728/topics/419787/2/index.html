              <p>to all who provide useful info, you have my thanks</p>
              <p>I guess the problem could really be that he still could not get
                              use to eating veg + not knowing the correct way to supplement his
                              diet</p>
              <p>i will let him know your recommendations</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to all who tried to convert me to be a vegetarian with all your
                              reasons, all i have to say is</p>
              <p>1. humans have been eating meat for thousands of years so
                              whatever your reasons of not eating meat makes no sense ie; if the
                              human teeth is not meant for meat eaters why do we have canines? if
                              the human digestive system is meant for digesting veg, why dont we
                              have two stomachs like herbeviors for more effecient digestion
                              of veg?</p>
              <p>2. it is human nature to eat meat, that is why it is so hard to
                              change to be a vegetarian. if it is human nature to eat veg, then
                              most people would be veg eaters. know that it is the vegetarians
                              who are going againts nature whatever the reasons they may give to
                              convince themselves otherwise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to all who wish to bang my friend's wife</p>
              <p>i am sure she had look for other people to satisfy her since my
                              rejection. whether you believe it or not (that she ask me to
                              satisfy her), i brought all these up to highlight the seriousness
                              of the changes to my friend who turn vegetarian</p>
              <p>i had admitted all along at the beginning of the thread that i
                              am bias againts vegetarian practices so you cant expect me to have
                              anything good to say about this</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">Hi PedoBear, I'll like to raise to you a few points:  First off, there are people who are wean off meat for a variety of reasons, from the point of religiousity, humanitarian, health, evolutionary path, or a combination of any reasons.   This is a Buddhist forum, with an inclination to kindness and tolerance, only because you personally feel uncomfortable with this issues, that this is thread is raised by you. Obviously there is some internal rationalisation within, or else issue would not be raised. </span></p>
              <div>Religion can be rather encompassing or compartmentatlised, depending on one's disposition and experience. If you desire very much  so to follow a teacher who strongly advocate vegetarian, then you should adhere to vegetarianism . If you can, you already one less craving to contend with, not a bad thing.</div>
              <div>Humanitarian, we learn to empathise with the animals who need to suffer the process of dying to feed our needs. In our modern eating habits with it animal to food processing chain, it is so easy to do and ignore. There was an incident of asking  children where there food they love so much comes from, eg. the chickenwings and hotdogs , the sad answer was, the supermarket. If one is ignorant,out of sight out of mind, it is so easy to sweep under the carpet.</div>
              <div>For health reasons, there  low density lipids, injected  animal hormones , raised blood acidity and chronic diseases such as  arthritis and gout deriving from all these causes. Incidentally,  purines from vegetable sources are shown not cause gout, in some studies. There are talks of how to balance one's diet, fats, protein and carbohydrate ratios, however, in naturally non meat food source, it does'nt pose much of a problem. Only when one put meat into equation, does this balance gets complicated. The less meat the less problem, simple. On nutrition, the problem of B12, is that it is not synthesized by plants or animals, but by bacteria. In a wholly vegetarian diet, it can be obtained by the bacteria in the feces of manure used. I am not sure if the B12 survives the intestinal process, but hopefully, there should studies which indicate so.It is certain the our intestinal has bacteria flora that produces something for us beneficial. Even bacteria which are not healthy to us occurs in us naturally, only when the balance is out that we succumb to them. Also, vitamin C, we are unfortunately one of the few species on earth that does'nt produce vit. C. That means that we eat from non meat source, sure vit. C can be found in animal organs, but much do we need to eat to fulfill our daily needs. Vitamin C is water soluble, will be flushed out of our system around 6 to 8 hrs, unlike B12 although water soluble is stored in the liver. That means we can survive long periods without meat but not vegetables and fruits.</div>
              <div>Last, evolutionary, there are the carnivores, omnivores, herbivores and fructivores. Why this distinction, because of the  evolutionary adaptation of our dental and intestinal systems.</div>
              <div>As humans, we do not eat raw meat all the time, except the inuits, eskimos, or those near the tundra regions where edible human plant source is scarce. We cook meat most of the time, showing meat adapted to us, instead of us being adapted to eating meat. Also, our incisors and canines are puny in comparison to other carnivores and indeed, to our own molars. Although I cannot be as so cruel as to ask you to sink your teeth to a live animal to demonstrate it's efficiency, even the though of it horrifies me! Why is the vampires so scary? Because it is so unhuman !!! Also, do you notice you masticate ever bite you take, ever see a carnivore do that ?!! If you are in the company of juvenile bears all the time, surely you'd have notice that!!! </div>
              <div>We now go to the digestive tract. We do not have four stomachs, because we are not leaf or grain eaters in there raw form. Generally we cook or ferment them first, to them. But  break them down first, we must . We cook our grains and make our beer ad spirits. However, we can eat our vegetables and fruits raw. Especially, when  are having a meat diet, that we require the raw vegetable and fruit enyzmes  and acids to aid us in digestion. Also our digestive tract is long compare to carnivores. And also need a lot of plant fibre to cleanse our intestinal tract on a regular basis.</div>

              <p>As answer to the second, no, I do not wish to bang your friends wife, period. </p>
              <p>Your friend has loss of libido, meaning low testosterone levels, which may does to a variety of reasons, general aging plummeting levels of HGH  , conversion to dihydrotestosterone .</p>
              <p>This may be due stress owing to a variety of reasons, perhaps a chronic worry about the possible lost of the daughter.</p>
              <p>True, a wholly vegetarian may bring down  nitric oxide levels due to lower protein intake, but has more to do with balance.</p>
              <p>Also, maybe, do you think maybe your friend does not want to do his wife anymore. Remember, sex drives of male and females peak at different age. We generally mellow down as we grow older. Emphasis of a relationship change over time too.   But if your friend really want to get intimate, all he has to do is go to a clinic, and raise his thumb. We are in the age of instant erections, my friend,  so it cannot be directly attributted to vegetarian diet.</p>

              <p>when you have to use the phrase wean off meat, you have already proven my point that humans are meant to eat meat.</p>
              <p>the reason I post this thread is to share my experience of someone turning into a pussy without eating meat and try to seek assistance to help him.</p>
              <p>now, from the start, i have already stated very clearly that I am bias againts vegetarian practices but people still try to push their vegetarian beliefs to me instead of providing relevent info to help my friend.</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe that all vegetarians are pussies and normally I could not care less that they choose to be pussies but in this particular instance, this pussy practice is seriously affecting my friend negatively.</p>
              <p>now I am grateful to those who manage to answer within topic, to try to get my friend some help but i have already said i am an anti-vegetarian so there is no need to advertise the "benefits of being a vegetarian" to me. I am sure there are already plenty of threads debating this.</p>
              <p>as an anti-vegetarian, i can also describe plenty of scientific experiments proving that soy protein causes cancer, certain vegetables cause cancer but that is not the point of this thread.</p>

              <p>For people who wean off meat, here I am referring to the more advanced affluent society, like ours. However, this is not representative of the world total population.</p>
              <p>You are your own man, so am I. Just as you are a proponent for eating  meat, am I not allowed to put my views across. I am not off meat, but that does'nt mean I try to validate my right to eat meat. I eat meat simply because it is more available to me and also occassions where I strongly crave meat.</p>
              <p>Until you can do the feats of the Shaolin monks, you are not entitled to call vegetarians "pussy", unless, you wish to call a lion "pussy".</p>
              <p>Because you  choose to incriminate you friend's troubles on vegetarianism, you are not being objective. Yes, you are non vegetarian, but I can present vegetarian point of view in a more objective manner, why does it offend you? At no time did I impose myself to make you eat your veggies.</p>
              <p>Also unless you are able to tabulate a chart of carcinogenic factors and attribution, it is rather unhelpful.  Soy contain isoflavones, may possibly be cancer causing, but soy beans supply protein in many parts of Asia, while at the same do not attribute diseases that have become more common in more affluent society, replacing soy protein with meat protein. Rates of diseases more common with the western pro meat consumption is not so in countries with a soy protein based diet. Also soy protein are may lower breast cancer.   Also, concerns of reproductive ability on males, the proof is in the pies, look at population which have been taken soy products for thousands of years, I think there is no problem.</p>

              <p>If you guys notice carefully, you will notice that Zen Masters are very different from ordinary people. Most of them are cool and calm. How I wish I'm like them. I think I'm better than last time after regular meditation though sometimes when people are getting too much, I will still lose my temper but compare with last time, I'm a better and  happier person. Meditations help.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that we need to be firm if there is a need. æƒ å¾‹fashi once said if anyone bully you just because people commented that vegetarian shouldn't lose temper, you should reply :“å�ƒæ–‹çš„å¥½æ¬ºè´Ÿå•Šï¼Ÿ”. As you know, æƒ å¾‹fashi likes to joke but what he said makes sense.</p>

              <p>Your friend needs to do some research on what to eat and what not to eat. Even if you are not a vegetarian, one also tends to eat a lot of junk and snowball alot of unhealthy crap into the system. Most of the meats of today, like the hen...I also don't know what kind of chemical that they inject the chicken which make them grow abnormally fat than they should be. When we eat the chicken, we are also consuming the chemical you know... If i'm not wrong there are research that indicate that these chemcial can also lead to cancer...</p>
              <p>Do you think it is easy to be a vegetarian? Why don't try become a vegetarian for a month. You will find that It is not easy at all. Some wants to become vegetarian because they are compassionate to the animals .. etc etc. </p>
              <p>Anyway, if people want to be vegetarian or not.. is really their own thing...</p>

              <p>Can you please read my post carefully. I said you had<span style="color: #ff0000;"> misunderstood</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> to be baptised need to be blood thirsty. <span style="color: #000000;">The meaning of this sentence is " there is no need to be blood thirsty in order to baptise". I'm respecting baptism but you are not because you misled others that inorder to baptise, one needs to eat meat. Understand ? <br></span></span></p>
