              <p>Not sure if this is the correct forum to post in as it is not really a religion issue</p>
              <p>if mods determine that this thread fit better into another forum, please feel free to move it.</p>
              <p>first of all, let me clarify</p>
              <p>1. i am not anti-buddhist, i would like to apologize beforehand to anyone who find my style of writing offending to buddhists</p>
              <p>2. i am just anti-vegetarian, as to why, it is a story for another thread another time</p>
              <p>True Story</p>
              <p>I have a very good friend, one of my best friend if you will who turn into a pussy after becoming a vegetarian. 2 years ago, his baby daughter became very sick and he was told that she would not survive for long. As he and his family is buddhist/taoist, (i am not sure of the distinction between the two) he made a promise to buddha/kwan yin/ kwan kong/ the fat smiling god in between kwan yin and kwan kong/the begger god(ji kong, i think) and a bunch of other deities that he would become a vegetarian if his daughter survives. For some reason she did so he became a vegetarian.</p>
              <p>now, i have known him since we were still in secondary school and after graduation, we join the same company and worked in the same department. you can say that i know him inside out. He was a very active person who would stand up for people he care about and for his beliefs.</p>
              <p>Some months later after becoming a vegetarian, his character completely change. He became very tired looking, always coming to work late, complaining of fatigue. He even start to let things slide when people challange his core beliefs.</p>
              <p>his wife has also commented on his changes, saying that he did not stand up for her when some guys tried to flirt with her in front of him, saying that he does not need to act like a monk just because he eats like a monk (at first i did not think much into this but recently, she confided in me that shes not getting enough sex and she ask me for some but i refuse saying shes my friend's wife but actually i just find her not that hot).</p>
              <p>being a vegetarian has turn my friend into a pussy who cannot sexually satisfy his wife, becoming a weak and tired slacker who let things slide. it has seriously affected his career and family in a negative way.</p>
              <p>any similar stories to share?</p>
              <p>anyway to help my friend on this?</p>

              <p>It has to do with your friend's diet. He doesn't know what is a good vegetarian diet. This requires some pointers from good vegetarian cookbooks. A good vegetarian diet contains all the necessary nutrients from one with meat... and makes it even healthier (as overeating meat can also cause illness, disease, overweight, etc)</p>

              <p>I understand a vegetarian must eat about 5 different colours of food a day to have enough nutrients. Example Black (black beans, dried mushrooms etc) , Green leaf vegetarian, Red (tomatoes etc), White (beancurd etc) etc etc.........................</p>

              <p>Yes. Actually many vegetarian stalls out there sell very unhealthy things... very oily, and unhealthy like mock meat etc.</p>
              <p>True vegetarian meals... I guess you have to learn how to make yourself.</p>
              <p>p.s. I'm not a vegetarian myself, only heard this from others.</p>

              <p>If your fren is feeling tired on becoming a vegetarian, need to make sure he has sufficient iron, protein, magnesium, vit b12</p>
              <p>It is not sufficient to rely on outside food diet. he has to take some supplements too.  Take some nuts everyday eg pistachio, cashew, tc.</p>
              <p>Supplements can include the brand of many herbs and kinds of natural vegetables grounded to powder and sold by Mitchell May, called Synergy brand is also  good... can check out Lapis Lazuli organisation, they sell such supplements.</p>
              <p>For vitamin b12 can take some nutritional yeast.</p>
              <p>Can take other supplements like Spirulina, etc.  They will all help. </p>
              <p>if your friend is very tired only just after eating for short time, he must do something about his diet, taking in sufficient nutrients, or else it will affect his health.  Outside vegetarian food generally do not supply enough nutrients, unless he is eating at those organic health stores which are much more expensive and not many such stores in singapore.  He needs to back up with supplements, chinese herbal soups, eat diverse types of vegetables, avoid MSG and processed food and so forth. </p>
              <p>Better bring his attention to this soon. It is not a small matter.</p>

              <p>If your fren is feeling tired on becoming a vegetarian,
              need to make sure he has sufficient iron, protein, magnesium, vit
              b12</p>
              <p>It is not sufficient to rely on outside food diet. he has to
              take some supplements too.  Take some nuts everyday eg
              pistachio, cashew, tc.</p>
              <p>Supplements can include the brand of many herbs and kinds of
              natural vegetables grounded to powder and sold by Mitchell May,
              called Synergy brand is also  good... can check out Lapis
              Lazuli organisation, they sell such supplements.</p>
              <p>For vitamin b12 can take some nutritional yeast.</p>
              <p>Can take other supplements like Spirulina, etc.  They will
              all help. </p>
              <p>if your friend is very tired only just after eating for short
              time, he must do something about his diet, taking in sufficient
              nutrients, or else it will affect his health.  Outside
              vegetarian food generally do not supply enough nutrients, unless he
              is eating at those organic health stores which are much more
              expensive and not many such stores in singapore.  He needs to
              back up with supplements, chinese herbal soups, eat diverse types
              of vegetables, avoid MSG and processed food and so
              forth. </p>
              <p>Better bring his attention to this soon. It is not a small
              matter.</p>

              <p>in the animal kingdom, elephant strength is the strongest. horse stamina of running is the longest. they also eat "vege". surprisingly there are examples of Olympic GOLD weight lifter, swimmer and runner (Carl Lewis) are vegetarian. so meat give strength is not so true.</p>

I don't drink milk because of the way industrial farming get milk.I felt guilty eating so much meat so I am trying to slowly reduce and maybe give it up .... its hard to switch overnight </p>

              <p>From past personal experience, I would guess that your friend is probably too tired now to concentrate on complex nutritional concepts and cooking procedures.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Protein foods</strong></span></p>
              <p>This is what most new vegetarians fail to factor in when they change dietary habits.</p>
              <p>Nuts, beans, seeds, tofu, mushrooms, tempeh.   Ask your friend to make a habit of snacking on a variety of nuts (the less they are roasted/salted the better).  No harm also in eating mock meats as they give protein, but my personal preference is for the natural stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Dark green leafy vegetables</span></strong></p>
              <p>Living in the tropics, these are readily available and are an important source of minerals.  Eat a wide variety and rotate everyday.  All vegetarian stalls will at least have these.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Cost effective whole food supplements</span></strong></p>
              <p>Blackstrap molasses (can be mixed with milk/soymilk), Goji berries (æž¸æ�žå­�, snack on them like snacking on raisins), Nutritional yeast if your friend consumes totally no milk/eggs, Chlorella/Spirulina, Seaweed</p>
              <p>Besides these, what Dawnfirstlight said about eating veggies and fruits of different colour groups is also a good way of ensuring a wide variety of nutrients.  Generally speaking, those with more intense/bright colours are more nutritious.</p>
              <p>Also, <strong>chew food thoroughly</strong>.  When eating animal foods, chewing is less important, but vegetables and fruits are fibrous and chewing well to extract nutrients ensures you get the most out of your food.</p>

              It is not sissy, in fact it is quite the opposite. It takes effort not to follow one's cravings whatever they are. Only weak people cave in to their cravings all the time, wanting to eat, wanting to buy stuff or whatever.
              
              But if he is just tired, not because of anything thing in his lifestyle but really because of his diet, you can suggest to him to do the following:
              
              1) Eat wholegrains for breakfast. Not wholegrain bread. In NTUC they have a kind of multi-grain cereal which can be cooked and eaten, that is very good. Things like barley, green bean, red bean, black bean also must eat.
              
              2) When eating out, try to chose brown rice + 3 veg most of the time. Avoid mock meat as they have hardly any nutrients and are full of rubbish. Avoid set meal like lor mee, laksa, nasi lemak etc. because they hardly got any veg in it, just mock meat and oil.
              
              3) Snack on nuts (walnut, cashew, macademia, etc) and seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, flax etc), blackstrap molasses, seaweed, goji berry, as mentioned above. Also add in dates - red or black etc. Indian curry also have quite a handful of nutrients as spices and chickpeas, dhal etc are pretty nutritious - cook at home for less oil.
              
              4) Get a vitamin B12 supplement.
              
              The key is variety. Let him see this list from the vegetarian society. And add in the items from the groups he is missing out.
              http://www.vegetarian-society.org/downloads/VitaminMin_a.jpg
              http://www.vegetarian-society.org/downloads/VitaminMin_b.jpg
              
              If you want to know how vegetarians who know how to eat thrive, you can google some of these names:
              Mac Danzog (ufc MMA fighter)
              Brendan Brazier (Endurance athelete)
              Bryan Danielson (WWE wrestler)
              Mike Mahler (Strength coach and kettleball instructor)
              These people don't eat meat, they don't eat eggs, they dun drink milk, they basically dun eat anything with animal products.

              <p>You are too naive to relate your friend's diet to his wife's infidelity. If the woman is a flirt, she will find all kind of excuses to be unfaithful like husband did not spend enough time with her or husband is not romantic enough etc. etc.</p>
              <p>Well, hopefully the day will not come that doctors advise you to eat more veggies for the sake of your health. I think the day will come when you reach middle or old age as I've seen doctors always adivse those middle or old age people to eat more veggies and less meat due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arteries got choked and so on.</p>

              <p>to all who provide useful info, you have my thanks</p>
              <p>I guess the problem could really be that he still could not get use to eating veg + not knowing the correct way to supplement his diet</p>
              <p>i will let him know your recommendations</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to all who tried to convert me to be a vegetarian with all your reasons, all i have to say is</p>
              <p>1. humans have been eating meat for thousands of years so whatever your reasons of not eating meat makes no sense ie; if the human teeth is not meant for meat eaters why do we have canines? if the human digestive system is meant for digesting veg, why dont we have two stomachs like herbeviors for more effecient digestion of veg?</p>
              <p>2. it is human nature to eat meat, that is why it is so hard to change to be a vegetarian. if it is human nature to eat veg, then most people would be veg eaters. know that it is the vegetarians who are going againts nature whatever the reasons they may give to convince themselves otherwise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to all who wish to bang my friend's wife</p>
              <p>i am sure she had look for other people to satisfy her since my rejection. whether you believe it or not (that she ask me to satisfy her), i brought all these up to highlight the seriousness of the changes to my friend who turn vegetarian</p>
              <p>i had admitted all along at the beginning of the thread that i am bias againts vegetarian practices so you cant expect me to have anything good to say about this</p>

              <p>You are too naive to relate your friend's diet to his wife's infidelity. If the woman is a flirt, she will find all kind of excuses to be unfaithful like husband did not spend enough time with her or husband is not romantic enough etc. etc.</p>
              <p>Well, hopefully the day will not come that doctors advise you to eat more veggies for the sake of your health. I think the day will come when you reach middle or old age as I've seen doctors always adivse those middle or old age people to eat more veggies and less meat due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arteries got choked and so on.</p>
