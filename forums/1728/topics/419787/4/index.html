              You started this thread with prejudices and without humility, now it is your cross to BEAR(pun intended).
                      Although I respect your right to your beliefs, you must also accept we are entitled ours as well, this way, there are no double standards. 
                      We do not worship the Buddha the way Christians do, we study and practice the Dhamma whenever we can. Also, assumption of belief is no assumption of fact. Something to share with you,http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/marshall_gauvin/did_jesus_really_live.html, as a practising Buddhist, I do not everything for granted, we investigate.

              Another thing, I don't know whether the friend you mentioned actually exists. Would that person still call you a friend after you aired intimate details of he and his wife, implying the wife is of an adulterous mind and your friend incompetent of his conjugal duties. 
                  Anyway, you are either contemptuous of your friend and his wife or you are fibbing. Or your definition of friendship is different perhaps lower standard to us, Buddhists. And blatantly flaunt yourself as a Christian.

                      You started with proclamation with that you are anti vegetarian in a Buddhism forum where many are vegetarian. You aired your friend's intimate details in public, then you proceed to call vegetarians pussies. And then you called yourself a christian, in addition to your reference to karma , all in reply in a Buddhist forum. Why did you post what you did in a Buddhist forum. All this begs questioning.

              Topic "Why a man turns into a pussy on becoming a vegetarian?"
               Most Mahayanist  teachers and some teachers of other traditions are vegetarians. What you did think will happen when you call one's teacher a pussy?
              There are also many Hindus who are laymen that fathered their own children.
              You attributed lack of libido and drive to vegetarianism without considering other factors.  
              Like I said, you came with prejudices and without humility.

                   Too late is'nt it, with cause there is effect, the thread just snowballed.
                  Respectful title can be  "Is vegetarianism depressing  my friend drive"
                  Also, you have not acknowledged or even entertained other probable causes.

              <p>In the 1st place, you should not link your friend's wife infidelity to his vegetarian diet. Secondly, what are you trying to imply when you posted at Buddhist forum calling vegetarian pussies, knowing too well that many Buddhists are vegetarian.</p>
              <p>Your motive is very clear.</p>

              <p>you are getting paranoid.</p>
              <p>like i said in my first post, i am anti-vegetarian not anti-buddhist (since alot of buddhist believe that buddha is actually Jesus)</p>
              <p>you say - <strong>many Buddhists are vegetarian</strong> but i dont believe that it is true as only 2 or 3 of my hundreds of buddhist friends are vegetarians.</p>
              <p>i would agree that most buddhist refrain from eating meat on the 1/15 of the lunar calender but this does not make them a vegetarian</p>
              <p>i would also agree that most vegetarians are buddhist</p>
