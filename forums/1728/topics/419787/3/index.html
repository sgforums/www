              <p><br>so why are we having this argument now?</p>
              <p>arguing with me that my opinion of vegetarians are pussies is something that is necessary?</p>
              <p>as i said before, this thread is started to try and get some help for my pussified vegetarian friend.</p>
              <p>Again, to those who had contributed useful info on getting some help for my friend, you have my thanks and gratitude</p>
              <p>Update: just found out that his promise to become a vegetarian is just for 1 year only. hopefully, by this time next year he would not be such a pussy anymore after his diet normalised with eating of meat.</p>

                                      explanations on your story. Perhaps that friend lost interest in
                                      his wife ? Many marriages after some time will lose interest in
                                      each other therefore no sex or imitate contact. Or perhaps the
                                      ordeal that his daughter nearly died changed him. Or perhaps it was
                                      stress. Or perhaps he has some misconceptions about buddism.</p>
              <p>So many reasons and yet i am shocked that you linked up
                                      vegetarian to it. Take him to see a counsellor or ask him to wake

              <p>According to my swallow knowledge, the theoretical aspect of unity or realization on the name for I-Kuan Tao, its seemed to be the same as Buddhism way of life on enlightenment (one is all and all is one). But pragmatically, it is different. As the advice goes å�„æ•™æ•™åŒ–å› æžœï¼Œå�„æ•™è´Ÿè´£ã€‚Buddhism applied on its realization from any Buddhism sects to understand the enlightenment nature of Taoism and Confucianism based on their literature, so that Buddhist would not fall into contempt. In dharma ending era, most living beings are shallowed in its wisdom and mind wandering, and understanding confucianism and Taoism may or may not be good for some depending on its grade of mind.  It don't actually lump it together, otherwise, the future would be devastating for Buddhism. Its destiny of dharma still has 9000 years to go based on sentient beings' perspective living in JambudvÄ«pa, according to Buddha Sakyamuni. So, be diligent and may you all attain enlightenment and be the master of the master for supreme emptiness<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">. And may all supreme vows fulfilled then shall I closed the defilement door in the Land of ulitmate bliss for an everlasting bliss, harmony and peace.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Namo Buddha Amitabha</p>

              village inhabited by fishermen, and in it was a big pond. It happened 
              that because of a great drought, the pond ran dry and all the fish were 
              caught and eaten by the villagers. The last fish taken was a big one and
               before it was killed, a boy who never ate fish, played with it and 
              thrice knocked its head. Later, after Sakyamuni Buddha's appearance in 
              this world, King Prasenajit</span><a href="http://www.hsuyun.com/en/hsuyun/#3"></a><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 85%;"> who believed in the Buddha-dharma, married a Sakya girl who then gave 
              birth to a prince called Crsytal. When he was young, Crystal had his 
              schooling in Kapila which was then inhabited by the Sakya clansmen. One 
              day while playing, the boy ascended to the Buddha's seat and was 
              reprimanded by others who dragged him down. The boy cherished a grudge 
              against the men and when he became king, he led his soldiers to attack 
              Kapila, killing all its inhabitants. At the same time, the Buddha 
              suffered from a headache which lasted three days. When His disciples 
              asked Him to rescue the poor inhabitants, the Buddha replied that a 
              fixed Karma could not be changed. By means of his miraculous powers, 
              Maudgalyayana</span><a href="http://www.hsuyun.com/en/hsuyun/#4"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 85%;"> </span></a><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 85%;">rescued five hundred Sakya clansmen and thought he could give them 
              refuge in his own bowl which was raised up in the air. When the bowl was
               brought down, all the men had been turned into blood. When asked by His
               chief disciples, the Buddha related the story (kung an) of the 
              villagers who in days gone by had killed all the fish (in their pond); 
              King Crystal had been the big fish and his soldiers the other fish in 
              the pond; the inhabitants of Kapila who were now killed had been those 
              who ate the fish; and the Buddha Himself had been the boy who thrice 
              knocked the head of the big fish. (Karma was) now causing Him to suffer 
              from a headache for three days in retribution for his previous act. 
              Since there colud be no escape from the effects of a fixed Karma, the 
              five hundred Sakya clansmen, although rescued by Maudgalyayana, shared 
              the same fate. Later, King Crystal was reborn in a hell. (As cause 
              produces effect which in turn becomes a new cause) the retribution 
              (theory) is inexhaustible. The law of causality is really very dreadful.</span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
