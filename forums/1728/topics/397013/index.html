              <p>Came across these essays by Jet Li about his humanitarian foundation, ONE foundation, thought to share... fyi, Jet Li is also a devoted Buddhist apart from being a famous movie star.</p>
              <p>For more information, <a href="http://jetli.com">http://jetli.com</a></p>
              <blockquote><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></strong>
              <p><span class="intro"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">My family and I have returned to safety.</span></strong></span> I know that friends and fans all over the world were greatly worried when they heard that my family and I were trapped in the Maldives when the tsunami hit. I want to take this opportunity to thank everybody who expressed concern for our safety and well-being. I am humbled by the outpouring of love.</p>
              <p>I am deeply indebted to the staff at The Four Seasons Hotel in the Maldives. Throughout the initial chaos and the entire disaster, they demonstrated selfless bravery and compassion, the finest human qualities, in assisting us and the other hotel guests, even though their own family members were likely endangered by the rising waters as well. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart.</p>
              <p>As a Buddhist, I hold a certain understanding of the impermanence of life-that everything has a beginning and end. However, living through this natural disaster has heightened my consciousness of suffering and joy, and of the fortune and misfortune around me. It shook me awake and helped me realize that I have an obligation to life. As I reflect on the tremendous suffering that continues in South Asia, the first thing that I can-and must-do as a single human being is to treasure every single day as a precious gift, and to give thanks for the people in my life-as well as life itself.</p>
              <p>More importantly, having experienced firsthand the devastation and distress caused by the flooding, deep in my heart I sense the urge to act, to do something, to help. I know that all of us, regardless of race and religion, will come together and contribute to help those who are still suffering-those who were injured and those left homeless by the earthquake and the tsunami. We are all human beings, and no matter how different we appear on the surface, we are the same inside. Our deepest, truest human nature is to be selfless and compassionate-the very qualities that are in greatest need at this moment. Please help however which way you can, my brothers and sisters around the world, whether it is to donate money, to provide assistance, or even to pray for the well-being of those affected by the tsunami, The time is now.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> and...</p>
              <blockquote>Reason"
              <p> </p>
              <p>As has been widely reported, I had a close brush with death during the tsunami that swept through South Asia on December 26, 2004. Fortunately, my family and I were able to escape danger. We are all right and in good health.</p>
              <p>However, the experience of surviving the chaos and witnessing the devastation caused by this natural disaster has changed me forever. During the recovery period in the Maldives, I was deeply moved to see that everyone who was able to help did willingly pitch in. Never once did anyone ask anybody else, "Where are you from?" or "What nationality are you?" I wondered: was it possible to keep that spirit alive and transcend traditional boundaries to help humanity at large?</p>
              <p>Deep in my heart, I sensed the urge to act-to do something more.</p>
              <p>I am proposing an idea for a new international relief agency, called <strong>ONE Foundation</strong>. This idea had been brewing in my mind for many years. Up until this moment, however, I had never had the courage to set it into motion.</p>
              <p>I realize that establishing this foundation will be more challenging than anything I have ever done. The night of the devastation, I couldn't sleep. I meditated through the night.</p>
              <p>I decided that no matter how difficult the path ahead, I would give it my all. I will never waver in my commitment to make <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> a reality. The need is unquestionable. The time is now.</p>
              <p><strong>"Idea"</strong></p>
              <p>The concept behind <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> is simple:</p>
              <p><strong><em>1 person + 1 dollar + 1 month (each month) = 1 (big) family</em></strong></p>
              <p>Translation: Each person who can, donates one dollar per month. Everyone is connected as one world. The generosity you show to others ultimately comes back to yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>ONE Foundation</strong> aims to create an organization whose main goal will be to provide relief to the victims of natural disasters. History shows us that natural disasters are inevitable and can cause catastrophic damage. The only uncertainty is when and where they will strike-and whose lives they will affect. Natural disasters know no boundaries. Nobody on the planet is immune. Because we share this common vulnerability, let us unite across national borders, race, religion, age, and politics. In other words, let us transcend traditional boundaries and unite as one.</p>
              <p>As we all know, the world has five major continents. It is how we are geographically divided. However, if you take a bird's-eye view of the planet, there is only one Earth. Everyone belongs to the planet. Think of the Earth as a human body. Think of the five major continents as major organ systems of the body. If something happens to one of the organs, every other part is affected.</p>
              <p>The population of our planet currently stands at 6.4 billion people. If 10% of us would agree to donate and give one dollar a month, together we can raise millions each year. Carried across many years and generations, one dollar a month can make a HUGE difference.</p>
              <p>Let's set up an infrastructure that will make the act of donating as effortless as breathing, or as simple as buying groceries. Our goal will be to make donating one dollar a month as easy as possible.</p>
              <p>In addition, <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> will hold occasional fundraisers-events that will challenge the world to show more generosity, unity, and teamwork than it believes possible. All of us are capable of doing much more than we do now. Every four years, we watch the ideals of the Olympics push athletes to achieve feats beyond what is imagined possible. Can we, the human family, break all previous records for compassion?</p>
              <p>I believe that the act of donating one's time or money is a holistic act. The immediate effect is to help those in need, but by contributing to the global family, you understand yourself to be part of something larger. By showing generosity, you understand that no matter what happens to you or your immediate family, you are never alone-and this is a priceless feeling. You have helped someone else. Should the day come that you are the one in need of assistance, you can be sure that this family will come and help you. You have always been part of a global family, and now you know that its resources are limitless as its desire to give and help. In reaching out to help others in your worldwide family, you realize that the ultimate beneficiary is yourself.</p>
              <p>We are so accustomed to helping and supporting victims of natural disasters only after the photographs and news reports of the devastation start to appear. Since we know that these natural disasters are a certainty, let's put together a world fund that is eminently prepared and proactively organized to provide aid. When disaster strikes, <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> can immediately put the plan into action to provide immediate aid and relief. Let's create a legacy together: a perpetual fund that will provide long-term support and planning for generations to come.</p>
              <p>The plan is to start <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> in China/Hong Kong. My homeland represents one-fifth of the world's population, and as such, bears a responsibility to take its place among the other leading nations in the world in setting an example. From China/Hong Kong, <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> will expand throughout Asia to Europe and the United States, and eventually everywhere in the world.</p>
              <p>The foundation's main services can be categorized as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Emergency rescue and response </li>
              <li>Post-disaster recovery, rebuilding, and disease prevention </li>
              <li>Long-term support, especially psychological and post-trauma support </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Long-term support is necessary and of utmost importance. My young daughters were with me during the tsunami disaster in the Maldives; I can already see that they are experiencing post-traumatic symptoms, as they have developed a fear of the ocean and water. Seeing this, it struck me that the deep mental scars and psychological effects that result from any large disaster can be just as devastating as the physical destruction. Feelings of loss and grief persist over time and are difficult to assuage. Long-term support is crucial in assisting disaster victims to cope with their loss and to help them towards the rebuilding of a normal life.</p>
              <p>As always, my intention is not to preach. I am only sharing my idea with the world in the hopes that everyone will come together to help each other-and themselves.</p>
              <p>In order to make <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> a reality, I am seeking the help of experts who are knowledgeable in establishing and running foundations and non-profit organizations. In addition, I will need assistance and advice from medical professionals, lawyers, bankers, politicians, and anybody else who is willing to help. To fulfill its humanitarian mission, <strong>ONE Foundation</strong>'s broad-based plan will also require many volunteers.</p>
              <p>I hope that the worldwide media will help me in publicizing, promoting and following the establishment and progress of <strong>ONE Foundation</strong>. In addition, I hope they will help in acting as a public check on the foundation to ensure that <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> is accountable for its actions and the money donated.</p>
              <p>A website for <strong>ONE Foundation</strong> is being created. Until it is done, please send all suggestions and comments to me at: <a href="mailto:jetli.com.1@gmail.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6dcff6;">jetli.com.1@gmail.com</span></span></a>. In addition, you may visit my website at <a href="http://www.jetli.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6dcff6;">jetli.com</span></span></a> for continual updates. If you have expertise to share, I am eager to hear from you. If you are willing to donate your time or money, thank you for understanding the idea behind <strong>ONE Foundation</strong>. Please be patient-you will hear from me again soon.</p>
              <h2>Afterword</h2>
              <p><strong>"The spirit of ONE Foundation"</strong></p>
              <p>The magnitude of devastation left in the wake of this unfortunate disaster is unlike anything we have previously seen. In response, the world has already shown an unprecedented outpouring of support, compassion, and love. This selfless outpour of generosity has already transcended all boundaries and has shown us how deeply the world can love. I am humbled by it. And it's this feeling of love and compassion that I hope to see carry forward in perpetuity. I hope we can pass this feeling of warmth and thoughtfulness to generations upon generations. Let's show that the scale of humanity's love-the feeling of a big family-can last forever.</p>
