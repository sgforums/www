              <h2 class="posttitle">Are All Religions the Same?</h2>
              <span class="left">Posted by <a title="Posts by Shen Shi'an" href="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/author/admin/">Shen Shi'an</a> on November 10, 2010</span> </div>
              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1999" src="http://thedailyenlightenment.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/18.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="300"></strong>It is a common and idealistically beautiful notion, that all the religions of the world essentially preach the same teachings for the betterment of the world. In fact, this is part of the spirit that makes harmonious inter-religious dialogue possible – when we choose to focus on the similarities of compassion and wisdom. If we are to harp on the differences to one another instead, there would be religious conflict.</p>
              <p>But are all religions exactly the same upon closer look? Realistically, of course not - this is why there are different religions in the first place, even though there might be certain teachings which overlap in between. If we truly wish to deeply understand various religions, we need to not only look at the similarities, which many prefer to stop at, but to look at the differences too. It should not be surprising that the deeper one looks, the more obvious it might be that there are differences aplenty. Many Buddhists too have previously speculated on the sameness of all religions, till they studied more about Buddhism, realising how it even explains how various religious stems of thought evolved differently.</p>
              <p>Is it okay for one to be a “hybrid Buddhist”? For instance, to be a “Whatever-Buddhist” (fill in your non-Buddhist faith in place of “Whatever”)? While many Buddhists are not exactly sure of others’ reactions to that, what would the Buddha think of such an idea? Well, though the Buddha clearly wished to benefit everyone with his teachings, he never demanded anyone to follow his teachings fully without question. In fact, he taught that “When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities (as taught) are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and to happiness’ - then you should enter and remain in them.” (From the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an03-065.html"><span style="color: #16387c;">Kalama Sutta</span></a>: please study it for more details as to how to wisely embrace a teaching.) Though the quote might seem like common sense, it also means the Buddha allows us to be as Buddhist or non-Buddhist as we wish, as we personally find sensible or are comfortable with - though there is no guarantee that every individual understands what is truly ”sensible”.</p>
              <p>Out of his great compassion, the Buddha would surely prefer us to benefit through partial practice of his teachings than to embrace none of them at all. Free-thinkers, those of other faiths and those who are not totally Buddhist are thus always welcomed to learn more about Buddhism in a non-exclusivist and “no obligation” way. What is worth pondering about the quote above is what truly constitutes “blameless”, “when adopted and carried out, lead to welfare and happiness.” As Buddhists, that leading towards enlightenment in one way or another, directly or indirectly, should be seen as the ultimate benchmark, with enlightenment being true “welfare and happiness”. The Kalama spirit of “Come and see (and ask); don’t just believe” is also renowned in Buddhism - a probable reason why Buddhism is currently the fastest growing religion in the largely dogmatically-saturated but spiritually-dissatisfied West.</p>
              <p>The Buddha also taught unequivocally that to become fully spiritually liberated like Himself requires the full practice and realisation of the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/"><span style="color: #16387c;">Noble Eightfold Path</span></a> (Right view, resolve, speech, action, livelihood, effort, concentration) which he taught – “But in whatsoever Dhamma (teachings) and Discipline (moral guidelines) there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is found a true ascetic (spiritual practitioner) of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness (levels of spiritual attainment culminating in self-liberation here). Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda (the Buddha’s last convert), is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers.” (From the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/digha/dn-16-sv0.html"><span style="color: #16387c;">Mahaparinibbana Sutta</span></a>) In this sense, to the extent that one practises the Noble Eightfold Path is the extent to which one is truly Buddhist at heart.</p>
              <p>The Three Universal Characteristics (Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta) are also unique teachings found complete in Buddhism alone. These are often described as the “Three Seals of the Law (of Dharma)”, used to authenticate the Buddha’s teachings, to differentiate them from non-Buddhist teachings. Another major difference of Buddhism from many other religions is that the Buddha clearly proclaimed himself not to be a god or godsend, having transcended the limitations of all beings, godly or not, though spiritual perfection, being addressed as the “Teacher of men and gods” instead. The Buddha also did not advocate the belief in an almighty good God, and even explained how the concept of a creator God arose. That aside, He did teach of the existence of countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with infinite compassion, ever ready to guide all beings to attain True Happiness.</p>
              <p>If one studies different religions on the surface level, one might be too quick to conclude that all religions simply teach us to avoid evil and to do good. The Buddha’s teachings are often summarised in this verse, “To abstain from all evil, the practice of good, and the thorough purification of one’s mind - this is the teaching of the Buddhas.” (From the <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/resources/dhammapada.html"><span style="color: #16387c;">Dhammapada</span></a>) Particular to Buddhism, not only does it has exceptionally unmatched high and detailed moral standards of universal compassion to all beings great and small, it also systematically advocates a path for the purification of the mind through meditational practices, whereby the end result is realisation of the truth of non-self, the attainment of enlightenment (also defined as the emancipation, Nirvana or True Happiness), after which one is better able to help all beings attain the same liberation. These teachings are unique to Buddhism alone.</p>
              <p>Even if one might be able to happily reconcile one’s faith with the Buddhist faith, there are still indeed “irreconcilable differences” which make Buddhism, as well as other religions distinct from one another. While it might be perceived that different religions are different paths to the same goal, the goals of each religion are usually essentially different, and only somewhat similar. May we remember that to be truly open-minded does not merely entail looking beyond differences, only thinking that different religions have similarities in ideology - it also includes realising they have concrete differences too. This is important as having or promoting over-simplified or warped and thus inaccurate personal conjectures of the essences of various religions is not only unfair to oneself spiritually, it is also unfair to those of their respective religions.</p>
              <p>While we might think outsiders of other religions can see the overall picture better than the insiders, one should also consider becoming more of an insider to see the picture from within, by having more through study and practice of a religion to discover its essence. Otherwise, one will have an incomplete vision of the whole picture. Just as those of a religion should respect and never disparage those of other religions, to “force” the assumed oneness of all religions upon anyone is to disparage all religions themselves, as this corrupts their original teachings, which have painstakingly evolved to be self-contained paths to their respective spiritual goals. Of course, whether the paths work or not, and whether the goals are true or not is another issue altogether, subject to debate. However, since religions exist to benefit humankind, may all religions co-exist harmoniously in the light of true understanding!</p>

              <p>The view that all paths lead to One God is a Hindu understanding and it is true of every non-Buddhist contemplative traditions that lead to direct experiential insight of a transcendental reality. <strong>However </strong>it is not in accord with Buddhism, because through realization of emptiness and interdependent origination, we deconstruct even the construct of an ultimate God. All religions lead to God, except in Buddhism, where we first realize God and then throw God away.</p>

                                                              am just saying that this is what may automatically happen as you
                                                              progress in your practice of Buddhism, if you do start practicing.</p>
              <p>I am speaking from experience - and not just mine, but similarly countless practitioners' - see for example <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a></p>
              <p>As you practice and gain direct experience on the nature of
                                                              reality, your view of 'God' may shift from a 'personal God' to an
                                                              impersonal and transcendental 'Ground of Being', to an
                                                              interdependently originated universe. Some people mistook the transcendental I AM or 'ground of being' as Buddha-Nature, and is half-right: the luminosity/brilliant awareness aspect of Buddha-Nature is realized, but its empty (no inherent/independent existence) nature is not yet realized. Luminosity and emptiness are inseparable. Note: emptiness is not formlessness, but the emptiness of an inherent substance or independent existence.</p>
              <p>You need to have the courage to suspend all beliefs and look at
                                                              your direct experience what the nature of reality is... once you
                                                              stop relying on concepts and beliefs and simply look, insights and
                                                              realizations of the nature of reality will arise quickly and you
                                                              will go beyond all doubts about what the Truth is.</p>
              <p>You will see that all experiences arise due to an intricate
                                                              interdependence and there is no one who is behind a particular
                                                              arising experience... neither is there a 'you' or a 'God' doing or
                                                              experiencing or making things happen.</p>
              <p>Things simply happen due to the supporting conditions... they
                                                              are empty.</p>
              <p>Shunyata (Emptiness) means whatever appears are empty of
                                                              independent or inherent existence, be it a sound, a form, or any
                                                              other phenomena. This is because it is the 'interconnectedness'
                                                              that give rise to the sound or experience (The person, the stick,
                                                              the bell, hitting, air, ears, etc, i.e. the conditions). There is no ultimate origin or source of experience, only seamless interdependence that turns out to be empty, unborn and unconditioned.<br> <br> Thus, whatever arises interdependently is vividly clear and
                                                              luminous, but empty of any *independent* or *inherent* existence.
                                                              The entire universe is empty.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is the doctrine of interdependent origination that
                                                              removes the view of there being an agent or self or God behind
                                                              experiences.</p>
              <p>These realizations happen in stages: first you experience yourself as the transcendental Source of all things, then you realize non-dual, then you realize Anatta, followed by D.O./Emptiness.</p>

              <h3>2.2 Pantheism</h3>
              <h4>A widely held view of ultimate nature is often referred to as pantheism.
                                      This view comprehends ultimate nature as some kind of primal substance
                                      out of which all things emerge. The most common metaphor for this view
                                      is waves and water. The phenomena that we perceive are the wvaes, but their
                                      true nature is water, which all phenomena share. From this perspective,
                                      the appearances of this world are considered to exist as modifications
                                      of this primal substance. The transcendent substance unites all existing
                                      things, constitutes what all existing things have in common, and is in
                                      a profound sense more real than appearances because appearances seem to
                                      exist in a way that things have differentiating natures whereas in reality,
                                      from the perspective of pantheism, the ultimate nature of things is this
                                      primal substance. The two great elucidations of this view are the <em>Upanishads</em> of Indian philosophy and Spinoza in the west.</h4>
              <h4>Interdependent Transformation, in contrast, is a non-substantial view of
                                      ultimate nature. The metaphor for Interdependent Transformation most widely
                                      used within the Buddhist tradition is Indra’s Net. In this metaphor the
                                      places where the threads of the net cross are occupied by jewels. The facets
                                      of the jewels reflect all the other jewels in the net. Now, drop the threads.
                                      Now drop the jewels: or rather the jewels are nothing more than the endless
                                      reflections and refractions off of all the other jewels.</h4>
              <h4>The common nature, from the point of view of Interdependent Transformation,
                                      that nature which all things share, is their dependency, their reliance
                                      upon conditions for their existence, not their substance. The dependent
                                      nature of all existing things manifests as a quality of those things, but
                                      does not imply an underlying substance or essential nature. Just as a green
                                      chair and a green table share the color green without implying that they
                                      have a common substance, so the qualities that emerge from Interdependent
                                      Transformation, such as dependence, interdependence, process, contingency,
                                      etc., mark all existing things, but do not imply a substantial presence
                                      or essential nature. This, in part, is what Buddhism means when it says
                                      that things are “empty”; they are empty of substance, empty of essence,
                                      but they are full of the causal matrix which is their true nature.</h4>
              <h3>2.3 Emanationism</h3>
              <h4>Another understanding of ultimate nature is referred to as “emanationism”.
                                      The great elucidator of this view in the west was Plotinus and through
                                      his considerable influence all subsequent neo-platonism and much of early
                                      Christian theology. There are also modern manifestations of this kind of
                                      view, particularly among Theosophists and related groups. The basic view
                                      here is that there is a constantly present source from which all things
                                      emerge. Spirituality is comprehended as a task of ascending higher and
                                      higher, closer and closer, to this ultimate source of all things.</h4>
              <h4>A model for the emanationist view of existence is a series of concentric
                                      rings. In the center is the source (God, The One, The Light, The Nameless).
                                      The closer one is to this source the more spiritual and ethereal one becomes.
                                      In a monotheistic context, for example, angels are closer to the source
                                      than humans, and therefore angels are more spiritual than humans. Humans
                                      do have the opportunity, however, to ascend to the divine through contemplation
                                      and prayer.</h4>
              <h4>The teaching of Interdependent Transformation differs from emanationism
                                      because there is no specific source from which the ultimate nature, as
                                      illuminated in this view, of all things arises. As Prashastrasena, an ancient
                                      Indian commentator, put it, Nirvana is unlocated, or has no location. A
                                      model often used for Interdependent Transformation is referred to as “Indra’s
                                      Net” which depicts a network, a fabric, of interconnectedness. The point
                                      here is that nirvana, or ultimate reality, has no locus/location, either
                                      in time or in space. Rather, Interdependent Transformation exists spread
                                      out over all of existence. One way of comprehending this is to think of
                                      Interdependent Transformation as a quality, or group of qualities, which
                                      qualify all existing things. Therefore, as a transcendental quality, Interdependent
                                      Transformation is present in all existing things, but does not negate any
                                      existing thing. As present in all existing things, it is present everywhere
                                      equally, but simultaneously has no particular location from which this
                                      ultimate nature springs.</h4>
              <h4>From the perspective of Interdependent Transformation the metaphor of ascent
                                      into a spiritual domain is inappropriate. Instead, spirituality is comprehended
                                      as awakening to, or understanding, or realizing, the primal interconnectedness
                                      of all things. This interconnectedness, these qualities of interdependence,
                                      of dependence, of transformation, of creativity, manifest equally everywhere,
                                      or, as I like to say, everywhere in particular.</h4>
              <h3>2.8 Monotheism</h3>
              <h4>This is the big one, the view that concerns most westerners.
                                                              There is a long and venerable history of discussion between the
                                                              monotheistic tradition and Buddhism. This dialogue between the two
                                                              traditions often centers on whether or not at core these two
                                                              traditions have a common understanding. The need for this dialogue
                                                              appears because at a certain obvious level Buddhism simply does not
                                                              have a supreme being, what the monotheistic tradition generally
                                                              means by God.</h4>
              <h4>I distinguish two components of ultimacy that are unique to the
                                                              monotheistic tradition. Given that the monotheistic tradition
                                                              believes in the existence of only one God, the monotheistic
                                                              tradition conceives of God as the ultimate; furthermore God in this
                                                              tradition is the creator of all existence and also bears moral
                                                              responsibility for the activities which occur in this
                                                              existence.</h4>
              <h4>Both of these components are absent from the Buddhist
                                                              tradition. The Buddhist tradition lacks a being who has created
                                                              existence. Instead, from the perspective of Interdependent
                                                              Transformation, Buddhism conceives of existence as always existing,
                                                              without beginning and without end. Furthermore, from the
                                                              perspective of Interdependent Transformation, there is no specific
                                                              locus of creation, no specific being is responsible for bringing
                                                              existence into existence. Rather, creativity is an aspect of all
                                                              existing things and therefore the source of existence is the things

                                                              that world went nova and the planet was destroyed in the ensuing
                                                              solar eruptions, the bulk of its inhabitants, as the result of
                                                              their arduously practicing the Dharma for ten thousand years, were
                                                              reborn on one of the higher planes of the Form World or
                                                              <em>Ruupedhaatu</em>, a plane of existence known as
                                                              <em>Aabhaasvara</em> or “clear light.” Here they enjoyed
                                                              inconceivable bliss and felicity for countless aeons. Then, when
                                                              their great store of past karma came onto maturity, our own solar
                                                              system and planet earth began to evolve and some among their
                                                              numbers were reborn on the lower planes of the <em>Ruupadhaatu</em> in the vicinity of the nascent earth. This plane of existence where
                                                              they found themselves reborn is known as <em>Brahmaaloka</em>. The
                                                              first of these beings to reawaken and be reborn, upon seeing the
                                                              solar system evolving below him, exclaimed in his delight, “I am
                                                              the Creator!” In this way, he came to believe that he was the
                                                              actual creator of the universe which he saw about him, for he did
                                                              not remember from whence he came and was born without any parents.
                                                              But in actuality the manifestation of this universe was due to the
                                                              collective karma of all in that company and his own individual

              <h4>Both of the above quoted passages are rooted in the
                                                              understanding of existence as a causal matrix, the view of

                                                              of God as deluded, as Reynolds suggests. God thinks he has created
                                                              this world system because, due to his karma, he was the first
                                                              conscious being in this world system. Unaware of his past karma
                                                              which created the conditions for his rebirth in this world system,
                                                              and not observing any other conscious beings in this world system,
                                                              God then concludes that he is the creator of this world system.
                                                              Unaware that there are other world systems, incalculably numerous,
                                                              God/Ishvara concludes that he is the creator of all of
                                                              existence.</h4>
              <h4>It takes some time to take in all the implications of such a
                                                              world view. It is breathtaking in scope and rich in implications.
                                                              One of the implications is that being reborn as God is not, from a
                                                              Buddhist perspective, a fortunate rebirth. It is not a rebirth that
                                                              will lead to liberation, to <em>nirvana</em>, and the cessation of
                                                              all sorrow because such a rebirth re-enforces the idea that there
                                                              is something that exists independently, and it is this very
                                                              idea/belief/feeling that is the source of sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>It might seem that this is the end of the story; Buddhism
                                                              doesn’t believe in a creator Deity that bears moral responsibility
                                                              for existence while the monotheistic tradition has this view at its
                                                              core. The two traditions, therefore, diverge.</h4>
              <h4>However, God has many names and many meanings and
                                                              Interdependent Transformation has many facets. Though the view of
                                                              Interdependent Transformation does lead to a view of existence that
                                                              in some respects differs from that of the monotheistic tradition,
                                                              we should not stop at this conclusion. I have previously mentioned
                                                              in the discussion on the basic implications of Intedependent
                                                              Transformation that this core view of the Buddha means that all
                                                              things exist dependently. Because the monotheistic tradition
                                                              regards God as the creator of all existing things and of existence
                                                              itself, the monotheistic tradition views all things as existing
                                                              dependently, as in a totally dependent state. From this
                                                              perspective, the perspective of dependence, the Buddhist and
                                                              Monotheistic tradition share a common insight into the transcendent
                                                              nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h4>Or take the view that God is love. It is out of God’s love that
                                                              existence emerges. Existence is an expression of the generosity and
                                                              benign nature of God. In the Buddhist tradition it is the
                                                              realization that all things exist interdependently that gives rise
                                                              to the blossoming of the compassionate heart. Love and Compassion
                                                              are always present, but they are covered over by ignorance,
                                                              self-concern, and distraction. I think that these two insights are
                                                              very close for they both proclaim that in some sense love and
                                                              compassion are the true nature of existence, that love and
                                                              compassion blossom when we comprehend the transcendental.</h4>
              <h4>What I am suggesting is that even if I put aside the idea of a
                                                              Creator Being, even if I put aside the idea of a Being who bears
                                                              moral responsibility for existence, there are still significant,
                                                              broad areas for dialogue between the two traditions because there
                                                              is more to the idea of God than the idea of a Creator. From a
                                                              Buddhist perspective, the most important aspects might lie outside
                                                              of the Creator view.</h4>
              <h4>How do we access this broader understanding that lies at the
                                                              core of the monotheistic tradition? I would suggest using those
                                                              traditions centered on positive theology. Positive theology is that
                                                              theology which explores the Divine Names and Attributes of God. For
                                                              example, Dionysius the Areopagite wrote a theological work called

                                                              to start making such a comparison. For example, Dionysius

              <h4>Now, turn to the Buddhist tradition and uncover the names that
                                                              the Buddha in the Discourses uses for <em>nirvana</em>. He uses
                                                              such terms as the “cessation of suffering”, “the non-clinging”,
                                                              “peace”, “serenity”, “the lovely”, “the unconditioned”, “love”,
                                                              “the unborn”, “the deathless”, etc.. Just as the core view of the
                                                              monotheistic tradition is multi-faceted, so also the ultimate goal
                                                              and core notion of the Buddhist tradition has many facets and many
                                                              names. Once I move away from a fixation on the idea of God as a
                                                              creator of existence, I am actually able to find a lot of
                                                              similarity between these core views, many overlaps. It is useful to
                                                              compare these two because how they arrive at these core
                                                              understandings, such as dependence, differs, but often the core
                                                              understandings themselves are amazingly similar. Thus, both
                                                              traditions are mutually enriched by broadening their
                                                              understanding.</h4>
              <h4>This is not the place to go into a systematic treatment of
                                                              these two core views. It would require a book in and of itself. I
                                                              believe what would be required is to compare and contrast the
                                                              facets of ultimacy that each tradition has lived with down through
                                                              the centuries. In addition to comparing and contrasting, I would
                                                              also suggest comprehending how each tradition arrives at this
                                                              understanding.</h4>
              <h4>I believe the result of such a project would produce a mosaic
                                                              of overlapping and divergent understandings. From the perspective
                                                              of a particular facet X, the two traditions have a shared view.
                                                              From the perspective of facet Y, the two traditions diverge. From
                                                              the persective of how they arrive at the same view X, there will
                                                              also appear similarities and contrasts. When engaging in this
                                                              project it is also important to keep in mind that monotheism is not
                                                              a uniform tradition; it is actually more accurate to say
                                                              “monotheisms”, and the same applies to Buddhism. The personalism of
                                                              Christianity, for example, is something not shared by Judaism or
                                                              Islam. Similarly, the view of the ontological status of suffering
                                                              is quite different in different Buddhist traditions. Though this
                                                              complicates the task, I do not consider it an insurmountable
                                                              obstacle as long as one maintains a broad focus.</h4>
              <h4>This may seem like a lot of work, but I believe the results of
                                                              such a project would be an ability to speak clearly to each other,
                                                              from the views that each tradition holds, and come to a genuine and
                                                              deep mutual understanding and appreciation. A good way to start
                                                              such a project would be to compare two specific core texts, such as
                                                              <em>The Divine Names</em> with something like the <em>Udana</em> in
                                                              the Buddhist tradition. This may seem to narrow the focus from the
                                                              broad focus I just suggested. However, the virtue of taking two
                                                              specific works and comparing them is that it grounds the
                                                              investigation in a specific work and tradition so that it reduces
                                                              mere speculation.</h4>
              <h4>The dialogue between monotheism and Buddhism has been going on

                                                              both traditions. I would hope that such an exchange of views could
                                                              be expanded to include other traditions as well, such as the
