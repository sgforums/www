              <p>There are three ways of understanding dependent origination.</p>
              <p>The classic, commentarial explanation as well as some of the suttas is 3 lifetimes. There are nowadays also the two lifetimes, one life explanation.</p>
              <p>In 3 life explanation, sense base does not cease - they continue to manifest due to old causes, but will cease upon death.</p>

              <p>Bhikkhu Bodhi: This passage shows the arahant's abiding in the Nibbana element with a residue remaining (of the factors of conditioned existence, sa-upadisesa nibbanadhatu). Though he continues to experience feelings, he is free from lust towards pleasant feeling, from aversion towards painful feeling, and from ignorance about neutral feeling.</p>
              <p>MN 141:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>22. “He understands thus: ‘If I were to direct this equanimity, so 
                  purified and bright, to the base of infinite space and to develop my 
                  mind accordingly, this would be conditioned. If I were to direct this 
                  equanimity, so purified and bright, to the base of infinite 
                  consciousness… to the base of nothingness…to the base of 
                  neither-perception-nor-non-perception and to develop my mind 
                  accordingly, this would be conditioned.’ He does not form any condition 
                  or generate any volition tending towards either being or non-being. 
                  Since he does not form any condition or generate any volition tending 
                  towards either being or non-being, he does not cling to anything in this
                   world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not 
                  agitated, he personally attains NibbÄ�na. He understands thus: ‘Birth is 
                  destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been 
                  done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’</p>
              <p>23. “If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is 
                  impermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.’ If 
                  he feels a painful feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent; there is
                   no holding to it; there is no delight in it.’ If he feels a 
                  neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is 
                  impermanent; there is no holding to it; there is no delight in it.’</p>
              <p>24. “If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he 
                  feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a 
                  neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. When he 
                  feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: ‘I feel a 
                  feeling terminating with the body.’ When he feels a feeling terminating 
                  with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with life.’ He 
                  understands: ‘On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, 
                  all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’ 
                  Bhikkhu, just as an oil-lamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick, and 
                  when the oil and wick are used up, if it does not get any more fuel, it 
                  is extinguished from lack of fuel; so too when he feels a feeling 
                  terminating with the body…a feeling terminating with life, he 
                  understands: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>‘I feel a feeling terminating with life.’ He understands: 
                  ‘On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, all that is 
                  felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’</strong></span></p>
              <p>25. “Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this wisdom] possesses the 
                  supreme foundation of wisdom. For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble 
                  wisdom, namely, the knowledge of the destruction of all suffering.</p>
              <p>26. “His deliverance, being founded upon truth, is unshakeable. For 
                  that is false, bhikkhu, which has a deceptive nature, and that is true 
                  which has an undeceptive nature – NibbÄ�na. Therefore a bhikkhu 
                  possessing [this truth] possesses the supreme foundation of truth. For 
                  this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble truth, namely, NibbÄ�na, which has a 
                  undeceptive nature.</p>
              <p>27. “Formerly, when he was ignorant, he undertook and accepted 
                  acquisitions; now he has abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made 
                  them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer 
                  subject to future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this 
                  relinquishment] possesses the supreme foundation of relinquishment. For 
                  this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely, the 
                  relinquishing of all acquisitions.</p>

              <p>Geoff/Nana/Jnana explanation
                                          on viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ:<br> <br> "As for anidassana, in this context I'm liking the translation as
                                          "non-illustrative" or "non-indicative." "Non-illustrative" in the
                                          sense of the term as used in MN 21 KakacÅ«pama Sutta: Ä�kÄ�so arÅ«pÄ«
                                          anidassano, the sky is formless and non-illustrative.
                                          "Non-indicative" in the sense of the term as used in the
                                          Abhidhammapiá¹­aka, where the applications of mindfulness. etc., are
                                          said to be anidassana. The sense here being that they are not
                                          indicative of defilements, and so on.<br> <br> Also cf. Ven. ÑÄ�á¹‡ananda, NibbÄ�na Sermon 07:<br> Now viññÄ�á¹‡aá¹ƒ anidassanaá¹ƒ is a reference to the nature of the
                                          released consciousness of an arahant. It does not reflect anything.
                                          To be more precise, it does not reflect a nÄ�ma-rÅ«pa, or
                                          name-and-form. An ordinary individual sees a nÄ�ma-rÅ«pa, when he
                                          reflects, which he calls 'I' and 'mine'. It is like the reflection
                                          of that dog, which sees its own delusive reflection in the water. A
                                          non-arahant, upon reflection, sees name-and-form, which however he
                                          mistakes to be his self. With the notion of 'I' and 'mine' he falls
                                          into delusion with regard to it. But the arahant's consciousness is
                                          an unestablished consciousness.<br> <br> We have already mentioned in previous sermons about the established
                                          consciousness and the unestablished consciousness. A non-arahant's
                                          consciousness is established on name-and-form. The unestablished
                                          consciousness is that which is free from name-and-form and is
                                          unestablished on name-and-form. The established consciousness, upon
                                          reflection, reflects name-and-form, on which it is established,
                                          whereas the unestablished consciousness does not find a
                                          name-and-form as a reality. The arahant has no attachments or
                                          entanglements in regard to name-and-form. In short, it is a sort of
                                          penetration of name-and-form, without getting entangled in it. This
                                          is how we have to unravel the meaning of the expression anidassana
                                          viññÄ�á¹‡a.<br> <br> All the best,<br> <br> Geoff"</p>

              <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="saketa" name="saketa">Saketa</a> at Kalaka's park. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "Monks, whatever in the cosmos — with its 
              devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives 
              &amp; brahmans royalty &amp; common people — is seen, heard, sensed, 
              cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect: That do I 
              know. Whatever in the cosmos — with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its
               generations with their contemplatives &amp; brahmans, their royalty 
              &amp; common people — is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought
               after, pondered by the intellect: That I directly know. That has been 
              realized by the Tathagata, but in the Tathagata<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.024.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> it has not been established.<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.024.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a></p>
              <p>"If I were to say, 'I don't know whatever in the cosmos... is seen, 
              heard, sensed, cognized... pondered by the intellect,' that would be a 
              falsehood in me. If I were to say, 'I both know and don't know whatever 
              in the cosmos... is seen, heard, sensed, cognized... pondered by the 
              intellect,' that would be just the same. If I were to say, 'I neither 
              know nor don't know whatever in the cosmos... is seen, heard, sensed, 
              cognized... pondered by the intellect,' that would be a fault in me.</p>
              <p>"Thus, monks, the Tathagata, when seeing what is to be seen, doesn't 
              construe an [object as] seen. He doesn't construe an unseen. He doesn't 
              construe an [object] to-be-seen. He doesn't construe a seer.</p>
              <p>"When hearing...</p>
              <p>"When sensing...</p>
              <p>"When cognizing what is to be cognized, he doesn't construe an 
              [object as] cognized. He doesn't construe an uncognized. He doesn't 
              construe an [object] to-be-cognized. He doesn't construe a cognizer.</p>
              <p>Thus, monks, the Tathagata — being the same with regard to all 
              phenomena that can be seen, heard, sensed, &amp; cognized — is 'Such.' 
              And I tell you: There's no other 'Such' higher or more sublime.</p>
              <div class="freeverse">"Whatever is seen or heard or sensed
              	and fastened onto as true by others,
              One who is Such — among the self-fettered —
              wouldn't further claim to be true or even false.
              "Having seen well in advance that arrow
              where generations are fastened &amp; hung
              <em> — 'I know, I see, that's just how it is!' — </em> there's nothing of the Tathagata fastened."</div>

              <p>Thanks for all the quotations and answers.  It is quite interesting. Buddhas have definitely ended all sufferings and they still have sense-perceptions etc.  For there to be omniscience, surely one needs to have sense perceptions etc. that is far beyond ordinary sense-perceptions.</p>
              <p>But in other explanations, the five aggregates have been transmuted into the five wisdoms. So the presentation there is different.  </p>
