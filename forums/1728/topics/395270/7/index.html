              <p>Wow ! I didn't know you are so young !</p>
              <p>I used to go out with friends but sometimes I can't make it because I need to go to the temple for chanting. From here, they know I chant frequently and they become curious why I become a Buddhist. I told them that I do not wish to be within the rebirth cycle again and that is how the conversation get started.</p>
              <p>I will e-mail them some interesting articles on Buddhism or  pass to them æƒ å¾‹æ³•å¸ˆ VCD. Some will follow me to the temple for chanting and I consider my job done because the monk said it is important to plant "seed" (by chanting Buddha's name at least once) into them and the rest is up to them. I will not pester them further. They will call me automatically if they wish to go to the temple again.</p>
              <p>There are a few who told me that they are grateful that I spread Buddhism to them. I did all these because I was grateful to my ex-colleague from my very first job. She went round spreading Buddhism patiently and she had successfully brought six of us (including myself) to take the 3 refuges.</p>
              <p>Let's help to spread the words of Buddha. My purpose is to let them know the truth and it is up to them to believe it or not.</p>

              <p>Hi Iron Fist,</p>
              <p>You asked me what root is, yes, root is gen in chinese. Same thing.</p>
              <p>The idea of root is just a way to express one's affinity.  If one has deeper roots, means in the recent past, he has been deeply involved in Buddhism, in terms of practice and/or understanding.</p>
              <p>I said you have positive roots because, since u were brought into contact with Buddhism so young, i dun feel it is a coincidence but due to your 'yuan' with Buddhism. </p>
              <p>Secondly, you read the sutras on Prajna Paramita Wisdom, is also another sign of your strong 'yuan' with the deepest teachings in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Although u dun understand, but I feel that the reading itself will be beneficial to you in future. </p>
              <p>My taoist acquaintance doesn't understand the sutra much too... but i think she will definitely reap the result of reciting the sutra once everyday.  more than 10 years now... she has at least done thousands of times. </p>
              <p>In the Tibetan tradition, there are many people who dun understand anything about the practice too, they have strong faith and due to the blessings of the practice and their diligence, they attain very astounding results.  In the Chinese Pureland tradition, such things are happening too.</p>
              <p>I think everyone stands a chance, affinity notwithstanding, of advancing on the spiritual path through their own path.  There have been many examples of people surprising others with their attainments although they were the least likely people to have realisations.</p>
              <p>I always feel that anyone on the street could have deeper understanding than myself.  It is always very humbling to know that.  It is not just my theory, it has happened many times.</p>

              <p>Hi Wisdomeye</p>
              <p>Your question: Why did I convert to Buddhism? .....</p>
              <p>In my teenage years, I used to attend charismatic church with a circle like minded Christian peers. At that point in time, it was fun and hippy if you would compare it to a temple when it was rather boring and dull.</p>
              <p>I was a very stauch Christian after my first baptism of holy spirit with initial sign of speaking in tongue due to my friend demonic possession case. Of course, I was affected by the incident  which further convince me that I need to go for my water baptism. Against my mum will I went ahead with the decision. In the years to come, I was very deeply rooted  in the church activities.</p>
              <p>The initial change was when I went oversea for my further studies. Being away from my Christian peers. I have a lot of time for myself. I begin to read a Buddhist book written by Dalai Lama without the typical "demonic connotation".  I used to sneer at Buddha thought as pessimistic teaching especially the 1st noble truth. In life there is suffering. However, when I am on my own after all the busy activities socialising, exam prep and etc. I realise the profoundity of this simple truth. After all, you do not need to be Buddha to realise that. Beside Buddha did not claim that you need to believe in him in order for the truth to be realised. The more I reflect on the 1st and 2nd noble truths. The more I being to appreciate Buddha teaching. Of course, in the midst of all this self reflection, I still continue to serve and attend church due to my connection. In fact, I had a dream when an evil unseen being was going after me. I was very frightened that I start to cast the being away in god's name. For some reason, it did not go away and suddenly I chanted, "Namu Guan Shi Yin Pusa." The being stop his approach and I was awake. I wonder how can I chant that when I have been attending church for 10 years. Something spiritual is awaking within me.</p>
              <p>The utlimate turning point was when I came back from oversea. To me there was nothing wrong being a Christian and Buddhist. After all, it is quite common in the west as Buddhist is a practice not a religion. However, due to my family's concern I decided to make the choice. Which mean I might lose a group of Christian social peers due to their lack of understanding. Of course, I did receive the typical anti Buddhist sneers and comment from them but I can't be bother. To me if you are my friend then you need to respect my choice.</p>
              <p>Eversince I begin to embark my Buddhist journey from the basic Theravada Buddhism to Mahanayana. As I was always looking out for the ultimate sutra to be used for my practise, in the end I settle for Lotus Sutra which co insight with the dream I mentioned. If you happend to read, Chapter 25 of Lotus Sutra, "Universal door" you will realise how compassionate Guan Yin is to all sentient beings both believer and non believer in assisting us. Well I would like to thanks those little things that happened along the way to lead me to where I am. I am still learning.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, do I miss the church. Yes, I still enjoy some of the smoothing songs. Well I think Buddhist temple, do need to change some of the style to cater to the needs of youth. Some temple or group has already embarked on the change process.</p>
              <p>May Buddha out of compassion continue to raise up more Earth Spring Bodhisattvas to lead Singapore Buddhist to a new height.</p>

              <p><br>Hi reborn76,</p>
              <p>Namu Myo Ho Renge Kyo!</p>
              <p>Thank you for your story.  I find that people who come into Buddhism thru reflection on the basic tenets and seals tend to be less likely to give up halfway...  jus my opinion. </p>
              <p>I am also very deep faith in Guan Yin Bodhisattva. </p>
              <p>Tibetan traditions have many songs with very touching tunes too... sometimes u may be able to hear them.  It is said that some tunes are inspired by higher beings.</p>
              <p>Thomas Merton is a Catholic (Father, in fact) who very interested in Buddhism. maybe you can derive some inspiration from him... in fact i feel that he is realised... but juz my guess.</p>
