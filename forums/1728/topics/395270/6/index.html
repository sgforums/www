              <p>I see... that's interesting. How did you come to talk to them about Buddhism?</p>
              <p>I don't feel it is very appropriate to talk to my friends about it. Perhaps also because my age group don't really feel drawn to spiritual things yet.. I just turned 20. Though a few of them has been to church (but left/back slided).</p>

              <p>Wow ! I didn't know you are so young !</p>
              <p>I used to go out with friends but sometimes I can't make it because I need to go to the temple for chanting. From here, they know I chant frequently and they become curious why I become a Buddhist. I told them that I do not wish to be within the rebirth cycle again and that is how the conversation get started.</p>
              <p>I will e-mail them some interesting articles on Buddhism or  pass to them æƒ å¾‹æ³•å¸ˆ VCD. Some will follow me to the temple for chanting and I consider my job done because the monk said it is important to plant "seed" (by chanting Buddha's name at least once) into them and the rest is up to them. I will not pester them further. They will call me automatically if they wish to go to the temple again.</p>
              <p>There are a few who told me that they are grateful that I spread Buddhism to them. I did all these because I was grateful to my ex-colleague from my very first job. She went round spreading Buddhism patiently and she had successfully brought six of us (including myself) to take the 3 refuges.</p>
              <p>Let's help to spread the words of Buddha. My purpose is to let them know the truth and it is up to them to believe it or not.</p>

              <p><br>It is ok to share openly.</p>
              <p>1) They said it does not make sense to be vegetarian because vegetables are also living things. I have even come across a Christian who told me that animals have no feelings of pain. I do not know how many Christians out there share his view or only him. I asked him to go slaughtering house to have a look or he can ask vets why vets have to inject anesthesia on animals when operating on them.</p>
              <p>He told me why not Buddhists tell the wild animals not to kill each other for food. I told him let nature takes its course. If they have to kill each other, it is their karma.</p>
              <p>Correction : Vegetables are not within the rebirth cycle. They have no eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc.</p>
              <p>2) Their explanations of the presence of ghosts :</p>
              <p>There are no ghosts. What people see are demons disguise as our relatives.</p>
              <p>Another group of explanation (mainly methodists) for ghosts is the souls will not go to heaven or hell immediately after death. All the souls will be wondering around till the judgement day.</p>
              <p>My question is : If that is the case, some souls must have wandering around for at least 2000 years! Poor souls.</p>
              <p>If I remember more, I shall share them here.</p>

              <p>Hello Ironfist,</p>
              <p> First I hope in the future you do not use the words such
              as:</p>
              <p>Hate,  Slander and Bash in vain.</p>
              <p>You are a christian and your god is "love", which is good, and
              "hate", the opposite of love is "evil', therefore bad. Your body is
              the temple of god,so if you are unable to love and can only hate,
              there not much god inside you is'nt it?!</p>
              <p> Slander is making false accusations and bashing is to
              verbally hit with violence.</p>
              <p>Just because you do not like what people are saying does'nt
              neccessarily make it false, just only proves you don't like like
              it. To prove slander, you must prove the statements made
              untrue!</p>
              <p>Comments made in other forums, I do not read, anyway, I am not
              my blubber's keeper!</p>
              <p>To answer your first statement about the buddhist son who
              scolded the mother for selling meat.  The son had the right
              intentions,perhaps like you, meaning well, but he lacked the
              skillfull means to go about it, Buddhism is also about skillful
              means if you do not know.</p>
              <p>Anyway, he do not understand what livelihood really means, it
              means you need it to survive, therefore cannot abandon it just like
              that! That why right livelihood is important, because we cannot
              change it easily, especially if you are old.</p>
              <p>The problem for non christians with christians is some of them
              are self righteous, pay lips service about love and do not respect
              other people religion. As far as I know, correct me if I am wrong,
              christians are the only religion I know in Singapore to harass
              dying people in hospitals.</p>
              <p>Religion is an identity, a sense of belonging to, so many people
              including lay buddhist is sensitive to it. Many taoist and buddhist
               or even christians are nominal one, eg. they are born in a
              family of that religion. Most of the time it is the sense belonging
              they are trying to protect, not really the religion! Just like you
              trying defend your religion without fully understand what people
              writng about!</p>
              <p>Like I said about slandering and bashing, have you been reading
              what the articles are trying to say?!</p>
              <p>Yes, Rony Tan is not the only one, but he is a community leader,
              who instead fostering better community ties, just to promote his
              religion, is tearing up a multicultural Singapore, and what do you
              know, he is slandering,because he can be proven false!</p>
              <p> If somebody is lying once, you may dismiss it, but if you
              allow him continuously say the same lies over and over again, then
              people start to take it as gospel truth. Do you wish to see
              Singaporeans fighting in the streets?!</p>

              <p>Just want to say I like the way Weychin uses Christian concepts of love and the body being the temple of God in the discussion.</p>
              <p>I share Weychin's concerns about the great influence of a religious leader, with or without referring to Pastor Rony Tan. If certain untruths about any one religion, not just on Buddhism is repeated, those untruths may eventually be known or accepted as truths.</p>

              <p>One will not become a true Buddhist just by chanting. Buddhism

              <p>1) They said it does not make sense to be vegetarian because
              vegetables are also living things. I have even come across a
              Christian who told me that animals have no feelings of pain. I do
              not know how many Christians out there share his view or only him.
              I asked him to go slaughtering house to have a look or he can
              ask vets why vets have to inject anesthesia on animals when
              operating on them.</p>
              <p>He told me why not Buddhists tell the wild animals not to kill
              each other for food. I told him let nature takes its course. If
              they have to kill each other, it is their karma.</p>
              <p>Correction : Vegetables are not within the rebirth cycle. They
              have no eyes, ears, nose, tongue etc.</p>
              <p>2) Their explanations of the presence of ghosts :</p>
              <p>There are no ghosts. What people see are demons disguise as our
              relatives.</p>
              <p>Another group of explanation (mainly methodists) for ghosts
              is the souls will not go to heaven or hell immediately after
              death. All the souls will be wondering around till the judgement
              day.</p>
              <p>My question is : If that is the case, some souls must have
              wandering around for at least 2000 years! Poor souls.</p>

              <p>1) I can only advice you to have compassion for animals. I don't kill fish, though sometimes I still kill mosquitoes (very very rarely now, sometimes I just let them off). Best is to avoid killing completely, since these beings are innocent.</p>
              <p>2) Yes, if you don't understand the sutras meaning, reading it even more is also not much use. If you want to understand Buddhism one must learn step by step with proper guidance. However since you are now Christian, I would not impose such things on people - it should be by their interest.</p>
              <p>3) Yes I do not think the 'root' thing applies for non-Buddhists.</p>

              <p>I doubt u know Buddhism very much from the ignorant comments you made. rote learning of sutra doesnt make one know about buddhism. anyone can do rote learning, even a 7 year old children, but do they understand the meaning? doubt so.</p>
