              <p>I am not so sure if pangu is from Taoism. Taoism originally is not a religion. its teachings just on yin and yang and the dao te ching. later it was mixed with all sort of mysticism in china.</p>
              <p>Brahma is a hindu god as Hinduism been in India long before Buddhism, so borrowed the brahma from Hinduism. Buddha did went up to the heaven where the Brahma resided. you have to read that sutra to understand. later the Brahma realised his folly and accept the Buddha's teachings I think.</p>

              <p>Brahma is a hindu god as Hinduism been in India long before Buddhism, so borrowed the brahma from Hinduism. Buddha did went up to the heaven where the Brahma resided. you have to read that sutra to understand. later the Brahma realised his folly and accept the Buddha's teachings I think.</p>

              <p>In Hinduism, the deity Brahma is known as the Creator, and is a member of a trinity of gods. The other two are Shiva the Destroyer and Vishnu the Preserver. Brahma is credited to be the source of the Vedas, hence you might have noticed him carrying a book representing the Vedas on one of his hands.</p>
              <p><br>The Hindu Brahma and the Buddhist Brahma(s) are quite different.<br>In Buddhism though, the Brahma have been described as a class (or classes) of higher level gods, and as opposed to Hindu beliefs there are many individual Brahma gods. One of the Brahmas known as Brahma-Sahampati was credited to have persuaded the newly enlightened Buddha to expound his teachings to the world.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" lang="sa-Latn">Baka BrahmÄ�</span></strong> (literally "crane-<span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" lang="sa-Latn">BrahmÄ�</span>") appears in the <a title="Majjhima Nikaya" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Majjhima_Nikaya"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Majjhima Nikaya</span></a>, where he is a deity who believes that his world is permanent and without decay (and that therefore he is immortal), and that therefore there are no higher worlds than his. The <a title="Gautama Buddha" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Buddha</span></a> refutes Baka's claims, relating the concept of <strong><a title="Impermanence" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Impermanence"><span style="color: #002bb8;">anitya</span></a></strong> or impermanence, but one of Baka's attendants (influenced by <a title="Mara (demon)" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Mara_(demon)"><span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" lang="sa-Latn"><span style="color: #002bb8;">MÄ�ra</span></span></a>) asserts that Baka is the Creator, that those who praise him will be rewarded, but those who deny his powers will be terribly punished. The Buddha identifies the real speaker as MÄ�ra, and states that he is free of his power.</p>
              <p>Baka then states that it is futile to escape his domain (which he imagines to be universal), and points out that if the Buddha depends upon any of the things within Baka's cognizance, he will be within his realm, and Baka can act upon him as he sees fit. The Buddha responds that Baka does have this much power, but that there are realms which Baka knows nothing of, and that the Buddha's knowledge places him beyond Baka's power. Baka is at last convinced by a display of the Buddha's superior magical power and his ability to explain his present situation by reference to his past lives.</p>
              <p>Baka was in a past life a human ascetic named Kesava; by various means he saved many people from destruction. For his meditative prowess he was born as a <a title="Buddhist cosmology" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology#B.E1.B9.9Bhatphala_worlds"><span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" lang="sa-Latn"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Bá¹›hatphala</span></span></a> deva, and in successive rebirths gradually sank through the levels of the <a title="Buddhist cosmology" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology#R.C5.ABpadh.C4.81tu"><span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" lang="sa-Latn"><span style="color: #002bb8;">RÅ«padhÄ�tu</span></span></a> until he became an ordinary BrahmÄ�.</p>
              <p>On another occasion, Baka believes that no monk or ascetic can enter his world (through supramundane powers of manifestation), but the Buddha himself and several of his disciples visit him to prove him wrong.</p>
              <p>Baka Brahma appears in the <em>Bakabrahma-sutta</em> and the <em>Brahmanimantanika-sutta</em>.</p>

              <p>From an old post, but I re-edited.</p>
              <p>There is a god who thought he was Creator, known as Maha Brahma. Maha Brahma was known to be "BrahmÄ�, Great BrahmÄ�,

                                      Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be".<br> <br> In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st 
                                                  Jhana plane, the
                                                                          first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There 
                                                  were higher realms

                                                   to the belief of
                                                                          such a notion that the Universe and its

                                                  Brahma, asked him
                                                                          questions which he could not answer. Eventually 
                                                  he has taken refuge
                                                                          in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br> <br> The Buddha was also known to have said this,<em><br> <br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why does he order such misfortune<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br> And he such inequity and injustice create?<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br> Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</em><br> <br> When the previous universe was destroyed and

Maha Brahma mistaken that he created them by his intentions, whereby it is actually due to the karmas of the previous being that they are born in that realm<em>. </em>There is no creator in Buddhism, no first cause, only conditioned genesis, dependent origination, karma, causes and conditions.<em><br></em></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Setting in Motion the Wheel of Truth</strong> <br><em>(Dhammacakkappavattana-Sutta</em><em>)</em>(1)<br>(The First Discourse of the Buddha)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(For seven weeks immediately following the enlightenment, the Buddha spent his time in lonely retreat. At the close of this period he decided to proclaim the doctrine (<em>Dhamma</em>), he had realized, to those five ascetics who were once struggling with him for enlightenment. Knowing that they were living at Isipatana (modern Sarnath), still steeped in the unmeaning rigours of extreme asceticism, the master left Gaya, where he attained enlightenment, for distant Varanasi, India's holy city. There at the Deer Park he rejoined them.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana (the Resort of Seers) near Varanasi (Benares). Then he addressed the group of five monks (<em>Bhikkhus</em>):</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">'Monks, these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life. (What are the two?) There is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy and unprofitable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata (The Perfect One) (2) has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to Nibbana. And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata….? It is the Noble Eightfold path, and nothing else, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. This is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata which gives vision, which gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment, and to Nibbana.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Noble Truth of Suffering (<em>Dukkha</em>), monks, is this: Birth is suffering, ageing is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with the unpleasant is suffering, dissociation from the pleasant is suffering, not to receive what one desires is suffering - in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Noble Truth of the Origin (cause) of Suffering is this: It is this craving (thirst) which produces re-becoming (rebirth) accompanied by passionate greed, and finding fresh delight now here, and now there, namely craving for sense pleasure, craving for existence and craving for non-existence (self-annihilation).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is this: It is the complete cessation of that very craving, giving it up, relinquishing it, liberating oneself from it, and detaching oneself from it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this: It is the Noble Eightfold Path, and nothing else, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. (3)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"This is the Noble Truth of Suffering": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before. "This suffering, as a noble truth, should be fully realized": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before. "This suffering, as a noble truth has been fully realized": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before.</span></p>

"This Origin of suffering as a noble truth has been eradicated": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"This is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the cessation of suffering": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before. "This Path leading to the cessation of suffering, as a noble truth, should be developed": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before. "This Path leading to the cessation of suffering, as a noble truth has been developed": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As long as my knowledge of seeing things as they really are, was not quite clear in these three aspects, in these twelve ways, concerning the Four Noble Truths (4), I did not claim to have realized the matchless, supreme Enlightenment, in this world with its gods, with its Maras and Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas, with its Devas and humans. But when my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was quite clear in these three aspects, in these twelve ways, concerning the Four Noble Truths, then I claimed to have realized the matchless, supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods, with its Maras and Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas, with its Devas and humans. And a vision of insight arose in me thus: "Unshakable is the deliverance of my heart. This is the last birth. Now there is no more re-becoming (rebirth)."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This the Blessed One said. The group of five monks was glad, and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the Venerable Kondanna the passion-free, stainless vision of Truth (<em>dhamma-cakkhu</em>; in other words, he attained <em>sotapatti</em>, the first stage of sanctity, and realized: 'whatever has the nature of arising, has the nature of ceasing.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Now when the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Truth, the <em>Bhummattha</em> devas (the earth deities) proclaimed: 'The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse, brahmana, deva, Mara, Brahma, or any one in the world, is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hearing these words of the earth deities, all the <em>Catummaharajika</em> devas proclaimed: 'The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse, brahmana, deva, Mara, Brahma, or any one in the world, is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi.' These words were heard in the upper deva realms, and from <em>Catummaharajika</em> it was proclaimed in <em>Tavatimsa... Yama... Tusita... Nimmanarati... Paranimmita-vasavatti... and the Brahmas of Brahma Parisajja... Brahma Purohita... Maha Brahma... Parittabha... Appamanabha... Abhassara... Parittasubha... Appa mana subha... Subhakinna... Vehapphala... Aviha... Atappa... Sudassa... Sudassi... </em>and in <em>Akanittha</em>: 'The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse, brahmana, deva, Mara, Brahma, or any one in the world, is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Thus at that very moment, at that instant, the cry (that the Wheel of Truth is set in motion) spread as far as Brahma realm, the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shook. A boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence (power) of devas appeared in the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Then the Blessed One uttered this paean of joy: 'Verily Kondanna has realized; verily Kondanna has realized (the Four Noble Truths).' Thus it was that the Venerable Kondanna received the name, '<em>Anna Kondanna</em>' - Kondanna who realizes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(With the proclamation of the Dhamma, for the first time, and with the conversion of the five ascetics, the Deer Park at Isipatana became the birth place of the Buddha's Dispensation (<em>Buddha-sasana</em>), and the Sangha, the community of monks, the ordained disciples.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Emperor Asoka, 281 years after the event, came on pilgrimage to this holy spot and caused a series of monuments and a commemorative pillar with the lion capital to be erected. This capital with its four magnificent lions upholding the 'Dharma Cakra', the 'Wheel of Dharma', now stands in the museum of Sarnath, and is today the official crest of India. The 'Dharma-Cakra' festival is still maintained in Sri Lanka.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Jawaharlal Nehru, the late prime Minister of India, writes: 'At Sarnath near Benares, I would almost see the Buddha preaching his first discourse, and some of his recorded words would come like a distant echo to me through two-thousand five hundred years. Asoka's pillars of stone with their inscriptions would speak to me in their magnificent language and tell me of a man who, though an emperor, was greater than any king or emperor.' <em>The Discovery of India</em> (The Signet Press, Calcutta), p. 44.</span></p>

              <p>BTW I would like to add regarding Brahma.. that I have a friend who is a Dzogchen practitioner a.k.a Vajrahridaya whose past life is actually a Brahma.</p>
              <p>I posted an article by him before in our forum which Thusness thinks is very well written: <a href="/forums/1728/topics/376891">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/376891</a></p>
              <p>He described being a vast and powerful God and time was entirely 
              different from the way we as humans consider it.  It felt very ancient, 
              from a human remembering the experience point of view. He also, at that point 
              though saw that there are infinite Brahmas and infinite universes.</p>
              <p>Because of his past life as a Brahma, he had a tendency for 
              God like pride and certain level experiences that reify a Godhead, or a 
              center of the universe type of thing, it's blissful, but he know it's not
               the realization of Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>He was into Hinduism previously and was able to enter very subtle states of samadhi and cosmic consciousness, but after recognising Rigpa and the truth of dependent origination through conversation with Buddhist teacher Loppon Namdrol and meeting his guru Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, he converted to Buddhism.</p>
