              <p>BTW I would like to add regarding Brahma.. that I have a friend
                                          who is a Dzogchen practitioner a.k.a Vajrahridaya whose past life
                                          is actually a Brahma.</p>
              <p>I posted an article by him before in our forum which Thusness
                                          thinks is very well written: <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/376891">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/376891</a></p>
              <p>He described being a vast and powerful God and time was entirely
                                          different from the way we as humans consider it. It felt very
                                          ancient, from a human remembering the experience point of view. He
                                          also, at that point though saw that there are infinite Brahmas and
                                          infinite universes.</p>
              <p>Because of his past life as a Brahma, he had a tendency for God
                                          like pride and certain level experiences that reify a Godhead, or a
                                          center of the universe type of thing, it's blissful, but he know
                                          it's not the realization of Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>He was into Hinduism previously and was able to enter very
                                          subtle states of samadhi and cosmic consciousness, but after
                                          recognising Rigpa and the truth of dependent origination through
                                          conversation with Buddhist teacher Loppon Namdrol and meeting his
                                          guru Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, he converted to Buddhism.</p>

              <p>I also have similar meditative experiences.</p>
              <p>My own opinion is that this may correspond to a higher jhana plane. In newage term (for newage guys reading this forum..), this may correspond to roughly the 6th density, of which the universe consist of roughly 8 layers of densities/dimension. From this plane, it is also possible to 'see' the purpose of reincarnation as the present physical form. Time is different from that plane as compared to this physical one is because that plane has access to all incarnations simultaneously, but the manifestation (of its intentions) must stepdown onto the lower planes.</p>
              <p>Beyond the 6th density, there is no mental formation to talk about or describe, in human terms.</p>
              <p>My understanding is that everybody will experience similar thing if they access a similar jhana plane. This plane although very fine by comparision to gross mental formation, can have a subtle sense-of-self, if its Beingness is not understood.</p>

May be you can ask your church to remove it if you don't like the sight of statue as you find them stupid.</p>

              <p>remarking on symbols,  Buddha statues has some kind of positive energy engendered in them due to the faith and sacredness of the worshippers... although it is said that Buddha statues are reminders of our innate Buddha nature and so on... but it could also be said that the statues themselves are also deep sources of blessings and can be indeed be considered inseparable from the Buddhas themselves. </p>

              <p><br>You are forgiven because you are being brainwashed by pastor like Rony Tan. Don't just listen to what is being said, observe, find out and think logically. To me, I also don't like the idea of salvation by grace and having both good and bad people in heaven, it makes no difference from earth. It does not sound logical to me as well.</p>
              <p>How to be happy if you are living in a palace with evil people around. Listen to Buddha, anybody can  be born in heaven, JUST BE GOOD. To be born in heaven is not the ultimate aim of Buddhists.</p>

              <p>No one will go to hell forever, just like no one will stay in heaven forever. In Buddhism, good and bad are well defined.</p>
              <p>Buddhists need not to be perfect to go to heaven or Buddha's Pureland but must  meet the  minimum requirements.  I shall not go into details on what are the minimum requirements as you are not a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>You are right, this world is complex. Your God is a loving God, He will not create a world full of sufferings, natural disasters and human beings who have no defence against diseases.</p>

              <p>you believe but I dun believe in god. creationist theories has been around since the ancient past for the past few thousand years, even earlier than christianity and judaism. science is starting to reveal the intracacies of the universe slowly and gradually. if you are interested, please read the post I posted recently on god idea by k sri dhammananda.</p>

              <p>Hi Iron Fist</p>
              <p>Great to see that you did apologise to the people on this forum for your harsh comment. Understand from your profile that you are from I Kuan Dao family.</p>
              <p>Anyway as an ex Christian, I do understand how you feel. You desire very much to convert the people to your new found faith. You are like a modern day "St Paul". However, do consider what the bible said,"  <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19:2&amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Proverbs 19:2</span></span></strong></a><br>It is not good to have <strong>zeal</strong> without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way." Next, Jesus overcome his enemies through his acts of love and compassion. Even in  <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:9&amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 12:9</span></span></strong></a> <strong>Love</strong> must be sincere. .James 2:26 ,"so faith without deeds is dead." Well is good that you consider living your new found faith life through your actions. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+4:12&amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Timothy 4:12</span></span></strong></a> ,"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in <strong>love</strong>, in faith and in purity."</p>
              <p>Hence I hope you will consider my suggestion to stop putting down other's belief despite of the fact that you disagree with it. Chinese has a good saying, the World is so big, there a lot of things which is beyond human comprehension.</p>
              <p>Recently I bounce into my ex church mate, who was trying to shuffle the gospel truth into me. Well as usual, I just smile and listen. Subsequently, she start to lead me into evangelical question and answer with the creation theory etc. I just told her, "Well you believe in a God creating this world. I need to respect your belief. It will not make a difference to me. Respect mean I can choose neither to disprove nor agree with you." She was confused and dumbfound. She just pray in tongue under her breathe. I ask her,"If one fine day, God told you there is no such place called HELL. Would you continue to LOVE and SERVE HIM." She could not really answer me but start to quote scripture. Perhaps she did not ever reflect on this controverse point.</p>
              <p>As Bishop John Sponge Shelby(Why Christianity must change)," most churches taught absolutism, there is little room for relativism." (available in the library).</p>
              <p>My 2 cents consideration. Do consider not to accept everything from the preacher as the gospel truth even they are from Mega Church capable of performing signs and wonders. Do learn and see the truth for yourself. There are many people attending churches for various motive. With this I end........</p>

              <p><br>I tell u no religion can have <strong>all </strong>their believers shutting up and nt slandering people.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My fav stall in boon lay market where i go buy meat She is a taoist and her son is a buddhist. He also tell his mom not to sell meat.</p>
              <p>she dun agree her son also scold. remember she is a toaist duabeigong. taoist do nt really believe in karma of killing animals. also scold each other's religion.</p>
              <p>funny right ?</p>
              <p>My church has one the old lady converted to christian but the family quarrel over buddhist or christian. both sides scold each other religion too.</p>
              <p>since the deceased has converted y dun respect her decisions.</p>
              <p>eventually the deceased do buddhist funeral because the family voted more on buddhsit funeral.</p>
              <p>they wanna do buddhist to make better conditions for rebirth., also ended up quarrelling.</p>
              <p>things do happen.</p>
              <p>my ex colleagues family quarrel over taoist or buddhist ritual too. also ended up scold each other religion.</p>
              <p>When there are religions they r bound to be conflicts.</p>
