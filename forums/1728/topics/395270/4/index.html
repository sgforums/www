              <p>Hi Iron Fist</p>
              <p>Great to see that you did apologise to the people on this forum for your harsh comment. Understand from your profile that you are from I Kuan Dao family.</p>
              <p>Anyway as an ex Christian, I do understand how you feel. You desire very much to convert the people to your new found faith. You are like a modern day "St Paul". However, do consider what the bible said,"  <a rel="nofollow" href="/passage/?search=Proverbs+19:2&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Proverbs 19:2</span></span></strong></a><br>It is not good to have <strong>zeal</strong> without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way." Next, Jesus overcome his enemies through his acts of love and compassion. Even in  <a rel="nofollow" href="/passage/?search=Romans+12:9&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 12:9</span></span></strong></a> <strong>Love</strong> must be sincere. .James 2:26 ,"so faith without deeds is dead." Well is good that you consider living your new found faith life through your actions. <a rel="nofollow" href="/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+4:12&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Timothy 4:12</span></span></strong></a> ,"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in <strong>love</strong>, in faith and in purity."</p>
              <p>Hence I hope you will consider my suggestion to stop putting down other's belief despite of the fact that you disagree with it. Chinese has a good saying, the World is so big, there a lot of things which is beyond human comprehension.</p>
              <p>Recently I bounce into my ex church mate, who was trying to shuffle the gospel truth into me. Well as usual, I just smile and listen. Subsequently, she start to lead me into evangelical question and answer with the creation theory etc. I just told her, "Well you believe in a God creating this world. I need to respect your belief. It will not make a difference to me. Respect mean I can choose neither to disprove nor agree with you." She was confused and dumbfound. She just pray in tongue under her breathe. I ask her,"If one fine day, God told you there is no such place called HELL. Would you continue to LOVE and SERVE HIM." She could not really answer me but start to quote scripture. Perhaps she did not ever reflect on this controverse point.</p>
              <p>As Bishop John Sponge Shelby(Why Christianity must change)," most churches taught absolutism, there is little room for relativism." (available in the library).</p>
              <p>My 2 cents consideration. Do consider not to accept everything from the preacher as the gospel truth even they are from Mega Church capable of performing signs and wonders. Do learn and see the truth for yourself. There are many people attending churches for various motive. With this I end........</p>

              <p>I hardly share gospel with people normally.</p>
              <p>so far i shared less than ten times.</p>
              <p>shared to all closed ppl in case of quarrelling.</p>
              <p>I already stop slandering buddhism but this issues appears to be growing.</p>

                              harmoniously?</span><br> <br> </span></span></strong>One common principle that mankind all over the 
                              world abides 
                                    by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A country may 
                              have different 
                                    religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, 
                              Catholicism, Christianity 
                                    or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition 
                              arising from 
                                    love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It
                               is a 
                                    good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the 
                              family members 
                                    bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to 
                              himself, 
                                    refrain from slandering or debating over each other’s faith, but 
                              mutually 
                                    respecting each other’s faith and character, then the family will 
                              naturally 
                                    be harmonious.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Further,
                               the younger 
                                    generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because
                               it is 
                                    their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose 
                              in arguing 
                                    with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we
                               do them 
                                    proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, 
                              well behaved, 
                                    and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be 
                              ideal. Otherwise, 
                                    it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and 
                              practise 
                                    Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences 
                              in religions 
                                    and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the 
                              family 
                                    will be harmonious.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br>

                               and faith. 
                                    No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to 
                              only believe 
                                    in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that 
                              particular 
                                    faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their children’s 
                              marriages, 
                                    the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties 
                              and how 
                                    to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. 
                              Religion and 
                                    faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the 
                              marriage that 
                                    matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel 
                              their children 
                                    about the code of family ethics, such as the role and 
                              responsibilities of 
                                    a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they
                               do not 
                                    know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as
                               husband 
                                    and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in 
                              Buddhism, 
                                    the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the 
                              choice partner 
                                    believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the 
                              teachings 
                                    of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of 
                              course, be 
                                    good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism.
                               If, meanwhile 
                                    that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of
                               loving-kindness, 
                                    compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the 
                              son-in-law 
                                    or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the 
                              same faith 
                                    and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating 
                              together 
                                    and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better 
                              if they 
                                    were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> </span>

                                    in all your endeavours. It may be because your husband has formed 
                              an affinity 
                                    with Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva that he worships Avalokitesvara

                                    in the Taoist way. According to the sutra of the Universal Door 
                              Chapter 
                                    of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, “If a person can only be guided or

                                    by a government official, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva shall

                                    guided or saved by embracing another religion, Avalokitesvara 
                              Bodhisattva 
                                    shall manifest as a person of that same religion to explain the

                                    him.” Your husband prays to the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and yet
                               
                                    he believes in Taoism. In this case we may consider him as a

                                    has embraced another religion, but has formed an affinity with

                                    Bodhisattva. Someday, when he understands the truth based on this

                                    he may embrace Buddhism.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">You

                                    husband will be delighted when he hears this, and may feel 
                              positive about 
                                    your Teacher and your faith. In this way, one day, he may come to 
                              take refuge 
                                    in the Three Treasures and embrace Buddhism.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">On the

                                    you should not say, “My Teacher commented that you are no good and
                               
                                    you are a believer of an unorthodox religion.” Your husband may be
                               
                                    so angered by such a remark that the next time I conduct a Dharma 
                              talk, 
                                    he may forbid you to attend. Hence, we have to be perfectly

                                    and harmonious in the way we deal with all matters (being

              <p>Hi Iron Fist</p>
              <p>Great to see that you did apologise to the people on this forum for your harsh comment. Understand from your profile that you are from I Kuan Dao family.</p>
              <p>Anyway as an ex Christian, I do understand how you feel. You desire very much to convert the people to your new found faith. You are like a modern day "St Paul". However, do consider what the bible said,"  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19:2&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Proverbs 19:2</span></span></strong></a><br>It is not good to have <strong>zeal</strong> without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way." Next, Jesus overcome his enemies through his acts of love and compassion. Even in  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:9&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 12:9</span></span></strong></a> <strong>Love</strong> must be sincere. .James 2:26 ,"so faith without deeds is dead." Well is good that you consider living your new found faith life through your actions. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+4:12&amp;amp;version=NIV"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Timothy 4:12</span></span></strong></a> ,"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in <strong>love</strong>, in faith and in purity."</p>
              <p>Hence I hope you will consider my suggestion to stop putting down other's belief despite of the fact that you disagree with it. Chinese has a good saying, the World is so big, there a lot of things which is beyond human comprehension.</p>
              <p>Recently I bounce into my ex church mate, who was trying to shuffle the gospel truth into me. Well as usual, I just smile and listen. Subsequently, she start to lead me into evangelical question and answer with the creation theory etc. I just told her, "Well you believe in a God creating this world. I need to respect your belief. It will not make a difference to me. Respect mean I can choose neither to disprove nor agree with you." She was confused and dumbfound. She just pray in tongue under her breathe. I ask her,"If one fine day, God told you there is no such place called HELL. Would you continue to LOVE and SERVE HIM." She could not really answer me but start to quote scripture. Perhaps she did not ever reflect on this controverse point.</p>
              <p>As Bishop John Sponge Shelby(Why Christianity must change)," most churches taught absolutism, there is little room for relativism." (available in the library).</p>
              <p>My 2 cents consideration. Do consider not to accept everything from the preacher as the gospel truth even they are from Mega Church capable of performing signs and wonders. Do learn and see the truth for yourself. There are many people attending churches for various motive. With this I end........</p>

              <p>hi reborn76,</p>
              <p>i like that about you saying "not disprove nor agree" .  It is a good way to handle proselytising... trying to explain more creates more hassles.</p>
              <p>and also your point on if "there is no Hell,would one continue to ...", yes, this comment jus struck me.  it is probably true that this is one of the main basis on which the belief is maintained...fear</p>
              <p>i'm curious why u decided to convert out of christianity, if it is not too private to share...</p>

              <p>Ironfist,</p>
              <p>I think son asking mother not to sell meat is not in the same category as attacking another religion.  So is the family disagreements about funeral type and religion-pursuits etc... these belong to private affairs of others. Family members, i should say, have a larger interest-vested in the affairs of each other, and that is why they disagree out of concern for one another. they are more concerned with the other person's choices and path, rather than the tenets of the belief per se. i'm not saying i agree with this but then, it is more commonplace and understandable.</p>
              <p>However, attacking a whole religion and its beliefs is involving alot of people you dun even know and goes beyond the personal level, it is potentially very splitist and creates alot of problems for many people.  It is not a responsible act.</p>
              <p>If one wishes to make critical remarks on another religion, the main criteria is that one should understand the other religion thoroughly.  If one understands thoroughly, then remarks that help to improve the other religion and point out flaws and so forth are highly appreciated by open-minded people. </p>
              <p>However, if one is just jumpng on the band-wagon and blindly criticizing something they dun understand, which is not constructive, mis-informed and illogical then of course, you are going to have to be whacked hard by the feedback.</p>

              <p>Precisely, at EH Ironfist claimed that he was an ex Buddhist who chanted Heart Sutra but from the posts he has posted, it seems that he has no basic knowledge of Buddhism. It is the trend now that most of the  christian converts claim to be an ex-Buddhist. LOL.</p>
              <p>Most of my close relatives are Christians. Let me share with you the common misconceptions that they have. They  got the misconceptions from their religious leaders :</p>
              <p>1) It is impossible to be as perfect as Buddha, thus Buddhists can never achieve our aim.</p>
              <p>Correction : As I mentioned before, there is no need to be as perfect as Buddha in order to go to Buddha's Pureland but must meet the minimum requirements.</p>
              <p>2) Based on the law of reincarnation, one must kill a human being in order to be reborn as a human being.</p>
              <p>I know there are many pastors preaching these. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Those pastors are twisting Buddha's teachings to suit their needs.</p>
              <p>3) Buddha was only a human being not God. Thus, not as powerful as God.</p>
              <p>Correction : Buddha was a "special" human being. He was enlightened. My question is :Aren't Jesus was born as human being ?</p>
              <p>4) When miracles happen to Buddhists or prayers being answered. They told me  Satan and demons can also perform miracles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many more, just quoted the above 4 examples to show how other religious leaders distort Buddha's teachings.</p>

Yet at times a diversity of religion and faith can exist within the family circle. The spirit of Buddhism advocates a freedom of choice, tolerance and mutual respect, for what good is there if there is religious homogeneity but a stark absence of happiness and bliss in the family? The key is practising the code of family ethics, compassion and loving-kindness and even if through these, others are not persuaded to the realm of Buddhism, let it be. Happiness and bliss, after all, is what all humanity seeks.</span></em></span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Happy Family</span></strong></span>         <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em><span style="color: #009900;"><strong>Mutual respect begets harmony</strong></span><br><br></em></span></strong></em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #cc3300;">How may a family whose members have different religions live together harmoniously?</span><br><br></span></span></strong>One common principle that mankind all over the world abides by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A country may have different religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each other’s faith, but mutually respecting each other’s faith and character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Further, the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be harmonious.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span><br><br>        <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em><span style="color: #009900;">Freedom in choice of religion<br><br></span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #cc3300;">If the children of a Buddhist family choose to marry a person of a different faith, will the marriage work out well?</span></span></span></strong></span><br><br></strong>Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary that his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote and encourage our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot force it upon them. Moreover, we should not object to their marriage just because their partners are from a different faith.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In this present age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his or her own lifetime partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of choice of religion and faith. No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to only believe in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that particular faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their children’s marriages, the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion and faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the marriage that matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel their children about the code of family ethics, such as the role and responsibilities of a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they do not know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism, the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the choice partner believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the teachings of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of course, be good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of loving-kindness, compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the son-in-law or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the same faith and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating together and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"><br><br></span>        <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em><span style="color: #009900;">Perfect harmony amid differences<br><br></span></em></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #cc3300;">I have embraced Buddhism and taken refuge in the Three Treasures, but my husband still adopts the Taoist way of praying to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Guan-yin Pu-sa), what should I do?</span></span></span></strong></span></strong><br><br>Actually, while you believe in Buddhism, you still have to learn to be harmonious in all your endeavours. It may be because your husband has formed an affinity with Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva that he worships Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in the Taoist way. According to the sutra of the Universal Door Chapter of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, “If a person can only be guided or saved by a government official, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva shall manifest as a government official to explain the Dharma to him. If a person can only be guided or saved by a king of ghosts, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva shall manifest as a king of ghosts to explain the Dharma to him. If a person can only be guided or saved by embracing another religion, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva shall manifest as a person of that same religion to explain the Dharma to him.” Your husband prays to the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and yet he believes in Taoism. In this case we may consider him as a person who has embraced another religion, but has formed an affinity with Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. Someday, when he understands the truth based on this affinity, he may embrace Buddhism.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You should compliment your husband; “I am indeed fortunate to meet a person like you. I have spoken to my Teacher about you and he says that you are a good man. You are devoted and in future many good things will happen to you.” Your husband will be delighted when he hears this, and may feel positive about your Teacher and your faith. In this way, one day, he may come to take refuge in the Three Treasures and embrace Buddhism.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">On the other hand, you should not say, “My Teacher commented that you are no good and you are a believer of an unorthodox religion.” Your husband may be so angered by such a remark that the next time I conduct a Dharma talk, he may forbid you to attend. Hence, we have to be perfectly rounded (flexible?) and harmonious in the way we deal with all matters (being harmonious even among differences).<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However, although he worships the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in that manner, you ought not to harbour such thought that, “since my husband worships the Bodhisattva as a Taoist, perhaps I should do likewise.”</span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span>     <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/contpage2.htm"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/back2.gif" alt="" width="72" height="28"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3d.htm"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/next2.gif" alt="" width="64" height="28"></a>   <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ff6600;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/bdigest.htm"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/txt_Question.gif" alt="" width="507" height="37"></a></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <h3>Miracles</h3>
              <p>Christians claim that miracles are sometimes performed in God's name and
               that the fact
              that this happens proves that God exists. This is an appealing argument 
              until it is looked at
              a little more closely.</p>
              <p>While Christians are quick to claim that because of their prayers the 
              blind could see, the
              deaf could hear and crooked limbs were straightened, they are very slow 
              in producing
              evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some Christians are so 
              anxious to prove that
              miracles have occurred at their prayer meetings that the truth often 
              gets lost in a flood of
              wild claims, extravagant boasts, and sometimes even conscious lies.</p>
              <p>It is true that things which are unusual and difficult to explain do 
              sometimes happen
              during religious events - but not just for Christians. Hindus, Muslims, 
              Taoists, etc. all
              claim that their God or gods sometimes perform miracles. Christianity 
              certainly does not
              have a monopoly on miracles. So, if miracles performed in God's name 
              prove the
              existence of the Christian God, then miracles performed in the name of 
              numerous other
              gods must likewise prove that they too exist.</p>
              <p>Christians may try to overcome this fact by claiming that, when miracles
               occur in other
              religions, they are done through the power of the Devil. Perhaps the 
              best way to counter
              this claim is to quote the Bible. When Jesus healed the sick, his 
              enemies accused him of
              doing this through the power of the Devil. He answered that healing the 
              sick results in
              good and if the Devil went around doing good he would destroy himself 
              (Mk 3:22-26).
              Therefore the same could be said for the miracles performed by Hindus, 
              Jews or Sikhs. If
              these miracles result in good, how can they be the work of the Devil?</p>

              <p>1) It is impossible to be as perfect as Buddha, thus Buddhists can never achieve our aim.</p>
              <p>Correction : As I mentioned before, there is no need to be as perfect as Buddha in order to go to Buddha's Pureland but must meet the minimum requirements.</p>
              <p>2) Based on the law of reincarnation, one must kill a human being in order to be reborn as a human being.</p>
              <p>I know there are many pastors preaching these. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Those pastors are twisting Buddha's teachings to suit their needs.</p>
              <p>3) Buddha was only a human being not God. Thus, not as powerful as God.</p>
              <p>Correction : Buddha was a "special" human being. He was enlightened. My question is :Aren't Jesus was born as human being ?</p>
              <p>4) When miracles happen to Buddhists or prayers being answered. They told me  Satan and demons can also perform miracles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many more, just quoted the above 4 examples to show how other religious leaders distort Buddha's teachings.</p>

              <p>Dawnfirstlight,</p>
              <p>One of the problems of our local Buddhist community, here I'm generalising abit, is the lack of emphasis on widespread education on the dharma.  Truly, we can also blame ourselves for it.  That these ex-Buddhists have such mistaken opinions can be largely linked to our own failure to propagate the dharma clearly and in a widespread fashion.</p>
              <p>This is also why i appreciate this forum becos at least it is trying to give Netizens a clearer picture thru articles n discussions.  B4 this, i frankly felt that in Singapore not many was trying to really find out abt the actual teachings of Buddha and actualise them.   Many of those who found out may easily slip into intellectualisation due to lack of practice or teachers to help them.</p>

              others.  It is our responsibility. </p>
              <p>The future of Buddhism does not only rest in the hands of great
              teachers and preachers but also depends on us common people to help
              spread the teachings by giving correct and accurate info where it
              is needed. Not in a pushy and proselytising manner to convert
              others, but to anyone who has queries, who needs, who
              misunderstands. </p>
              <p>Most especially if the person is already a Buddhist, to give
              them info that clarifies their path is important and it is very
              meritorious.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with the above, especially the one about the important role of lay Buddhists like us in spreading the Dharma as far as we can, with the right attitude to anyone who wishes to know or who misunderstands.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do. Especially to free thinkers. Most of my friends are
              surprised that I am a devoted Buddhist because I don't look like
              one who chants.</p>
              <p>Most of them do not know much about the true law of
              reincarnation. They thought the aim of being a Buddhist
              is to have a better rebirth which we Buddhists know that it is
              not the case.</p>
              <p>Free thinkers and Christians I know have never heard of
              Amitabha's Pureland till I told them. Some were surprised that
              é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›was a Buddha. They told me they always heard the monks said
              é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½› in the movie but do not know what it is. I even showed
              them the picture of Amitabha.</p>
              <p>I have even tried to talk to the Yi Kuan Dao but I
              find it very difficult because to them, Yi Kuan Dao and Buddhism
              are the same. So I let them be because I believe they will come to
              know about true Buddhism in their next life as they also pray to
              Goddess of Mercy and Maitreya.</p>

              <p>I wish I had met Buddhists like you when my family was half Buddhist, half taoist many years ago.</p>
              <p>You even tried to talk to Yi Guan Dao? That's really some courage there. By the way from what I have researched about Yi Guan Dao, the followers seem to believe in a Supreme God which is in every aspect above Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p>

              <p>Ironfist,</p>
              <p>I think son asking mother not to sell meat is not in the same category as attacking another religion.  So is the family disagreements about funeral type and religion-pursuits etc... these belong to private affairs of others. Family members, i should say, have a larger interest-vested in the affairs of each other, and that is why they disagree out of concern for one another. they are more concerned with the other person's choices and path, rather than the tenets of the belief per se. i'm not saying i agree with this but then, it is more commonplace and understandable.</p>
              <p>However, attacking a whole religion and its beliefs is involving alot of people you dun even know and goes beyond the personal level, it is potentially very splitist and creates alot of problems for many people.  It is not a responsible act.</p>
              <p>If one wishes to make critical remarks on another religion, the main criteria is that one should understand the other religion thoroughly.  If one understands thoroughly, then remarks that help to improve the other religion and point out flaws and so forth are highly appreciated by open-minded people. </p>
              <p>However, if one is just jumpng on the band-wagon and blindly criticizing something they dun understand, which is not constructive, mis-informed and illogical then of course, you are going to have to be whacked hard by the feedback.</p>
              <p>There are many subtle differences between different courses of actions, dun just lump everything (that seems superfically similar) together when you make judgements.  You shd question and consider clearly.</p>

              <p>Precisely, at EH Ironfist claimed that he was an ex Buddhist who chanted Heart Sutra but from the posts he has posted, it seems that he has no basic knowledge of Buddhism. It is the trend now that most of the  christian converts claim to be an ex-Buddhist. LOL.</p>
              <p>Most of my close relatives are Christians. Let me share with you the common misconceptions that they have. They  got the misconceptions from their religious leaders :</p>
              <p>1) It is impossible to be as perfect as Buddha, thus Buddhists can never achieve our aim.</p>
              <p>Correction : As I mentioned before, there is no need to be as perfect as Buddha in order to go to Buddha's Pureland but must meet the minimum requirements.</p>
              <p>2) Based on the law of reincarnation, one must kill a human being in order to be reborn as a human being.</p>
              <p>I know there are many pastors preaching these. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Those pastors are twisting Buddha's teachings to suit their needs.</p>
              <p>3) Buddha was only a human being not God. Thus, not as powerful as God.</p>
              <p>Correction : Buddha was a "special" human being. He was enlightened. My question is :Aren't Jesus was born as human being ?</p>
              <p>4) When miracles happen to Buddhists or prayers being answered. They told me  Satan and demons can also perform miracles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many more, just quoted the above 4 examples to show how other religious leaders distort Buddha's teachings.</p>

              <p>I indeed chanted it before. all 32 chapters of diamond sutra and heart sutra.</p>
              <p>The problem is my grandma asked me to do ah.</p>
              <p>she guided me with the recitation.</p>
              <p> when i young i also gt bow to buddha ah. my grandma gt bring me go buddhist places.</p>
              <p>refuge i think my grandma when i young gt bring me take refuge. my parents no religion so they din care.</p>
              <p>I gt no buddhist knowledge. I so young that time.</p>
              <p>But sometimes i am really angry when i met my buddhist frenz or relatvies they challoenged me to solve Koan .</p>
              <p>they do scold me sometimes. I din even <strong>evangelise</strong> them.</p>
