               the teachings visualize that each of us is in a mandala and we are all 
              Dakas and Dakinis and the teachings are from the Buddha. Unsurpassable

               moment needs to be infused with this awareness of transformed world. 
              You will leave with a sacred outlook. We go into retreat to practice - 
              it’s not a school. Interaction with sangha and teacher, the teachings, 
              prayers, meditation –is all practice.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Doha
               is the Sanskrit word for Vajra Song. These songs are mystical songs 
              written by those in the state of Dharmakaya mind.  The following 
              commentary is on the Doha called the Words of Dzogchen.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Dzogchen
               teachings are vast. They describe the pervasive reality of the essence 
              of all things. Universal essence. Oneness, not plural. The nature of 
              reality which never changes. The Primordial Buddha. Buddha is not a 
              person at all. From Dzogchen perspective, it’s the Dharma of the 
              concept. Lonchenpa is one of the great lamas of Dzogchen.  He says that 
              once we realize Dzogchen we are on the top of the mountain. You can see 
              all the other mountains and you understand the essence and wisdom of all
               the teachings. You can never understand the nature of reality unless 
              you’re on the Dzogchen path.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Once
               you realize the Buddha Samantabhadra, you are free from suffering. 
              Samantabhadra is the self-arising Buddha. No biography. No Colors.  
              Realizing your own true nature – rigpa – that pervades all existence. 
              Nirvana and Samsara, gods and sentients beings, hatred and loved. All is
               the manifestation of Buddha Samantabhadra. If you get this, you’d be 
              out dancing and singing instead of sitting here in painful lotus 
              position!<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Utopian
               spiritual abstractions? Seems like it because we are bound to our 
              ordinary conceptions. We’re obscured by deeply rooted karmic imprints in
               our consciousness through countless lifetimes. We’re trying to clean 
              this big mess through meditation, retreats, sadhanas. They all help to 
              overcome this tendency of egoism and karmic obscurations. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">We
               don’t have to go anywhere, be anywhere to experience dharmata, rigpa. 
              Everywhere is actually Dharmata paradise. All beings are Buddha 
              Samantabhadra in immeasurable miraculous reality.  Humans, especially 
              those who are seeking spiritual nirvana, are in a hurry to attain 
              enlightenment. To run away from suffering by transcending their body or 
              their life. Samsara – and nirvana – are not outside. They are in our 
              consciousness. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">One
               of the vows you take at Dzogchen initiation is to believe that samsara 
              is not real. That’s one of the reasons that Dzogchen practitioners are 
              the happiest people. All matters.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Look for Samsara. You can’t find it. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Dzogchen
               is a way of abiding in Rigpa or Buddha awareness. Self-arising 
              awareness. Not an ordinary awareness. It exists already in your 
              consciousness. Not produced by mantras…it’s simply there. Like Mount 
              Rainier behind the clouds. Rigpa is behind the ego and mental 
              obscuration of the 84,000 kleshas. Buddha mind is always with you even 
              when you’re angry or suffering or depressed which comes from self-hatred
               and not realizing your true nature. When you’re judgmental against 
              yourself, you’re judgmental against all others. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">We
               can always go to Rigpa to rest. Great Dzogchen lamas welcome tragedies.
               We’re tragedy phobics – that’s why we depend so much on insurance. 
              We’re constantly running from tragedy. Without suffering, there’s no 
              dharma. It provides us the opportunity to cultivate the noble path. 
              Tragedy is not the enemy that we perceive it to be.  It also is a 
              manifestation of our consciousness. It enhances our practice.  It’s 
              sharpens our meditation and realization.  If you realize you have rigpa 
              while you're suffering any more enlightened, you are free from Samsara.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Timeless Time<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">State
               of consciousness which transcends time.  Time does not exist. We can’t 
              experience timeless time when we’re caught up in the past and future. 
              Rigpa is a momentary experience similar to a momentary sensation. It is 
              the present awareness of the realization of everything.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Timeless Awareness<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The
               past and future only exist in the relative world.  The ultimate truth 
              is the Dharmadatu. In the realm of relative truth there is the existence
               of time birth and death.  We are tormented by these beliefs. Time, as 
              well as ego, passed, and future He is illusory in the realm of rigpa. 
              You abide in the single present moment. There is neither Good nor bad, 
              samsara or nirvana, meditator or ego. Only constant awareness; wisdom 
              time.  Beyond any conception.  The present time is the primordial time. 
               The suffering.  We are living in this time every moment. When we get 
              distracted we grasp to the illusory objects as if they were real. We 
              project into the future and create anxiety.  There is no future.  This 
              is the only moment that exists. This is the present and last moment. 
              Belief in the future is a difficult habit to break.  This can only be 
              experienced through meditation.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The Ground<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">The ground of all things is not nirvana, not samsara, happiness or suffering, good or bad.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Beyond
               conceptual understanding. Nirvana is an idea.  The ground is not an 
              idea.  It exists every moment ... the awareness we are experiencing 
              right now. The ground of all things is the source of all things. Where 
              all things dissolve eventually. Everything, positive or negative, is 
              manifestation of the zhi-awareness that is residing in all of us. 
              Luminous consciousness. Free of concepts. The source of samsara and 
              nirvana is present in each of us every moment. Our supreme consciousness
               has 1) mental obscurations (sees objects as solid) and 2) is free of 
              all conditions; peaceful. When we experience our fantasy thoughts and 
              get caught up in them, there is also Buddha mind, utterly pure and 
              luminous. All conflicting emotions arise from the ground and dissolve 
              back into the ground. There is no duality between what arises and the 
              ground. Everything is you. “I’m the Buddha and I’m the sentient being”. 
              “I’m the Everything”. I’m the earth &amp; I’m the Heaven.” Once realized
               or glimpsed, there is nothing more to realize. It’s what Buddha 
              realized.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">No
               truth to be realized no samsara to be rejected. Liberation is not a 
              place or condition that you can acquire. All the effort of running from 
              something we don’t want or running to something we think we want is 
              pointless. By realizing shi we can have the ultimate rest. The ultimate 
              vacation. Liberation is very simple. Rest. Retired forever. Not 
              tormented by exertion and effort. Even great meditators sometimes 
              overexert and strive too hard for enlightenment. Exertion itself is 
              suffering; egoism.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Dzogchen
               talks of four levels of meditation. All phenomena is exhausted, 
              dissolved in the place of Dharmatu. Chiusasa – the highest level. There 
              are living masters who have arrived at that level of realization. 
              Literally living in a different dimension. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">You
               can always remain in the state of zhi even through the six bardos of 
              sleeping, meditating, dying. You no longer are trying to choose one 
              condition or another. Everything is equal manifestation of the ground. 
              No judgments, no preferences. While living in the awareness you purify 
              your karma.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Mind
               is not mind. It is luminous awareness. So taught the Buddha. 
              Consciousness cannot be grasped. Like god, it cannot be comprehended. 
              Inexpressible. It is the essence of the Buddha mind in all of us – our 
              true identity. Everything else is illusory. You are not your blue jeans.
               That would be quite sad if you identified with your tee-shirt or blue 
              jeans. But that is what we are doing. Our body was no different from the
               blue jeans.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">What
               is different from personality and Buddha nature? Personality is a 
              collection of your perceptions, ideas, projections, political and social
               preferences, gender and so on. Dzogchen goes beyond-breaks down –this 
              ego-structure so we can actualize our true essence of the Buddha 
              Samantabhadra. Divine pride (different from ordinary pride) is to be 
              convinced that we are Buddha Samantabhadra. Knowing that we are already 
              the Buddha. How to realize this? We must go beyond the current 
              ego-structure.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Enlightenment
               is not a place to go or to become. It’s an awakening to our tru essence
               of Buddha Samantabhadra. There is an original face prior to birth and 
              kleshas and suffering. Gzhi rigpa awareness; clear light awareness.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Empty
               your consciousness; be ready. Then when the Dzogchen teachings are 
              given, a person can recognize this nature. Remember the times during 
              teachings when you have completely let go of fear of death, fear of 
              letting go of ego. Wisdom of enlightened wisdom is non-attachment. 
              Source of all freedom, awareness, dignity, integrity, knowledge. Letting
               go of attachments to possessions and ideas, pride, ego, concepts about 
              even dharma, enlightenment. Practice “No Dzogchen Dzogchen”. Buddhism 
              beyond Buddhism. Transcends. Universal. <br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Ground Dzogchen. “No Dzogchen Dzogchen”. All pervasive, pure awareness. The true essence. Timeless reality, non-duality.<br></span></div>

              and commitments in order to manifest the ground. Transformation is

               is a mental process to develop the transcendent nature mind. 
              Conventional meditation is analytical. It requires constant effort to 
              chase after something. In Dzogchen meditation, no exertion should be 
              made. Rather to rest in the natural state of consciousness. It comes 
              naturally. Completely content in the present moment. You don’t look for 
              anything else. Nature of consciousness is already enlightened. Rest in 
              the treasure house of all attributes the highest Buddha paradise. 
              Meditation chases after you as if you have an aura which is always with 
              you. You don’t restrain yourself. It arises naturally. However, this is 
              not easy. All worry, hatred, anger drops away.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Chant
               Hum. Everything, the universe becomes of the nature of hum. Visualize 
              from your heart, fire that consumes the ego-related ideas, forms &amp; 
              concepts. When you are no longer able to sustain the posture, lie down 
              on the floor and rest in the non-conceptual mind.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Vajrayana
               means diamond path. Diamond means precious and indestructible. There is
               a diamond-like Buddha entity in all of us. Personality and ego are 
              illusory, not real. Therefore not permanent. Realization of this nature 
              mind comes about unexpectedly. <br></span></div>

               is the root of samsara. We are obscured by mental conditions. Ma rigpa.
               No light of awareness; delusional, temporarily stained. This becomes 
              rooted in our mind (Bakchaks). That’s not who we are. Not the real 
              consciousness. Dharma is a cleansing of the obscurations. Like the 
              clouds moving away from the mountain. Burdens of habitual tendencies 
              take a long time to overcome.<br></span></div>

               mind begins to polarize objects as appearances. Everything is 
              miraculous appearance. The dualistic mind sees them as separate from our
               conscious. External, objectives, attachments, aversion, grasping, 
              aversion and attachment. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Everything
               is appearance. “It’s Happening”. It’s neither good nor bad. It’s 
              happening. Rain or shine, “It’s raining”. Neither favorable or 
              unfavorable.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">You
               see an object then separate it form yourself not realizing it is part 
              of the supreme source. This can get expensive. You feel attachment and 
              fear that someone will take the object. You label things naming things 
              that are unnamable. This is the greatest sin! Original sin. That’s when 
              you fall from the heaven of Dharmatu. Instead, experience the oneness 
              between you and the object.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Enlightenment
               can occur suddenly when there’s synchronicity. When you become 
              exhausted in the infantile dharma. Striving for enlightenment “out 
              there” is based on dualism. This is infantile. Allow yourself to be 
              exhausted. (The vajra posture is designed to allow this physical and 
              mental exhaustion.) Then the realization can be spontaneous. Buddhism is
               a hard work religion. But Dzogchen uses language like ‘allow yourself 
              to be exhausted’. We’ve been working hard spiritually through countless 
              lifetimes. Running a spiritual marathon during meditation instead of 
              completely immersing yourself in the relaxation. <br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Ask
               yourself what you are trying to gain. There is no great meaning of 
              Life. Right here, right now is the meaning of life. Our ego is always 
              trying to succeed at something. Constant striving for the future to fill
               the emptiness and loneliness we’re trying to run from. All we look for 
              is already residing within. The true essence, the true awareness, is in 
              all of us.<br></span></div>

               – ground; rigpa; source of all. Like air. Self-arising awareness. All 
              inner and outer phenomena arise and dissolve into it. Make prostration 
              to everything. All is manifestation of the Buddha. Pay homage and honor 
              EVERYTHING. Even illness and tragedy.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Sit
               in lotus posture. Vajra mudra. Imagine the central channel from the

               palms on knees. This is the mudra of resting in awareness of 
              unconditioned consciousness. Rest; relax, demonstrates the most

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Keep
               body straight for synchronizing central channel. Consciousness is 
              therefore straight. Awakening mind can arise spontaneously. Initiated as
               noble sun or daughter by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. If not straight, 
              prana energy will be imbalanced. Sitting in Vajra posture is a very 
              subtle art. Very subtle movement makes huge difference in subjective 
              balance in your meditation.<br></span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Outer
               Sky is the empty space around us. Blue sky. Vast space. You must stare.
               Eyes as wide as you can. Simply look at space in front of you. Thoughts
               arise. You don’t judge them or reject them or get attracted to good 
              thoughts no matter how transcendent. Our duty is to be the observer. To 
              witness. To simply observe. You may experience pain or emotional 
              dullness. Regard all as equally clear.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;">Experience
               the one taste. Truly liberating. The peacefulness experienced is called
               Inner Sky. From which you can experience Buddha mind. You can see 
              through walls and see different dimensions. Love grows for all sentient 
              begins and you can embrace all living beings. <br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If
               you find yourself attached to an emotion, use “PHAT” loudly with all 
              your strength to shake up, cut through. To bring back to awareness. That
               awareness is called the Secret Sky.</span></p>
