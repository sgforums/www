            <div class='col-md body'>You are right that 37 prerequisites of enlightenment, including the 8 fold path, can be found in all orthodox Buddhist traditions.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You have made a good distinction between the Nikaya &amp; non-Nikaya but what do all these different traditions have in common that makes them Buddhist? There are a number of factors that all orthodox Buddhist schools share. The Buddha outlined 37 factors which he considered prerequisites to enlightenment. They are known in the Pali Canon as the bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma, the Wings to Awakening. As they are common to the Foundational Vehicle (The Dalai Lama now uses "Foundational Vehicle" in preference to "Hinayana" which has derogatory connotations) &amp; the other schools it not incorrect to say that the other schools are based on the Foundational Vehicle. These factors are what distinguish Buddhism from other religions.</span></div>

The 37 prerequisites of enlightenment is a gradual path. However to say that we can totally ignore is also incorrect. Not everyone has the capacity to practise the sudden path, I must say that even I am a gradual person, otherwise I would have been awakened by now, isn't it? However we should not mix them up together.<br><br><blockquote>If you just paid more attention to Mahayana scripture ,you will not find alot of reference on making the Bodhi vows<br><br>whereas for 52 stage of Bodhisattva<br>dont quote becos u think it is deep <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></blockquote>My purpose for posting the 52 stages of Bodhisattva is not bcos it is chim, but to give people a general understanding of Bodhisattva cultivation, as I have seldom posted anything on Mahayana. I am not a Bodhisattva, so if they want to practise, they should also find a Bodhisattva teacher. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway I don't think it is very chim. It is much more difficult to put them into practise.</div>
