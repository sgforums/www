I agree with this.<br><br>However don't you think it is difficult to be completely pure prior to realising prajna wisdom/attaining awakening? (i.e realising non-birth).

As fan shen tong ju tu is able to link with Ji guang jing tu. it's inconcievable. that mean beings in fan shen tong ju tu although their karma is still intact, yet they enjoy the abilities of 8th bhumi! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>/\<br></div></blockquote>As you have already said, there is still a difference between 'Fan' and 'Sheng' even though they live together, so how can it be said that everyone is 8th bhumi? Even though everyone may share the abilities of 8th Bhumi, there is definitely differences still in terms of wisdom, for example.<br><br>Anyway reminds me of some something. If a person's self-power is not strong, he will have to rely on other-power. However to rely on other-power implies that at death, there is still Antara-bhava (7th consciousness) to be delivered by Amitabha Buddha. On the other hand, a person who's self-power is enough, who is able to liberate from birth and death, may enter instantaneously into Ji guang jing tu - his antarabhava (7th consciousness) dissolves like a drop of rainwater enters the great ocean. Is there possibility of coming back? Yes, in both case, they may come back as Bodhisattvas out of their vows, but not as sentient beings undergoing samsaric rebirth.</div>
