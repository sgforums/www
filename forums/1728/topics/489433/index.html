              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Yuriko Koike Jul 31, 2015
              The  Japan Times  </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, composed no sutta to
              religious hatred or racial animus. And yet Buddhist chauvinism now threatens
              the democratic process in both Myanmar (Burma) and Sri Lanka. Some of the same
              Buddhist monks who braved Myanmar’s military junta in the “Saffron Revolution”
              of 2007 today incite violence against members of the country’s Muslim Rohingya
              minority. In Sri Lanka, the ethnic chauvinism of the Buddhist Sinhalese,
              stirred by a former president determined to reclaim power, mocks the supposed
              goal of reconciliation with the vanquished Hindu Tamils.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">In Myanmar, Buddhist racism is at the root of a virtual
              civil war in the state of Rakhine and is fueling a humanitarian crisis in which
              hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled their country by land and
              sea. Most ominous for Myanmar’s future, given that all genocides are linked to
              official action, this racial and religious antagonism is in no way spontaneous.
              The Rohingya have already been stripped of their Myanmar citizenship, and a
              raft of new and proposed legislation that would further marginalize Islam seems
              certain to provoke further violence.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">A new marriage law, for example, requires interfaith
              couples to register their intent to marry with local authorities, who will
              display a public notice of the engagement; only if no citizen objects to the
              union — highly unlikely in the present tense climate — is the couple permitted
              to wed. Another bill in the pipeline would forbid anyone under the age of 18
              from converting to another religion, and would require even an adult seeking to
              convert to gain the permission — subject to repeated interrogation — of local
              officials.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">Perhaps most disturbing, a third recent bill would allow
              for the imposition of Chinese-style population control on any group with a
              growth rate that is higher than the national average. Women could be ordered to
              wait, say, three years after the birth of a child before having another. Here,
              too, local governments, which are the most susceptible to popular prejudices,
              will be empowered to implement a law that seems specifically targeted at the
              Rohingyas, with their large families.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">These laws do not yet amount to an updated version of the
              Nuremberg laws (the anti-Jewish legislation enacted by the Nazis in 1935). But
              they do reflect the agenda of those seeking to fan Buddhist resentment in order
              to thwart Myanmar’s democratic transition. That dark ambition has gained
              urgency, because the country is due to hold its first democratic presidential
              election since the transition began in 2011.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">The Rohingya are, of course, the main target of this
              strategy. But there is another target as well: Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel
              Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">For now, Suu Kyi is precluded from running for president
              by a cynical constitutional provision that excludes anyone whose spouse or
              child has a foreign passport (Suu Kyi’s two sons by her late English husband
              hold British passports). Nonetheless, the regime, still fearing her popularity,
              is playing the race and religion card in order to discredit her and her party,
              the National League for Democracy, which won all but one of the parliamentary
              seats contested in the recent general election (and swept the annulled 1990
              election).</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">By stoking Buddhist violence against the Rohingya, the
              regime aims to damage Suu Kyi and the NLD’s chances of victory in two ways. If
              she speaks out for the Rohingya, her appeal among Buddhists, the vast majority
              of Myanmar’s citizens, may be dented enough to preserve the army’s grip on
              power. If she does not defend the Rohingya, her aura of moral leadership may be
              dimmed among her own supporters, both at home and abroad.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">So far, Suu Kyi has circumvented this booby trap with the
              verbal evasiveness that one would expect of an ordinary politician, rather than
              someone of her courage and standing. But, as the violence grows and the
              election nears, her room for maneuver will undoubtedly narrow. Instead of
              highlighting the country’s real needs — serious land reform, an anti-corruption
              drive, and freeing the economy from oligarchic control — she may instead be
              drawn into defending an unpopular minority.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">A similar political imperative is at the heart of the
              Sinhalese chauvinism that has made a sudden return to public life in Sri Lanka.
              The religious and ethnic passions of the Sinhalese were encouraged during the
              final, bloody push that ended Sri Lanka’s quarter-century of civil war with the
              Tamil Tigers in 2009. But instead of seeking reconciliation with the Tamils
              following their defeat, then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa continued to play on
              ethnic hatred as he subverted Sri Lanka’s democracy.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">Rajapaksa’s unexpected defeat by a coalition of Sri
              Lanka’s democrats and Tamil political parties in last January’s presidential
              election — a result that he then sought to annul — should have ended both his
              career and the politics of race-baiting. But the former president is now
              mounting a furious comeback bid and might well win the parliamentary election
              scheduled for August 17.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">One reason for Rajapaksa’s potential victory is his deep
              pockets; another is that he can probably count on support from China, having
              allowed the construction of ports and other facilities for the People’s
              Liberation Army during his presidency. But the key to his fortunes has been his
              effort to stoke the fears of the majority Sinhalese.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #333333;">Rajapaksa is thus placing Prime Minister Ranil
              Wickremesinghe in the same difficult position faced in Myanmar by Suu Kyi. So
              far, Wickremesinghe has succeeded in suggesting that the Sinhalese have more to
              fear from the return of Rajapaksa than they do from the country’s ethnic minorities.
              But no one should ever underestimate the power of hatred to undermine a
              democracy from within.</span></p>
