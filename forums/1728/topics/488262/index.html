              LOUIS TEMPLADO/ AJW Staff Writer</p>
              <p>Satoshi Murakami tested the hospitality of lots of strangers on his recent
              pilgrimage across Japan. When he shows up on someone’s doorstep at dusk,
              instead of asking for a room, he asks for space on their land where he can put
              down his own house, which he carries on his back.</p>
              <p>“I think what I do really challenges people and makes them aware of how
              attached they are to what they own,” says Murakami, “Everyone assumes that
              their property is permanent and inviolable. What I do is make a nuisance that
              hopefully lets them see that they can't completely isolate their own part of
              the world.”</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old Tokyo-based artist says he was shocked into action by the
              Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011. Like many in Tokyo he watched the
              disaster unfold on TV and saw entire towns swept away.</p>
              <p>He decided to reduce his possessions to the bare minimum and be always be
              ready to move. He built the portable house out of plastic foam and duct tape
              and set off on a journey across Japan in April 2014 in order to test the
              lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Since then he has plopped his house down next to isolated farmhouses, in
              alleys, occasionally in parks and often under the eaves of local temples and
              shrines. Buddhist priests, he said, often told him they could connect
              spiritually with his voyage.</p>
              <p>To share his experiences, Murakami came back to Tokyo for an exhibition of
              photos of his house in various locales throughout the country. The show, titled
              "Iju wo seikatsu suru 1-128" (moving as a way of life) was held last
              month at Gallery Barco in the Kameari district of Katsushika Ward. It recorded
              the first 128 places to accomodate his house as well the structure itself,
              along with pencil sketches of the homes of the people who agreed--sometimes
              reluctantly--to let him set up home on their land for a night.</p>
              <p>Traveling on foot, Murakami covered about 20 kilometers a day before
              knocking on doors, sweaty and dusty, to ask for a spot of his own. Reactions
              varied, and not all regions of Japan were equally hospitable toward Murakami.</p>
              <p>“In the Kyoto area, for example, a lot of people found me suspicious,"
              he says. "If I put my house down next to a bathhouse or convenience store,
              for example, to take a bath or buy a drink inside, it would cause a commotion.
              The owners would come out to make sure I wasn’t squatting and that I’d move
              on."</p>
              <p>In parts of the Tohoku region devastated by the tsunami, however, he found
              the going much easier.</p>
              <p>“Some areas were completely flattened so it was hard for owners to tell
              where their property ended and their neighbors’ began. People would just say,
              ‘Go ahead.’ Old residents have been moved around, and there are many people
              who’ve come from outside to work for the reconstruction. So someone like me
              didn’t stand out so much,” he explains.</p>
              <p>The house he built weighs about 8 kilograms and is roughly the size of an
              office desk. Yet Murakami purposely constructed it so that it can’t be taken
              apart or folded away. That would make it something more along the lines of a
              tent, he says, and the responses it draws would be different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The reactions would be systematized. If I showed up with a car, for
              example, would be directed to a parking lot. In the same way, if I showed up
              with a tent or something foldable I would be directed to a camp ground. It’s
              part of everyone’s logic. But if people see you coming with a house, they have
              trouble fitting it into their world.”</p>
