              <p>I wish to just say something which holds true for anyone who is a true Buddhist.</p>
              <p>Buddhists consider all teachings of most religions (especially those that we Singaporeans are familiar with, even on a superficial level; example, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so on) to be good and correct.</p>
              <p>However, it is also in our opinion that the teachings of other religions are not comprehensive enough in explaining certain phenomena of our world or certain truths leading to complete liberation.</p>
              <p>It is this part of Buddhism that attracts me to stay on as a Buddhist; the bigness of heart to embrace all without blindly following, the bigness of heart to discern but not judge without experiencing it on our own.</p>
              <p>And that usually in this world, there is no absolute and only one way to attain liberation for any individual, only that one has to find the right one for him/her.</p>
              <p>The teachings of other religions are never judged covertly or overtly to be false or wrong per se. Even if other religions's teachings are considered to un-Buddhist, we do not see any problem with that, and we do not go about trying to change people's minds about what they want to believe aggressively or over-zealously.</p>
              <p>We simply acknowledge that those teachings exist to cater to the unique needs and aspirations of every individual on earth.</p>
              <p>Should I one day choose not to stay a Buddhist, I will stay a free-thinker. I want to be able to regard, respect and embrace all religions as good and true in essence, but what really answers my doubts is Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is really very good for me, I thank myself for having planted good dharma karma during one or some of my previous past lives.</p>
              <p>I thank my parents from previous lifetimes, the present and the future, the Buddhas and saints of all directions and from all time periods (past, present and future).</p>
              <p>If this expression of thanks or gratefulness has even one drop or speck of sincerity in it, may I and all sentient beings being able to gain fast and complete liberation from life and death and be reborn into Amitabha Buddha's Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss.</p>

              <p>You are right that buddhism is very open to other religions, even if some of their teachings conflict with the dharma, we won't go around launch wars to force people to convert. This is one of the uniqueness of buddhism. Sometimes my friends try to brainwash and tell me that there is no
              cause and effect concept, no rebirth, I just smile and ignore them.</p>
              <p>Other religions although teach people to behave good and refrains from doing bad, but obviously it is not complete, it doesn't explain the ultimate truths for the disciple to follow.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are many ways to attain liberation, that's why buddhism has so many dharma doors that suits people of different capacity.<br>May I know what you meant by not to stay as buddhist. We are buddhist because we take refuge of buddha, dharma and sangha meaning in simple terms trust the enlightened beings, follow the teachings and guidance of them and practice towards enlightenment.<br>If one say he give up as a buddhist, I will be surprised as I never come across any ex-buddhist.</p>

              <p>There are a few I know personally who were ex-Buddhist but later converted into Christianity. One of them was my sis, who can consider an ex-Buddhism believer (as in having respect towards Buddhism and enjoys listening to audio cds of Buddhist mantras). She didn't go through the Triple Gem Refuge undertaking, but she used to enjoy listening to the Great Compassion Mantra, Heart Sutra. But after she went for overseas studies, she simply told us that she has found her true calling, her true refuge in Christianity.</p>
              <p>My dad was so heartbroken, that he couldn't sleep for many nights and it was until now that my sister's married, we can see him learning to let go bit by bit. But we know deep in our hearts, it still pains him to see his own daughter turn to Christianity after returning from overseas. It is a very cruel reality for him.</p>
              <p>There are others too, mere acquaintances so to speak ,who convert from Buddhism to Christianity. The numbers of those doing so are still consistently heard, or witnessed directly by me.</p>
              <p>I know it is unbecoming of me as a Buddhist to think or feel this way, but I'm just..I don't know..sad? Whatever.</p>
              <p>My cousin, who's a Christian, challenges me on Buddhism, when I ask him to share with me more about Christianity.</p>
              <p>His points are roughly the same as any Christians out there:</p>
              <p>1) Are the teachings authentic? How do you know they are authentic? The Bible is a collection of letters or testimonies that point to more or less the same person with the same behaviour, that shows the Bible is authentic.</p>
              <p>2) Buddhism doesn't teach about the beginning of the world, that means it's not practical/scientific/insightful at all.</p>
              <p>3) Buddhism teaches falsehood, as it doens't explain properly how the world has so many wonderful things, how things are created and so on..There has to be a God who creates all these things around us, as they all have a complex and intricate design.</p>
              <p>There are many others, but the above are three main points raised by him.</p>
              <p>I'm still trying to do more research into point one. So can't say anything yet.</p>
              <p>I have no problems with his second point, as I told him that it does not matter to me personally how the world began, so I don't see the need to dispute who is right or wrong about whether there is a Creator God.</p>
              <p>I replied his third point by saying that all things are 'created' by our own mind. ï¼ˆå�Žä¸¥ç»�ï¼šä¸‡æ³•ä»Žå¿ƒæƒ³ç”Ÿ). But he said it sounds incredulous that our thoughts can turn into trees or animals literally. I just kept quiet and then said I was sharing with him cos he asked and I respect his belief.</p>
              <p>And the above took place 2 years ago, when I was still merely a Buddhism believer, not a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wish I have the wisdom of the Buddha and can teach things according to each sentient being's level of understanding and acceptance.</p>
              <p>Oh well, I guess I have to wait and practise till 3 great aeons are over...haiz...</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>let me try to answer your cousin's points -</p>
              <p>(1) The whole point about Buddhism or Buddha-Dharma is about "Investigation", not just blind faith and belief. Of course, we must have faith in the teachings as well before we begin our path of investigation. The teachings direct people of different capabilities with different inclinations (å°�ç™¥ä¸‹è—¥) to lead to Nirvana.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the Bible has also gone through several revisions (bet your cousin and most christians do not really care or know about this). For the New Testament, the majority of it, other than the gospels and some letters by John and other disciples, are letters by a person (Paul) who did not even meet Jesus and was not even a direct disciple, even though it is said that Jesus "revealed" himself to Paul. The Old Testament is nothing but a historical account of the Jews, and the God of the Jews in it, is not a compassionate being.</p>
              <p>(2) &amp; (3) are about the same, so i will answer them like this:</p>
              <p>Buddha-Dharma is more concerned about the PRESENT state of a being in suffering. Why would a suffering being want to know about the creation of the universe? (Of course, christians do not think they are suffering, but anyway...) So what if one knows how the universe was created? Will it lead him to a greater understanding, or to liberation and emancipation? Also, Buddha-Dharma talks about "Interconnectedness" and "Interdependence" (ç·£èµ·), there are so many causes, so there really cannot be just a single cause (god's creation etc), THAT is why it is so intricate and complex. If it were just a single cause, then why was it made so intricate and complex? One example, if we were to go back 20 generations, how many people would it take before "I" am born - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256......so can there be just a single cause?</p>

              <p><br>It is good that you share christian's doubt on buddhism with us. Indeed, there are many other misunderstanding about buddhism by christians.<br>1) The teachings are authentic, from buddha time until now, we been talking about the same teaching, cause and effect concept, rebirth, compassion, noble 8 fold path, 4 noble truths and so on. Even though it is translated to many languages, transmited to various lineage and schools, the teaching doesn't change. I agree with Sanath that bible itself has gone through many changes, though it is good that they discovered and corrected the errors in bible (eg. conflict with Galileo's discovery).</p>
              <p>2) Buddhism did explain the creation of the universe so clearly and detail until no other religion or even modern science can compare to it. Many elite scientists including Albert Einstein admitted this fact. Buddhism sutras are so vast and huge. If the teaching are as little as a tiny little book, then we will be able to focus on the creation of universe alone, but then again it is not meaningful to talk abt the past if it doesn't help our spiritual practice. We rather focus on more practical thing for our future than to talk about some fairy tale in the past.</p>
              <p>3) This is similar to question 2. What you meant doesn't explain the wonderful things on earth? yes, there are many things be it wonderful or not wonderful, but why it is that must be a god to create it? Next time if your cousin criticize buddhism again, pls ask him why "christian god" create hell to torture people who don't believe in him, why create retarded baby, they will go to hell because of not able to accept christian, isn't it.</p>
              <p>Regarding things are
              'created' by our own mind, the meaning of create is not to physically make an object. Dharma is much more profound than viewing thing as a physical object. A physical object let's say a tree can be different things seen by different beings. It can be a source of food to an animal, a place to stay for a spirit, a playground for a child, source of income for a merchant. Some being even see it as series of molecules that exists with other molecules in the air, they don't even know why we human want to create a concept of tree. Even a glass of drinking water is seen as hot larva by hungry ghost. Why so many difference, it is our mind to view it this way.<br> There are no computer thousands year ago, but there are computers today, because the conditions to make computers is there, the cause is also there, so the result is automatically there, not because "christian god" create it. Buddha taught us the underlying concept for all phenomenon, it is not necessary for buddha to go through every single item on the earth and tell us the cause of this ant, that tree etc.</p>

                  There are ways to check for scriptural authenticity, like checking out the translator, source of scripture, and so on. Our scriptures were first recited 2 weeks after Buddha passed in parinirvana.

                          around us, as they all have a complex and intricate design.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>I think I can't explain better than the following passage, and also Sanath makes a good point that conditionality is the only logical way to explain the 'complex and intricate.</p>

                  <p>http://www.uq.net.au/slsoc/bsq/budchr2.htm</p>
                  <h3>The Argument from Design</h3>
                  <p>In response to the above refutation, the Christian will maintain that the universe does not
                          merely exist but its existence shows perfect design. There is, a Christian might say, an
                          order and balance which point to its having been designed by a higher intelligence, and
                          that this higher intelligence is God. But as before, there are some problems with this
                          argument.</p>
                  <p>Firstly, how does the Christian know that it was his God who is behind creation? Perhaps
                          it was the gods of non-Christian religions who designed and created the universe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how does the Christian know that only one God designed everything? In fact, as
                          the universe is so intricate and complex we could expect it to need the intelligence of
                          several, perhaps dozens, of gods to design it. So if anything the argument from design
                          proves that there are many gods, not one as Christians claim.</p>
                  <p>Next, we would have to ask, is the universe perfectly designed? We must ask this because
                          if a perfect God designed and created the universe, then that universe should be perfect.
                          Let us first look at inanimate phenomena to see whether they show perfect design. Rain
                          gives us pure water to drink but sometimes it rains too much and people lose their lives,
                          their homes and their means of livelihood in floods. At other times it doesn't rain at all
                          and millions die in drought and famine. Is this perfect design? The mountains give us joy
                          as we see them reaching up into the sky. But landslides ~nd volcanic eruptions have for
                          centuries caused havoc and death. Is this perfect design? The gentle breezes cool us but
                          storms and tornadoes repeatedly cause death and destruction. Is this perfect design? These
                          and other natural calamities prove that inanimate phenomena do not exhibit perfect design
                          and therefore that they were not created by a perfect God.</p>
                  <p>Now let us look at animate phenomena to see whether they reveal perfect design. At a
                          superficial glance, nature seems to be beautiful and harmonious; all creatures are provided
                          for and each has its task to perform. However, as any biologist will confirm, nature is
                          utterly ruthless. To live, each creature has to feed on other creatures and struggle to avoid
                          being eaten by other creatures. In nature, there is no time for pity, love or mercy. If a
                          loving God designed everything, why did such a cruel design result? The animal kingdom
                          is not only imperfect in the ethical sense, it is also imperfect in that it often goes wrong.
                          Every year ~lions of babies are born with physical or mental disabilities, or are stillborn or
                          die soon after birth. Why would a perfect creator God design such terrible things?</p>
                  <p>So if there is design in the universe, much of it is faulty and cruel. This would seem to
                          indicate that the universe was not created by a perfect all-loving God.</p>

              <p><br>It is good that you share christian's doubt on buddhism with us. Indeed, there are many other misunderstanding about buddhism by christians.<br>1) The teachings are authentic, from buddha time until now, we been talking about the same teaching, cause and effect concept, rebirth, compassion, noble 8 fold path, 4 noble truths and so on. Even though it is translated to many languages, transmited to various lineage and schools, the teaching doesn't change. I agree with Sanath that bible itself has gone through many changes, though it is good that they discovered and corrected the errors in bible (eg. conflict with Galileo's discovery).</p>
              <p>2) Buddhism did explain the creation of the universe so clearly and detail until no other religion or even modern science can compare to it. Many elite scientists including Albert Einstein admitted this fact. Buddhism sutras are so vast and huge. If the teaching are as little as a tiny little book, then we will be able to focus on the creation of universe alone, but then again it is not meaningful to talk abt the past if it doesn't help our spiritual practice. We rather focus on more practical thing for our future than to talk about some fairy tale in the past.</p>
              <p>3) This is similar to question 2. What you meant doesn't explain the wonderful things on earth? yes, there are many things be it wonderful or not wonderful, but why it is that must be a god to create it? Next time if your cousin criticize buddhism again, pls ask him why "christian god" create hell to torture people who don't believe in him, why create retarded baby, they will go to hell because of not able to accept christian, isn't it.</p>
              <p>Regarding things are 'created' by our own mind, the meaning of create is not to physically make an object. Dharma is much more profound than viewing thing as a physical object. A physical object let's say a tree can be different things seen by different beings. It can be a source of food to an animal, a place to stay for a spirit, a playground for a child, source of income for a merchant. Some being even see it as series of molecules that exists with other molecules in the air, they don't even know why we human want to create a concept of tree. Even a glass of drinking water is seen as hot larva by hungry ghost. Why so many difference, it is our mind to view it this way.<br>There are no computer thousands year ago, but there are computers today, because the conditions to make computers is there, the cause is also there, so the result is automatically there, not because "christian god" create it. Buddha taught us the underlying concept for all phenomenon, it is not necessary for buddha to go through every single item on the earth and tell us the cause of this ant, that tree etc.</p>

              <p>I feel so useless in not being able to know more about Buddhism, to develop more objectiveness in deciding whether to go for historial authencity or go for wisdom and qualities like what AEN has said when choosing which teaching/religion to follow.</p>
              <p>As such, most of you can read about me asking almost the same questions every now and then, cos I believe every different individual has his/her own personal but perhaps insightful experience or knowledge to share about controversial topics as the above.</p>
              <p>My cousin sounds like criticisng Buddhism, but I have to tell myself not to regard it as such whether or not he truly is. Why? Cos thinking in this way will only lead me to be complacent with my knowledge and way of cultivation.</p>
              <p>I will admit to my inadequacies, my own lack of objectiveness and wisdom, than to think of others as critising 'MY' religion or personal belief. I want to tame my ego, my arrogance, my dogmatic views on all things in life.</p>
              <p>Hence I will continue to ask similar questions and continue to reflect on the comments given by all of you here.</p>

              <p>Thanks AEN, really appreciate all that information above. I have similar materials on the argument about connection between 'perfect design' and 'God' too.</p>
              <p>In case anyone or any Christian in SGforums thinks I'm anti-Christian or a Buddhist fundamentalist or conservative, I wish to clarify by saying the following:</p>
              <p>Most Christian churches and their members subtlely or zealously challenge members of other religions on their beliefs, which I think will not lead to inter-faith respect and harmony in the short or long term.</p>
              <p>Therefore as a Buddhist, I need to continously re-affirm my belief, knowledge in Buddhist teachings, and develop spiritual wisdom. I also need to learn as many ways as possible to show clear and unwavering respect for the teachings of other religions and their members. One way is definitely to restrain myself from imposing, instilling or provoking the rise of doubtful thoughts in their members about their beliefs in any way, well-intentioned or not.</p>
              <p>I will continue to seek guidance from the entire Buddhist community anywhere.</p>
              <p>May I be able to meet the right Dharmma everywhere I go and may I quickly realise the Truth as experienced by the Buddha. And after that, I will definitely go ahead to help others to realise the Truth and gain quick and complete liberation from all suffering and delusions.</p>
              <p>If there's any single speck of sincerity in my wishes, may it come true as quickly as possible with the empowerment of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and enlightened beings in all ten directions and all time periods.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I feel so useless in not being able to know more about Buddhism,
              to develop more objectiveness in deciding whether to go for
              historial authencity or go for wisdom and qualities like what
              AEN has said when choosing which teaching/religion to follow.</p>
              <p>As such, most of you can read about me asking almost the same
              questions every now and then, cos I believe every different
              individual has his/her own personal but perhaps insightful
              experience or knowledge to share about controversial topics as the
              above.</p>
              <p>My cousin sounds like criticisng Buddhism, but I have to tell
              myself not to regard it as such whether or not he truly is. Why?
              Cos thinking in this way will only lead me to be complacent with my
              knowledge and way of cultivation.</p>
              <p>I will admit to my inadequacies, my own lack of objectiveness
              and wisdom, than to think of others as critising 'MY' religion or
              personal belief. I want to tame my ego, my arrogance, my dogmatic
              views on all things in life.</p>
              <p>Hence I will continue to ask similar questions and continue to
              reflect on the comments given by all of you here.</p>

              <p>IMO, we should tell Christians that Christian teachings is similar to äººå¤©ä¹˜ (Human and Heaven Vehicle) in Buddhism. For example, ten commandments include principles like no killing, no adultery, no stealing and honor your parents.  The dharma of äººå¤©ä¹˜ is the foundation/basis to more advanced dharma found in Theravada and Mahayana. It is like äººå¤©ä¹˜ is the primary school, Theravada is the secondary school and Mahayana is the university. From the point of äººå¤©ä¹˜, there is nothing wrong with believing in God and wanting to go to Heaven. In fact, if everybody in this world, despite having different religions, can really practise äººå¤©ä¹˜, our environment will naturally improve and become Heaven. Christians and Buddhists can work together to make our world a better place. The dangers comes when we discriminate against each other's religion. Discrimination results in misunderstanding. Misunderstanding gives rise to conflicts and eventually war. Therefore, I usually avoid discussing the differences but focus on the common teachings when I speak to my Christian friends.</p>
              <p>The following is a speech made by Dalai Lama to promote religious harmony:</p>
              <h1>A Biased Mind Cannot Grasp Reality</h1>
              <p><em>Excerpts
              from His Holiness the Dalai Lama's address to the inter-faith seminar organised
              by the International Association for Religious Freedom, Ladakh Group, in Leh on </em>25 <em>August</em></p>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I am extremely delighted to attend this inter faith
              seminar on the Preservation of Religious Harmony, Co­existence and Universal Peace
              organised by the International
              Association for Religious Freedom (IARF), Ladakh group. Thank you very much for
              the detailed explanation of the association's history, activities, objectives
              and their relevance in the present century. I have nothing to add on what the
              speakers said earlier. But I would like to say a few things.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>We are now in the twenty ­first
              century. The quality of research on both the inner and physical world has
              reached quite high-thanks to the tremendous stride in technological advancement
              and human intelligence. However, as some of the speakers said before, the world
              is also facing a lot of new problems, most of which are man­made. The root
              cause of these man­made problems is the inability of human beings to control
              their agitated minds. How to control such a state of mind is taught by the
              various religions of this world.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I am a religious practitioner, who follows Buddhism.
              More than a thousand years have passed since the great religions of the world
              flourished, including Buddhism. During those years, the world had witnessed a
              lot of conflicts, in which followers of different religions were also involved.
              As a religious practitioner, I acknowledge the fact that different religions of
              the world have provided many solutions about how to control an agitated mind.
              In spite of this, I still feel we have not been able to realise our full
              potential.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> always say that every person on
              this earth has the freedom to practice or not practice religion. It is all
              right to do both. But once you accept religion, it is extremely important to be
              able to focus your mind on it and sincerely practice the teachings in your
              daily life. All of us can see that we tend to indulge in religious favouritism
              by saying, "1 belong to this or that religion", rather than making
              effort to control our agitated minds, This misuse of religion, due to our
              disturbed minds, also creates problems sometimes.</span></div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I know a physicist from Chile who told me that it is not
              appropriate for a scientist to be biased towards science because of his love
              and passion for it. I am a Buddhist practitioner and have a lot of faith and
              respect in the teachings of the Buddha. However, if I mix up my love for and
              attachment to Buddhism, then my mind shall be biased towards it. A biased mind,
              which never sees the complete picture, cannot grasp the reality. And any action
              that results from such a state of mind will not be in rune with reality. As
              such it causes a lot of problems.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>According
              to Buddhist philosophy, happiness is the result of an enlightened mind whereas
              suffering is caused by a distorted mind. This is very important. A distorted
              mind, in contrast to an enlightened mind, is one that is not in tune with
              reality.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Any issue, including political, economic and
              religious activities human beings pursue in this world, should be fully
              understood before we pass our judgement. Anyhow, the worldly things are the
              results of so many cause and conditions. Therefore, if is very important to
              know them. Whatever the issue, we should be able to see the complete picture.
              This will enable us to comprehend the whole story. The teachings offered in
              Buddhism are based on rationality, and I think are very fruitful.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Today, a lot of people from
              different religious backgrounds have made their presence here. You all might
              have a question mark in your mind: anything, which can be
              felt and is possible, should be a question of whether we can realise it by our mind or
              not. It is not easy to answer this question. In every religion, there are
              transcendent things that are beyond the grasp of our mind and speech. For
              example, the concept of God in Christianity and Islam and that of wisdom truth
              body in Buddhism are metaphysical, which is not possible for an ordinary person
              like us to realise. This is a common difficulty faced by every religion. It is
              taught in every ­religion, including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and
              Islam, that the ultimate truth is driven by faith.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I want to emphasise that it is
              extremely important for practitioners to sincerely believe in their respective
              religions. Usually, I say that it is very important to distinguish between
              "belief in one religion" and "belief in many religions".
              The former directly contradicts the latter. Therefore, we should resolutely
              resolve these contradictions. This is possible only by thinking in contextual
              terms. A contradiction in one context might not be the same in the other. In
              the context of one person, a single truth is closely associated with a single
              source of refuge. This is of extreme necessity. However, in the context of
              society or more than one person it is necessary to have different sources of
              refuge, religions and truths.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>In
              the past it was not a major problem because nations remained aloof from each other
              with their own distinct
              religion. However, in today's close and inter-connected world there are so many
              differences amongst various religions. We must obviously resolve these
              problems. For example, there have been a lot of religions in India for the past
              thousand years. Some of them were imported from outside whereas some have grown
              in India itself. Despite this, the fact is that these religions have been able
              to coexist with each other, and the principle of Ahimsa has really flourished in this
              country. Even today, this principle has a strong bearing on every religion.
              This is very precious and India should really take pride in it.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Ladakh has been a predominantly
              Buddhist area 'for so many centuries. But other religions such as Islam,
              Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism have also flourished here. Although it is natural
              for the people of Ladakh to have attachment to and love for their own religions, yet this
              place has a very peaceful environment with no major problems of religious
              intolerance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">During my maiden visit to Ladakh, I heard elderly Muslims using
              the phrase "community of sangha" in their speeches. Although such
              phrases are not found in Islam, yet a reference of this kind invokes a lot of
              trust amongst the Buddhists. Therefore, people from different religious
              background in Ladakh are very close to each other and live in harmony.</span></div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>As far as the Muslims are concerned
              it is appropriate for them to have complete devotion to Allah while praying in
              the mosques. This is also the same with Buddhists who are completely devoted to
              the Buddha when they pray in Buddhist temples. A society, which has many
              religions should also have many prophets and sources of refuge. In such a
              society it is very important to have harmony and respect amongst the different
              religions and their practitioners. We must distinguish between belief and
              respect. Belief refers to total faith, which you must have in your own
              religion. At the same time you should have respect for all other religions.
              This tradition of believing in one's own religion and having respect for others
              is in existence in Ladakh since your forefathers. Therefore you do not have to
              invent it. The most important thing at the moment is to preserve and promote
              this tradition. I would like to thank all of you for working hard regarding
              this and request you to continue to do so in the future.</div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If a harmonious relationship is
              established amongst societies and religious beliefs in today's multi-ethnic,
              multi-religious and multi-cultural world, then it will surely set a very good
              example for others. However, if all the sides become careless, then there is a
              danger of imminent problems. In a multi­ethnic  society   the biggest problem is
              that of between the majority and the minority. For 'instance, in the capital
              Leh, Buddhists constitute the majority of the population whereas Muslims
              belong to the minority
              community. The majority must consider the minority as their invited guests.
              The minority, on the other hand, should be able to sensitise with the II1ajority.
              In other words, both sides should live in harmony. In order to sustain this
              harmony, both sides should not take lightly the sensitive issues between
              themselves. Indeed, the majority should I pay attention to and appreciate the
              views and opinion of the minority. Both sides should discuss and clearly
              express what they think about the other's view and opinion. The minority, on
              the other hand, should be careful about where the sensitive issues of the
              majority lies and express whatever doubts they have in their minds. If problems
              are resolved in such a friendly manner; then both sides will gain. Suspicion of
              each other will only harm both communities. Therefore, it is very important to
              live in harmony and analyse where the opinion of the other lies. The best way
              to do this is to engage in dialogue, dialogue and dialogue.</div>

              <p>Buddhists consider all teachings of most religions (especially those that we Singaporeans are familiar with, even on a superficial level; example, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so on) to be good and correct.</p>

              <p><br>Is this taught by the Buddha himself?</p>
              <p>My view towards other religions is that, they are not good and correct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in all entirety</span>. There are portions which are good and correct (eg. the 6th to the 10th commandments), but there are also portions that are at odds with the teachings of Buddhism (slavery, human sacrifice, waging wars, establishing personal prestige and power, wholesale slaughter of human beings by God etc.).</p>
              <p>But I also respect the rights of every person to believe and practice their own respective religion, independent of my views towards that religion. I also believe that in a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-racial society such as ours, we need to emphasize the common teachings of our religions rather than dwell on the differences.</p>

              <p>I think what he meant is, that they do not teach the way to Enlightenment or Nirvana. All if not most teach "Cease Evil, do Good", but fail to mention "Purify the Mind", which is the essential teachings of the Buddha-Dharma.</p>
              <p>As for structures, while we asians think that eurpoean church architecture like St Andrew's Cathedral are very nice and cool; on the other hand, europeans and americans love asian architecture like our temples. Get what i mean?</p>
