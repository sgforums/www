The concept that the bible
              is the inerrant word of God</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> There are countless contradictions in the bible that are obvious (and many more
              that are not as evident). One just has to read the bible (not even study it in
              detail) to find these. I recall a pastor tell me that if the bible is not
              inerrant then we might as well just throw the whole thing out. The bible is an
              important book like others books. And inspired by God is a much more accurate
              manner to describe the bible. However it is far from inerrant.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>While there are many discrepancies in the bible, here are
              just a few examples of some; let's start with Genesis chapters 6-9 about Noah
              and the flood, there are two stories combined. One account has two, a pair of
              every kind of animal. Another account says seven pairs of the clean animals and
              only two of the unclean animals. Another one from the Old Testament is Psalm
              145:9 and Jeremiah 13:14 where in the prior God is good and merciful to all and
              in the latter God will destroy all that worship a different deity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>In the New Testament, Matthew 10:34-36 describes Jesus
              telling the disciples that He came not to bring peace to the world, but a
              sword. However, in Matthew 5:43-48 Jesus says to love your enemy. Paul of
              Tarsus in Galatians 3:28 wrote: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor
              free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." However 1st
              Timothy 2:11-15: says "A woman should learn in quietness and full
              submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man;
              she must be silent...". Religious scholars unequivocally agree that Paul
              wrote Galatians but did not write 1st or 2nd Timothy. The historical Paul of
              Tarsus was well known for supporting women's equal rights.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong style="line-height: 19.65pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #333333; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">2. Warped theology by Christian exclusivists which includes
              ignoring the human rights violations in the Middle East</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>A friend of mine, a professor of theology recalled a
              disturbing event while on his trip to the Middle East in the 1980s; a Christian
              fundamentalist attempt to bomb the Dome of the rock to somehow start the events
              for the second coming of Jesus. This action was endorsed by American Christian
              fundamentalists. Christian Zionists or dispensationalists believe Jews should
              control the Middle East to set the stage for the second coming of Jesus. Yet
              Christian Zionists do not endorse Judaism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Jerry Farwell believed that a Jew would be the
              Anti-Christ. Of course if he had really studied his theology he would
              understand that Roman ruler Nero during the time of antiquity was considered by
              the early church to be the anti-Christ. Nero was persecuting early Christians.
              "666" was a code used by John of Patmos to disguise his criticism of
              the Emperor Nero---the Greek alphabet assigns a numerical value for each
              letter, and Nero Caesars full name adds up to either 666 or 661, depending on
              how you translate the name.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>To understand the biblical gospels academically, the
              second coming of Jesus and the end of the world were thought to have been
              within or shortly after his lifetime. As one example, Jesus is quoted as saying
              in Luke 9:27 "But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will
              not taste death before they see the kingdom of God." So for Christian
              Zionists or dispensationalists to act in this manner (ignoring the atrocities)
              is not only unethical but also prophetically erroneous. The conflict in the
              Middle East involves a denial of the right to vote, segregation, violence and
              the death of innocent civilians, and many are children. This type of warped
              theology is demeaning true Christianity which include, first and foremost the
              care of innocent women and children.</span></p>

Refusal to get acquainted with people of other religions</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'> Exclusive Christians have generally no interest in learning another religion. I
              spoke to a local pastor suggesting I give a short lecture on Islam. He replied
              that this would be polarizing to Christians. This pastor wasn't really
              criticizing Islam with this statement but instead was acknowledging that many
              Christians know almost nothing more than the propaganda by certain media
              outlets that Islam is equated with terrorism. On the contrary, two of the 'Five
              Pillars' of Islam include the concern and charity for the needy and the other
              is fasting to remember those, especially children that don't have enough (or
              anything) to eat.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>According to Buddhist scholar Edward Conze, Buddhist
              missionaries had been proselytizing for centuries (before and after the time of
              Jesus) around Alexandria, Egypt. To say Buddhism influenced early Christianity
              is not by any means unprecedented. Yet exclusive Christians have little or no
              knowledge of Buddhism and for the few that do, to say to them that Buddhism
              likely influenced Christianity would result in a staunch rebuttal.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>4. More concerned with legalism than humanism</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Some Christians are overly concerned with legalism (rules) and forgetting all
              together the concern and well-being of one's neighbor (humanism). Which should
              include all neighbors of all faiths. The legalistic perspective has sin being
              perceived as disobedience to God and/or offending God and the humanistic one
              describes sin as what degrades or harms the person. But in reality, there is
              really no difference; disobedience to God is like disobeying a father or mother
              with the child doing something to harm themselves or others. A father or mother
              is seldom stunned with being offended directly. As an example, it is
              commonplace for a child to occasionally say they hate us (as parents).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Parents typically want the child to learn to adapt within
              society and respect all persons. If parents tolerate misbehavior, then the
              child will believe it to be acceptable in society. Since humanity was made in
              the image of God, then it would be logical to assume we would mimic His actions
              as parents. Sin is about what harms ourselves and subsequently others, not so
              much about offending God. God is concerned about the well-being of all of his
              children.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>5.</span></strong><span><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Â </span></strong></span><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>Thoughts, quotes, philosophies,
              and music from other religions have no merit</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> In the social media, and news, one will rarely (if ever) see an exclusive
              Christian quote someone like Rumi, the Dalai Lama or Gandhi. Why is this? Is it
              really because they are considered to have no merit by these people?
              Additionally, if a famous Christian musician becomes ill or dies, the exclusive
              Christian will ask for prayers yet if a Hindu or Muslim with similar fame faces
              a tragedy, seldom will there be the same request for prayers.</span></p>

Overly concerned with homosexuality as being a serious and
              grave sin</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Seldom do we hear in the conservative Christian media strong condemnations of
              frivolous sexual activities. Society has a tendency to elevate in status the
              irresponsible sexual undertakings of the young male, despite it being highly
              discouraged in the bible. This is not at all the case of homosexual activities.
              The bible clearly discourages irresponsible sexual activities but this is not
              exclusive to just homosexuals.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>The responsible homosexual couple is much more likely to
              adopt orphans than the heterosexual couple simply because they cannot conceive.
              All of the synoptic Gospels quote Jesus saying "whoever may cause to
              stumble one of the little ones, better is it for him if a millstone is hanged
              about his neck, and he had been cast into the sea." The proper nurture and
              care of children is central in Christianity. Jesus certainly didn't say cast
              into the sea the homosexual as a consequence for their sins. As a matter of
              fact, Jesus never even once mentioned homosexuality in the gospel accounts of
              his life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>7. Belief that religious/theological academia is somehow
              falsehood, destructive and/or distorted</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> An article in the Christian post from John Piper where he reveals "Why
              PhDs in Theology Commit Adultery; Says They Cheat 'Probably More' Than
              'Less-Educated People'" is just complete nonsense. According to the
              Associated Press Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 54-57% of spouses commit
              adultery and the large majority of these people do not have Phds in theology.<span>Â </span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> It is a belief by many exclusive Christians that biblical scholars like Dr.
              Bart Ehrman or Dr. Michael Coogan agenda is to attack Christianity. Instead of
              understanding their results are from dedicated and countless hours of honest
              research and academia. Both are top scholars in their field of study. What
              exactly might either of these scholars or others like them gain by trying to
              undermine Christianity or another religion? I mean really? Bart Ehrman reads
              Hebrew and Greek and Michael Coogan reads Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic. I doubt
              most of their critics have even the smallest grasp of these ancient languages.<span>Â </span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> <br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> <strong style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">8. Their concept of being
              "saved"</span></strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"> Countless times over the years, I've been approached by evangelical Christians
              in their effort to 'save' me as if I just fell off the boat. "I was raised
              Roman Catholic" I say; yet they still ask me if I'm saved, and I often
              respond with "saved from what"? Then when they get to know me and
              that I am a scholar of religion, it stifles them. One has to wonder if some of
              these people are too consumed with the being saved concept forgetting the
              importance of love your neighbor and enemy. If every Christian in the world
              including those overly concerned with personal 'sin' and being 'saved' would
              adopt (or foster) just one orphan, there would be no orphans and a lot less
              hungry children.</span></p>

              <p>It is definitely extremely contradicting.Â </p>
              <p>This religion/faith preaches salvation for all.Â Â  god wants all to be saved. Â Â  On the contrary, in the new testament,Â  Jesus/god stated that it is not we who choose him ,Â  it is he that chooses us. Â Â  So crappy, this does put a doubt in people's mind.Â  According to christian teaching doubting is a sin.Â  tsk tsk tsk!</p>
