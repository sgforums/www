            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Catholic leaders send greetings for Buddha's birth</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">UCANews, April 28, 2006</span></span><br><br><strong>SEOUL, South Korea</strong> -- Cardinal Nicholas Cheong Jin-suk of Seoul has issued a message greeting all Buddhists in South Korea on the occasion of Vesak. Cardinal Cheong said in his April 26 message, "I congratulate all Buddhists on the occasion of Buddha's birthday this spring, when all creation comes into new being." This year Korean Buddhists will celebrate Vesak, the holiday commemorating Gautama Buddha's birth, on May 5.<br><br>The cardinal observed that although Buddha bestowed universal compassion and goodwill on people, to this day conflict, hate, hostility and many kinds of discrimination are prevalent in the world. "That is why we need Buddha's teaching more and more. We believe that we can solve the problems by following Buddha's compassion and practicing love, which is the fundamental teaching of all religions," he said.<br><br>Mentioning that Pope Benedict XVI has stressed interreligious dialogue and harmony in this pluralistic age, Cardinal Cheong expressed his intention to help build a peaceful society through more active interfaith dialogue that results in all people contributing to promote the common good.<br><br>On April 25, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea (CBCK) sent its Korean translation of the Vatican's annual Vesak message to the Jogye Order, the nation's largest Buddhist denomination, and to Church-run and secular media.<br><br>The message, "Buddhists and Christians at the Service of Humanity," was signed by Archbishop Michael L. Fitzgerald as president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue before Pope Benedict reassigned him in February as apostolic nuncio to Egypt and to the Arab League.<br><br>The Jogye Order posted the translated Vatican message on its Web site (http://www.buddhism.or.kr), along with Cardinal Cheong's message.<br><br>Meanwhile, Venerable Beopjeon, patriarch of the Jogye Order, issued a Vesak message on April 25. In it he wrote: "Those who open the sharp eye of discernment in anguish will see the Buddha. Those who are awakened to redemption in love will see Jesus."<br><br>The Buddhist leader urged the people to see the living Buddha in all people they meet daily. He said that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (pervading goodness of highly enlightened beings) and Maitreya (the merciful Buddha) are everywhere.<br><br>"Though one may search everywhere and never find the place in this world where it exists, within the truth of 'everything is Buddha' the essence of reality is revealed and the infinite light is laid out before us all," the Jogye leader explained.<br><br>An official of the order told UCA News on April 27 that Buddhists would hold a Vesak ceremony in the Jogye Temple in downtown Seoul on May 5, at which time Venerable Beopjeon's message and congratulatory messages from other religions would be presented in public.<br><br></div>

During an event called Â“Lotus Lantern Making Festival for Foreigners,Â” 200 foreigners learned how to make lanterns in front of Jogyesa Temple.<br><br>Around 7 p.m., the organizing committee gave people small lanterns to carry at Tapgol Park and the people marched in a big parade from  Dongdaemun Stadium to Jogyesa Temple. Visitors also enjoyed a Lotus Lantern music concert that started at 9:30 p.m. and at the end of the festival, everyone danced together hand in hand.<br><br>Because BuddhaÂ’s birthday is on the same day as ChildrenÂ’s Day this year, many fun programs for children and their families combining the two holidays are being offered, such as an exhibition of bright and colorful lanterns at Pongunsa Temple in southern Seoul.<br></div>

Temples were lit with hundreds of candles, and the sound of bells could be heard miles away.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/baby-buddha.jpg"><br><strong>Bathing the Baby Buddha is a popular ritual during Wesak</strong><br><br>The smell of burning joss sticks also permeated the air as devotees knelt to pray and seek blessings. There was also a carnival-like atmosphere outside the temples, with many stalls selling flowers, religious trinkets and food.<br><br>The celebration commemorated the birth, enlightenment and death of Siddharta Gautama Buddha.<br><br>At the Kwan Inn Teng temple in Petaling Jaya, Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Seri Ong Ka Ting reminded Malaysians to be thankful that they live in a harmonious multiracial and multi-religious society. "We are very lucky to be living in a country which provides for the freedom of religion in its constitution," he said.<br><br>He also said Malaysians must help and accept each other regardless of race or religion to achieve Vision 2020.<br><br>In conjunction with the celebration, the temple also presented scholarships, study loans and donations, worth RM350,000, to deserving students and charitable bodies.<br><br>At the Taman Jaya Buddhist Temple in Petaling Jaya, the scene was similar with many devotees offering prayers and queuing to be blessed with holy water.<br><br>At the Buddha Maha Vihara temple in Brickfields, the celebration started at dawn with devotees observing the "Atta Sila" (Eight Precepts).<br><br>This was followed by the hoisting of the Buddhist Flag by the Sri Lankan High Commissioner, C.D. Casie Chetty.<br><br>The theme for this yearÂ’s celebration was Â‘Respect Human Rights, Promote Mutual UnderstandingÂ’.<br><br>According to Sasana Abhiwurdhi Wardhana Society president Sarath Wickrama Surendre, they decided on this theme as, in the light of events over the past one year, "we realised that many Malaysians do not understand their basic human rights".<br><br>"The theme is also apt because Buddha taught that mankind should respect human rights," he added.<br><br>The temple also held a blood and organ donation drive, and its Buddhist Institute Sunday Dhamma Schools organised a colouring competition for children as well as staging a dance and drama performance by its students.<br><br>Meanwhile, at the Mahindarama Buddhist Temple in Jalan Kampar, Penang, the chief monk Venerable E.

Although there are different schools of Buddhism practiced in this country, such is his deep impact on the community that he is affectionately known by all as Chief Venerable, or just "Chief".<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/chief-documentary.jpg"><br><br>To commemorate his remarkable achievement, a documentary on the VenerableÂ’s life has been produced by new media house True Sense. The film will be premiered at the forthcoming Wesak International Film Festival (WIFF).<br><br>The short film offers a glimpse of Chief, not just as a highly respected senior monk, but as someone with very human qualities Â– humane, humorous and always caring for the well-being of others.<br><br>It starts off with Chief talking how he became a monk at the age of 12 and the challenges that come with leading a religious life at such an early age. He recollects his early days in Malaya and how he overcame early resistance to his teachings.<br><br><strong>Two key innovations that Chief introduced were teachings in English and back-to-the-basics approach to Buddhism</strong>. <span style="color: blue;">Before his arrival in this country, Buddhism was largely taught in Chinese and the practices were mainly devotional in nature, mixed up with Taoism and other traditional Chinese rituals. Chief made it possible for English-speaking Malaysians to learn about the original teachings of the Buddha.</span><br><br>The documentary also showcase the VenerableÂ’s work to foster inter-religious harmony and he shares some light moments with us on the correct attitude to adopt towards other religions.<br><br>With very few Sangha members in this country, the future of Buddhism lies in the hands of the lay people, particularly, the youth. Chief has placed strong emphasis, especially on students. His efforts have paid off as much of the Buddhist activities organised in the country are managed by young Malaysians.<br><br>The film ends with Chief sharing his views on the right perspective of Buddhism and giving some very simple instructions on how to lead a Buddhistic way of life.<br><br><a href="http://www.bodhivision.net/chief/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodhivision.net/chief/</a></div>

This year the foundation's anniversary came a week after Sakyamuni Buddha's Birthday May 7.<br><br>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anna sent a congratulatory message to Tzu Chi's Dharma Master Cheng Yen, while 12 cities in six states of the United States proclaimed May 14 as "International Tzu Chi Day."<br><br>Tzu Chi's main shrine in Hualien County and the foundation's local chapters throughout Taiwan invited members of the public to join them at more than 60 locations in various forms of celebration, including Buddha-bathing ceremonies and exhibitions.<br><br>At Tzu Chi's main shrine, Master Cheng Yen, who established the foundation in 1966, led a long queue of Buddhist followers to worship the Buddha by paying homage to a giant Buddha statue, surrounded by 16 smaller Buddha statues. She also led them to pray for peace and prosperity for the people of Taiwan and elsewhere in the world.<br><br>Master Cheng Yen urged people seeking the Dharma not only to be respectful to the Buddha but also to keep a pure heart.<br><br>She cited 16 Chinese characters from "The Sutra of Innumerable Meanings" as the motto that all Tzu Chi members have followed in the past 40 years.<br><br>The passage, describing the state of mind of "Bodhisattvas" (enlightened Buddhists worthy of nirvana who postpone it to help others) says: "With tranquil minds and constantly in contemplation, they are peaceful, indifferent, non-active, and free from desires. They are immune from any kind of delusion or distraction. Their minds are calm and clear, profound and infinite. They remain in this state for hundreds of thousands of kotis of kalpas."<br><br>Tzu Chi Foundation, which began its charitable operations in an impoverished community in eastern Taiwan, has become an international organization with more than 5 million supporters and 30,000 certified volunteer coordinators all over the world. It has a total of over 200 liaison offices around the world. At least 61 countries in five continents, including Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Oceania, have received relief aid from Tzu Chi.<br><br>Tzu Chi Foundation started to extend its relief abroad in 1985 through its overseas Chinese supporters.<br><br>The foundation was certified by the United Nations as a NGO (non-government organization) on Dec. 22, 2003.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">Foreign monks reincarnate what they've learned in Korea</span></span><br><br>Not every child in Seoul has the opportunity to attend one of the ubiquitous hagwon cram schools, play soccer or go to taekwondo or piano lessons after school. Kids coming from poor districts and single parent families may find themselves at a loss for something to do after school, unlike their better-off counterparts.<br><br>It was with this in mind that American Buddhist monk Myong Haeng Seunim and a group of foreign monks and nuns recently decided to take an active role in the lives of a group of such kids. He is hoping that by volunteering his time teaching English at Wolgoksa Young People's Center (WGSYPC) he could give the kids Â“a good direction in life.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.korea.net/image/news/today/20060419007L.jpg"><br><br>The WGS Young People's Center is one of the charities run by the Jogye order of Korean Buddhism. Located in northern Seoul near Mia Samgeori Station, Line No. 4, the center provides an after school venue for kids living in one of the poorest areas of Seoul. Here they can do homework, learn some English and interact with adult supervision. The center can host up to 100 8 to 12 year-olds at a time.<br><br>Myong Haeng SN is part of a community of Zen monks and nuns from all over the world called the Gwan eum school of Buddhism. A part of the Jogye Order, the Gwan eum school was initiated by the celebrated Zen Master Seung Sahn SN who traveled across the world during his lifetime attracting many students, some of whom are now monks and nuns living in Korea.<br><br>From Malaysia to Poland and many other counties, this school of monks and nuns is unique for its international members who practice Zen Buddhism.<br><br>Recently, members of Musangsa (Temple) invited a group of kids from Seoul to the Daecheon Zen Center to partake in such simple activites as playing outside, making paper lanterns with monks and nuns, hearing stories and playing together in the beautiful mountain valley.<br><br>While Nun Wan Mi SN from Poland said the kids program is Â“totally natural,Â” and Â“nothing special,Â” from the beaming faces of the kids as well as adults, it was apparent that it was a special event for everyone there. The kids loved it, and the monks as members of a community that vows to help save all beings every morning seemed to find it totally natural to help society in this way.<br><br>Zen master Dae Bong SN spoke with korea.net about the community outreach program. He said, Â“We appreciate living in Korea. We get so much from the Korean people and culture; emotional warmth. We want to share in community life and give back to the community.Â”<br><br>A few weeks ago, Dae Bong SN, originally from Philadelphia, made a special appearance at the young people's center to tell some stories to the kids along with Myong Haeng SN. Not all the kids at the WGSYPC are Buddhists, and the monks don't try to proselytize or preach, but tell simple stories with basic human messages.<br><br>Â“Service is a really important part of human life,Â” he said. The Zen master is not looking to indoctrinate kids into Buddhism but enrich their lives and give them opportunities they don't have, noting that they would probably not have a chance to interact with foreigners or learn English otherwise.<br><br>Interacting with foreigners from all over the world can be a very positive experience for the kids, he said. There are people from over 10 different countries living at Musangsa. He hopes that the children can develop good relationships with foreigners at an early age, so that when they get older, they will have Â“a good relationship with the world.Â”<br><br>Humans are like pumpkins which are fighting in a garden, Dae Bong SN told the kids in one story. They keep fighting until a farmer comes out and shows them that their stems connect them all to each other.<br><br>Another of his favorite kids' stories is the M&amp;M story: All the different colored M&amp;Ms are fighting until they realize that they are all chocolate inside, so they cannot fight anymore.<br><br>Temple Abbot Mu Shim, also an American, said Â“Society can be very difficult on the kids. They can come here and return to their roots, which are clean and bright. We can give them a taste of what's possible in a place where no one is asking anything of them or pushing them to do or be anything.Â”<br><br>The coordinator of the WGS program notes that this is the only place in Seoul where kids from a Â“bad backgroundÂ” can go to get a positive influence in their lives. While the center is funded by the Jogye Order, they are still short of money, and the employees often end up giving their time and money to the program for free.<br><br>The Jogye Order is also active in sponsoring social outreach programs such as those for the handicapped and homeless and a support center for Â“comfort womenÂ” of the Japanese occupation, among others.<br><br>Dae Bong SN said that more and more, religious groups are reaching out in order to help society, not just to further the religion. This is true, he said, among both Buddhist and Christian organizations, and he seems optimistic that religious organizations of all types will work together for the common good of humanity instead of fighting with each other.<br><br>Myong Haeng SN hopes to leave a lasting impression with the kids. Â“Could it be that the answer to happiness and satisfaction in our lives is not really material wealth, but spiritual direction? Even if the kids do not have this kind of question now, perhaps later in their lives they will remember this experience, and it will give them some kind of inspiration or direction.Â”<br><br>Wan Song SN from Singapore had a more simple idea of what she wanted to give kids when they visited her temple. What will they bring back with them? Â“Happiness,Â” she said with a smile.<br><br>The WGS Young People's Center needs foreign volunteers to teach English classes.
