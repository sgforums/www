From her first brush with Buddhism to her setting up of the Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in 2000, hers is a fascinating tale of self-discovery, compassion and joy. LOKE POH LIN has the story.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/tenzin-palmo.JPG"><br><br><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong> -- Meeting the Venerable Tenzin Palmo is like breathing clean, fresh mountain air. ItÂ’s calming and exhilarating at the same time. Robed in saffron and red, she spoke with a gentle voice, a smile ever ready on her radiant face.<br><br>Tenzin Palmo was in Kuala Lumpur to speak at the upcoming International Conference on Buddhist Women from Saturday to June 21, and we took the opportunity to have a chat with her.<br><br>Amazingly, her spiritual journey started in London when she was 18, after reading a book.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="color: blue;">Â“Up to that time I was searching for a spiritual path. Then I joined a Buddhist society in London. Mind you, that was in the early 60s, before the hippie movement and general interest in Eastern religions.<br><br>Â“I got involved in the Sri Lankan Society as I was interested in Theravada Buddhism. Then I read a book dealing with an overview of Buddhism and while reading about Tibetan Buddhism and its four traditions: Nyingma, Sakyapa, Kargyupa, Gelugpa, a voice said Â’YouÂ’re a GelugpaÂ’.<br><br>Â“The last thing I wanted to be involved in was Tibetan Buddhism! But this voice inside said Â‘You are a GelugpaÂ’. I went to see a woman about this and she advised me to read The Life of Milarepa, about a great yogi of the 11th century. It was one of the few translated books at that time. When I read that book, I realised that this is my path.<br><br>Â“I started to learn Tibetan. And when I was 20 I went to India to look for a teacher.Â” </span></span><br><br>In 1964, she met her Tibetan guru, His Eminence the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche, and became one of the first Westerners to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun.<br><br>She studied under him for six years, after which she was sent to Lahaul for more intensive practice.<br><br>For a further six years, she practised in the monastery there and remained in isolation during the long winter months.<br><br>Eventually, Tenzin Palmo sought more seclusion and found a nearby cave where she stayed 12 years in solitary retreat. This became the subject of a book by Vicki Mackenzie, Cave in the Snow.<br><br>The cheerful Tenzin PalmoÂ’s main focus now is the Dongyu Gatsal Ling (DGL) Nunnery she founded in 2000.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Â“The lamas of my monastery (Khampagar, at Tashi Jong) requested that since there was nothing at that time, we should start a nunnery. For the last 13 years we have been raising funds for the nunnery. We have 38 nuns now but we are building for 100. Every year, we take in 20 more. They study Buddhist philosophy, meditation, language</span>.Â”</span><br><br>Teachers are senior lamas and nuns who have had the opportunity of an education.<br><br>A browse through Tenzin PalmoÂ’s website (<a href="http://www.tenzinpalmo.com" rel="nofollow">www.tenzinpalmo.com</a>) shows that the nuns receive accounting and budgeting lessons too Â— so that they will be able to run the nunnery well in the future.<br><br>The DGL Nunnery offers young women from Tibet and the Himalayan border regions of India, Bhutan and Nepal an opportunity to develop their intellectual and spiritual potential.<br><br>Tenzin Palmo adds, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Â“In the past, nuns were regarded as girls who couldnÂ’t get married. In the last 10 years this has changed. They have met nuns from Korea and Taiwan and seen how confident they are, how respected and empowered. And it inspires them.<br><br>Â“Tibetans should introduce higher ordination for nuns. Nuns should have the opportunity to become more educated, same as the monks, but this has been denied women. The lamas themselves are most keen to help teach the nuns. Certainly the ones who have taught our nuns love teaching our girls. And have been apologetic that they have not thought about this in the past.<br><br>Â“Historically, the trend among women to not appreciate their own gender has not served aspiring nuns well. Their needs were not expressed. It is changing now, with a gentle, quiet revolution. Hopefully they will progress to advanced degrees. Now our concern is for higher ordination for nuns.<br><br>Â“We have discussed the introduction of higher ordination for nuns in the Tibetan tradition. Things are moving along. Now young scholars are also researching the bikkshunis (ordained nuns) and how ordination has come about.Â”</span></span><br><br>At present nuns in the Tibetan tradition can only receive the vows of a novice. The lamas were supportive while raising some points which would need to be addressed before the full ordination can be bestowed within their tradition.<br><br>When asked why there has been a lack of interest in training nuns and integrating them into the mainstream of Buddhist clergy, she answered: <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Â“It has been pointed out that if they had introduced ordination of nuns 20 years ago, it would not have been successful. The nuns were not educated. It would not have worked. Now itÂ’s different. Nuns are more confident and have more self esteem.<br><br>Â“The nuns always had more difficulty in surviving. The nunneries rely on the generosity of lay patrons. When resources are scarce, the monks would get the vote. Women are not supportive of their own gender. Somehow the monks seem more meritorious. So generally thereÂ’s much less devotion towards nuns.<br><br>Â“Even now, with nuns coming into their own, their nunneries are rundown and struggling. Each monastery has a head, but the nuns have no one to represent them. ItÂ’s always a struggle to keep going. So through the ages, there has been fewer and fewer nuns.There werenÂ’t enough good teachers to teach. Now, itÂ’s different. Our professors really love our nuns and are proud of the fact that they teach them. The Dalai Lama is very supportive of the nuns also. He himself says that the future of the Dharma is in the hands of the women.Â”<br><br>The world lives in fear, intolerance and distrust. I asked Tenzin for advice on how to help us cope.<br><br>She said, Â“Buddhism is a path which leads to peace and lovingkindness and compassion. The world is full of violence and greed because itÂ’s inhabited by minds which are working by themselves. Many disasters are brought about by the humans. We are unbelievably destructive. We have to change our minds, and purify our minds and cleanse ourselves.<br><br>Â“Greed, anger, arrogance, jealousy Â– all the negative energies would be gone if we can control our minds. Greed goes closely with anger and frustration. Materialism is nothing to do with levels of happiness. Buddha said greed is like salty water. You can swallow the whole ocean and never satisfy your thirst.</span></span><br><br>-------------------<br>Tenzin Palmo and a host of international speakers will be sharing their insights at the 9th Sakyadhita International Conference on Buddhist Women in Kuala Lumpur from Saturday to June 21, 2006.

The monk stood to one side, meditating, with his arms tucked in his robe. It was time to beat the Beomjong temple bell. In Korean Buddhism, the ceremony rids a person of earthly desires and helps prepare for meditation.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/temple-stay-kr.jpg"><br><br>The huge bronze bell has rung every morning and evening for hundreds of years. Weighing several tons and adorned with floral and celestial motifs, bells like this one are found in all temples. Cho Seong Ran, the temple guide, took hold of the suspended log, about a metre long and 24 centimetres in diameter, and slammed it into the huge bell. Then she motioned for the guests to follow her, and we slowly walked around the bell, hands together in prayer.<br><br>The bell's deep sound reverberated through our bodies. It was a moving and emotional experience. When we arrived back at our starting point, she indicated that it was my turn. The log was heavier than I thought, and it took a good push to make a loud and resounding echo. We repeated this 33 times, meditating as we circled the bell.<br><br>It was cold on the exposed roof, but the thrill of participating in this ancient ceremony warmed me. It was part of a South Korean program that allows anyone to stay in a Buddhist temple for a day, week or more. Begun in 2002, when South Korea (with Japan) hosted soccer's World Cup, the <strong>"Templestay"</strong> initiative proved popular with Koreans and foreigners, and the number of participating temples has doubled to 44. Many are in the countryside, others are on the outskirts of small towns.<br><br>Temples are considered cultural treasures, so an overnight stay is an opportunity to experience the ancient traditions of monks and nuns (yes, there are Buddhist nuns, called Biguni in Korea).<br><br>Buddhism remains the largest religion of South Korea. While at the temple, you are free to ask questions about Buddhism or just enjoy the peace and quiet. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"This is a unique experience for people who want to truly relax or delve into the culture,"</span></span> said Frank Creasey, of South Korea's National Tourism Organization.<br><br>If you are touring South Korea, the calm and tranquil atmosphere is a welcome relief after the hustle and bustle of Seoul, the capital and largest city just an hour by bus from the Jagwang-Sa temple compound.<br><br>There is no charge for a stay, which includes lodging in a dorm, three meals and activities, but a $60 donation is suggested for each day you are there. The temples are clean but spartan, and the size and style of the accommodation varies. Rooms are usually shared. At times Western-style beds are provided, but sleeping with a mat and comforter on the heated Korean floor can be cozy.<br><br>Meals are eaten together, at long, low tables. Be forewarned: The entire group will wait until everyone is seated before beginning the meal, no matter how late the guest arrives.<br><br>Men and women have separate residences. The women's residence at the Jagwang-Sa temple is called the <strong>"Empty mind house."</strong> When we saw the sign, the Western women in the group felt miffed until we were told that an empty mind is a good thing in Buddhism. To empty one's mind is a prelude to meditation.<br><br>After morning prayers and breakfast, a visitor's day begins with a tour of the compound, which typically includes the temple, an administration building and a lodging building with dorms and dining hall. Temples are always open for individual worshippers and are used four or five times a day for group worship.<br><br>During the day you can roam the countryside or take part in such activities as hiking, calligraphy, forest meditation, sutra printing, Buddhist dance, tea ceremony and traditional crafts, such as making lotus lanterns.<br><br>Meals are simple, vegetarian and presented in a serve-yourself style.<br><br>Food is an important element in temple life -- eating is seen as a way to discipline the mind, to know your limits and to teach self-control.<br><br>You must eat what you take; waste is not an option. When the monks have finished eating what is on their plate, they add a little water, scrape up the remaining morsels and drink the water with the tidbits of food.<br><br>This simple ceremony is all part of getting to know a country, and a stay in a temple is an exceptional opportunity to glimpse into the soul of South Korea.<br><br>For more information on the Templestay program, go to <a href="http://www.templestaykorea.net" rel="nofollow">www.templestaykorea.net</a> Toureast holidays, 1-(877)-578-8888 or <a href="http://www.toureast.com" rel="nofollow">www.toureast.com</a>, specializes in temple tours<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nepal recognised as new Kaikyochi by Hongwanji</strong><br><br>On 3rd July 2006, Nepal was recognized by Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) as an Overseas Missionary district (Kaikyochi) in view of the continuing spread of the Jodo Shin teachings there. It is the forth after Australia, Mexico and Taiwan.<br>The current name is "Hongwanji Buddhist Society Nepal, Kathmandu Hongwanji". A new temple building temporarily called Kathmandhu Hongwanji is now being built in Kathmadu, and it will house the District Office. Currently the Main Shrine Hall (Hondo) on the 1st floor as well as living quarters on the 2nd floor have been completed as a Buddha-dedication service is scheduled in Mid-August.<br>Jodo Shinshu first spread in Nepal 14 years ago due to the auspices of the late Mr Mukaibo Hiromichi (passed away in May/June 2006), who contributed to the building of the "Greenlife Research Society", a Buddhist welfare group in Nepal. Later it was re-named the "Greenlife Buddhist Society, Nepal". The current president is Rev Sonam Wangdi, who after meeting Mr Mukaibo, converted from Tibetan Buddhism to Jodo Shinshu in 1998.<br>Rev Sonam Wangdi studied at the Chuo Bukkyo Gakuin in 2003 and was ordained as a minister in the Jodo Shin tradition before graduating and made an overseas missionary in September 2004. Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu country and Buddhists make only 10% of the population. At first Rev Sonam held gatherings at his own home, but with the completion of the Main Shrine Hall gatherings as well as worship services in Nepalese, English and Japanese. Other than scheduled services as well as sermons, "A Beginners' Guide to Jodo Shinshu" as well as the Japanese language are taught. Membership of the society numbers at more than 200 members currently.<br>In April this year (2006), Director Goto of the Hongwanji visited Nepal and supervised the construction of the temple building and temple activities. The Hongwanji also accepted Rev Calup Lama (sorry not sure of the correct spelling for his first name so just guessing from the katakana in the newspaper <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  ) who graduated from the Chuo Bukkyo Gakuin in April this year and is now assisting Rev Sonam Wangdi in Nepal; currently Miss Uma Lama Gishin (also not sure of her name! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  ) who is scheduled to graduate next spring and will return to Nepal to assist in temple activities.<br><br>(Translated by sanath from the Honganji Journal 20/7/2006)<br></div>

Now computer skills, foreign language ability and a degree in financial management are also desirable.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/monk-pc.jpg"><br><strong>A monk at China's Shaolin Temple, which helps produce computer games, logs on to the internet.<br>Picture: Cancan Chu/Getty Images</strong><br><br>Three decades after temples were destroyed and scriptures burned during the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism is making a comeback in China. And, like most things in the super-competitive, rapidly developing country, it has become both big business and a field in which people are eager to get ahead.<br><br>That's creating a new breed of multi-tasking, tech-savvy, upwardly mobile monks.<br><br>"Our recruiting process is highly competitive," said Hui Jue, the deputy general manager of the 120-year-old Jade Buddha Temple in central Shanghai, who recently completed a master of business administration degree at Jiaotong University.<br><br>Fifteen monks from his temple have been on foreign language courses at the Shanghai International Studies University, and another batch have started MBA studies in Jiaotong's business school.<br><br>Such skills are necessary, Mr Hui believes, for the temple to spread Buddhist teachings in the modern world and to manage its growing business interests. As well as its grounds, Jade Buddha owns a vegetarian restaurant, a four-star hotel, a seven-floor office building and a food factory.<br><br>Many of China's temples have been little touched by time, especially in remote areas of the country. But Jade Buddha Temple's modern approach is no longer unusual.<br><br>Buddhism, introduced into China in about the first century, is the biggest religion in the country, with as many as 100 million adherents - that's more than 8 per cent of the Chinese population - according to some estimates.<br><br>The persecution of the Cultural Revolution is long gone and, while the government is not very enthusiastic about any religion, in recent decades it has given more support to Buddhism than other faiths.<br><br>China now has some 13,000 Buddhist temples and about 200,000 monks and nuns.<br><br>The ancient Shaolin Temple in Henan province has capitalised on its reputation as a birthplace of the martial arts to host international guests and stage kung fu displays around the world.<br><br>It owns a martial arts training school and Shaolin Development, a company producing vegetarian snacks and Zen tea. It also co-operates with entertainment companies in film-making and online game production.<br><br>Guangxiao Temple in Guangdong province has launched online worshipping, so users can offer virtual incense, fruit and flowers to electronic Buddhas.<br><br>The internet is also important for Mr Hui at Jade Buddha Temple. "The first thing in my daily work is to open the laptop to check e-mails and surf the internet," he said. "Everything in the temple is now processed online. No paperwork. Those who failed to pass the computer test were laid off and reassigned to non- office jobs."<br><br>Surfing the internet may seem a dangerous activity for people who are meant to be sequestering themselves from the world for spiritual contemplation. But Mr Hui has thought of that.<br><br>"Only certain people, such as we managers and those in charge of public relations, can get access to the internet. Others can only use the local area network, because it is hard to control what they will read on the internet," he said.<br><br>Mr Hui concedes that the lifestyle of a modern monk does not always permit much focus on the spiritual realm. "Interacting with the outside world occupies most of our time, so many monks have to use the noon break if they want to do meditation," he said.<br><br>But overall, he does not regret the change. "Before, everyone, including the abbot, had to clean the temple, and old monks were assigned to check tickets and guard the temple," he said. "But they often smoked and fell asleep, causing bad influences. Now, we have hired professional service companies to be responsible for temple security and cleaning. This works very well."<br><br></div>

All of these roles have been significant in their journey to touch, move and inspire others.<br><br>Â“Through more than two decades of learning with good teachers and our own journey in meditation, Lai Fun and I have taught and shared with many like-minded people. The inward transformation they have undergone and the way they look at life anew tells us that there is a greater urgency to reach out,Â” shares Tuck Loon.<br><br>Tuck Loon, a graphic designer by training, and Lai Fun, an IT consultant with a multinational oil and gas corporation for 9 years, quit their day jobs a few years ago to engage full-time into teaching meditation.<br><br>They are joined by Choy Boon Ling, a corporate trainer with 14 years of experience, who passionately shares their belief of helping others grow positively into a leading life with more love and wisdom.<br><br>At the centre, the three will facilitate courses which offer a contemporary approach to meditation, using mindfulness and loving-kindness as tools to guide participants into understanding the mechanics of the mind and transforming their perspectives on every aspect of their lives, from work to relationships.<br><br>Programmes at Clove&amp;Clive are designed for the different levels of the beginner, intermediate and experienced practitioner. There are follow up courses available for every level, serving to encourage a continuous practice of meditation which will result in a natural progression of making it a way of life.<br><br>Besides weekly sessions, practice retreats will also be conducted over the weekend. Classes are kept small to provide more individual attention and facilitate close sharing of experience and feedback with the facilitators and one another.<br><br>Clove&amp;Clive was set up with the immense moral and financial support from the trusted friends of the founders. In its initial stage, the courses are heavily subsidized and range from a nominal fee of RM160 to RM290 per course.<br><br>For more information on Clove&amp;Clive and the courses offered, please visit www.cloveNclive.com or mailto:cloveNclive@gmail.com or call Freddie Lee (+6)016-328 3366 [except between 6pm-7pm]<br></div>

Dhammaratana Thera, better known as Rev Ratana, was installed as chief monk of the Maha Vihara temple in Brickfields yesterday.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/dhammaratana.jpg"><br><br><strong>MY BLESSINGS: Six-month-old Rinzen Tee Juyn Young and his parents (from left) Chee Hui Yin, 32, and Tee Beng Chen ,32, presenting alms to Rev Ratana at the Maha Vihara temple in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, yesterday.</strong><br><br>The simple installation ceremony coincided with Kathina, a day of showing respect to monks. Rev Ratana replaces Ven Dr K. Sri Dhammananda Nayaka Maha Thera, who passed away on Aug 31 at the age of 87.<br><br>Rev Ratana told The Star that he would continue from the old leadership with focus on building a younger generation of compassionate youths.<br><br>Â“From my observation, parents are having difficulty with youths who are growing rebellious and they find difficulty in bringing them up.<br><br>Â“For this reason, I hope to organise different activities to guide youths to not challenge their parents.<br><br>Â“Most of all they must not speak when they are angry as they may say the wrong things and hurt others,Â” he added.<br><br>He also called on Malaysians living in a multi-racial society to respect each otherÂ’s religious and human values. Â“If adults do not practise tolerance, patience and compassion, then the seeds of discontent will continue with the younger generation.<br><br>Â“This will not be good for the economic and social progress of the nation,Â” he said.<br><br>Devotees marked Kathina by giving away alms in the form of robes and food to monks. Buddhist Missionary Societies of Malaysia secretary Datuk Chee Peck Kiat said it was a moment of happiness for the devotees to be part of the occasion.<br><br>Born in Ceylon on July 24, 1948, Rev Ratana arrived at the Brickfields temple on March 8, 1980.<br><br>Among his contributions during his 26 years of temple service were the setting up of the Ti-Ratana Welfare Centre free clinic at Ampang Jaya and a halfway house for outstation patients seeking treatment here.<br><br>Rev Ratana acknowledged that as a chief monk he had to face big challenges. But he is undaunted. He is determined to modernise the teaching of Buddhism and to show devotees how relevant it is in coping with modern life.<br><br>Â“In modern society, people no longer go to religious leaders to seek advice as they are too busy with work,Â” he said. Â“But as a religious leader, it is my duty and responsibility to reach out to them.<br><br>Â“Within my capacity, I hope I will be able to continue his (Rev Dhammananda's) service.Â”  Rev Ratana also hoped to work with the country's political leaders in building a developed nation.<br><br></div>

Do they achieve spiritual release?</span><br><br><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong> -- Pressure, now that is not an uncommon word for modern people. In Hongkong, bus drivers use dirty words to release it.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/templestay-s.jpg"><br><strong>More and more white collar workers in Asia are opting for short retreats in Buddhist temples to rejuvenate their lives</strong><br><br>While in Chongqing, more and more white collar workers are choosing to make short stays in temples to explore what life would be like without it - peace and contentment.<br><br>Well, how do city dwellers fare when they visit a temple? Do they achieve spiritual release?<br><br>Dressed in a long robe, 34 year old Wang Shiming is exercising with a broom. If it wasn't for his hairstyle and shoes, people would think he was just an ordinary monk.<br><br>Seems nobody can understand how he feels now. Afflicted by various troubles recently, this is not the first time Wang has escaped to this temple, not to pray, but to get away from the stresses of life.<br><br>Wang has been an insomniac for a while. "Every time I went to bed, all kinds of samples and data went to my mind," he says.<br><br>From his monthly phone bill to the future development of his business, Wang, the owner of a clothing manufacturer, has to think about it all. Always having to think back to whether or not he locked home though he had already arrived office.<br><br>The city's KTVs, theaters and clubs were not enough to rid Wang of all the overwhelming pressure. Mild-tempered Wang was shocked himself when he scolded one female colleague to tears for being 5 minutes late.<br><br>After having to go to the doctor to check a stomach ache, he says, "I was using my health to gain money."<br><br>Recalling all of the things he does miss about life in the city, the sunrise, the breakfast, Wang calls his assistant. But he turns off the phone immediately, a far cry from before, when answering the phone was his main job in the afternoon.<br><br>Time to work in the temple now. Today's task is to move books. Wang sweats a lot but feels much lighter.<br><br>Forget about the shower at home, Wang takes a cold shower at the temple, afterwards joining in a chat with some monks. He feels great after some loud laughter. Going to bed at 8:30, the end to a perfect day means a new day too.<br><br>"Going to the temple for a short time is a way of escaping pressure, but not the only way," Chinese psychologist Chen Lan says. "It's common that white collar workers in the city have to shoulder pressure from their work, studies, competition, marriage, and education for their child." But, just as the sources of pressure may differ, "the way to release pressure could be different too. If it's too severe, people have to go to a psychologist."<br><br>Well, for those with a lot of stress, but not too overwhelming an amount, a visit to a temple may be a good fit. And, in addition to being a good way for some to release pressure, temple stays can also promote Buddhism, Monk Deman of Huayan temple says.<br><br>Actually temple stays have already gained popularity in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. Besides allowing visitors to experience a monks' life in the temple, parents also sign their children up for short stays to teach them discipline.<br><br></div>
