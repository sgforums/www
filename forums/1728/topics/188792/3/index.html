I pulled myself up from my floor mat, straightened my itchy gray uniform and stumbled through the pre-dawn darkness to the temple, where pink lotus lanterns illuminated a small group of people waiting to begin their morning prostrations.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/sk-journey.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224540" rel="nofollow">In South Korea, Immersion in Buddhist Austerity </a></div>

The standard route taken by Buddhist tourists is Bodhgaya, Nalanda, Rajgir, Patna, Kushinagar, Lumbini, Sravasti and Sarnath."<br><br>"Hence a multi-entry visa will enable the tourists to travel to Nepal and be back in India and save time and trouble in having to reapply for visa in order to complete the circuit," it added.<br><br>The FICCI also called for a "multi-pronged marketing strategy" since different countries have followers of different Buddhist doctrines.<br><br>"This will help market the Buddhist sites in appropriate countries, target higher-spend category tourists from these existing countries and address new markets," it said.<br><br>There is also a need for proper implementation of conservation strategies and monitoring at regular intervals to make Buddhist monuments, sites and structures world-class destinations, it added.<br><br>The study noted that holistic development of Buddhist tourism in India assumes special significance in the light of the decision by India and China to celebrate 2007, as the India-China Year of Friendship Through Tourism and the designation of 2007 by India and Japan as the India Japan Tourism Exchange Year.</div>
