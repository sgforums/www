              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,
                                  speaking to a capacity audience in the Albert Hall in 1984 united his listeners
                                  instantly with one simple statement: "All beings want to be happy; they
                                  want to avoid pain and suffering." I was impressed at how he was able to touch
                                  what we share as human beings. He affirmed our common humanity, without in any
                                  way dismissing the obvious differences.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">When invited to look at Jesus
                                  through Buddhist eyes, I had imagined that I would use a 'compare and contrast'
                                  approach, rather like a school essay. I was brought up as a Christian and
                                  turned to Buddhism in my early thirties, so of course I have ideas about both
                                  traditions: the one I grew up in and turned aside from, and the one I adopted
                                  and continue to practise within. But after re-reading some of the gospel
                                  stories, I would like to meet Jesus again with fresh eyes, and to examine the
                                  extent to which he and the Buddha were in fact offering the same guidance, even
                                  though the traditions of Christianity and Buddhism can appear in the surface to
                                  be rather different.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">A little about how I came to be a
                                  Buddhist nun</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Having tried with sincerity to
                                  approach my Christian journey in a way that was meaningful within the context
                                  of everyday life, I had reached a point of deep weariness and despair. I was
                                  weary with the apparent complexity of it all; despair had arisen because I was
                                  not able to find any way of working with the less helpful states that would
                                  creep, unbidden, into the mind: the worry, jealousy, grumpiness, and so on. And
                                  even positive states could turn around and transform themselves into pride or
                                  conceit, which were of course equally unwanted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Eventually, I met Ajahn Sumedho, an
                                  American-born Buddhist monk, who had just arrived in England after training for
                                  ten years in Thailand. His teacher was Ajahn Chah, a Thai monk of the Forest
                                  Tradition who, in spite of little formal education, won the hearts of many
                                  thousands of people, including a significant number of Westerners. I attended a
                                  ten-day retreat at Oakenholt Buddhist Centre, near Oxford, and sat in agony on
                                  a mat on the floor of the draughty meditation hall, along with about 40 other
                                  retreatants of different shapes and sizes. In front of us was Ajahn Sumedho,
                                  who presented the teachings and guided us in meditation, with three other monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">This was a turning point for me.
                                  Although the whole experience was extremely tough - both physically and
                                  emotionally - I felt hugely encouraged. The teachings were presented in a
                                  wonderfully accessible style, and just seemed like ordinary common sense. It
                                  didn't occur to me that it was 'Buddhism'. Also, they were immensely practical
                                  and as if to prove it, we had, directly in front of us, the professionals -
                                  people who had made a commitment to living them out, twenty-four hours a day. I
                                  was totally fascinated by those monks: by their robes and shaven heads, and by
                                  what I heard of their renunciant lifestyle, with its 227 rules of training. I
                                  also saw that they were relaxed and happy - perhaps that was the most
                                  remarkable, and indeed slightly puzzling, thing about them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">I felt deeply drawn by the
                                  teachings, and by the Truth they were pointing to: the acknowledgement that,
                                  yes, this life is inherently unsatisfactory, we experience suffering or
                                  dis-ease - but there is a Way that can lead us to the ending of this suffering.
                                  Also, although the idea was quite shocking to me, I saw within the awakening of
                                  interest in being part of a monastic community.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">So now, after more than twenty years
                                  as a Buddhist nun, what do I find as I encounter Jesus in the gospel stories?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Well, I have to say that he comes
                                  across as being much more human than I remember. Although there is much said
                                  about him being the son of God, somehow that doesn't seem nearly as significant
                                  to me as the fact that he is a person - a man of great presence, enormous
                                  energy and compassion, and significant psychic abilities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">He also has a great gift for
                                  conveying spiritual truth in the form of images, using the most everyday things
                                  to illustrate points he wishes to make: bread, fields, corn, salt, children, trees.
                                  People don't always understand at once, but are left with an image to ponder.
                                  Also he has a mission - to re-open the Way to eternal life; and he's quite
                                  uncompromising in his commitment to, as he puts it, "carrying out his
                                  Father's will".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">His ministry is short but eventful.
                                  Reading through Mark's account, I feel tired as I imagine the relentless
                                  demands on his time and energy. It's a relief to find the occasional reference
                                  to him having time alone or with his immediate disciples, and to read how, like
                                  us, he at times needs to rest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">A story I like very much is of how,
                                  after a strenuous day of giving teachings to a vast crowd, he is sound asleep
                                  in the boat that is taking them across the sea. His calm in response to the
                                  violent storm that arises as he is sleeping I find most helpful when things are
                                  turbulent in my own life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">I feel very caught up in the drama
                                  of it all; there is one thing after another. People listen to him, love what he
                                  has to say (or in some cases are disturbed or angered by it) and are healed.
                                  They can't have enough of what he has to share with them. I'm touched by his
                                  response to the 4000 people who, having spent three days with him in the desert
                                  listening to his teaching, are tired and hungry. Realising this, he uses his
                                  gifts to manifest bread and fish for them all to eat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus dies as a young man. His
                                  ministry begins when he is thirty (I would be interested to know more of the
                                  spiritual training he undoubtedly received before then), and ends abruptly when
                                  he is only thirty-three. Fortunately, before the crucifixion he is able to
                                  instruct his immediate disciples in a simple ritual whereby they can re-affirm
                                  their link with him and each other (I refer, of course, to the last supper) -
                                  thereby providing a central focus of devotion and renewal for his followers,
                                  right up to the present time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">I have the impression that he is not
                                  particularly interested in converting people to his way of thinking. Rather
                                  it's a case of teaching those who are ready; interestingly, often the people
                                  who seek him out come from quite depraved or lowly backgrounds. It is quite
                                  clear to Jesus that purity is a quality of the heart, not something that comes
                                  from unquestioning adherence to a set of rules.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">His response to the Pharisees when
                                  they criticise his disciples for failing to observe the rules of purity around
                                  eating expresses this perfectly: "There is nothing from outside that can
                                  defile a man" - and to his disciples he is quite explicit in what happens
                                  to food once it has been consumed. "Rather, it is from within the heart
                                  that defilements arise." Unfortunately, he doesn't at this point go on to
                                  explain what to do about these.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">What we hear of his last hours: the
                                  trial, the taunting, the agony and humiliation of being stripped naked and
                                  nailed to a cross to die - is an extraordinary account of patient endurance, of
                                  willingness to bear the unbearable without any sense of blame or ill will. It
                                  reminds me of a simile used by the Buddha to demonstrate the quality of metta,
                                  or kindliness, he expected of his disciples: "Even if robbers were to
                                  attack you and saw off your limbs one by one, should you give way to anger, you
                                  would not be following my advice." A tall order, but one that clearly
                                  Jesus fulfills to perfection: "Father, forgive them for they know not what
                                  they do."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Confidence</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">So why did I need to look elsewhere
                                  for guidance? Was it simply that Jesus himself was in some way lacking as a
                                  spiritual template? Was it dissatisfaction with the church and its
                                  institutional forms - what Christianity has done to Jesus? Or was it simply
                                  that another way presented itself that more adequately fulfilled my need at
                                  that time?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Well, in Buddhism I found what was
                                  lacking in my Christian experience. It could be summed up in one word:
                                  confidence. I don't think I had fully realised how hopeless it all seemed,
                                  until the means and the encouragement were there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">There is a story of a Brahmin
                                  student called Dhotaka, who implored the Buddha: "Please, Master, free me
                                  from confusion!" The Buddha's perhaps somewhat surprising response was,
                                  "It is not in my practice to free anyone from confusion. When you yourself
                                  have understood the Dhamma, the Truth, then you will find freedom." What
                                  an empowerment!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">In the gospels we hear that Jesus
                                  speaks with authority; he speaks too of the need to have the attitude of a
                                  little child. Now, although this could be interpreted as fostering a child-like
                                  dependence on the teacher, Buddhist teachings have enabled me to see this
                                  differently.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">The word 'Buddha' means awake -
                                  awake to the Dhamma, or Truth, which the Buddha likened to an ancient overgrown
                                  path that he had simply rediscovered. His teaching points to that Path: it's
                                  here, now, right beneath our feet - but sometimes our minds are so full of
                                  ideas about life that we are prevented from actually tasting life itself!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">On one occasion a young mother,
                                  Kisagotami, goes to the Buddha, crazy with grief over the death of her baby
                                  son. The Buddha's response to her distress, as she asks him to heal the child,
                                  is to ask her to bring him a mustard seed - from a house where no one has ever
                                  died. Eventually, after days of searching, Kisagotami's anguish is calmed; she
                                  understands that she is not alone in her suffering - death and bereavement are
                                  inevitable facts of human existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">Jesus too sometimes teaches in this
                                  way. When a crowd had gathered, ready to stone to death a woman accused of
                                  adultery, he invites anyone who is without sin to hurl the first boulder. One
                                  by one they turn away; having looked into their own hearts, they are shamed by
                                  this simple statement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">In practice, I have found the
                                  process to be one of attuning, of attending carefully to what is happening
                                  within - sensing when there is ease, harmony; knowing also whenone's view is at
                                  odds with What Is. I find that the images that Jesus uses to describe the
                                  Kingdom of Heaven explain this well. It is like a seed that under favourable
                                  conditions germinates and grows into a tree. We ourselves create the conditions
                                  that either promote well-being and the growth of understanding, or cause harm
                                  to ourselves or others. We don't need a God to consign us to the nether regions
                                  of some hell realm if we are foolish or selfish - it happens naturally.
                                  Similarly, when we fill our lives with goodness, we feel happy - that's a
                                  heavenly state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">On that first Buddhist retreat it
                                  was pointed out that there is a way between either following or struggling to
                                  repress harmful thoughts that arise. I learned that, through meditation, I can
                                  simply bear witness to them, and allow them to pass on according to their
                                  nature - I don't need to identify with them in any way at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">The teaching of Jesus that even to
                                  have a lustful thought is the same as committing adultery had seemed too hard,
                                  while the idea of cutting off a hand or foot, or plucking out an eye should
                                  they offend is sensible enough - but how on earth do we do that in practice? I
                                  can see that it would require far more faith than I, at that time, had at my
                                  disposal! So I was overjoyed to learn of an alternative response to the states
                                  of greed, hatred or delusion that arise in consciousness, obscure our vision
                                  and lead to all kinds of trouble.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="EN-GB">So, as the Dalai Lama said:
                                  'Everyone wants to be happy; no one wants to suffer.' Jesus and the Buddha are
                                  extraordinary friends and teachers. They can show us the Way, but we can't rely
                                  on them to make us happy, or to take away our suffering. That is up to us.</span></p>
