              <p>It’s a fun learning journey… thank you for the interesting classes… really enjoyed them.<strong style="font-size: 13px;"> – Joyce</strong></p>
              <p>After attending these lessons. I have a better understanding of the Zen stories in another different angle. <strong style="font-size: 13px;">- Boon Tiong</strong></p>
              <p>I enjoyed this evening’s first lesson of The “Magic” of Zen at Tai 
              Pei Buddhist Centre very much. Thank you for painstakingly preparing and
               presenting such a promising course that I’ll look forward to attending 
              the next 8 weeks! <strong>- Jacqueline</strong></p>
              <p>I am very glad I attended the Zen class, and learnt a lot. If there 
              is module 2, I would like to sign up. I always enjoy your classes very 
              much. Jiayou! I hope have chance to join your Pure Land class soon… Your
               classes are always appealing to me, and I believe it is the same for 
              everyone else as well. Looking forward for next week’s 
              class! -Amituofo, <strong>MiaoYun</strong></p>
              <p>The “Raisin Experience” was wonderful! I really enjoyed the class. 
              You have made it very interesting with stories and illustrations… Thank 
              you for the effort. I have learnt more about Zen, and the harmony 
              between Zen and Pure Land in this class. If there is a Part 2 to this 
              course, I will be happy to enrol. ;) Have a Zen day. - With metta, <strong>Val</strong></p>
              <p>I really enjoyed the course with the numerous stories =) Wish I could
               have attended more but I had to miss some lessons when I went overseas.
               I thought the Zen videos and music were cool examples of how we can 
              find and be Zen in our everyday lives… Thanks for the course! 
              - Amituofo, <strong>Xinyi</strong></p>
              <p>The example of the Apple computer designs and how they 
              used Zen impressed me. Thank you very much for your teaching. See 
              you. Very best regards, <strong>Lay Har</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for coming up with the course on “Zen”. Before the course, I 
              could not put a definition to it. Was it an art form? A way of life? I 
              thoroughly enjoyed the easy pace and stories that embody Zen teachings, 
              photography, music, art, diet etc. So Zen is about simplicity in life, 
              things around us, about us, within us, things taken for granted and Pure
               Land teachings included! Why do we make life so complicated and 
              complexed; live and enjoy the moment as and when it should be! Yes, life
               should be lived as such (even more so before retirement)! – <strong>Choi Pheng</strong></p>
              <p>This was certainly a delightful course which covered myriad 
              interpretations of Zen. The koans are at times, elusive, most times, 
              enlightening, prompting a lot more mental adjustment on everyday life, a
               refreshing alternative to the structured sutra learning. For such a 
              popular word, I guess not many know its deeper meanings. This course has
               been well laid-out to explore that. Thank you for holding this course, 
              I’ve enjoyed it thoroughly. Looking forward to follow-up courses, if 
              any.- Amituofo, <strong>Shannon</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you, Teacher Shi’an, I enjoyed the “Magic of Zen” very much, especially the humourous parts. - Amitoufo, <strong>Brother Waichong</strong></p>
              <p>The course is filled with interesting and fun information 
              about Zen Buddhism. You incorporated the essense of Zen into different 
              aspects of our lives, which makes Zen a valuable tool to use in our 
              daily lives, if only we have enough wisdom. This is what I find so 
              touching and encouraging about your course… Thank you so much! æ‚¨ç”¨å¿ƒè‰¯è‹¦! 
              - Warm regards, <strong>Jo-Anne</strong></p>
              <p>I have enjoyed the Magic of Zen Course very much.  A big thank you to
               you. I appreciate very much your great effort to provide us with all 
              the interesting, touching and enlightening Zen stories; pictures of 
              conventional Zen-like furniture, decorations etc, and the practice 
              of Zen awareness in our daily living. Hope you will conduct more courses
               on Zen in the near future. Amituofo, <strong>Yuen Leng</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks for making such a tremendous effort to share your knowledge 
              on Zen. I have understood Zen better and it shows that Zen can be 
              practised at every moment… Thanks again. - Amituofo, <strong>Kee</strong></p>
              <p>I find this course pretty interesting, with various suitable stories 
              to illustrate your points. I particularly like the raisin lesson and 
              your sharing on the Apple and Muji brands as I was totally unaware of 
              their origins,,, From now onwards, I will particularly pay more 
              attention to the design of these products when I step inside these 
              stores… Thanks for the much information which you had painstakingly 
              sourced and taught us. - Amituofo, <strong>Janice</strong></p>
