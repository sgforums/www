              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Sister Ocean Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2016-12-30 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">The
              turning of the year is a natural time to pause and reflect on our lives, be it
              for the lunar or the Gregorian calendar. Many people prepare by cleaning or
              making resolutions. Some are excited about a new job or a new child, while
              others are living without food or shelter. But one thing holds true for
              everyone: none of us knows what the New Year will actually bring. The Buddha’s
              teaching on impermanence may seem redundant here, but I think this is the
              perfect time to examine it it more closely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No
              matter how many times I think I’ve understood the truth of impermanence, I find
              another corner of my mind that has attached to some sort of permanence, be it a
              certainty about someone’s character that I dislike, an opinion about politics,
              or a hidden belief about my own powerlessness. I know that the weather is
              always changing and I might remember that I, too, am always changing, but when
              it comes to what (and who) I like and dislike, it’s so easy to forget the
              impermanent nature of all phenomena. I also find myself caught in
              expectation-laden notions of impermanence, such as: “This headache is bound to
              change, I wish it would change now!” or “I know that this person standing
              before me is capable of change and has the same Buddha Nature as all beings, why
              doesn't he start acting like it?” Wherever there is a confused notion of
              impermanence, suffering is bound to ensue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Long live impermanence!</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Teachings
              on impermanence bring us face to face with the mental habit of trying to
              control and shape our environment to match our preferences, and our assumption
              that these strategies will bring about a lasting happiness. If you’ve ever
              raised a child, faced a serious illness, or been with someone as they died, it
              becomes painfully clear that controlling other people or even our own lives is
              not actually possible. As my teacher, the Venerable Master Thich Nhat Hanh, has
              written in his commentary on the Heart Sutra:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If
              we use our intelligence and insight, we can see how crucial impermanence is to
              life. If things weren’t impermanent, your situation couldn’t change, a child
              couldn’t grow up, a grain of corn would never become an ear of corn to eat.
              It’s not a negative note of music, it’s rather positive, because thanks to
              impermanence, everything is possible. Your disease can be cured, a regime
              characterized by dictatorship can change, we can do something to reverse the
              course of global warming—otherwise global warming would be there forever.
              Because of impermanence, there is hope.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So
              instead of complaining about impermanence, we must say: “long live
              impermanence!” The insight of impermanence can liberate us from much of our
              fear, sorrow, anger, and our feelings of separation. Knowing that everything is
              impermanent, we’re less attached to it. Flowers are beautiful, but when a
              flower dies, we don’t cry a lot. We know that flowers are impermanent. When we
              practice that awareness, we suffer much less. And we enjoy being alive much
              more. Knowing that things are impermanent, we will cherish them in the present
              moment. (Nhat Hanh 2012, 299)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Try it now</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Knowing
              that 2017 is impermanent, can we cherish each moment? Can we at least cherish
              more moments? Mindfulness practices are a direct and accessible way to cherish
              each moment more fully. There’s nothing to wait for. Try it now. Take a deep
              breath. Notice the sensation of breathing in the body. Relax your shoulders.
              When thoughts arise, notice them and then bring awareness back to the breath,
              with kindness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bring
              something to mind that you are naturally grateful for. Let this grow into a
              deeper joy and let that joy feed you. Then bring awareness back to the breath,
              with kindness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Feel
              the parts that are in pain and allow them to be as they are. Make space for the
              emotional and physical pain that is part of life. I like to say a silent “okay”
              to myself. Do it now. And again. Then bring awareness back to the breath, with
              kindness. A mindful year is simply one that is lived fully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-size: 13pt;">Mindfulness
              is not an individual matter</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              mindfulness can bring more joy into our lives, maintaining a practice does not
              prevent us from suffering. We don’t know what will happen in 2017, but there
              will be suffering and there will be joy. Wars will begin, and continue, and
              end. Some refugees will find safe shelter and others will not. Children will be
              born and some will die. People will get sick and some will be cured. People
              will marry and some will get divorced. People will commit suicide and some will
              help prevent suicide. The world is endlessly filled with joy and sorrow and
              more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              cannot control it all and if this realization does not bring up fear at some
              point, you are either completely enlightened or else you are still fighting the
              fear. It is easy to avoid. Our minds are great masters at distraction and
              denial. The people who say they have no fear are most likely the ones who have
              been able to avoid it, whereas the most courageous people I know face fear all
              the time and are not controlled by it. This is a very big difference.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              David Loy writes in Money, Sex, War, Karma, “Believing that mindfulness means
              attentiveness only to my immediate surrounding, and placing such limits on our
              awareness, is really another version of the basic problem: our sense of
              separation from each other and the world we are “in.” (Loy 2008, 81) Avoid
              trying to draw lines between “your practice” and “the world.” There is no
              choice to make between caring for the world and caring for yourself—you are
              part of the world; the world is part of you. The challenge is learning to live
              and practice in a way that allows you to care for all beings at once. When you
              do this, the lines between “inside” and “outside” will become blurred and
              finally removed, dissolving all fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Are you sure?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              way to carry the contemplation of impermanence and uncertainty into daily life
              is to ask ourselves from time to time, “Are you sure?” This is especially
              important when we are suffering. This is not a question of negation but a tool
              to bring us into the present moment and out of endless thoughts of sorrow,
              anxiety, and doubt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Looking
              to the New Year, what are you hoping for? Then ask yourself, “Are you sure?”
              Are you really sure that the thing you want will make you happy? It might, yet
              it might not. Both possibilities are okay. It is the asking that’s important.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Likewise,
              what are you dreading in 2017? And ask again, “Are you sure?” Are you sure the
              thing you really do not want to happen will prevent you from experiencing
              peace, joy, and true love in the next year? In seeing things as they are, much
              anxiety vanishes because our fears are usually worse than any possible reality.
              And when reality is worse than our fears, we need all the courage and
              compassion available to survive, to heal, and to thrive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              the brilliant Radical Dharma, Reverend angel Kyoto williams asks, “What places
              are you not feeling? What part of you are you rejecting? What aspect of you are
              you not loving? What truth are you not willing to accept?” (williams, Owens,
              and Syedullah 2016, 96) Rather than looking at how to make our lives more
              comfortable or our paycheck bigger in 2017, we practitioners on the Buddhist
              path can take these questions to guide ourselves into moments of aliveness that
              eventually string together to become a year well-lived, present to enjoy what
              there is to be enjoyed, ready to respond to tragedy and suffering with the
              strength to be vulnerable and the courage to heal, remembering that all is
              subject to change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Each
              moment is new and yet connected to every other moment, past and future. They
              cannot exist without each other. We cannot exist without each other. It is
              always a New Year, and we, too, are always new. Don’t wait for a specific day
              to begin living deeply, living fully. The New Year is our very life, always
              changing. The New Year is NOW.</span></p>
