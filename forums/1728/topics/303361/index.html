In fact if Beth could stop n think about how mom may sadden over her actions of assertiveness, compassion may arise in her heart instead n see mom in a different light. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Its' how Buddhdharma teaches us to see things fr a different perspective - "zhuan3 jing4"<br><br>In Beth n friends story, applying the teaching of impermanent, she should be able to know what is the piority in her life at that moment. That is to keep mom accompany in her short stay with her, or to win a badminton tournament. I think the answer is clear. In Buddhism teachings, our parents are the ones whose kindness we could never repay enough. So again, the chioce is clear n in a way Beth did the rt thing in rejecting her friends. It was not about assertiveness, I guess it  was more about piorities. Nothing difficult, nothing great, appologise maybe but nothing to feel guilty of. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yes we hv our own needs n opinions, but if in voicing them out ( assertively) may hurt or harm others or even society at large, then it is not worth it. Of cos if its' the other way round ie our actions could benefit others, then go ahead n be assertive. I guess this is when wisdom needs to be applied. Then again u may ask how then can ppl like us hv the relevent wisdom? The answer is always the same: Study the Dharma n practise the path. Through " jie, ting " then " hui" can develope. It may takes a while, but we must not be impatient. To be assertive in one's own desires ( in order not to be a pushover) could be harmful if such actions arise from " self- cherishness" which is the cause of subject-object attachment.( This will need AEN or Thusness to elaborate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>I think the only "assertiveness" in Buddhadharma is about  us practising the Dharma diligently. Then we will be able to solve all kinds of situations in our lives wisely n be liberated fr our own defilments n entrapment.</div>

              <p>True assertiveness is never aggressive, in my opinion. It will never put self before others. But the assertiveness concept that you explain using your understanding of Buddhism is just only 'others before self'.</p>
              <p>I agree that the Buddhist way is about observing precepts or maintaining high self-awareness at all times, so that one would be able to cultivate the necessary wisdom to handle different types of situations.</p>
              <p>However, before anyone achieves that kind of high awareness, they need to learn communication techniques that will at least help them for the time being while they learn to become truly non-attached.</p>
              <p>I also agree with you that the assertiveness demonstrated by Beth can be viewed as knowing one's priorities, but whatever it is, assertiveness is about understanding and taking care of your needs and priorities, so that you can help yourself and/or specific group of people you need to help at that particular moment.</p>
              <p>True assertiveness is about knowing when and how to say 'No', without ignoring the needs and priorities of others at the same time.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that being assertive about one's own desires may be viewed as attachment and hence essentially harmful. However, this is not what I want to achieve. I believe there is a very, very long way to go, for most to attain non-attachment and wisdom in handling many types of life's challenging situations.</p>
              <p>The assertiveness example that I gave is just one small example. There are many that can be applied together with Buddhist concepts. That is my main intention and wish for myself, which is to eventually help myself and other people at the same time, Buddhists or non-Buddhists, to maintain a healthy self-esteem before attaining true non-attachment to self.</p>
              <p>The above example is my way of trying to say there is a need to find more methods or means to bridge the cultivation gap between secular assertiveness and the long path towards wisdom and non-attachment taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Something has to be done, to be learnt first through ordinary or secular measures or by applying secular knowledge (only those which is established to be effective and practical for most people to follow) while trying to understand, practise and finally attain true wisdom and non-attachment to self at the same time.</p>
              <p>My wish is to be able to give a talk, or write a book one day, about mutually-beneficial assertiveness techniques or guidelines with many real-life examples, that any Buddhist or anyone interested in Buddhist teachings can use while cultivating 'jie, ding, hui' and practising non-attachment.</p>
              <p>From there, I hope what I share will be able to help these people in some small way, so that they will not have to feel lost, feel alone, or struggle to understand and finally be able to apply quickly and effectively on their own (or despite having attended numerous Buddhist talks), some Buddhist concepts which sound too general, ambiguous, or profound in nature.</p>
              <p>My target groups are: slow and/or lazy people learning Buddhism on their own or with their own Buddhist groups. So my views can appear to be quite unorthodox or selfish when viewed by most of you here.</p>
              <p>As such, I seek the understanding and tolerance of fellow Buddhists here. :)</p>
