            <div class='col-md body'>I used to do brainwave research on An-Hsiang ChÂ’an practitioners for a period of time. Out of 7 subjects who are enlightened, I found out that their brainwaves are somewhat different from others. First of all, their main frequencies all appears at the lower Alpha or Delta range that indicates they are more relaxed. Secondly, bandwidth of the main frequency is much narrower that indicates more order and concentration. Thirdly, overall brainwave rhythm is more consistent that indicates higher mind stability. And finally, synchronization of both hemispheres is higher that indicates better coordination.<br><br>What surprised me is that one subjectÂ’s brainwave even showed the pattern of Schumann resonance(See figure below). He told me that he was in the state of deep An-Hsiang while measuring. I guess perhaps that is the state of mind what the the Chinese called Â“Men in one with the HeavenÂ”.<br><br><img src="http://home.pchome.com.tw/life/anshiang/fft78.gif"><br><br>The above research was incomplete because no comparison was made to others other than An-Hsiang Ch'an practitioners. ItÂ’s purely my personal interest and I was not trained in that area. It was only good enough for me to be deeply involved in the practice of An-Hsiang ChÂ’an. And the research was stopped because I knew that current scientific progress is not advanced enough to prove anything yet. We could only get a small glimpse of it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, thanks for sharing with us your research, it is most interesting. I believe anyone in a meditate state will have a much more stable and calm mind.

They are also present during stress and anxiety. Beta waves oscillate between approximately 14 and 30 Hz (cycles per second).<br><br><strong>Alpha:</strong> Alpha occur when we are relaxed and not thinking about anything in particular. Alpha waves are also associated with a calm and focused mental state. Alpha waves oscillate between 8and 14 Hz.<br><br><strong>Theta:</strong> Theta is a state of deep relaxation and is often associated with bursts of creative insight; sleep learning and vivid mental imagery. It is also found in more advanced Meditators. Theta waves oscillate between 4 and 8 Hz.<br><br><strong>Delta:</strong> Delta is the slowest of brainwave activity and is found during deep, dreamless sleep and sometimes in very experienced Meditators. They oscillate between .5 and 4 Hz.<br><br>NOTE: The brainwave states are an indication of the most dominant patterns during<br>any given mental activity. The brain is a dynamic, living organ. During these dominant<br>patterns, other frequencies still exist and there is no exact, single frequency that our<br>brain operates on.<br><br>Many more articles on Meditation and the Brain: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43006-2005Jan2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43006-2005Jan2.html</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html</a></div>

You're really resourceful.<br><br>Well, I forgot to mention that An-Hsiang ChÂ’an practitioners donÂ’t practice sitting meditation. As meditation often refers to meditate in a sitting position. We do not use the word Â‘meditateÂ’ to describe our method. Instead, we call it Â‘zih4 jyue2Â’ or Â‘self-awarenessÂ’. We observe all activities in the mind 24 hours a day in all positions and conditions. All subjects were told to maintain their normal daily state of mind while measuring the brainwave except that they had to close their eyes. ItÂ’s not like other brainwave research where they need to sit and meditate for a certain time before measuring. As far as I know, there are a few experienced practitioners(over 15 years of experience) can maintain the state of deep An-Hsiang almost all day long even when they are sleeping. An-Hsiang ChÂ’an inherits the teachings of Master Hui Neng. For himself did not encourage sitting meditation either.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, it seems like your master is not very different from my master! We also emphasize on self-awareness, we do not emphasize on sitting meditation. When someone asked my master why he did not stay in a Monastery to meditate/chant/pray to xiu xing but goes everywhere around Taiwan, my master replied 'Xiu Xing' is Xing2 Zhong1 Xiu1, it does not mean sitting and chanting whole day. But 24 hour cultivation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My dharma teacher also says that her zheng ding is 24 hours, no matter what she do, even in sleep it is the same.. and seldom have/dont have dreams. I'm still really far from that.... I only have a taste of 'an hsiang' when I really want to practise or during sitting meditation. My practise is still very poor...</div>
