              <p>Totally agree with you.</p>
              <p>And what is no self?</p>
              <p>No self means right now, sensation of touch on keyboard!</p>
              <p>Sound of keyboard typing!</p>
              <p>Words appearing on screen!</p>
              <p>But no separate experiencer. Just that.</p>
              <p>To understand No-Self is not to think in terms of existence or
                                      non existence.</p>
              <p>It is to live fully in this very moment, as the pure action
                                      without doer, as the pure sensation without perceiver.</p>
              <p>It is Alive, it is NOT dead.</p>

              <p>BTW I have to add, realisation No-Self is not just living fully
                                          in this very moment.</p>
              <p>An insight has to occur, a quantum shift of perception. Then one
                                          will realise that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all along</strong></span>,
                                          there has never been a separate self, perceiver, or doer. It is not
                                          a stage to enter, no effort is necessary, only natural luminosity
                                          shining everywhere.</p>
              <p>That is why diligent practice of mindfulness, with right views,
                                          is necessary to uncover our true nature.</p>

                                          as Mirror Bright Clarity</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;"><span><br> I got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find
                                          out more about the experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching
                                          of impermanence syncs deeply with what I experience in life. I am
                                          faced with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by
                                          financial crisis. At that point in time I have no idea that
                                          Buddhism is so profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The
                                          mystery of life cannot be understood, I seek for a refuge in
                                          Buddhism to alleviate my sorrows caused by the financial crisis but
                                          it turned out to be the missing key towards experiencing total
                                          presence.<br> <br> I wasn’t that resistant then about the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but
                                          the idea that all phenomenon existence is empty of an inherent
                                          ‘self’ or ‘Self’ did not quite get into me. Are they talking about
                                          the ‘Self’ as a personality or ‘Self’ as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we
                                          do away even with the ‘Witness’ itself or the Witness is another
                                          illusion itself?<br> <br> There is thinking, no thinker<br> There is sound, no hearer<br> Suffering exists, no sufferer<br> Deeds there are, no doer<br> <br> I was meditating the above stanza deeply…about its meaning until
                                          one day, suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it was so clear, there was
                                          nothing else, just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’
                                          resounding…. It was so clear, so vivid!<br> <br> That experience is so familiar, so real and so clear. It is the
                                          same experience of “I AM”….it is without thought, without concepts,
                                          without intermediary, without anyone there, without any
                                          in-between…What is it? IT is Presence! But this time it is not ‘I
                                          AM’, it is not asking ‘who am I’, it is not the pure sense of “I
                                          AM”, it is ‘TONGSss….’, the pure Sound…<br> Then come Taste, just the Taste and nothing else….<br> The heart beats…..<br> the Scenery…<br> <br> There is no gap in between, no longer a few months gap for it to
                                          arise…<br> There never was a stage to enter, no I to cease and never has it
                                          existed<br> There is no entry and exit point…<br> There is no Sound out there or in here…<br> There is no ‘I’ apart from the arising and ceasing…<br> The manifold of Presence….<br> Moment to moment Presences unfolds…</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;"><span>Presence is the Crystal Bright Clarity</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;"><strong><span>Updated comments: Insight into no-self has arisen but
                                          non-dual experience is still not stabilized. The tendency to
                                          experience as a clear mirror reflecting still persist, however, the
                                          attention is shifted to experiencing pure presence rest in being
                                          authenticated by mere phenomenon. There is no more resistance
                                          towards phenomena manifestation, the ‘illusion’ of a background is
                                          seen and effort to sink back to a void background diminishes
                                          substantially.</span></strong></p>

              <p>And also, the pure compassion of the Bodhisattva for sentient beings, even though he never views sentient beings them as entities and concepts 'to be saved'.</p>
              <p>There is simply pure compassion going forth towards these sentient beings, even though he never sees beings as separate from from himself. No internal and external. Just pure love and compassion. And pure action arising spontaneously out of compassion.</p>
              <p>This will explain why a Bodhisattva can have compassion. Only the conceptualized mind sees contradiction. It thinks 'no-self' in terms of concepts, in terms of non-existence or existence. And miss the essence.</p>

              <p>Vimalakirti Sutra:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thereupon, Manjusri, the crown prince, addressed the Licchavi
                                      Vimalakirti: "Good sir, how should a bodhisattva regard all living
                                      beings?"</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti replied, "Manjusri, a bodhisattva should regard
                                      all livings beings as a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in
                                      water or as magicians regard men created by magic. He should regard
                                      them as being like a face in a mirror; like the water of a mirage; like
                                      the sound of an echo; like a mass of clouds in the sky; like the
                                      previous moment of a ball of foam; like the appearance and
                                      disappearance of a bubble of water; like the core of a plantain tree;
                                      like a flash of lightning; like the fifth great element; like the
                                      seventh sense-medium; like the appearance of matter in an immaterial
                                      realm; like a sprout from a rotten seed; like a tortoise-hair coat;
                                      like the fun of games for one who wishes to die; like the egoistic
                                      views of a stream-winner; like a third rebirth of a once-returner; like
                                      the descent of a nonreturner into a womb; like the existence of desire,
                                      hatred, and folly in a saint; like thoughts of avarice, immorality,
                                      wickedness, and hostility in a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance;
                                      like the instincts of passions in a Tathagata; like the perception of
                                      color in one blind from birth; like the inhalation and exhalation of an
                                      ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessation; like the track of a
                                      bird in the sky; like the erection of a eunuch; like the pregnancy of a
                                      barren woman; like the unproduced passions of an emanated incarnation
                                      of the Tathagata; like dream-visions seen after waking; like the
                                      passions of one who is free of conceptualizations; like fire burning
                                      without fuel; like the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate
                                      liberation.</p>
              <p><strong>"Precisely thus, Manjusri, does a bodhisattva who realizes the ultimate selflessness consider all beings."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manjusri then asked further, "Noble sir, if a bodhisattva
                                      considers all living beings in such a way, how does he generate the

              <p>Vimalakirti replied, "Manjusri, when a bodhisattva considers
                                      all living beings in this way, <strong>he thinks: 'Just as I have realized the

                                      the love that is truly a refuge for all living beings; the love that is
                                      peaceful because free of grasping; the love that is not feverish,
                                      because free of passions; the love that accords with reality because it
                                      is equanimous in all three times; the love that is without conflict
                                      because free of the violence of the passions; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the love that is nondual

                                      intrinsic nature; the love that is even, its aspirations being equal;

              <p>The answer is actually very simple...</p>
              <p>The "thing" is consciousness.. The "thing" is what you
                                                experience as yourself now.</p>
              <p>When the physical body dies, the conscoiusness changes state,
                                                but it is still consciousness. There is no some 'thing' beyond
                                                you... it is all just change of state according to conditions.</p>

              <p>I agree with you... but would like elaborate on the inseparability of conditions and consciousness and its relation to rebirth.</p>
              <p>Your post clearly explains the inseparability of conditions and presence. But consciousness is very easily misunderstood as the experiencer or transmigratory entity of rebirth.</p>
              <p>It's very long, but the essence are on top, and alot are elaboration.</p>

              <p><br>Thus have I heard:</p>
              <p>Once the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's grove,
                                                Anathapindika's park. At that time a pernicious view had arisen in a
                                                bhikkhu named Sati, the son of a fisherman: "As I know the Teaching of
                                                the Blessed One this consciousness transmigrates through existences,
                                                not anything else." Then many bhikkhus heard that this pernicious view
                                                had arisen in the bhikkhu named, Sati the son of a fisherman: "As I
                                                know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates
                                                through existences, not anything else."</p>
              <p>Then those bhikkhus approached the bhikkhu Sati, the son of a
                                                fisherman, and asked: "Friend, Sati, is it true, that such an
                                                pernicious view has arisen to you: ‘As I know the Teaching of the
                                                Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not
                                                anything else’?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this
                                                consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else."</p>
              <p>Then those bhikkhus thinking to dissuade the bhikkhu Sati from
                                                that pernicious view, cross examined him, asked for reasons and
                                                discussed with him: "Friend, Sati do not say that, do not misrepresent
                                                the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that. The Blessed One has
                                                shown in various ways, that consciousness arises dependently. Without a
                                                cause there is no arising of consciousness." Even when so much was
                                                said, he held on to his pernicious view tenaciously and would not give
                                                it up and said: "As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this
                                                consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else."</p>
              <p>When the bhikkhus could not dissuade the bhikkhu Sati from that
                                                pernicious view, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage, sat to
                                                one side and said: "Venerable sir, this pernicious view has arisen in a
                                                bhikkhu named Sati, the son of a fisherman: "As I know the Teaching of
                                                the Blessed One this consciousness transmigrates through existences,
                                                not anything else." Then we approached the bhikkhu Sati and asked him:
                                                "Friend, Sati, is it true, that such an pernicious view has arisen to
                                                you: ‘As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness
                                                transmigrates through existences, not anything else’?"</p>
              <p>"Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Sati said to us: "Yes, friends, ‘as
                                                I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness
                                                transmigrates through existences, not anything else’." Then we
                                                bhikkhus, thinking to dissuade the bhikkhu Sati from that pernicious
                                                view, cross examined him, asked for reasons and discussed with him:
                                                'Friend, Sati do not say that, do not misrepresent the Blessed One. The

                                                is no arising of consciousness'." Even when we cross questioned, asked
                                                for reasons and studied together with him, he held on to his pernicious
                                                view tenaciously and would not give it up. As we could not dissuade the
                                                bhikkhu Sati from that pernicious view, we came to inform you about
                                                it."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu and said,
                                                "Come bhikkhu, in my name, call the bhikkhu Sati, tell him the Teacher
                                                wants him." That bhikkhu consented and approached the bhikkhu Sati and
                                                told him, "Friend, the Teacher wants you." The bhikkhu Sati said "Yes,
                                                friend" and approached the Blessed One, paid homage and sat to one
                                                side.</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One said: "Sati, is it true, that such an
                                                pernicious view has arisen to you. ‘As I know the Teaching of the
                                                Blessed One, this consciousness tansmigrates through existences, not
                                                anything else’?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, venerable sir, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this
                                                consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else."</p>
              <p>"Sati, what is that conscciousness?"</p>
              <p>"Venerable sir, it is that which feels and experiences, that
                                                which reaps the results of good and evil actions done here and there."</p>
              <p>"Foolish man, to whom do you know me having taught the Dhamma
                                                like this. Haven’t I taught, in various ways that consciousness is
                                                dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of
                                                consciousness. Yet you, foolish man, on account of your wrong view, you
                                                misrepresent me, as well as destroy yourself and accumulate much
                                                demerit, for which you will suffer for a long time."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, what do
                                                you think, has this this bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, learned
                                                anything from this dispensation?" "No, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>When this was said the bhikkhu Sati became silent, unable to
                                                reply back, and sat with drooping shoulders and eyes turned down. Then
                                                the Blessed One, knowing that the bhikkhu Sati had become silent,
                                                unable to reply back, and was sitting with drooping shoulders and with
                                                eyes turned down, told him: "Foolish man, you will be known on account
                                                of this pernicious view; now I will question the bhikkhus on this."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you too know
                                                of this Teaching, the wrong view of the bhikkhu Sati, the son of a
                                                fisherman, on account of which he misrepresents us and also destroys

              <p>"No, venerable sir. In various ways we have been taught that
                                                consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no arising
                                                of consciousness."</p>
              <p>"Good, bhikkhus! Good that you know the Dhamma taught by me. In
                                                various ways I have taught that consciousness arises dependently.
                                                Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, this
                                                bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, by holding to this wrong view,
                                                misrepresents us and destroys himself and accumulates much demerit, and
                                                it will be for his suffering for a long time.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the condition dependent
                                                upon which it arises. If consciousness arises on account of eye and
                                                forms, it is reckoned as eye consciousness. If on account of ear and
                                                sounds it arises, it is reckoned as ear consciousness. If on account of
                                                nose and smells it arises, it is reckoned as nose consciousness. If on
                                                account of tongue and tastes it arises, it is reckoned as tongue
                                                consciousness. If on account of body and touch it arises, it is
                                                reckoned as body consciousness. If on account of mind and mind-objects
                                                it arises, it is reckoned as mind consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as a
                                                fire is reckoned based on whatever that fire burns - fire ablaze on
                                                sticks is a stick fire, fire ablaze on twigs is a twig fire, fire
                                                ablaze on grass is a grass fire, fire ablaze on cowdung is a cowdung
                                                fire, fire ablaze on grain thrash is a grain thrash fire, fire ablaze
                                                on rubbish is a rubbish fire - so too is consciousness reckoned by the
                                                condition dependent upon which it arises. In the same manner
                                                consciousness arisen on account is eye and forms is eye consciousness.
                                                Consciousness arisen on account of ear and sounds is ear consciousness.
                                                Consciousness arisen on account of nose and smells is nose
                                                conscioussness. Consciousness arisen on account of tongue and tastes is
                                                taste consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of body and touch
                                                is body consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of mind and
                                                mind-objects is mind consciousness.</p>

                                                within himself the joy of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Happy is he
                                                who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness.'</p>
              <p>"With the abandoning of pleasure and pain -- as with the

                                                fourth Jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain; and purified by
                                                equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
              <p>"On seeing a form with the eye he does not become greedy for pleasant
                                                forms, or averse to disagreeable forms. He abides with mindfulness of
                                                the body established and with a immeasureable mind. He knows the
                                                deliverance of mind and the deliverance through wisdom as it really is,
                                                where unwholesome states cease completely. Having abandoned the path of
                                                agreeing and disagreeing, he experiences whatever feeling that arises -
                                                pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant - just as it
                                                is. He is not delighted or pleased with those feelings and he does not
                                                appropriates them. Interest in those feelings ceases. With the
                                                cessation of interest, clinging ceases. With no clinging, there is no

                                                or death, no grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure or distress.
                                                Thus ceases the complete mass of dukkha.</p>

              <p>The
                      question is wrongly put and the Buddha's reponse when asked such a
                      question was to reject it as an improper question. Having rejected the
                      question he would then inform the questioner of what he ought to have
                      asked: "With what as condition is there birth?"<br><br>The reason that
                      it is an improper question is that rebirth is taught as the
                      continuation of a process, and not as the passing on of any sort of
                      entity. For a more complete exposition of the subject see Mahasi
                      Sayadaw's <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/a_discourse_on_paticcasamuppada_.htm">Discourse on Paticcasamuppada</a>.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Dhammanando Bhikkhu</p>

                              I understand what you are saying but the "what" doesnt necessarily have to mean one thing like some real entity it could also mean many things. I dont think any assumptions were being made it is just a question anyway nothing right or wrong about it.
                              *
                              
                              
                              *</p>
              <p>-----------------------------<br><br>The point is that the question is phrased wrong requiring at best an ambigious answer that will confuse more than edify. <br><br>Buddha
              in fact discussed this with Sharputra saying that if he answers the
              question "yes there is something that undergoes birth" people will
              become confused and assuem there is a permanent self that undergoes
              retribution of action and so on. Likewise, if he answers the question
              "no, there is nothing which undergoes rebirth" likewise there are those
              who will assume there are no consequences of action and so on and will
              therefore feel no compelling need observe the principles of karma and
              so on. <br><br>Therefore when asked the question "what takes rebirth" he points out that question itself is flawed. <br><br>The
              question should be "Why is there birth?" The answere to that question
              is easy. There is birth, i.e. suffering, because of affliction and
              action. <br><br>As long as the aggregates are afflicted, afflicted aggregates will continue to be appropriated. <br><br>In
              Madhyamaka it is explained there is birth because of the innate
              self-grasping "I am" appearing to the afflicted mind. It is asserted
              that what appropriates birth in a new series of aggregates is the
              mental habit "I am." That "I am" is baseless, has no correspondence in
              the aggregates or seperate from them or in any one of them, just as a
              car is not found in its parts, seperate from them, or in any one of the
              parts. Nevertheless, the imputation "car" allows us to use cars
              effectively. Likewise, the mental habit "I am" is proper as both the
              agent of action and the object upon which it ripens even though it is
              basically unreal and has no basis in the aggregates, outside the
              aggregates, or in any one of them, but allows us to treat the aggreates

              <p>I have replied plenty above, but I'm going to summarise one for you right now. It replies all your questions asked.</p>
              <p>In fact this is an old post I did months ago. Just updated a bit only.</p>
              <p>It is a bit difficult for me to translate to Chinese but if you do not understand any parts, please feel free to clarify.</p>
              <p>Oh and btw, after Maitreya, there are still countless Buddhas
                                                              to come. So there's always this opportunity, but it all depends on
                                                              whether the yuan for the sentient being has arisen to meet, cultivate
                                                              and realise the dharma.</p>
              <p>And also... after the end of this universe, there will be countless universes to follow. Never ending cycles of birth and destruction. <strong>But this is only talking about relative truths, Ultimate Reality is that there is no universe out there, the universe is empty, and of course no 'birth and destruction' (Empty). As Longchen said, "There is no some 'thing' beyond
                                      you... it is all just change of state according to conditions." That means all there is is an experiential reality (consciousness) that is empty, arising and changing according to conditions.<br></strong></p>
              <p><br>To answer your question, "What is reborn?"<br><br>The basis of this question is the false assumption that there is 'something' or an entity that is reborn.<br><br>The question 'what' or 'who' is exactly pointed out by Buddha to be irrelevant, false from the beginning.<br><br>In
                                                                                          other words -- the question cannot be asked that way, because to say
                                                                                          'what' or 'who' presumes there must be an existent entity or self
                                                                                          behind birth, but in reality no such entity can be found. In Buddhism,
                                                                                          there is no such thing as an existing soul or atman that 'passes on' to
                                                                                          the next life, or an agent that is the subject of birth and suffering.<br><br>Rather, the Buddha say, it should be correctly asked 'Why', or "With what as condition is there birth and suffering?'<br><br>And
                                                                                          the answer for that is very simple. There is birth, i.e. suffering,
                                                                                          because of affliction and action. As long as the aggregates are
                                                                                          afflicted, afflicted aggregates will continue to be appropriated.</p>
              <p>And the primary affliction/delusion is the conceit of 'I am'. This conceit is false and delusional.</p>
              <p>And when ignorance is removed through awakening of Insight, until all fetters and afflictions are dissolved, there will be no more conditions for Birth to arise. This is Nirvana.</p>
              <p>Birth will arise moment to moment, again and again until and only until enlightenment.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as a "soul expiry date" or even a
                                              "soul" in the first place. Birth will arise whenever there is
                                              condition for it to arise, and the conditions for birth will perpetuate only until enlightenment and liberation.</p>
              <p>There is consciousness but it must not be misunderstood as an experiencer or transmigratory entity of rebirth, otherwise it will end up like Sati's false views. But if it is as explained by longchen, the essence of emptiness is there. But it may be misunderstood by the reader.</p>
              <p><br>Regarding birth, the Buddha taught the 12 Dependent links of
                                                                                          Origination which is founded on the principle of Dependent Arising.<br><br><strong>Note

              <div>Q. So there is no self (Atman). so what exactly is it
                                      that is reborn, and how does what is reborn pass from one body to
                                      another?<br>   Thanks in advance for any answers received.  <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/style_emoticons/Default2/bow.gif" alt="bow.gif"><br></div>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p>The question is wrongly put and the Buddha's reponse when asked
                                      such a question was to reject it as an improper question. Having
                                      rejected the question he would then inform the questioner of what
                                      he ought to have asked: "With what as condition is there
                                      birth?"<br> <br> The reason that it is an improper question is that rebirth is
                                      taught as the continuation of a process, and not as the passing on
                                      of any sort of entity. For a more complete exposition of the

              <p>I think this passage summarises very nicely.</p>
              <p>The problem with the I AM experience is that it makes a person assume that there is a part of him/her (that is beyond the personality) that will go on forever. And more often then not, either this "I AM" or the alaya is mistaken as a permanent soul.</p>
              <p>However, to a person who experiences non-duality (and emptiness), he understands that 'this is it!' and there is nothing beyond this. There is no self-existing soul that is apart from the personality. All are just changes according to the condition at that precise moment. To a non-dual person, there is no preference towards an assumed permanent part that is beyond the thoughts and personality. It is non-dual (not two), there is no seeing in terms of separate parts. That also means, there is no seeing 'any body' as a person out there. All are just perceptions and the amazing power of cognition discriminates and see many things, persons and object outside of the self.</p>
              <p>This truth of no-self and non-separation may sound very scary or disturbing to a person who only understand it mentally or conceptually. But the actual experience is not so. To the non-dual person, permanent or impermanence, things and objects are just concepts... if one don't get bothered by it... it is not an issue at all.</p>
