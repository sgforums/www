              <p>First time i ask a question here, before i search from other source maybe would have some guide here.</p>
              <p>Buddhist do not believe there is a soul, but I do believe there is a soul(ç²¾ç¥žä½“) as i am a chinese, so I do not think of a better english word to use in this context. My question is, when a sentinent being has ended his life, there would be rebirth due to karmic forces, they will rebirth to different releams....so does this "soul" that i term as, has a lifespan, how many times can this soul contnue to go for rebirth, I read that buddha also has a lifespan, but it is very long that usually they put it as infinite...and sentinent being all has buddha nature, but accordance to the article i posted here in another thread, we sentinent beings are actually a manifestition of a higher heaven being, so, does our this "soul" has a expire date.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Mitreya come to this world to preech the dharma, that would be closed to the end of this world, a new world will be born again.Then what happen to those whom have not attain enlightenment and out of the six releam?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps anyone here could share, but try not to post long extractred articles, maybe use your own words to explain, thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi Bodhi Hut,</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.</p>
              <p>The word soul means different things to different people. So quite hard to define. Some people define the alaya as the soul. But you must bear in mind that even the alaya has no inherent existence.</p>
              <p>But your true nature is timeless. That means 'it' will go on for infinity.</p>
              <p>It is far better to have an authentic experience, then to find out from the internet. Many information on the internet are not complete truth. You will get even more confused.</p>

              <p>By 'authentic experience', i meant meditate to directly experience the timeless Presence (Buddha Nature) which is your true nature.</p>
              <p>Once, you have that direct experience, you will know, without any doubt, that the true nature is forever.</p>
              <p>"Soul' is very subjective... All kinds of teaching will say all kind of things that are contradictory to each other. And where does soul starts and you the personality end? You get what i mean?</p>
              <p>To me, the closest match to the word 'soul' is the subconscious mind.</p>
              <p>But, then you only will experience the sensate reality. If you do not experience it, then it does not exist for you.</p>
              <p>That is why 'emptiness' in Buddhism is such a profound truth. For people who doesn't realise it, they will alway think that there is something 'beyond' their existence.</p>
              <p>For in truth, there is no something beyond what is being experienced. For example, if you meditate and experience the 'soul', then the soul only exist for you at that moment. That moment is just right for the conditions of the 'soul' to be experienced.</p>
              <p>By that definition, 'soul' is nothing but that experience of pure 'intent' that is being experienced at that moment.</p>
              <p>Through this way of understanding, you will know that there is no separate entity elsewhere that is call the soul. It is just another altered state of your own consciousness.</p>
              <p>Once, this is known, the lifespan of the soul becomes a meaningless question.</p>
              <p>Do you get what i mean?</p>

              <p>Like Longchen said, the term 'soul' has different meanings.</p>
              <p>But in either case Buddhism, with the teaching of No-Self and Emptiness cannot accept that there is an entity with inherent existence that is called the soul.</p>
              <p>However, there are things in Buddhism that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>appears</strong></span> (but are not!) close to that.</p>
              <p>For example, when we die, our 7th consciousness (consciousness of a 'self', <strong>please understand they arise based on delusions -- there is actually no 'self'</strong>) after entering the bardo state for some time, will exit the body and transform into an antarabhava. It's like a 5 year old (or 7 year old cant remember) tall body, its invisible to human eyes... like a ghost. But those with psychic vision can see them. They usually linger around until the conditions for rebirth takes place, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>within the 49 days</strong></span>. If they didn't get the opportunity (too much attachment, refusal to move on, etc) after 49 days they can turn into a ghost and to be reborn will be a much more difficult task then on.</p>
              <p>However, if one is enlightened, the 7th consciousness (consciousness of a 'self') will dissolve and transform into wisdom. All other consciousnesses can also transform into wisdom. Then rebirth will not take place.</p>
              <p>Also when I say 'exit the body' it seems as if there is a fixed soul entity attached to the body. This is not the case, just that the conditionings are there for consciousness to take place along with a physical form/body. Now when death happens, the condition of the body is gone, and the conditions are there for 7th consciousness to transform into an antarabhava.</p>
              <p>Consciousness is actually not a 'fixed entity' or a 'self', it's a state of being which changes every moment, depending on conditions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consciousness arises dependent on conditions, without conditions, no consciousness arise. Hence, Consciousness is also empty and is inseparable from conditions.</strong></span> When the conditions of life is no longer there -- i.e. body dies, the ripening of our karma will lead to rebirth in any of the 6 realms -- unless you are liberated, in which case then nirvana "occurs". (please see the post below, Thusness explains it in much simpler terms)</p>
              <p>As Thusness said years back, <strong><em>Next is her experience of Â‘astral travelingÂ’, if she is in a stage
                                                                          of absorption and then out of a sudden awareness, the eyes of
                                                                          awareness may allow her to witness something that is altogether
                                                                          different from the physical place but this does not necessary mean
                                                                          that Â‘consciousnessÂ’ has left and re-enter the body. Consciousness
                                                                          is propelled by causes and conditions. According to her conditions
                                                                          of absorption and clarity, just IS.</em></strong></p>
              <p>I will try to post more regarding Conditions and Consciousness, and hopefully it will all be clear to you all.</p>

              <p>By 'authentic experience', i meant meditate to directly
                                          experience the timeless Presence (Buddha Nature) which is your true
                                          nature.</p>
              <p>Once, you have that direct experience, you will know, without
                                          any doubt, that the true nature is forever.</p>
              <p>"Soul' is very subjective... All kinds of teaching will say all
                                          kind of things that are contradictory to each other. And where does
                                          soul starts and you the personality end? You get what i mean?</p>
              <p>To me, the closest match to the word 'soul' is the subconscious
                                          mind.</p>
              <p>But, then you only will experience the sensate reality. If you
                                          do not experience it, then it does not exist for you.</p>
              <p>That is why 'emptiness' in Buddhism is such a profound truth.
                                          For people who doesn't realise it, they will alway think that there
                                          is something 'beyond' their existence.</p>
              <p>For in truth, there is no something beyond what is being
                                          experienced. For example, if you meditate and experience the
                                          'soul', then the soul only exist for you at that moment. That
                                          moment is just right for the conditions of the 'soul' to be
                                          experienced.</p>
              <p>By that definition, 'soul' is nothing but that experience of
                                          pure 'intent' that is being experienced at that moment.</p>
              <p>Through this way of understanding, you will know that there is
                                          no separate entity elsewhere that is call the soul. It is just
                                          another altered state of your own consciousness.</p>
              <p>Once, this is known, the lifespan of the soul becomes a
                                          meaningless question.</p>
              <p>Do you get what i mean?</p>

              <p>Yes usually when people think of 8th consciousness, it can become misunderstood as a soul, as a place or a storage location. In fact it's called 'storehouse-consciousciousness', but we have to understand that it is spoken out of convention -- there is no actual permanent unchanging entity storing anything. It's just a flow of conditionings succeeding moment to moment. 8th Consciousness is also empty [not a fixed entity, doesn't have a fixed location, or anything like that]</p>

              <p>Also,</p>
              <p><strong>With regards to Alaya, I posted before:</strong></p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Something about the idea of storage... in Thusness's opinion we
                                                                  must get rid of the entire idea of there being a 'place' where
                                                                  seeds are being 'stored'. 'Storage' is simply spoken out of
                                                                  convention.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>There are always imprints and tendencies, nothing lost. It has
                                                                  always been like that. 'Stored' actually means an on going process
                                                                  to mean that the tendencies are there. But not to see it as a place
                                                                  keeping track of something.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>These tendencies/momentum/karma are our 8th consciousness in action. They are subtle and subconscious and will not be detected unless one meditates.</p>
              <p>Also, they will not manifest into karmic ripening UNTIL the conditions are present for them to manifest, hence for example... some people who commit tremendously evil deeds may appear to be well off, while good people may sometimes suffer their whole life.</p>
              <p>This is because the conditions are not yet ripe for the karmic seeds they planted this life to ripen. What they are experiencing are ripening of karmic seeds/imprints/momentum brought over from their past lives. But their rebirth would be affected their actions in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>For example, the beggar who was so delighted when Maha-arhat Mogallana [or Mahakasyapa?] (out of compassion) asked for the beggar's 3 drops of gruel in his bowl (he was initially saddened when he thought he had nothing to give him), and as a result of this pure deed the beggar died like a week later and was reborn in the heaven of 33 gods for 90+ kalpas. For the beggar's case, the karma arising out of this pure intent is too strong and manifested very quickly. For others, it will not manifest until a long time later.</p>
              <p>The continuity of karmic seeds spanning over lifetimes may seem that we have a fixed 'soul' or a 'self'. In actuality, it is just the succession of our sub-conscious karmic tendencies over lifetimes, waiting for the conditions to ripen.</p>

              <p>First time i ask a question here, before i search from other
              source maybe would have some guide here.</p>
              <p>Buddhist do not believe there is a soul, but I do believe there
              is a soul(ç²¾ç¥žä½“) as i am a chinese, so I do not think of a better
              english word to use in this context. My question is, when a
              sentinent being has ended his life, there would be rebirth due to
              karmic forces, they will rebirth to different releams....so
              does this "soul" that i term as, has a lifespan, how many
              times can this soul contnue to go for rebirth, I read that
              buddha also has a lifespan, but it is very long that
              usually they put it as infinite...and sentinent being all has
              buddha nature, but accordance to the article i posted
              here in another thread, we sentinent beings are actually a
              manifestition of a higher heaven being, so, does our this
              "soul" has a expire date.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Mitreya come to this world to preech the dharma, that would
              be closed to the end of this world, a new world will be born
              again.Then what happen to those whom have not attain enlightenment
              and out of the six releam?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So let me continue.</p>
              <p>....So whether "soul expires" is irrelevant. There is no fixed thing
                                          called "self", "soul", that can expire, or annihilate. But....</p>
              <p>...comes the question or Nirvana (cessation). What is Nirvana, really? Isn't it the annihilation of the "I"?</p>
              <p>And the answer to this is, Nope, Nirvana is not the annihilation of the self.</p>
              <p>Because all along there is no self, what self is there to annihilate? There is only conditioned arising moment to moment.</p>
              <p>Nirvana hence, is defined as <strong>the absence of conditioned for further sufferings, delusions, and further re-birth.</strong></p>
              <p>Please understand that birth can only take place with the Conditions of ignorance leading to the 12 interdependent links of origination.</p>
              <p>Without such conditions, no birth takes place, hence it is like fire blowing on fuel, without the fuel, the fire stops burning and blows out.</p>
              <p>Fire is not an entity, fire is constantly changing according to conditions, <strong>no two moments of fire are the same</strong>. We can't say that fire is a fixed entity that is annihilated. But when the base condition [fuel] for fire runs out, the fire is blown out. The fire stops burning, there is no more birth.</p>
              <p><strong>Nirvana just means the absence of condition to give rise to further birth.</strong></p>
              <p>For an arhat, even while still living, nirvana is experienced. However nirvana experienced while he is alive is known as 'nirvana with residue', while after his passing it is known as 'nirvana without residue'.</p>
              <p>In 'Nirvana with residue', the arhat no longer has ignorance and sufferings, but still has a body and mind.</p>
              <p>In 'Nirvana without residue', the body of the arhat passes away, so there is no more body/mind.</p>
              <p>However, a Bodhisattva returns to Samsara, and continues the work of saving sentient beings out of great compassion, and practice his way to Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>Does such a Bodhisattva still experience nirvana? Yes. But his Nirvana is the Nirvana of Non-Abidance. He neither abides in nirvana or samsara, he experiences no ignorance and is liberated from the effects of afflictions.</p>

              <p>Dare me to say here, but some of the teachings like there is no 'soul' is not agreeable with me in anyways. I believe Buddha did not really say that there is no 'soul' but just that our self is made up of different components like feelings and etc. There is an energy flowing throughout our rebirths in samsara that keeps us going, like the flame of a candlelight which passes on and on. You cant say that there is no flame in the candle light. Buddha said there is no 'self' because the self is ever-changing, throughout this life as well as next life and so on. The 'self' is like a water with no fixed shape and thus there is no fixed 'self', but that does not equal that no fixed 'self' means no 'self'. The 'self' is just ever-changing and acts as different entity throughout samsara, thus to speak it really, there is no 'self' in a sense. But then again, we cant dispute that we really have no 'self'. Its like a duality ; we have a 'self' , we have no 'self' .</p>
              <p>Just like you cant say everything is emptiness. You read that 'form does not differfrom emptiness, emptiness does not differ from form' in the heart sutra. It did not say that everything is really emptiness, nor say that everything is really not of emptiness. Its like everything is empty; everything is not empty.</p>

              <p>Dare me to say here, but some of the teachings like there is no
              'soul' is not agreeable with me in anyways. I believe Buddha did
              not really say that there is no 'soul' but just that our self is
              made up of different components like feelings and etc. There is an
              energy flowing throughout our rebirths in samsara that keeps us
              going, like the flame of a candlelight which passes on and on. You
              cant say that there is no flame in the candle light. Buddha said
              there is no 'self' because the self is ever-changing, throughout
              this life as well as next life and so on. The 'self' is like a
              water with no fixed shape and thus there is no fixed 'self', but
              that does not equal that no fixed 'self' means no 'self'. The
              'self' is just ever-changing and acts as different entity
              throughout samsara, thus to speak it really, there is no 'self' in
              a sense. But then again, we cant dispute that we really have no
              'self'. Its like a duality ; we have a 'self' , we have no 'self'
              .</p>
              <p>Just like you cant say everything is emptiness. You read that
              'form does not differfrom emptiness, emptiness does not differ from
              form' in the heart sutra. It did not say that everything is really
              emptiness, nor say that everything is really not of emptiness. Its
              like everything is empty; everything is not empty.</p>
              </div>

              <p>That's right!</p>
              <p>No soul/no self should not be understood as the nihilistic understanding of non-existence.</p>
              <p>It just means 'self' is made up of 5 skhandas, arising moment to moment, and no moment are the same. There is no fixed self but self1, self2, self3 etc....</p>

              <p>Yah, but what is misunderstood many people in the world is that 'no self' means to them that we do not exist. And 'emptiness' means nihilism and everything around them is all fake and not real.</p>
              <p>This thinking is very dangerous. Think about it. If Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva spoke that everything is 'emptiness', then why would He have to help sentient beings and practice compassion when all is just emptiness? If we hold on to the theory of nihilism, then when we see people dying, we wont help. Why? Because their death and experience is all emptiness and since its emptiness why do we need to save them? Thats really a WRONG view.</p>

              <p>An insight has to occur, a quantum shift of perception.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;"><span><br>I
                      got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out
                      more about the experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of
                      impermanence syncs deeply with what I experience in life. I am faced
                      with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by financial
                      crisis. At that point in time I have no idea that Buddhism is so
                      profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The mystery of life cannot
                      be understood, I seek for a refuge in Buddhism to alleviate my sorrows
                      caused by the financial crisis but it turned out to be the missing key
                      towards experiencing total presence.<br><br>I wasn’t that resistant
                      then about the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but the idea that all phenomenon
                      existence is empty of an inherent ‘self’ or ‘Self’ did not quite get
                      into me. Are they talking about the ‘Self’ as a personality or ‘Self’
                      as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we do away even with the ‘Witness’ itself or
                      the Witness is another illusion itself?<br><br>There is thinking, no thinker<br>There is sound, no hearer<br>Suffering exists, no sufferer<br>Deeds there are, no doer<br><br>I
                      was meditating the above stanza deeply…about its meaning until one day,
                      suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it was so clear, there was nothing else,
                      just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’ resounding…. It was so
                      clear, so vivid!<br><br>That experience is so familiar, so real and so
                      clear. It is the same experience of “I AM”….it is without thought,
                      without concepts, without intermediary, without anyone there, without
                      any in-between…What is it? IT is Presence! But this time it is not ‘I
                      AM’, it is not asking ‘who am I’, it is not the pure sense of “I AM”,
                      it is ‘TONGSss….’, the pure Sound…<br>Then come Taste, just the Taste and nothing else….<br>The heart beats…..<br>the Scenery…<br><br>There is no gap in between, no longer a few months gap for it to arise…<br>There never was a stage to enter, no I to cease and never has it existed<br>There is no entry and exit point…<br>There is no Sound out there or in here…<br>There is no ‘I’ apart from the arising and ceasing…<br>The manifold of Presence….<br>Moment to moment Presences unfolds…</span></p>

                  comments: Insight into no-self has arisen but non-dual experience is
                  still not stabilized. The tendency to experience as a clear mirror
                  reflecting still persist, however, the attention is shifted to
                  experiencing pure presence rest in being authenticated by mere
                  phenomenon. There is no more resistance towards phenomena
                  manifestation, the ‘illusion’ of a background is seen and effort to
                  sink back to a void background diminishes substantially.</span></strong></p>

              <p>BTW, the many Zen Masters get enlightened after hearing a sound, perhaps something breaks. Or through seeing something.</p>
              <p>And suddenly got enlightened.</p>
              <p>Because the illusion of duality between the perceiver and the sound has dissolved.</p>

              <p>BTW, the many Zen Masters get enlightened after hearing a sound, perhaps something breaks. Or through seeing something.</p>
              <p>And suddenly got enlightened.</p>
              <p>Because the illusion of duality between the perceiver and the sound has dissolved.</p>
              <p><strong>Like a famous</strong> <strong>Zen Master said when he got his enlightenment, "When I heard the</strong> <strong>bell ring, suddenly there was no 'I' and no '</strong><strong>bell,' just the ringing."</strong></p>

              <p>Hmm, i was wondering this question. In Zen, there are many practinioners who have got their enlightenment. But i am wondering if their enlightenment is the same enlightenment that Buddha attained. Because, as you have known, Sakyamuni had practiced dharma as a bodhisattva in thousands of previous lives, and became a Buddha thus.</p>

              <p>There are many stages of enlightenment, there are 10 bhumis for Bodhisattva path, and 4 stages for Arhat path.</p>
              <p>Even after an initial glimpses, one has to deepen his enlightenment experience and uncover deeper insights.</p>

              <p>BTW, one has to build up a lot a lot of merits and wisdom to attain the omniscience of the Buddha. That would take many many lifetimes.</p>
              <p>So just having the sort of enlightenment mentioned is not enough for Buddhahood. However, it is possible to achieve liberation in this lifetime.</p>

              <p>AEN sure knows better about the scriptures and he can provide a better answer with regards to your question.</p>
              <p>The 'thing' that you call has no expiry date. Unless attained buddhahood, one continues rebirth in samsara until attained buddhahood, like a cycle of day and night then day and night again, never ending process.</p>
              <p>The 'thing' should be noted to be without a beggining or an end, unlike theology which believes that we have a creator and at the end times we would all be claimed back or something. In Buddhism, we are all in the state of becoming, because we arent fixed at any point of life or time.</p>
              <p>After Maitreya, there is not the end of the world. Dharma will once flourish again and those who have heard the teachings of maitreya who cannot become enlightened will continue rebirth in samsara but in higher realms. Because of the karma of living beings has to ripen, the world must continue to be around so that rippening can take place. If i were to tell you tomorrow is the end of the world, how would you clear your bad karma you have previously accumulated?</p>

              <p>The answer is actually very simple...</p>
              <p>The "thing" is consciousness.. The "thing" is what you experience as yourself now.</p>
              <p>When the physical body dies, the conscoiusness changes state, but it is still consciousness. There is no some 'thing' beyond you... it is all just change of state according to conditions.</p>
              <p>Consciousness will go on forever.</p>
