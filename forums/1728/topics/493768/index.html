              Answers Is Still Controversial</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Barbara Hoetsu O'Brien MAR
              17, 2017 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Why
              the recently reissued The Sound of the One Hand: 281 Zen Koans With Answers may
              not give Zen students the answers they’re looking for</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              1916, a peevish Japanese Zen monk gave himself a pseudonym meaning “The
              Arch-Destroyer of the Existent Order” and published a book titled A Critique of
              Japanese Pseudo-Zen. The book consisted mostly of a blistering attack on
              Japan’s Rinzai Zen schools and the way they were conducting koan study at the
              time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Koans
              are those odd questions asked by Zen masters that defy rational answers. The
              Rinzai school of Zen developed a practice of koan study in which a student sits
              in meditation with the koan and periodically presents his understanding of it
              to his teacher in a private interview. Although the standard koans have all
              been published, the way they are presented is supposed to remain private
              between student and teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              Arch-Destroyer broke centuries of protocol and described how the 281 koans then
              in use by Rinzai Zen schools were answered. His aim in doing this was to expose
              the Rinzai Zen masters of his time as phonies who had forgotten the essence of
              Buddhism. Armed with this book, he said, any fool could be a Zen master.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Critique
              raised a scandal, and it sold well enough to justify a second printing in 1917.
              When monks began to present the cribbed answers in interviews, at least one
              teacher made changes to the traditional koans to confound his students.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              book was not reissued after the second printing. However, much later in the
              20th century, there were shopkeepers in Kyoto known to keep photocopies of the
              “answer” section behind the counter, ready to sell to those who asked for them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s
              said that most of those who asked were novice Zen monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              1975, the New York-based publisher Basic Books released an English translation
              of the answer section by the distinguished Israeli author and scholar Yoel
              Hoffman, who added his own extensive notes. Although Hoffman’s translation
              wasn’t on any Zen teacher’s recommended reading list, copies quietly circulated
              among Zen students. Whether anyone ever tried the book’s answers on their
              teachers, I cannot say.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Basic Books edition is out of print. However, in December 2016 the New York
              Review of Books reissued Hoffman’s translation, titled The Sound of the One
              Hand: 281 Zen Koans With Answers, as part of its classics series. It’s possible
              the koan answers will soon turn up in a library near you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hoffman
              studied Zen in Japan in his youth and, in Israel, has published books on Zen
              that were well received. He wrote in the introduction to The Sound of the One
              Hand that his purpose in translating and publishing the answer book “was above
              all my firm conviction that it would introduce to the Western world the
              clearest, most detailed, and most correct picture of Zen.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              does it? And would the answer section be of any benefit to koan students today?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most
              of my experience as a Zen student has been in the Soto school, which as a rule
              (there are exceptions) does not approach koans the same way Rinzai does. And
              the answers given in the book simply don’t speak to me. For example:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Master:
              The original faceâ€•the face before you were brought into this world by your
              mother and fatherâ€•What is it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Answer:
              Placing both hands on the chest, the student stands up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hoffman’s
              note to this koan explains that “the student implies, ‘it’s me,’ thus avoiding
              the trap of an unanswerable question.” This explanation did not exactly light a
              candle in the darkness for me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jaime
              Heiku McLeod is a teacher in the White Plum lineage founded by Soto Zen teacher
              Hakuyu Taizen Maezumi of the Los Angeles Zen Center, and I asked him about the
              book:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Early
              on in my koan work, when I was working through the Miscellaneous Koans (or
              Simple Koans, with simple meaning short, not necessarily easy), I snuck a peek
              at The Sound of One Hand. I wasn’t necessarily looking for “the answers,” but
              just some kind of starting point. The whole process felt so incomprehensible to
              me. Even so, it felt like a very dirty thing to do. Like ogling your dad’s
              Playboys or something. I would have been mortified if my teachers ever found
              out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              realize now, though, they probably wouldn’t have cared. There was nothing in
              there that was going to help me. The “answers” just seemed silly. Looking at
              them now, I can certainly understand what each of the answers are pointing to,
              but unless a student has experienced the gut-level understanding that led
              someone 100 years ago to declare that such-and-such a gesture or performance
              was THE one official answer —and I’m not really convinced that was ever
              completely the case—then the gestures or phrases or interpretive dances or
              whatever that the book outlines are meaningless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Very
              simply, koan contemplation is a means to develop insight. The American Rinzai
              master Robert Aitken wrote in Taking the Path of Zen, “Fundamentally the koan
              is a particular expression of buddhanature, and your koan work is simply a
              matter of making that expression clear to yourself and your teacher.” Mimicking
              words and gestures one doesn’t really understand simply doesn’t function, and
              teachers claim they can tell when someone is faking it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Because
              what is realized often is ineffable, a student may “answer” the koan by means
              of gestures as well as words. “We do ask students to respond to a case
              nonverbally first, just to get them out of the habit of intellectualizing about
              it,” Heiku McLeod said. However, then the student is asked to talk about it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even
              though words can never fully express the gut-level understanding that the koans
              are pointing to, students need to be able to articulate it in some way, anyway.
              It takes that encounter with the absolute and grounds it back into the
              relative. Always, the two are dancing with one another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Does
              this mean the koan answers are completely useless? Not necessarily. I asked
              Barry Magid, a dharma heir of Charlotte Joko Beck, about the book:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              think it does have some cross-cultural value. So often we were taught that if
              your eye was truly opened all the koans would become transparent. Some do but
              as the book shows, what “counted” as an answer varied wildly. I found it
              interesting to ask myself “how was that an answer?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              other words, while The Sound of the One Hand is of little help to a novice koan
              student, it does give us an intimate window into Rinzai Zen in Japan, at least
              as it was 100 years ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              in Japan was already in a period of decline by the beginning of the Meiji
              Period (1868–1912). Buddhism had been the dominant religion in Japan for a few
              centuries, and by the early 19th century was widely viewed as arrogant and
              corrupt. Then the Meiji Emperor chose to elevate Shinto as the favored
              religion. He also issued a number of imperial decreesâ€•including one that ended
              monastic celibacyâ€•that further rocked Japanese Buddhist institutions. Many
              temples closed, and many clergy returned to lay life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              1916 Rinzai Zen as an institution was still stumbling. Certainly, there were
              several well-respected Rinzai masters teaching in those days, but it was far
              from a golden age of Rinzai Zen. Arch-Destroyer may have had reason to feel
              frustrated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s
              also the case that an “answer” that resonates in Japan might not work in the
              West. A senior koan student told me, “Being from Texas at present, here ‘one
              hand’ sounds like singing to cows . . . ‘I’m an ol’ cowhand, from the Rio
              Grande . . .’” Make of that what you will.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Several
              of the classic koan collections have been translated into English, and some of
              these have commentaries by distinguished masters such as Robert Aitken and Koun
              Yamada. Someone new to Zen who wants to read about koans would, I’m sure, find
              these works more helpful than The Sound of One Hand. And koan students looking
              for the magic decoder ring to Zen may be disappointed.</span></p>
