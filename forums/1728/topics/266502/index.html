In my honest and direct opinion, if supposedly a god 'sucks' the milk, then it is not a celestial god and definitely not a Bodhisattva. It is the doing of a Ghost-Deity/Gui Shen, which is a type of ghost who are powerful and have some good karma, and some people worship them.<br><br>Celestial beings do not drink milk nor eat meat, so if any sort of beings appear in your dreams and ask you for animal sacrifices or something like that, it is beyond all doubts that it is definitely a ghost-deity from the lower realms. Celestial beings have food that are far better. Their food is not earthly food, it is completely beyond what we can imagine. Meat and the like are totally disgusting to them - that's like eating disgusting corpses.<br><br>In Buddhism, we do not worship any ghost-deities and it is not a good thing to create any such karmic affinity with the lower realm beings.<br><br>Also, please know that temples that worship Guan Yin does not mean it is a Buddhist temple, there are lots of non-Buddhist folks temples that worships Guan Yin as well.<br><br>As my dharma teacher said before... a lot of those temples that worship Guan Yin that claims to be able to communicate with Guan Yin, etc, those are actually ghost-deities communicating with the medium. They are NOT the real Guan Yin.  The above could be a similar case.<br><br>p.s. BTW, even Celestial gods are NOT the same as Bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas and Buddhas are enlightened beings, they are much much higher than ordinary celestial gods. Celestial beings take Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as their teachers. The difference is that while celestial beings have very good karma and thus are reborn in the heaven realms, they still have not eradicated ignorance and are still under the cycles of samsara -- his temporary enjoyment will eventually end and he still has to undergo cycles of rebirth. An enlightened being transcends all samsaric cycles.</div>

As the level of liquid in the spoon dropped, it became obvious that after the milk disappeared from the spoon, it coated the statue beneath where the spoon was placed. With this result, the scientists offered capillary action as an explanation; the surface tension of the milk was pulling the liquid up and out of the spoon, before gravity caused it to run down the front of the statue.[1] This explanation did nothing to reduce the numbers of faithful rushing to the temples, however, and queues of people carrying pots, pans, and buckets of milk continued to gather.</blockquote></div>
