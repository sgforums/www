              1. You must know yourself

              <p>we can try meditation to cultivate more self-awareness. in a comfortable room, close our eyes and let ourselves become more aware of the surroundings. identify the specific feeling we have, be it resentment or anger towards smth or someone, and after tt, slowly try to visualise ways in which we can overcome it.</p>

              <p>There are many ways... I think one is through metta, which is attempting to transform it through loving kindness. This method is an antidote to anger towards someone, and is a very important virtue and should be emphasized and cultivated. But metta by itself cannot lead to liberation. It is like trying to use a method to treat an ailment. It is not instantaneous liberation.</p>
              <p>For the more direct liberation on the spot, we need to practice naked awareness on the emotion itself, without separating oneself from the anger, and because one does not separate oneself from the feeling of anger, one does not label and judge the anger as if it is an object separate from yourself... there is no subject-object relationship... instead you let yourself 'be' that feeling.</p>
              <p>Just the presence of 'anger' -- yet you do not even know what it is, there is no interpretation or labeling ('this is anger, this is bad, etc') -- one just completely opens up to the raw feeling, but you do not follow or get caught up in the mental stories. We are simply completely present with and as that feeling without feeding it with more thoughts.</p>
              <p>This is easier said than done because obviously our conditionings and habitual energy is very strong -- it constantly comes up unnoticed, so we need to practice for a period of time.</p>

                                                  have read several times that completing the Dzogchen practice takes

                                                  of the passion... depending on our personality makeup. We may block

              We need to let go of our storylines. The meditation practices teach us
              to notice thoughts, touch them, and let them go allow us to let go of
              the story lines. Then we can get in touch with the underlying raw
              feeling of guilt itself.</span> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">That's
              the nowness we were talking about earlier -- being completely present
              with the discomfort that comes with the guilt and not simply feeding it
              with thoughts.</span></p>

              <p>Questioner: In certain situations in life I feel blocked by a
                                      fear which prevents me from acting. How can I be free from this
                                      obstacle?<br> <br> Jean Klein: First free yourself from the word, the concept, 'fear'.
                                      It is loaded with memory. Face only the perception. Accept the
                                      sensation<br> completely. When the personality who judges and controls is
                                      completely absent, when there is no longer a psychological
                                      relationship with the<br> sensation, it is really welcomed and unfolds. Only in welcoming
                                      without a welcomer can there be real transformation.<br> <br> We are in essence one with all existence; when we truly observe
                                      ourselves there is ultimately no observer, only observation -
                                      awareness.</p>

              <p>This is important -- let it be. But what is 'It' when it just 'Be'/'Is'? As Thusness asked four years ago, <strong>"When things are "be"? What is it? <img title="Cool" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool">"</strong> 'It' is not anger, not 'bad emotions', -- not anything that mind interpretes it to be -- it is just a pure presence. Pure presence is all there is.</p>
              <p>Our entire experience of the world and of ourselves is coloured by our conditionings... we interprete our experience according to what we have learnt or been taught from others. Prior to the mental conditioning, what is It?</p>
              <p>To truly let things be, we become completely alive to what things truly are free from that layer of conditionings.</p>

              <p>Just a sharing and a reminder for myself as well :)<br><br>IMO, just leave these feeling as there are. Any attempt to destroy or block them is the arising of the 'sense of self'.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, i notice that there will be more thoughts that will come up to reinforce the anger. Just don't entertain them. These thoughts are about 'how to protect, avenge and defend oneself'.</p>
              <p>The thoughts and emotions can condition us... but there are not entirely 'real' in a sense. In a way, they are valid and invalid at the same time.</p>
              <p>Thoughts attempts to defend the person from harm ... but if one has enough 'faith' in the 'presence as true nature', there is more of the willingness to let go of defending oneself.</p>
              <p>If 'let go' sufficiently, one may gain more 'faith' and have some insight that understand that the thoughts and feelings are not absolute. The power of the anger and thoughts to condition may weaken.</p>
              <p>There must be however a daringness to explore uncharted territories. ...for to see that 'there is no self to defend' is an experience alien to our normal mode of belief.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it is not just a 'sit there and no need to do anything' kind of experience.  We still live as per normal and exercise decision-making too.</p>
              <p>Also, because we are in samsara, don't expect life to be pleasant all the time. .. the constant change doesn't allow that.</p>

              <p>This is important -- let it be. But what is 'It' when it just 'Be'/'Is'? As Thusness asked four years ago, <strong>"When things are "be"?

Pure presence is all there is.</p>
              <p>Our entire experience of the world and of ourselves is coloured by our conditionings... we interprete our experience according to what we have learnt or been taught from others. Prior to the mental conditioning, what is It?</p>

              <p>it means pure presence, but it does not make sense, if you assemble this together, let pure presence be, i don't understand what's does this mean, i think it could mean anything, since let it be, is universally adopted, include emotion, good or ill emotion, delusion.</p>
              <p>After you stoping trying to control it, it will subdue and reside in peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let it be, no action or no interference is little mantra, little reminder of the right path, when you dealing with daily life.</p>
              <p>Different meaning may be attached to it.</p>
              <p>My understand of conditioning, is people is result of accumulation of ä¸šï¼Œso the condition does not mean  mental condition only.</p>
              <p>I guess, prior to mental condition, which here means knowledge occupied in your mind.It's the emptiness, which is the pure presence you called, the true buddhaness of human</p>

              <p>Pure presence is simply pure presence, pure awareness. Emptiness is not just empty, it's filled with presence. It is what things truly are prior to and even during our conceptualization process (but our habitual imputation dulls our luminosity, prevents us and makes us 'avoids' seeing what is)</p>
              <p>We often have not truly looked or heard anything deeply -- because our mind always kicks in and say "I am seeing a tree, this tree is green, this tree is old, this...." it keeps on labeling what it sees, hears, feel. It is grasped because the mind projects an external identity to the object of experience, as if it has some inherent objective existence out there, apart from oneself. The constant subject/object projection prevents us from experiencing the moment non-dually. (no 'me' and 'tree', just the awareness, seeing inseparable from seen)</p>
              <p>If one totally lets go of this clinging to separation, the clinging to 'self', and all judgements, labeling fall away into the pure moment of experience... that is pure presence. Without thinking, without labeling and judging, without 'me', awareness continues to function perfectly and naturally in sensory awareness. We do not stop 'seeing' and 'awar-ing' -- that is pure presence.</p>
              <p>The same goes to all our thoughts and emotions... rather than blocking them, labeling and judging them, we should simply let go (of any dualistic projection) and let them be -- and again as Thusness asked, <strong>"When things
                                                              are "be"? What is it? <img title="Cool" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool">"</strong></p>

              <p>1.Didnt realise his emotion.</p>
              <p>2.Self Realise / or remind by other about his emotion, and let emotion take control.</p>
              <p>3.Realise emotion, and slowly tame it.</p>
              <p>4.Realise emotion and using technique to resolve it, or using alternative mindset or habits to replace the negatie habitual emotion.</p>
              <p>5.Realise it and immediately conquer it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One should understand his emotion, and usually it is the environmental influences that can let his emotion to arouses. If an individual do not understand his emotional exchanges, it will be difficult for him to conquer it. By understanding the root of the cause, he should applies dharma into it, as seen the outside world are impermance. Meditation is a great way to subpress such negative emotion, exercising and Yoga are great as well...Mind training is very important. When the mind is strong, the body is strong.</p>

So, you are not separate from me, though we are uniquely different. We come to sesshin to meet boredom, clean toilets, get our hands dirty, and face our own anger, sadness, joy and sorrow, without rejecting anything, in fact accepting that everything has its place. Here we realize how to appreciate every aspect of existence, every pain, every breath, every puff of breeze, every drop of rain, every ray of sunshine, every sparkle of morning star, every blossom, every piece of dog shit.
