              <p>There is no 'non dualism school' in Buddhism -- non-duality is not a specific sect but is the nature of reality. Insight into non-duality is found in every single Buddhist sect, from Theravada to Mahayana to Vajrayana. Anyone who has not realised non-duality is not enlightened. But the term 'non-duality' can mean a lot of things -- most of what are unrelated to real enlightenment.</p>
              <p>A lot of people misunderstood what non-duality mean. They think it is no absolute right and wrong, or no absolute polarities. All these are not the non-duality I am talking about. As Longchen wrote before:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-misinfo.html">http://www.dreamdatum.com/nondual-misinfo.html</a></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>...The most common understanding of Non duality is related to the issue of Polarity such as light and dark. In this semantic, non-duality is explained as the non-biasness towards any side of a pole. This is about the concept of there being no absolute good or evil. In another word, it is about being non-judgemental. Many spiritual materials believed that this concept of non-duality is equivalent to enlightenment. This is not entirely correct.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em><br></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Non-duality as a concept for no polarity is not wrong. However, it should not be mistaken for non-duality as the state of enlightenment. The term non-duality that is being used to describe Enlightenment is actually describing a state whereby there is <strong>no subject-object division</strong>. This is an experience that is difference from the concept of no absolute polarity...</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p>Also other religions also talk about 'non-duality' but they may have slightly different meanings. So as you can see the term 'non-duality' is very diverse and though many people talk about it, it might not mean the same thing.</p>
              <p>The non-duality I am talking about is the nature of reality as no subject and object division. This is related to the insight into Anatta (no-self), that there is no separate, distinct, permament agent or Self that is the doer, thinker, observer/feeler of things. As such when you are hearing a sound, there is no hearer apart from the sound. There is just sound, without subject/object division. This is the sort of insight one must come to to awaken.</p>
              <p>All schools of Buddhism will talk about this, though the way they describe it might be slightly different. They might not use the same words but the essence is exactly the same.</p>

              <p>The link you gave me is already very clear that Non-Duality is present in All Buddhist traditions. As such, it is not a particular tradition, because it is found in ALL traditions. Emptiness, non-duality, is the nature of reality -- anyone that denies this is obviously not in accord with Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The wikipedia link you provided quotes from Theravada, then talks about Mahayana and Zen, then Vajrayana and Dzogchen and Mahamudra. All these traditions talk about non-duality.</p>
              <p>Because non-duality is the nature of reality, to become enlightened IS to realise non-duality. There is no other way around.</p>

              <p>There's no problem with conceptualisation. But concepts are second hand knowledge. It is useful and important for functioning in the mundane world, it helps us navigate in our lives. But it is utterly useless in regards to knowing our true nature. Because our true nature is too intimate for words and concepts, words and concepts overlay and obscure that intimacy. Ask yourself, without using concepts, how do you know you are alive? How do you know you are breathing? You don't need other people to tell you, you don't need concepts.</p>
              <p>You cannot know what/who you really are by second hand knowledge -- not by what others tell you -- it must be first hand direct experience. Before thoughts and concepts, your true nature is already present and aware. Your sense of being, presence, awareness, is undeniable and present even without thoughts. And even during thoughts your true nature is present and aware. It knows everything and manifests as everything.</p>
              <p>Practicing means direct, inner, first hand knowing/awareness. Naked awareness of what is. Our true nature is not second hand knowledge, it is always here, present, direct. So we should abide as pure awareness. Pure awareness does not reject thoughts and conceptualisation, but to be in pure awareness means one is not relying or attached to the thoughts and concepts. There is a whole dimension of awareness that transcends and is prior conceptual knowing.</p>
              <p>When we abide in pure awareness, thoughts play a secondary role -- only for practical mundane purposes to help us navigate in the world. And also for the purpose of communicating, like what I am doing now. They no longer take the predominant role in our lives, we are no longer caught up in repetitive streams of thoughts. The habitual patterns of thinking and labelling will not be so strong. When looking at a flower you do not allow yourself to be overwhelmed by streams of thinking about the flower -- there is just the flower.</p>
              <p>Hence to practice, we must get in touch with awareness that is direct and intuitive and first-hand -- that which is prior to all conceptualisations, second hand knowledge. It is just pure presence. This is important, and is a fundamental practice in ALL traditions.</p>

                                beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness could be 
                                describes in completely different terms than will be used here 
                                and each description could still be correct. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is a subtle process that you are using at this very moment. 
                                The fact that this process lies above and beyond words does 
                                not make it unreal--quite the reverse. Mindfulness is the reality 
                                which gives rise to words--the words that follow are simply 
                                pale shadows of reality. So, it is important to understand that 
                                everything that follows here is analogy. It is not going to 
                                make perfect sense. It will always remain beyond verbal logic. 
                                But you can experience it. The meditation technique called Vipassana 
                                (insight) that was introduced by the Buddha about twenty-five 
                                centuries ago is a set of mental activities specifically aimed 
                                at experiencing a state of uninterrupted Mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instant 
                                of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the thing, before 
                                you identify it. That is a stage of Mindfulness. Ordinarily, 
                                this stage is very short. It is that flashing split second just 
                                as you focus your eyes on the thing, just as you focus your 
                                mind on the thing, just before you objectify it, clamp down 
                                on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of existence. 
                                It takes place just before you start thinking about it--before 
                                your mind says, "Oh, it's a dog." That flowing, soft-focused 
                                moment of pure awareness is Mindfulness. In that brief flashing 
                                mind-moment you experience a thing as an un-thing. You experience 
                                a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is interlocked 
                                with the rest of reality, not separate from it. Mindfulness 
                                is very much like what you see with your peripheral vision as 
                                opposed to the hard focus of normal or central vision. Yet this 
                                moment of soft, unfocused, awareness contains a very deep sort 
                                of knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind and objectify 
                                the object into a thing. In the process of ordinary perception, 
                                the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to be unobservable. We 
                                have developed the habit of squandering our attention on all 
                                the remaining steps, focusing on the perception, recognizing 
                                the perception, labeling it, and most of all, getting involved 
                                in a long string of symbolic thought about it. That original 
                                moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over. It is the purpose 
                                of the above mentioned Vipassana (or insight) meditation to 
                                train us to prolong that moment of awareness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                this Mindfulness is prolonged by using proper techniques, you 
                                find that this experience is profound and it changes your entire 
                                view of the universe. This state of perception has to be learned, 
                                however, and it takes regular practice. Once you learn the technique, 
                                you will find that Mindfulness has many interesting aspects. </span></p>

              <p>Aen, besides you keep saying Non duality, i think you should
              read stuff from different sect, in fact different sects all seeing
              the reality, but in a different way, they put emphasize on
              different factors,</p>
              <p>To enhancing you practice on buddhism, at least you need to know
              what's the different sects talking about,</p>
              <p>You have talent in buddhism, if you could learn chinese, and
              read chinese sutras, or chinese article about buddhism, that's
              better.</p>
              <p>You keep saying avoiding habit and conceptualisation, as long as
              you don't attach to them, i think conceptualisation is fine, if you
              talk to a guru, but you don't know what's he talking about, i think
              your experience with buddhism will also be restrained.</p>

              <p>What AEN said is true. Non-dualsim is the ultimate reality common to all traditions. However, the confusion probably arise due to different terms used in different sects but ultimately it all refer to the same truth that is basically beyond language.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;">...Because as you rest in the infinite ease
              of consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that is arising, there
              will soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness:
              the Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing
              the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you are the
              earth; instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the
              entire Kosmos because One Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a
              single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas
              swirl in your heart and the solar system replaces your head…<br><br>You
              are One Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all objects
              that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse:
              infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br><br>So
              the primary Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in
              here and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all
              things witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste.
              Once you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then –
              can it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes
              fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so
              how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian
              dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism,
              then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking
              at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of
              that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is
              arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face
              looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with
              a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a
              five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling
              hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present
              condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular
              organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction
              that makes it seem that “you” are in the head looking at the rest of
              the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal
              bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a
              vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full
              expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject
              and every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of
              One Taste. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you
              become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity
              is everything that is arising moment to moment</strong></span></span> (just as previously you
              felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal
              coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One
              Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br></span></p>

              <p>14th Century Mahamudra Master Dakpo Tashi Namgyal:</p>
              <p><br>"When you vividly perceive a mountain or a house, no matter how
              this perception appears, it does not need to disappear or be stopped.
              Rather, while this perception is experienced, it is itself an
              intangible, empty awareness. This is called <em>seeing the identity of perception.</em>"<br><br>"Previously
              you cleared up uncertainties when you looked into the identity of a
              perception and resolved that perceptions are mind. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Accordingly, the
              perception is not outside and the mind is not inside. It is merely, and
              nothing other than, this empty and aware mind that appears as a
              perception.</strong></span></span> It is exactly like the example of a dream-object and the
              dreaming mind.<br><br>"From the very moment a perception occurs, it is
              a naturally freed and intangible perceiving emptiness. This perceiving
              yet intangible and naked state of empty perception is called <em>seeing the natural face of innate perception</em> or <em>perception dawning as dharmakaya</em>.</p>
              <p>----------------------------</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><br>Take the metaphor of a wave on water. The wave is nothing other
              than the water, and yet it is seen as a wave. Although it appears as a
              wave, it has never changed from being of the nature of water. In the
              same way, with the various types of thoughts, from the very moment they
              appear, they are nothing other than the aware emptiness of
              unidentifiable mind.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>When looking at the flowers, the trees, the mountains, there is no 'you' that is looking at the mountain -- Mountains, Trees, Flowers, are all Mind Only -- in other words you ARE the mountains, trees, flowers. Mountains and rivers are not 'out there', it is your Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>Subject means 'you'... or 'Mind'. Mind is you, the subject.</p>
              <p>Everything is Buddha-Nature means there is no You in here, watching something Out There.</p>
              <p>Inside and outside is one. Subject and object is never two. When hearing sound, the sound is not out there. It's your buddha nature. It's you. It's Mind. It's pure awareness and emptiness inseparable.</p>
              <p>æ€§(Mind-Essence) ç›¸(Form/Appearance)ä¸€å¦‚, is totally one.</p>
              <p>Also, emptiness is not just empty, it's not void or nothingness, because it's filled with presence/awareness/luminosity. Luminosity and emptiness is inseparable. So when we talk about Buddha-Nature, it is awareness and emptiness inseparable.</p>
              <p>When you hear the sound, it's pure awareness. But it's also empty.</p>

              <p>Thusness just had a discussion with me... there's some things that are not so correct with your (rokkie) reply on ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ</p>
              <p>First of all the statement "water is the è‡ªæ€§ï¼Œwave is the  ç›¸ of water, so
                                                              no matter what's wave like, the water is the same." is wrong understanding...</p>
              <p>Because if we propose there is a è‡ªæ€§ (Water), then there is no need for ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ. The illustration also implies there is a permanent unchanging essence (water) in this case, ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ is no more necessary.</p>
              <p>The purpose of telling ppl ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ is not to discard ç›¸. It is to tell ppl that because ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ, there is no need to be attached to a particular ç›¸. For the illustration, one must be aware that both water and wave are all ç›¸.</p>
              <p>It is wrong to say water is è‡ªæ€§ and wave is ç›¸. Therefore you must see water as ç›¸ and wave as ç›¸, therefore ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ. Thus æ— è‡ªæ€§ = ç©ºæ€§</p>
              <p>When one speaks of æ€§, people think that there is a  æ€§ call water, that is call ç�€ç›¸. It makes ppl seek for è‡ªæ€§  therefore giving ppl the impression of æœ‰æ‰€å¾—.</p>
              <p>In actual case there is always only ç›¸ and  ç›¸ is already the å¦™æœ‰but å…¶æ€§ is ç©º. It is not that waves are all ç›¸ and we should shunt from ç›¸ whereas as water is æ€§ and we should seek and attach to æ€§. This will lead to æœ‰æ‰€å¾— and æœ‰ä½�äºŽå¿ƒ. The reason why we think that there is truly a è‡ªæ€§ is because it is the tendency of the conventional (dualistic) mind to trend towards 'å¾—'. </p>
              <p>The idea that 'there must be something otherwise how...' is due to a deeply latent dualistic tendency of seeing things inherently (This is similar to the question 'if there is no soul then what is being reborn'). If this 'knot of essence' is gone, practitioner will naturally feel that there is no need to have a something to grasp.</p>
              <p>Once we truly see that there is always and only å¦™æœ‰ and nothing else, then all experiences is naturally non-dual (no-self) as there is no a æ€§ that separates from ç›¸.</p>
              <p>So ç¦»ç›¸æ— ä½›æ€§å�¯è¨€.  We cannot separate æ€§ from ç›¸ and to be more precise there is not really a æ€§ that can be grasped anywhere -- æ€§ç©º. The nature of all ç›¸ is luminous/aware, it's essence is empty, i.e. no findable, inherent essence.</p>

              <p>Thusness just had a discussion with me... there's some things that are not so correct with your (rokkie) reply on ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ</p>
              <p>First of all the statement "water is the è‡ªæ€§ï¼Œwave is the  ç›¸ of water, so no matter what's wave like, the water is the same." is wrong understanding...</p>
              <p>Because if we propose there is a è‡ªæ€§ (Water), then there is no need for ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ. The illustration also implies there is a permanent unchanging essence (water) in this case, ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ is no more necessary.</p>
              <p>The purpose of telling ppl ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ is not to discard ç›¸. It is to tell ppl that because ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ, there is no need to be attached to a particular ç›¸. For the illustration, one must be aware that both water and wave are all ç›¸.</p>
              <p>It is wrong to say water is è‡ªæ€§ and wave is ç›¸. Therefore you must see water as ç›¸ and wave as ç›¸, therefore ä¸€åˆ‡ç›¸ä¸�äºŒ. Thus æ— è‡ªæ€§ = ç©ºæ€§</p>
              <p>When one speaks of æ€§, people think that there is a  æ€§ call water, that is call ç�€ç›¸. It makes ppl seek for è‡ªæ€§  therefore giving ppl the impression of æœ‰æ‰€å¾—.</p>
              <p>In actual case there is always only ç›¸ and  ç›¸ is already the å¦™æœ‰but å…¶æ€§ is ç©º. It is not that waves are all ç›¸ and we should shunt from ç›¸ whereas as water is æ€§ and we should seek and attach to æ€§. This will lead to æœ‰æ‰€å¾— and æœ‰ä½�äºŽå¿ƒ. The reason why we think that there is truly a è‡ªæ€§ is because it is the tendency of the conventional (dualistic) mind to trend towards 'å¾—'. </p>
              <p>The idea that 'there must be something otherwise how...' is due to a deeply latent dualistic tendency of seeing things inherently (This is similar to the question 'if there is no soul then what is being reborn'). If this 'knot of essence' is gone, practitioner will naturally feel that there is no need to have a something to grasp.</p>
              <p>Once we truly see that there is always and only å¦™æœ‰ and nothing else, then all experiences is naturally non-dual (no-self) as there is no a æ€§ that separates from ç›¸.</p>
              <p>So ç¦»ç›¸æ— ä½›æ€§å�¯è¨€.  We cannot separate æ€§ from ç›¸ and to be more precise there is not really a æ€§ that can be grasped anywhere -- æ€§ç©º. The nature of all ç›¸ is luminous/aware, it's essence is empty, i.e. no findable, inherent essence.</p>

              <p><br>what you said is Nagajurna's point of view, but i think the right way to say it is, not FREE from the 4 extremes, but actuall is OF the 4 format in chinese is é�žæœ‰é�žç©ºï¼Œäº¦æœ‰äº¦ç©ºï¼Œé�žé�žæœ‰é�žç©ºï¼Œactually, it mainly point out the emptiness is hard to conceive and it's complicated,</p>
              <p>and nagajurna mainly attack the old school of buddhism, and he is trying to build something new, because the old school is neither æœ‰ or ç©ºï¼Œchina use æœ‰ to represent å°�ä¹˜ theravada, ç©º represent å¤§ä¹˜ï¼ŒMahayana.</p>

              <p>Empty (sunyata) means "empty of inherent existence" (ç©ºæ— è‡ªæ€§). You are not the 1st one who thinks "empty " leads to misunderstanding:</p>
