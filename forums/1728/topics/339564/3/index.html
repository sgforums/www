              <p>The collapse of the illusion of subject/object duality can only occur after insight into non-duality and no-self has arisen. Before that, one can only have intermittent non-dual experiences arising through states of absorption (that comes and goes), it can never last.</p>
              <p>Another important point is that the collapse of subject/object duality does not mean thoughts and emotions cannot arise. They can arise, but since there is no dualistic projection they do not last. They arise and subside like drawing on water, leaving no trace.</p>
              <p>That said it does not mean thoughts and emotions do not arise -- they arise, thoughts arise but there is no thinker apart from thought. There is no watcher watching the thought -- the thought itself is the self-illuminating display of mirror-like awareness. There is no watcher because the thought itself is awareness. Everything is the self-shining display of Buddha-Nature, and there is no one, no separate person apart from this oneness appearing as thoughts, sights, sounds, etc.</p>
              <p>At this stage there is totally no stepping back from the reflections, there is no objective relationship with the reflections of the mirror -- mindful awareness is ongoing but without separation from its reflections -- as Thusness would say, <span style="font-family: arial;">The key point about the practice of mindful awareness is there is no keeping of the mind on anything and by not resting on anything, it fuses into everything; therefore it cannot be concentrated; rather it is to relax into nothingness empty of self, empty of any artificial doing so that the natural luminosity can take its own course. There is no focusing, there is only allowing the mirror bright clarity to shine with its natural radiance. In essence there is no one there, only the phenomenon arising and ceasing according to conditions, telling their stories.</span></p>

It is also a result of lack of compassion.<br>In my opinion, there are 2 solutions.<br>1) Repent all your past bad wrong doings. Follow the method taught by great masters, and develop a strong sense of repentance. Be persist and do it everyday. When you receive any suffering, remember you have done it to other people in the past.<br>2) Practice compassion. Same thing, follow the methods taught by great masters. Also do it everyday.

              <p>èƒ½æ‰€å�Œäº¡ is what I just said, the collapse of the illusion of subject/object duality.</p>
              <p>When
                          one experiences enlightenment, one experience the collapse of subject
                          (èƒ½)/object (æ‰€) duality. The subject is the sense of a separate
                          entity/self/knower/observer/doer/thinker that is APART from what is
                          being known/observed/done/thought, and what is being known is objectified as being the object
                          of observation.</p>
              <p>The true nature of awareness is non-dual -- which means In hearing there is just sound, no hearer, in seeing there is just
                          scene, no seer. In thinking there is just thoughts, no thinker. Mountains and rivers are all the manifestation of Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>This is as what an old Zen master said upon his enlightenment,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span style="font-size: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB">“When I

              <p>That is why, I was saying non-dual experience can only be sustained effortlessly when it is realised that Non-Duality is the nature of reality, that this is not a stage to be sustained but has Always Been So -- it is the Dharma seal of no-self, never was there an observer apart from observed. Prior to that, non-duality can be temporarily achieved through the help of concentration to enter states of absorption or samadhi but it is temporary.</p>
              <p>Prior to insight, one will always experience separation. <span style="font-family: arial;">Hence initially the dualistic mode of experience is necessary. It is necessary when the karmic tendency to
                                          divide is already there. Hence as Dr. John Welwood wrote, </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The
                                          first step in freeing ourselves from the prison of unconscious
                                          identification is to make it conscious, that is, to reflect on it. We
                                          cannot move from prereflective identification directly into nondual
                                          awareness. But we <em>can</em> use divided consciousness to reflect on
                                          divided consciousness. The Buddha likened this to using a thorn to
                                          remove a thorn from one’s flesh. All reflection involves stepping back
                                          from one’s experience in order to examine and explore its patterns, its
                                          feeling textures, its meanings, its <em>logos,</em> including the
                                          basic assumptions, beliefs, and ways of conceiving reality that shape
                                          our experience. By comparison with identification, this kind of
                                          self-reflection represents a giant step forward in the direction of
                                          greater self-understanding and freedom. As Gabriel Marcel (1950) put
                                          it, “reflection... is one of life’s ways of rising from one level to
                                          another (p. 101).”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are
                      different ways of reflecting on one’s experience. Some are cruder;
                      others subtler; depending on the rigidity of the dualism and the size
                      of gap they maintain between observer and observed. I would like to
                      distinguish three levels of reflective method: conceptual reflection,
                      phenomenological reflection, and mindful witnessing.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And he further uses an analogy on the state of Pre-reflective identification, to Reflective consciousness, to Non-dual awareness as such:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If we use the
                                  analogy of awareness as a mirror, prereflective identification is like
                                  being captivated by and lost in the reflections appearing in the
                                  mirror. Reflection involves stepping back from the appearances,
                                  studying them, and developing a more objective relationship with them.
                                  And transreflective presence is like being the mirror itself – that
                                  vast, illuminating openness and clarity that allows reality to be seen
                                  as what it is. In pure presence, awareness is self-illuminating, or
                                  aware of itself without objectification. The mirror simply abides in
                                  its own nature, without either separating from its reflections or
                                  confusing itself with them. Negative reflections do not stain the
                                  mirror, positive reflections do not improve on it. They are all the
                                  mirror’s self-illuminating display.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When insights eventually develope, through contemplating the nature of reality, we gradually enter into nondual awareness which is what the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment calls èƒ½æ‰€å�Œäº¡.</p>
              <p>All these are discussed in the topic

              <p>In short: first there is unconscious identification with the reflections in the mirror (thoughts and experiences), in which one is caught up, attached to, lost in, identified with, and chasing after mundane thoughts and experiences, causing endless sufferings.</p>
              <p>The next step is to develope a witnessing of our thoughts and experience, which is is to reflect on it, thus dis-identifying ourselves from those thoughts. Here we begin to notice the crucial difference <em>between thought and awareness, between the contents of consciousness,
                                                          which are like clouds passing through the sky, and pure consciousness,
                                                          which is like the wide open sky itself. </em></p>
              <p>However at this stage, we still have not gone beyond the dichotomy of subject and object. (èƒ½æ‰€) In fact, at this stage Awareness can be misunderstood as the Eternal Witness or the I AM. Awareness is thought to be the èƒ½çŸ¥ or the Subject or the Observer, and the 18 dhatus (å��å…«ç•Œ) becomes misunderstood as the object of observation by the observer (æ‰€/è¢«çŸ¥).

In fact I just saw this article written by a Taiwanese who obviously misunderstood Awareness (which he calls the Self-Bright/æœ¬æ˜Ž) as the Eternal Witness or the I AM: <a href="http://www.taiwanclassic.com/teps/ec/ecjnlarticleView.aspx?jnlcattype=1&amp;jnlptype=1&amp;jnltype=176&amp;jnliid=416&amp;issueiid=1151&amp;atliid=14037">http://www.taiwanclassic.com/teps/ec/ecjnlarticleView.aspx?jnlcattype=1&amp;jnlptype=1&amp;jnltype=176&amp;jnliid=416&amp;issueiid=1151&amp;atliid=14037</a></p>
              <p>Next when one discovers nondual awareness the subject/object dichotomy collapses, and now awareness is realised to have always been totally one with its perception, hence there is no objective relationship to what we see, hear, think, etc. There is just pure presence manifesting as everything, with no sense of a separate self or observer. Here mindful awareness is ongoing except there is no longer any sense of standing back from appearances -- all appearances are the self-illuminating display of awareness. The practice is as what Thusness says, <em><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">to
                                                                  relax into nothingness empty of self, empty of any artificial doing
                                                                  so that the natural luminosity can take its own course. There is no

                                                                  with its natural radiance. In essence there is no one there, only
                                                                  the phenomenon arising and ceasing according to conditions, telling

              <p>Nope, what I am talking about is stages of insights and has nothing to do with å››ç¦…å…«å®š which are stages of absorptions. Stages of absorptions are temporarily achieved through concentrating in a fixed object. They are temporary states that can be entered and left, they are <strong>not</strong> permanent, and they do not lead to liberation.</p>
              <p>Stages of insights are achieved through contemplation of the nature of reality known as Vipassana or Vipashyana practices, and these insights are permanent. For example when you realise there is no-self and no duality, it is not a stage that can be entered or left. No-Self is not a stage that can be reached. It has Always Been So -- it is a Dharma Seal, a characteristic or nature of reality and realised to be such. This is insight, awakening, enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Personally I have not reached insight or awakening, this one Thusness and Longchen (another moderator) will be able to speak from experience, I only had glimpses of non-dual experiences but they do not last... which I have discussed before in the past.</p>
              <p>When èƒ½æ‰€å�Œäº¡ is experienced, it is not that there is no awareness, rather the true nature of awareness is realised as being non-dual -- in seeing there is just what's seen, no seer. Thought is but no thinker. Mountains and rivers are all the display of pure awareness, and you are not seeing the mountain because you are the mountain.</p>

              <p><br>in order to type chinese characters, your default OS has it, if you are using Vista, it should have, XP PRO some haf it some do not have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can go download Nj star communicator, you can type chinese software and read it, but it is a trial version, but trail version also can use, as after the trail is expired, every open of this software will lag gradually.</p>

              <p>Different Buddhists traditions will counter resentment, anger and frustration differently and it also largely depends on the capacity and preferences of the practitioner. No one can decide which is best for you.</p>
              <p>For Theravadic tradition, this may mean stay in jungle, observing body not clean, observing no self, sunyata ...</p>
              <p>For Mahayana easy path, this may mean repent, bowing to buddha, transfer merits to your enemies, praising buddha, reciting amitabha, reciting mantras</p>
              <p>For Mahayana difficult path, you are supposed to be bodhisattva who vows to help all sentient beings that ill-treated you, practise 6 perfections that includes toleratation helped by observing prajna paramita  ... very tough</p>

              <p>There is no 'non dualism school' in Buddhism -- non-duality is not a specific sect but is the nature of reality. Insight into non-duality is found in every single Buddhist sect, from Theravada to Mahayana to Vajrayana. Anyone who has not realised non-duality is not enlightened. But the term 'non-duality' can mean a lot of things -- most of what are unrelated to real enlightenment.</p>
              <p>A lot of people misunderstood what non-duality mean. They think it is no absolute right and wrong, or no absolute polarities. All these are not the non-duality I am talking about. As Longchen wrote before:</p>

                                        most common understanding of Non duality is related to the 
                                        issue of Polarity such as light and dark. In this semantic, 
                                        non-duality is explained as the non-biasness towards any 
                                        side of a pole. This is about the concept of there being 
                                        no absolute good or evil. In another word, it is about being 
                                        non-judgemental. Many spiritual materials believed that 
                                        this concept of non-duality is equivalent to enlightenment. 
                                        This is not entirely correct.</em></p>

              <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG"><em>Non-duality 
                                        as a concept for no polarity is not wrong. However, it should 
                                        not be mistaken for non-duality as the state of enlightenment. 
                                        The term non-duality that is being used to describe Enlightenment 
                                        is actually describing a state whereby there is <strong>no 
                                        subject-object division</strong>. This is an experience 
                                        that is difference from the concept of no absolute polarity...</em></p>
              <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-SG"> </p>
              <p>Also other religions also talk about 'non-duality' but they may have slightly different meanings. So as you can see the term 'non-duality' is very diverse and though many people talk about it, it might not mean the same thing.</p>
              <p>The non-duality I am talking about is the nature of reality as no subject and object division. This is related to the insight into Anatta (no-self), that there is no separate, distinct, permament agent or Self that is the doer, thinker, observer/feeler of things. As such when you are hearing a sound, there is no hearer apart from the sound. There is just sound, without subject/object division. This is the sort of insight one must come to to awaken.</p>
              <p>All schools of Buddhism will talk about this, though the way they describe it might be slightly different. They might not use the same words but the essence is exactly the same.</p>

              <p>Yes but equally important along with emptiness insight is the luminosity aspect of Buddha-Nature, the aspect of pure awareness. Emptiness is not the nihilistic meaning of void or nothingness, emptiness is filled with presence. But the presence is empty of any graspable reality, empty of inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Pure awareness and emptiness cannot be separated. When non-duality is realised, all phenomena are realised to be pure awareness and emptiness inseparable. In other words, luminosity and emptiness inseparable.</p>
              <p>There is no longer any sense of a separate observer, because it is now realised that the observer is the observed. A poetic way of describing is: <em><strong><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-US"><span>sound hears, scenery sees, the dust is the mirror.</span></span></strong></em></p>
              <p>As Thusness said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Here the highlight must not only be the empty nature of
                                              Â‘soundÂ’ alone, that luminosity as Â‘soundÂ’ must similarly be
                                              emphasized. When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of
                                              Â‘birdÂ’, Â‘chirpingÂ’, Â‘outsideÂ’, Â‘eyes-organÂ’, Â‘ears-organsÂ’, Â‘senate
                                              realityÂ’ and merely experience in bare, this is the meditative
                                              state of intuitively knowing that quality of being luminous in
                                              oneness. Oneness as there is nothing to divide when devoid of these
                                              symbolic layering. The depth of the crystal clarity of that pure
                                              experience Â– Â‘chirpingÂ’ is not what language can convey. The point
                                              here is not to bring about a scientific study on the topic of
                                              qualia but to have a direct feel of the full absorption in the
                                              delight of that clear-luminosity of Â‘soundÂ’. It is the Â‘depth and
                                              degreeÂ’ of absorptive-clarity yet non-staying that is most
                                              important; not the symbolic understand of meanings.</em></p>
