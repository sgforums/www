              experience life of a Buddhist monk to de-stress themselves from high pressure
              jobs. Shanghai's Yufo Temple has received a good response to its week-long
              programme that lets people experience life as a monk.</span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> </span></span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> Most participants are female office workers, state-run Global Times reported.
              The programme will be held from October 15 to 21, and it is aimed at reducing
              stress by experiencing monks' daily lives. Activities include listening to the
              abbot's teaching, copying Buddhist sutras, meditating and chanting. Master
              Huihong of the temple said that there were 108 places for the programme and it
              was filled within 10 days. During the programme, participants will go through a
              modified tonsure ceremony.</span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> </span></span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> "We will not shave off all of the hair, but will only cut a bit of it,
              symbolising the ceremony," he said adding that the programme's purpose is
              to let people experience the life of a monk, not to recruit people. He also
              emphasised that meals will be provided in the temple, correcting some media
              reports that participants will have to beg for all of their food.
              "(Begging for food) is a Buddhist ceremony and will be held at noon on the
              last day of the programme. Participants will follow the master and walk a
              planned route," Huihong said.</span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> </span></span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> According to Yufo Temple, each participant has to pay 2,000 yuan ($ 315) for
              the programme, to cover costs such as clothing, meals and renting venues.</span><span style="line-height: 18.7pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>Sadhu sadhu sadhu, I like it when women practise the dharma, especially Chinese women, they are very sexy.</p>
              <p>However it is a different issue when women become nuns, because you will cause my sangha to fade earlier firstly because you dont procreate when it is your job, secondly you rely on Å›ons and daughters of others to keep you alive, thirdly you are not allowed to accept male disciples and some like Tzuchi went ahead and had as many as one such as Wei Ying Chung the factory owner that imported poisonous ingredients iirc seasoning oils that poisoned carton loads of Tzuchi i.e. Daai brand of instant noodles, many that got shipped into Singapore Tzuchi at Pasir Ris and got secretly removed when it became infamous in Taiwan. Now Tzuchi at Pasir Ris has even closed that small shop that is the same size as the one City Harvest once had at Nanyang and they dont tell you why that clearly on their official website http://tzuchi.org.sg. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Wei Ying Chung has since been arrested and sentenced to prison.</span></p>
              <p>The buddhists are very efficient, you make a mistake i.e. selling poisonous foods, you get arrested you go to jail you come out soon like Ming Yi when he bought his racehorse and more.</p>
              <p>Does it mean that the Buddhists are free from mistakes, we put it on record. We bring it up as textbook case studies.</p>
              <p>I don want to have to ask what is Mdm Mavis busy with because we are supposed to be more efficient than Taipei. I think itÅ› because her new appointment has got her quite flustered I dont know, what are we waiting for?</p>
              <p>Is it life? </p>
