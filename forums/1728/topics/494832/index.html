              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cynthia Thatcher FALL 2009 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cynthia Thatcher explores the teachings on happiness that the
              Buddha gave to Bahiya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The painting was George Seurat’s Neo-impressionist work A
              Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, his famous scene of
              Parisians in a waterside park. As my eye scanned the canvas, jumping from boats
              to people to clouds, it caught on a tree.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here were no seamless bands of color, no blended patches of
              tint as in so many other paintings. The tree was made up of countless specks—a
              smattering of separate orange, yellow, and blue dots. The boats on the water,
              the people on the lawn, their faces and clothes—all were a sprinkling of motes,
              as if the canvas had been caught out in a rain of paint.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Out of the blue, I remembered the ascetic Bahiya, who asked
              the Buddha to teach him the path leading to happiness. “When seeing,” the
              Buddha said, “just see; when hearing, just hear; when knowing, just know; and
              when thinking, just think.” (Udana 1.10) It was all in how you looked at it.
              The Bahiya text is deceptively simple. In one sense, it means: Don’t daydream.
              Pay full attention to what you’re seeing. But there’s more to these words than
              you might think. Or maybe less.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I did a double take when my meditation teacher, Achan Sobin
              Namto, explained the deeper meaning of this attention practice. “If we could
              focus precisely on the present moment…,” he once wrote, “the eye would not be
              able to identify objects coming into the area of perception.” Ultimately, he
              said, following the Bahiya formula meant to see mere color instead of recognizing
              what you were looking at. It was possible to do this because there was a
              split-second time lag between (1) sensing the bare image and (2) recognition.
              (The same applies to perceiving sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental
              phenomena such as feeling.) If mindfulness were quick enough, you could catch
              the moment of bare seeing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Wait a minute—had I heard right? “So if I really stay in the
              present moment,” I asked, “I’ll see a cup in front of me and not recognize it?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Bahiya teaching tells us to break our habit of looking at
              experience in terms of labels or concepts and instead observe ultimate reality
              directly. This is done by paying attention to bare seeing, hearing, smelling,
              touching, tasting, and feeling in their most primitive state, before your inner
              narrator names them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Absolutely,” Achan said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“When pigs fly,” you might be thinking. Achan Sobin was once
              skeptical, too. “Impossible!” he’d said when his own instructor explained the
              idea. Later he spent decades teaching it to others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To understand the teaching Bahiya received, it helps to
              remember the Buddhist distinction between ultimate and conventional truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Consider the painting again: close-up, you see meaningless
              flecks of tint that don’t represent anything. Beings and objects, time and place,
              have vanished. The Seine, the trees, the woman’s face—all have exploded into
              particles, scattered across space. But when you step back from the picture,
              recognizable shapes leap into view as the eye “pulls” the specks together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The individual points of color, and the identities that
              coalesce when the eye connects them, occupy the same space. From one vantage
              point there is a vista of permanent beings and things. From another, there’s no
              solid ground—only empty sensation that you can’t name. The painting presents a
              visual metaphor for conventional truth versus ultimate reality; self versus
              nonself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Bahiya teaching tells us to break our habit of looking at
              experience in terms of labels or concepts and instead observe ultimate reality
              directly. This is done by paying attention to bare seeing, hearing, smelling,
              touching, tasting, and feeling in their most primitive state, before your inner
              narrator names them. By repeatedly watching these events you’ll discover there
              is nothing personal about the act of perception.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Normally you think, “I am seeing.” Yet in the ultimate sense,
              the seeing that happens isn’t anyone’s. Although hearing occurs, there’s no
              self who hears. Rather than a homogeneous entity, we find a collection of
              parts. Unless observed closely, what we regard as the self appears to be a
              solid, personal identity that perceives things. But in truth there is no
              metabeing who unifies the parts. All our actions happen without an agent, or
              self, performing them. There is no seer, just the seeing; no hearer, just the
              hearing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Distinguishing the tree in the painting from the specks it
              consists of may be a walk in the park. But it’s much more challenging to learn
              to separate the named things we’re familiar with from the bare seeing, hearing,
              and touching of actual experience. To master this skill, we must turn our
              attention again and again to direct experience until our mindfulness is fast
              enough to notice bare sights, sounds, touches and so on before recognition
              takes place. Even when practicing very diligently, the remarkable experience of
              observing bare sense-perception usually only happens when we’re least expecting
              it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">One morning, during a meditation retreat, I heard the sound
              of a bird. A mundane event, right? Except the sound was a quick whiplash of sensation
              that wasn’t connected to any named thing—least of all a creature called
              “blackcapped chickadee.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At first I didn’t even recognize the sensation as an auditory
              form as opposed to a sight or smell. The next moment, the mental dots connected
              and the word “bird” slid into the mind. But the label didn’t erase the
              experience. Some veil had slipped, if just for a second.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When Achan Sobin walked in, I could hardly wait to blurt out:
              “It’s just a sound! It has nothing to do with the bird.” The event had somehow
              shaken my world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Nothing to do with the bird?” he asked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bingo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He laughed and nodded. “Very good!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“But it’s not even a sound.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“No,” he confirmed, “by the truth, not even a sound.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Stories of meditators experiencing bare awareness are common
              in the Buddhist world. The English monk Kapilavaddho Bhikkhu describes casually
              looking at his left hand, when “suddenly… the hand had lost all sense of
              solidity… Here, all that was presented to the eye was color.” In her memoir
              Hidden Spring: A Buddhist Woman Confronts Cancer, Sandy Boucher reports that
              when she first tried to mindfully observe pain, the feeling seemed very solid
              and she wanted to scream. But when she stopped labeling the pain as anything
              and ceased defining it as part of her self, a shift happened: “Finally there
              were only the sensations—without a name or a definition or association—only an
              elemental vibration of phenomena expressing life. For a few moments I was able
              to stay with this… separate from my identifications and desires. Then I fell back
              into my ‘I’ and experienced the sensations as if they were attached to ‘me,’
              and they became pain again.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The clincher for me came when my Christian mother attended a
              meditation retreat, expecting nothing but sore knees. “For the first time,” she
              said afterward, “I’d seen color only, without any label attached, and only a
              moment later did I realize I’d been looking at the familiar orange drapes.” But
              is it possible to function in ordinary life when seeing only color patches? No,
              you have to recognize sights and other sense-impressions when writing, cooking,
              and even teaching the dharma. To follow the Bahiya teaching doesn’t mean giving
              up the concepts of conventional reality altogether. The point is to devote some
              time every day to formal insight meditation during which you focus on bare
              sense-perception, until that practice gives rise to clear and direct insight
              into nonself (during daily actvities you can use broader attention). By paying
              attention to sensory experience as it is happening—and not getting caught up in
              the labels, preferences, thoughts, and emotions that happen in the split
              seconds after bare sense-data impinge on our awareness—we learn to see the
              suffering involved in getting caught up. And by seeing that suffering, we learn
              to free ourselves from it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We learn this because when we can separate bare perception
              from conventional meanings, the feeling that an experience is happening to “me”
              begins to drop away. We discover that instead of being inherent in perception,
              the notion of a self is a deep-seated belief unconsciously added to it. If we
              focus on stopping short at bare perception before any concepts arise to
              complicate it, nonself will get clearer and clearer, since it’s the natural
              state of things, always there to be seen. And the clearer our understanding of
              nonself, the less we’ll suffer. Although initially the clinging to self
              disappears only when we’re very mindful, those moments free of delusion give
              deeper insight a chance to arise, and eventually wisdom becomes strong enough
              to trigger a permanent change of outlook. But even before that permanent
              change, the memory of having seen nonself directly—even for one moment—stays
              with us, and most of the time we feel much lighter than we used to.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For most of us, however, the permanent change of outlook is a
              long way down the path. Even observing bare sense-data for a few moments, if we
              truly do it, is nothing to sneeze at. The Burmese meditation master Mahasi
              Sayadaw wrote, “It is no easy matter to stop short at just seeing.” Although
              the aim from day one in insight meditation practice is to observe bare
              perception, it won’t actually happen, he says, until mindfulness and other
              factors reach an intermediate level.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We’re not going to live in a world of nameless sensation
              forever. But glimpsing nonself clearly, even for one moment, puts ordinary
              truth in perspective.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the early stages of meditation, you’ll still perceive only
              named, conventional objects, which are concepts. That’s fine. But it will help
              to focus on the knowing itself––that is, on the act of hearing, touching,
              seeing, and so on––rather than on the sense-impression per se. Further, right
              understanding will guide your effort toward the target. If you realize the aim
              is to know bare perception before the mind names or describes the experience,
              you’ll eventually be able to do it—paradoxically, though, only when you aren’t
              consciously trying to. (And by the way, although I’ve been emphasizing color
              and sound, in practice you’ll observe tactile sensations more often than any
              others.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As we reach the intermediate stages of insight meditation, we
              begin to see that our experience isn’t an unbroken flow but rather a series of
              separate moments of consciousness that arise and die out, one at a time, with
              incredible speed. The mind that sees something quickly dies, and a different
              consciousness hears a sound. No self or soul carries over from one perceptual
              act to the next. In truth, your life-span is only one moment long. Buddhaghosa,
              the fifth-century Indian Buddhist scholar, wrote: “The being of the present
              moment has not lived, it does live just now, but it will not live in the
              future.” While you’ve been reading this article, thousands of different
              “beings” have arisen and died in the very chair you’re sitting in. No wonder
              the Buddha called consciousness a “conjuring trick”! (Samyutta Nikaya 22.95)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In daily life the separate moments seem to blur together,
              concealing the truth that birth and death are always occurring. This is part of
              the reason we buy into the conventional picture of a lasting self. Nonself only
              begins to be clear when the illusion of seamlessness disappears and we
              experience the gaps in the continuity, when we actually see the mind and its
              object arising and dying together from instant to instant. Then we may
              discover, as Mahasi Sayadaw wrote, that “the concept of a human form with its
              head, hands, and other parts is nowhere to be found.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We’re not going to live in a world of nameless sensation
              forever. But glimpsing nonself clearly, even for one moment, puts ordinary
              truth in perspective. When the conventional picture returns, we regard it
              differently. What a relief when we no longer have to take our “selves” so
              seriously! We can still be responsible family members and effective employees;
              but we won’t suffer as much when problems arise. The anger, hurt, or fear that
              usually comes up when the boss berates us—or a loved one betrays us or the body
              gets sick—will be much weaker and shorter-lived. And when it’s absolutely clear
              that no phenomenon, including consciousness, truly belongs to us, we can
              realize the happiness of nibbana as Bahiya did.</span></p>
