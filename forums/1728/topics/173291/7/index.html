            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism does not believe in the existence of an everlasting and unchanging soul. If one accepts the existence of a soul, then one is not a Buddhist with right understanding, but a deviant teaching believer.<br><br>Admittedly, in the eyes of common people, apart from the materialist-only believers, most will believe that everyone has an everlasting and unchanging soul<br><br>Religions such as Christianity, Islam, Jainism and Taoism etc, each to a certain extent subscribe to the idea that soul exists. They believe according to the good and evil that one commits, upon death oneÂ’s soul will be judged either by the heavenly god or Lord Hades. The good ones will ascend to the heavens whereas the evil ones will descent to hell.<br><br>In China, among the masses not only is this superstitious belief about the soul deeply entrenched, there is also a most serious misconception that upon death, the ghost/spirit form that one can take is the soul itself. In Chinese traditional beliefs, this relationship between soul and the ghost presents a knotty and inseparable problem.In China there are many traditional beliefs and sayings. Commonly, souls are used as bridges to explain the transitional state between human rebirths. Birth is seen as the reincarnation of soul and death represents the departure of the soul from a physical body. In general, the relationship between soul and the human body can be viewed as equivalent to that of a house and a house-owner. When the old house is broken, one moves into a new house. While the house can get old, built, moved in or moved out, the house-owner does not change. This implies the belief that the human represents a soul having put on suit of flesh body. While the flesh body can be repeatedly changed, the soul remains unchanged, i.e. belief that soul is the principle entity in our transmigration in the cycle of birth and death.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It is only by dissolving this 7th consciousness will your True Self be revealed. Which is also why it is possible to attain enlightenment and end the cycle of rebirth in Samsara. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not take birth due to their 7th consciousness but due to their great compassion and vows.<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157333" rel="nofollow">Cease your False Self and your True Self lives!</a></div>

That is to discover who you really are?</div></blockquote>In truth, right faith Buddhism does not accept this set of view on the soul. This is because from the principles of Â“conditioned existenceÂ” and Â“conditioned extinctionÂ”, this view is not possible. From the standpoint that Â“all conditioned phenomena are impermanentÂ”, one can recognize that all things are conditioned and impermanent. Not only does this apply to the materialistic domain, even the spiritual domain is also as such. Using the naked eye commonly gives the wrong impression that all things are real and unchanging. However, if high-tech sophisticated instruments are used instead, these things can then be detected to be evolving all the time. In  when continuous arising is used, it actually implies that in the backdrop of every birth there is also continuous death, pointing to continuous changes or continuous evolution.<br><br>After having taken note that all physical phenomena in the physical material domain are ever-continuously arising, looking at the mental phenomena in the spiritual domain would be a lot easier to come to the same conclusion. This is because the arising of mental formations is the result of changes in the spiritual state of the mind. It is this change in the mental formations that brought about the urge/inclination to do good or do evil, which in turn will then vice-versely influence the subsequent mental tendencies. And it is based on this recurring and dependent cycle of relationships between mental conditions and its results that will dictate our short-term experience and long term future.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Various suttas from the<br>Nikayas clearly talk about a state of existence before actual rebirth as a<br>another sentient being. Let me quote some examples from them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> the Buddha states that for conception to<br>occur, one of the conditions is that the being to be reborn (gandhabba) has to<br>be present at the moment of union between the father and mother. Here, it is<br>implicitly stated that there is an intermediate state of existence between death<br>in the previous existence and rebirth in the next.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There are various references to the rebirths of bodhisattas as well as other<br>beings, which also imply as much. According to Sampasadaniya Sutta (DN 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and<br>Sangiti Sutta (DN 33), some beings "enter the mother's womb unknowing, stay<br>there unknowing and leave it unknowing", while others "enter the mother's womb<br>knowing, stay there knowing, and leave it unknowing". One who "enters the<br>mother's womb knowing, stays there knowing and leaves it knowing� is, according<br>to the commentary, a bodhisatta in its last rebirth. This is confirmed by<br>several suttas that describe the bodhisatta's moment of entry into the mother's<br>womb as "being mindful and fully aware�. [Mahapadana Sutta (DN 14);<br>Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta (MN 123); Pathama-tathagata-acchariya Sutta (AN 4: 27);<br>Bhumicala Sutta (AN 8:70)].<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There are references to a fivefold typology of non-returners, one of which is<br>called antaraparinibbayi (�attainer of Nibbana in the interval�<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, in the<br>Samyutta Nikaya (SN 48:15, 24, 66, 51:26, 54:5, 55:25); Purisagati Sutta (AN<br>7:55) and Samyojana Sutta (AN 4:131). Ven Bhikkhu Bodhi, in his "The Connected<br>Discourses of the Buddha: a new translation of the Samyutta Nikaya", Volume II<br>(Note 65, Pp 1902-1903), argues (with support from Samyojana Sutta) that the<br>antaraparinibbayi is "�one who has abandoned the fetter of rebirth<br>(upapattisamyojana) without yet having abandoned the fetter of existence<br>(bhavasamyojana)."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Orthodox Theravadins argue against this interpretation of the<br>antaraparinibbayi because in the Kathavatthu (e.g. Kv 366), an Abhidhamma text<br>regarded by them as canonical, the idea of antarabhava (intermediate life) was<br>strongly refuted.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;However, there is further evidence to consider. In Metta Sutta (Khp 9, Sn<br>1:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> there is reference to bhuta (those who have been born) and sambhavesi<br>(those seeking birth). Several suttas [Channovada Sutta (MN 144); Channa Sutta<br>(SN 4:35:87); Catuttha-nibbana-patisamyutta Sutta (Ud 74)] mention the states of<br>"here or beyond or between the two". Kutuhala Sutta (SN 4:44:9) also tells of "a<br>being [that] has laid down his body but has not yet been reborn in another<br>body".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;All the above references from the suttas implying an intermediate state of<br>existence should provide sufficient food for thought by Theravadins and ample<br>reason to keep an open mind regarding the mystery of dying and rebirth.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Although fundamentalist Theravadins may subscribe to a belief of an<br>intermediate afterlife, it does not necessarily mean that they accept all of the<br>bardo (�gap in between� or intermediate state) teachings postulated by the<br>Vajrayana tradition.</span><br><br>btw, i was told by someone who visited Ajahn Brahm yesterday (he came Singapore for a talk), that Ajahn Brahm cld read his mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">[/b]</blockquote></div>

I am getting increasingly offended by followers of one of the monotheistic faiths. Right now there is a lot of anger and frustration in me. I know these are destructive sentiments, so I am seeking some help here.<br><br>First, something about me; All my life, I have experienced members of a particular monotheistic faiths trying to convert me.<br><br>In the late 1970s, there was a very vocal and aggressive campaign in Singapore not only to promulgate that monotheistic faith, but also to denigrate the traditional Chinese religions such as Taoism and Buddhism. I even get preached everywhere. On the streets, while waiting for a bus, even at home! And these preachers do not stop preaching even after I requested them to stop.<br><br>When I was studying in a missionary school of that faith, our pastor would often tell us stories of a Buddhist/ Taoist converting to that faith after realizing that the statutes they worship are nothing but pieces of wooden blocks. That pastor never fails to gleefully narrate the way these new converts smashed up the Buddhist statutes after being Â‘savedÂ’.<br><br>Even while I was in the armed forces, a fellow soldier freely distributed evangelical materials graphically depicting Buddhists/ Taoists burning in hell for not believing that faith. Even now in the work place, my head of department (HOD) is a member of that faith. On her first day of work, she conducted interviews to familiarize with each of us, and in that interview, not only announces her religion but also ask if I share her faith. I do not. Subsequently, she will seize every opportunity to talk about her faith in office, even to the extent of leading the department in prayer during company sponsored department lunches! By the way, I work in a profit-oriented, secular company. There are people of different religions working in my department.<br><br>Things like that are still happening all over Singapore. Just not to long ago, there were some public concerns over members of that faith exploiting their institutional/ vocational advantages to spread their faith. Eg, a doctor trying to convert his terminally ill patient and lecturer leading prayer sessions with his students etc. members of this faith even manage to insert its influence in sex education, culminating in the recent ST forum discussion of a supposedly secular sex education program not being secular at all.<br><br>The members of this faith areÂ…insidious, for want of a better term. Is there no escaping these evangelists? The latest incident in my office disturbed me the most. I cannot tell my HOD of my concerns. That would be a career limiting move on my part, no matter how politely I may request that. I can of course report her, but that might jeopardize her career. I donÂ’t want something bad to happen to her career tooÂ…<br><br>You know Buddhists as a whole are a stoic lot. They donÂ’t push back even while they are encroached! This is especially true of Singapore Buddhists, who tend to have a very low profile while members of that monotheistic faith are getting increasing vocal. I am having a hard time looking for fellow Singapore Buddhists to share my concerns and to offer me advice on how to manage my feelings of being indignant.<br><br>Help please!<br></div></blockquote>If your faith in Buddha is strong, why is there fustration? Are you moved by men? If your faith in Buddha is like solid mountain, how can the great tide move you one inch? How can you feel anything at all, your mind would be numb.</div>

If one accepts the existence of a soul, then one is not a Buddhist with right understanding, but a deviant teaching believer.<br><br>Admittedly, in the eyes of common people, apart from the materialist-only believers, most will believe that everyone has an everlasting and unchanging soul<br><br>Religions such as Christianity, Islam, Jainism and Taoism etc, each to a certain extent subscribe to the idea that soul exists. They believe according to the good and evil that one commits, upon death oneÂ’s soul will be judged either by the heavenly god or Lord Hades. The good ones will ascend to the heavens whereas the evil ones will descent to hell.<br><br>In China, among the masses not only is this superstitious belief about the soul deeply entrenched, there is also a most serious misconception that upon death, the ghost/spirit form that one can take is the soul itself. In Chinese traditional beliefs, this relationship between soul and the ghost presents a knotty and inseparable problem.In China there are many traditional beliefs and sayings. Commonly, souls are used as bridges to explain the transitional state between human rebirths. Birth is seen as the reincarnation of soul and death represents the departure of the soul from a physical body. In general, the relationship between soul and the human body can be viewed as equivalent to that of a house and a house-owner. When the old house is broken, one moves into a new house. While the house can get old, built, moved in or moved out, the house-owner does not change. This implies the belief that the human represents a soul having put on suit of flesh body. While the flesh body can be repeatedly changed, the soul remains unchanged, i.e. belief that soul is the principle entity in our transmigration in the cycle of birth and death.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Buddhists do believe in an everlasting soul, if not how do you reincarnate in the six realms of samsara??<br><br>Anyway, for your infomation, what Christians, Muslims and Taoists believe are right, it is you that is wrong.

I think he give a very good explanation.<br><br>Buddha taught the <strong>doctrine of selflessness</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Our mind has gross and subtle levels. The sense consciousness that see, hear, smell, taste and feel tactile sensations, and the gross mental consciousness, which is always so busy thinking this and that, function very actively while we are alive. At the time of death, they cease to function and absorb into the subtle mental consciousness. This subtle mind bears with it all the imprints of the actions we have done. It is this subtle mind which leaves one body, enters the intermediate state and finally takes rebirth in another body. After the subtle mind is joined with another body at the moment of conception, the gross sense consciousness and the gross mental consciousness reappear, and the person again sees, hears, thinks, etc. This subtle mind, which goes from one life to the next, is a constantly changing phenomena. For this reason, it is not considered to be a soul, atman, self or real personality</span><br><br><strong>rebirth</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rebirth refers to a personÂ’s mind taking one body after the other. Our body and our mind are separate entities: the body is matter and is made of atoms. The mind refers to all of our emotional and cognitive experiences, and is formless. When the body and mind are linked, we are alive, but at death, they separate. The body becomes a corpse, and the mind continues on to take another body</span><br><br>U need to do more study on the 'Emptiness'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
