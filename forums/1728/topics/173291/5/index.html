From the scientific angle, we can tell him we don't know how his handicap comes about, and we dont know why he is the only one in about a hundred thousand people to suffer this. (In other words, tell the handicapped that he is a freak and/ or genetic accident). From the monotheistic religious angle, we can tell him that this is God's will and He choose to make you so for a reason only He knows. None of these explanations are easy.<br><br>However, the point of Buddhism is not to rub it into the handicapped and to exacerbate their discrimination, but rather to explain the phenomena of his handicap. Whats more important for us Buddhists is to help these handicap in anyway we can and to alleviate their suffering. Buddhists are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> to sit back, do nothing, and claim that these handicapped are reaping a just karmic consequence.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Beyond Religion:<br><strong><br><br>There is never an easy way to explain to a handicap why he is a handicapped. From the scientific angle, we can tell him we don't know how his handicap comes about, and we dont know why he is the only one in about a hundred thousand people to suffer this. (In other words, tell the handicapped that he is a freak and/ or genetic accident). From the monotheistic religious angle, we can tell him that this is God's will and He choose to make you so for a reason only He knows. None of these explanations are easy.<br><br>However, the point of Buddhism is not to rub it into the handicapped and to exacerbate their discrimination, but rather to explain the phenomena of his handicap. Whats more important for us Buddhists is to help these handicap in anyway we can and to alleviate their suffering.

And as my article has suggested, foetus of the 1-3 months already has heartbeat and formation of a human. Although the legal period for abortion is much longer than that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what Shade343 said. In fact , Judaism, Islam , Christianity, all three religions share the same God. And Judaism is the mother of Christianity that is to say Christianity comes from Judaism. The Old Testament is Jewish scriptures.Jesus Christ gone to India to learn Buddhism and Hinduism before.All religions have Doomdays Teachings, including Buddhism which has a future Buddha calls Maitreya coming to save the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is my case.... (regarding foetus)<br><br>when i knew i was pregnant, i just felt naturally there's another living thing living inside together with me. be it a foetus of 2months or more so forth, sometimes i could feel its heart beat and movement around inside the womb tummy. its alive just like me...<br><br>abortion is cruel but in modern society where people have many different needs and reasons they opt for this solution to remove from having kids. sometimes its sad sometimes no choice...... but killing is involved in abortion where a healthy alive normal foetus is concerned. its important to use precaution if not planning for babies cos "accidents" do happen as nothing is 100% safe.<br><br>i experienced miscarriage too. thats my cause and effect. cos from young i never eat enough healthy tonic nourishing food and have always been stressful busy with work....<br>or.... is that my karma?<br><br>the doctor told me to abort the 2.5months old foetus cos its unhealthy died already inside my womb....<br></div>
