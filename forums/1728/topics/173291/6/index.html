See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=152247" rel="nofollow">When will it be the End of the World?</a><br><br>In My Humble Opinion: I agree that Jesus Christ is a highly enlightened being. However even though he is highly enlightened and is a mahabodhisattva, he probably couldnt teach the ultimate truth to everyone. Not everyone has that kind of capacities. In most of the gospels I see, Jesus Christ taught people to ascend to heaven, the celestial realms in Buddhism, by loving all, being virtuous and shunning evil. But in Buddhism that is still not ultimate. Practising virtuously and avoiding evil alone will not lead to liberation, only by purification of the mind will it lead to liberation.. that is no more sentient mind.<br><br>Probably few has caught the essence of what Jesus taught.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1. And he said, "Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death."<br><br>2. Jesus said, "Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]"<br><br>3. Jesus said, "If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the (Father's) kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the (Father's) kingdom is within you and it is outside you.<br><br>When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."<br><br>22. Jesus saw some babies nursing. He said to his disciples, "These nursing babies are like those who enter the (Father's) kingdom."<br><br>They said to him, "Then shall we enter the (Father's) kingdom as babies?"<br><br>Jesus said to them, "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter [the kingdom]."<br><br>28. Jesus said, "I took my stand in the midst of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them. I found them all drunk, and I did not find any of them thirsty. My soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their hearts and do not see, for they came into the world empty, and they also seek to depart from the world empty.<br><br>But meanwhile they are drunk. When they shake off their wine, then they will change their ways."<br><br>62. Jesus said, "I disclose my mysteries to those [who are worthy] of [my] mysteries.<br><br>77. Jesus said, "I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, and to me all attained.<br><br>Split a piece of wood; I am there.<br><br>Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."<br><br>91. They said to him, "Tell us who you are so that we may believe in you."<br><br>He said to them, "You examine the face of heaven and earth, but you have not come to know the one who is in your presence, and you do not know how to examine the present moment."<br><br>113. His disciples said to him, "When will the kingdom come?"<br><br>"It will not come by watching for it. It will not be said, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't see it."</span></div>

Not only your father, but many many others have reported similar thing. Their tears fall even after passing away. And they feel very uncomfortable because they are no longer in control of their body (remember I said sleep paralysis was just like death?).. and they are attached to the loved ones. Consciousness generally can abide there up to 8 hours after death, but in extreme cases, for a few days. That is why my taiwanese teacher ask people to delay as far as possible from sending the corpse into the frozen morgue. It will freeze him to death and the consciousness will experience the sufferings of the Ice Hells.<br><br>In any case, it seems your father has been too attached and even appears in your dreams. I suggest every year during 7th Month you attend Ksitigarbha Pujas, Ullabanadharma Puja, and dedicate the merits of offerings to the Sangha to your father in case he has fallen into the spirit realm so that he can quickly reborn in human realm again. Even if he is reborn in virtuous realms, dedicating merits will help him gain blessings. Even if he is in Amitabha Pure Land, dedication of merits will also help him raise the 'grade'. (See: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">Ullambana Dharma - Not Festival Of Hungry Ghosts</a>) Tell your father that you are going to dedicate merits to him and ask him to attend the puja during which you dedicate the merits to him. Since his 'yuan' is strong with you he should easily resonate with your thoughts.<br><br>BTW, you are not Chinese or your father is not Chinese? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> I don't remember seeing your photo as Indian.</div>
