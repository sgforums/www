Those members of the church believe in being evangelical because it serves them. You have the free choice to walk away from them if you so desire. Use your intuition in discerning the truth. And do not worry about those who convert. In fact you should be happy for them. These people convert for they believe what they are doing is right and if it serves them, so be it. Do no be judgemental.<br><br>But I would condemn the behaviour of people smashing religious statues. Remember that all religions came from God. So it does not matter what faith you suscribe to. NO religion teaches bad.</div>

Is there any universal rule or Law that states that you must respond to anybody who issues you a statement of negativity?<br><br>Like I said its precisely because of how man interpreted God words that causes them to do things like smash religious statues in afghanistan. These people are fanatics who do not understand God. You think prophet mohammad is happy with these fanatics? And why are you concern about whether buddhism will be extinct or not? Remember that buddhism teaches the sublimation of ego, pride and arrogance. Look to the west. More and more caucasians are adopting buddhism and its something which is gaining popularity over there.<br><br>Im a student and I have friends who preach to me about the gospel and the bible. And I feel sad that some of them tell me things like "if you are not a christian, you would go to hell". It only shows how much they know about God.<br><br>Again I ask, Why are you so concern about how the monotheist go about preaching? Does it serve you to be concern about their ways? Why worry about what they are doing? Is it because you dont want their fellowship to be bigger than the fellowship of buddhism? Be at Peace! Buddism is a peaceful religion!<br><br>If what your boss says displeases you, you can always be polite and tactful about it. If she ask you to go to church, you can politely decline and explain that it is not really necessary as you have another faith. Christians are taught to be evangelical...Unfortunately, that does not mean asking people of another to faith to convert.<br><br>But then again, I think your boss has a rather outgoing personality <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

No need to get work up about it. I think people should learn how to ignore things that dosent serve them.
