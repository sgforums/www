Essentially, truth-based faiths are different from faiths like Buddhism, where its part of their doctrine to evangelise, albeit overzealously. Its also essential to their doctrine that other religions are bad or false. By questioning their actions, there is a possibility, you are using your own values to override their values and in the proces, judge them.<br><br>My personal take on this? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have so far personally target people who sully other religions, but not overzealous preachers who are pushy</span>, but not to the point of condemning other religions.</strong><br><br>And from the way this thread goes, most of the time you guys are talking about Christians and Christianity. But, pardon me, my personal view is that its inappropriate for a forum like a Buddhism forum. I guess its allright to discuss the differences in the values upheld by these two faiths, but the mood has gone to Christians bashing and using our values to put their religions in the negative light, for example, pooh pooh their view that their faith is the true one.<br><br>We may have done what we dont want others to do to us, that is, to a bunch of non believers discussing in full length about other religion.<br><br>I hope I have made add some valuable points to the discucssions.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I think a little contradictory between two statements. First you say its 'grey area' to condemn people who <strong>insulted</strong> other religions, then later you say targeting people who sully other religions is ok, but not overzealous preachers who are pushy.<br><br>I think insulting other religions has definitely crossed the line. Being pushy about one's religion is still ok - as long as it did not become annoying. I think there is little we can do about them being pushy. We can kindly reject them or tolerate them. But if he has gone over the line to insult, condemn other people's religions, that is against Singapore multi racialism and religious tolerance.<br><br>On the other hand, Buddhism can work more to promote its own teachings.. as long as not to the level of being pushy or overzealous.</div>

Of all the religions I know, all focuses on their gods or one god and their teachings not really that different from one another.<br><br>From my personal opinion, its really not captivating and arousing to the intelligence to say the least as it needs an unquestioning blind faith to the almighty one and there is nothing really new in the teachings, like everything, the entire cosmos, human races were created by god and after you die, if you have accepted the god, you will be reborn in the god's heaven forever.<br><br>Its refreshing to know that Buddhism is more than this, especially at this day and age, where science and technology revealed more than god revealed to us. I also heard that Buddhism is an offshoot of Hinduism, and that Buddhism merely refined  or improved the concept of transmigration and kamma from Hinduism.<br><br>Although kamma and rebirth were already in existence in India before the advent of Buddhism, the buddhist teachings (Dhamma) excelled and improved the concept of kamma and rebirth to a new level not heard before and self liberation rather than relying on salvation externally, like god.<br><br>One sentence to describe Buddhism among the religions in this world, a lotus that is so beautiful and refreshing , that standout in a pond.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha never confirmed or denied the existence of gods because this kind of questioning does not lead to happiness. He did make it clear that gods, if they literally exist, created nothing and are merely beings trapped in a different realm of suffering. When the good fortune created by their past behavior is used up these beings will be thrown back into a lower realm and continue in the endless cycle of existence.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Essentially, truth-based faiths are different from faiths like Buddhism, where its part of their doctrine to evangelise, albeit overzealously. Its also essential to their doctrine that other religions are bad or false. By questioning their actions, there is a possibility, you are using your own values to override their values and in the proces, judge them.<br><br><span style="color: red;">My personal take on this? I have so far personally target people who sully other religions, but not overzealous preachers who are pushy, but not to the point of condemning other religions.</span><br><br>And from the way this thread goes, most of the time you guys are talking about Christians and Christianity. But, pardon me, my personal view is that its inappropriate for a forum like a Buddhism forum. I guess its allright to discuss the differences in the values upheld by these two faiths, but the mood has gone to Christians bashing and using our values to put their religions in the negative light, for example, pooh pooh their view that their faith is the true one.<br><br>We may have done what we dont want others to do to us, that is, to a bunch of non believers discussing in full length about other religion.<br><br>I hope I have made add some valuable points to the discucssions.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">Breytonharge seems to think otherwise, IMO. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>And yes, there can only be harmony in the world when all people decide that <span style="font-style: italic;">if it harm no one, do what you will</span>.</div>
