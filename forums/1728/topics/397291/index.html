              <p>Act, speak, with full awareness 
              and then you will find a
              tremendous change in you. The very fact that you are aware changes
              your acts. Then you cannot commit sin. Not that you have to control
              yourself, no! Control is a poor substitute for awareness, a very
              poor substitute; it doesn't help much. If you are aware, you need
              not control anger; in awareness, anger never arises. They cannot
              exist together; there is no coexistence for them. In 
              awareness, jealousy never arises. In awareness, many things simply
              disappear - all the things that are negative.</p>
              <p>It is just like a light. When the light is in your house, how
              can darkness exist there? It simply escapes. When your house is
              lighted, how can you stumble? How can you knock at the wall? The
              light is there, you know the door, you simply reach the door, you
              get out or in. When there is darkness, you grope, you stumble, you
              fall. Anger is nothing but stumbling; jealousy is nothing but
              groping in the dark. All that is wrong is wrong, not because of
              itself but because you are living in darkness.</p>
              <p>If Jesus wants to be angry, he can be; he can use it. You cannot
              use it - you are being used by it. If Jesus feels that it will be
              good and helpful, he can use anything - he is a master. Jesus can
              be angry without being angry. Many people worked with Gurdjieff,
              and he was a terrible man. When he was angry, he would be terribly
              angry, he would look like a murderer! But that was just a game,
              just a situation to help somebody. And immediately, not a single
              moment's gap would be there, he would look again at the same person
              toward whom he had been angry, and he would be angry and terrible
              looking.</p>
              <p>It is possible. When you are aware, you can use everything. Even
              poison becomes elixir when you are aware. And when you are asleep,
              even elixir becomes poison - because the whole thing depends on
              your being alert or not. Acts don't mean anything. Acts do not
              matter - you, your awareness, your being conscious, mindful, is
              what matters. What you do is not the concern.</p>

I am perfectly aware, and have been for a long time, that I am “snobbish.” What prevents my getting rid of snobbishness?<br><br>Krishnamurti: The questioner has not understood what I mean by awareness. If you have a habit, the habit of snobbishness for instance, it is no good merely to overcome this habit by another, its opposite. It is futile to fight one habit by another habit. What rids the mind of habit is intelligence. Awareness is the process of awakening intelligence, not creating new habits to fight the old ones. So, you must become conscious of your habits of thought, but do not try to develop opposite qualities or habits. If you are fully aware, if you are in that state of choiceless observation, then you will perceive the whole process of creating a habit and also the opposite process of overcoming it. This discernment awakens intelligence, which does away with all habits of thought. We are eager to get rid of those habits which give us pain or which we have found to be worthless, by creating other habits of thought and assertions. This process of substitution is wholly unintelligent. If you will observe you will find that mind is nothing but a mass of habits of thought and memories. By merely overcoming these habits by others, the mind still remains in prison, confused and suffering. It is only when we deeply comprehend the process of self-protective reactions, which become habits of thought, limiting all action, that there is a possibility of awakening intelligence, which alone can dissolve the conflict of opposites.<br><br>J.

                      <p>The karmapa definitely endorsement sounds suspicious because of new age terms. The HHDL I'm not sure as well, but I will not be surprised if the endorsement is real because HHDL has given endorsement to a number of non-Buddhist mystics including Sri Ramana Maharshi and others.</p>
                      <p>I don't think he fits Shurangama Sutra - alot of his apparent failings has to do with the community he had. They are into using his money and did many evil deeds (including attempting murder) though Osho never endorsed any of these.</p>

              <p>We cannot judge someone by what we hear about him, or just by behavior alone. To see whether one is enlightened, one has to judge by the criteria of insights alone.</p>

              <p>The karmapa definitely endorsement sounds suspicious because of new age terms. The HHDL I'm not sure as well, but I will not be surprised if the endorsement is real because HHDL has given endorsement to a number of non-Buddhist mystics including Sri Ramana Maharshi and others.</p>
              <p>I don't think he fits Shurangama Sutra - alot of his apparent failings has to do with the community he had. They are into using his money and did many evil deeds (including attempting murder) though Osho never endorsed any of these.</p>

              <p>He just needs to ask one question (forgot what was it) and if the person is not enlightened, he will not be able to answer. lol</p>

              <h2>..........</h2>
              <p>It happened:</p>
              <p>There was one great 
                          master, a Buddhist master, Nagarjuna. A thief came to him. The thief had
                           fallen in love with the master because he had never seen such a 
                          beautiful person, such infinite grace. The thief asked Nagarjuna, "Is 
                          there some possibility of my growth also? But one thing I must make 
                          clear to you: I am a thief. And another thing: I cannot leave it, so 
                          please don't make it a condition. I will do whatsoever you say, but I 
                          cannot stop being a thief. That I have tried many times--it never works,
                           so I have left the whole sport. I have accepted my destiny, that I am 
                          going to be a thief and remain a thief, so don't talk about it. From the
                           very beginning let it be clear."</p>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br> Nagarjuna said, "Why are you afraid? Who is going to talk about your 
                          being a thief?"<br> The thief said, "But whenever I go to a monk, to a religious priest, or 
                          to a religious saint, they always say, 'First stop stealing.'"<br> <br> Nagarjuna laughed and said, "Then you must have gone to thieves; 
                          otherwise, why? Why should they be concerned? I am not concerned!"<br> <br> The thief was very happy. He said, "Then it is okay. It seems that now I
                           can become a disciple. You are the right master."<br> <br> Nagarjuna accepted him and said, "Now you can go and do whatsoever you 
                          like. Only one condition has to be followed: be aware! Go, break into 
                          houses, enter, take things, steal; do whatsoever you like, that is of no
                           concern to me, I am not a thief--but do it with full awareness."<br> <br> The thief couldn't understand that he was falling into the trap. He 
                          said, "Then everything is okay. I will try." After three weeks he came 
                          back and said, "You are tricky--because if I become aware, I cannot 
                          steal. If I steal, awareness disappears. I am in a fix."<br> <br> Nagarjuna said, "No more talk about your being a thief and stealing. I 
                          am not concerned; I am not a thief. Now, you decide! If you want 
                          awareness, then you decide. If you don't want it, then too you decide."<br> <br> The man said, "But now it is difficult. I have tasted it a little, and 
                          it is so beautiful--I will leave anything, whatsoever you say. Just the 
                          other night for the first time I was able to enter the palace of the 
                          king. I opened the treasure. I could have become the richest man in the 
                          world--but you were following me and I had to be aware. When I became 
                          aware, diamonds looked just like stones, ordinary stones. When I lost 
                          awareness, the treasure was there. And I waited and did this many times.
                           I would become aware and I became like a buddha, and I could not even 
                          touch it because the whole thing looked foolish, stupid--just stones, 
                          what am I doing? Losing myself over stones? But then I would lose 
                          awareness; they would become again beautiful, the whole illusion. But 
                          finally I decided that they were not worth it."</div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br></div>
              <div class="KonaBody">Once you have known awareness, nothing is worth it - you have known the greatest bliss of life. Then, suddenly, many things simply drop; they become stupid, become foolish. The motivation is not there, the desire is not there, the dreams have fallen.</div>

              <p>Yes but so far I don't think anyone has mentioned Osho as being a demon.</p>
              <p>Many times we have very prejudiced views of teachers because they don't fit into our model of how a guru 'should be'. There are great and enlightened gurus who drink, womanize, etc. I won't justify their behaviors, but whether a spiritual teacher is genuine is not as easy as we think.</p>
              <p>Anyway I also hope people do not demonize people - like labeling someone as a demon, etc. If you want to point out what you disagree with someone (what aspect of his teaching, etc) - that is fine, but not demonizing.</p>
              <p>For me, it is very clear who are simply on a guru business, and who are having genuine insights. I can recognise what Osho said in my own experience, and know that his words are genuine. Sometimes just reading the texts you feel that your experience is being authenticated as you read (though not that I have reached Osho's level of wisdom) and it is still a joy to read even if you already know what he is saying. There is a real power in the words of genuine teachers... to reflect the Presence in you. Those who do not have such wisdom will not be able to put it down so concisely in words. They will be writing from the ego-centric perspective, rather than from a place of Wisdom and Presence. It is easily recognizable. When you yourself are in the 'place' of Presence and Awareness, you will be able to detect whether what is said is from that place, or from the place of ego.</p>

              <p>Many times we have very prejudiced views of teachers because they don't fit into our model of how a guru 'should be'. There are great and enlightened gurus who drink, womanize, etc. I won't justify their behaviors, but whether a spiritual teacher is genuine is not as easy as we think.</p>
              <p>Anyway I also hope people do not demonize people - like labeling someone as a demon, etc. If you want to point out what you disagree with someone (what aspect of his teaching, etc) - that is fine, but not demonizing.</p>
              <p>For me, it is very clear who are simply on a guru business, and who are having genuine insights.</p>

              <p><strong>Many Illnesses, One Prescription</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: red;">Pradipam,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> I know why the question
               has arisen<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span>because
               you have tried not to  be angry, you have decided so many times, but 
              still it happens. You have tried  not to be greedy, but again and again 
              you fall in the trap. You have tried <span style="color: red;">ALL</span> <span style="color: blue;">all </span>kinds of  things to change 
              yourself, but nothing seems ever to happen. You remain the  same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And here I am saying that
               there is a simple key<span style="color: blue;">:</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> awareness. You  cannot believe it. How can
               awareness, just awareness<span style="color: red;">,</span> help when 
              nothing else has been of any help? Keys are always very small; keys  are
               not very big things. A small key can open a very big lock. And why does
                awareness function as a key?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The person who is living in a dream, is deep asleep, has a  
              nightmare, is being tortured, is being killed. And of course fighting, 
              fighting  back, he is very much afraid, wants somebody to save him, and 
              finds no way to  escape. All around him are enemies with naked swords. 
              Death seems to be  certain. Trembling, perspiring, just out of the pain 
              of the nightmare, he  awakes. Still his breathing is not natural, still 
              he is perspiring, trembling,  but he starts laughing. There is no 
              problem... the dream has disappeared. All  those enemies and the naked 
              swords were not realities. He need not ask to be  saved; he need not 
              arrange any defence. The whole thing was just a shadow  world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Once awakened the whole 
              dream has disappeared. And in the  dream he had tried every possible way
               to protect himself and was finding it  impossible. That's how the case 
              is with you, with everybody.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anger is a shadow. You cannot be victorious by fighting  with a
               shadow. Greed is a shadow... these are not realities. The reality is  
              that which will remain even when awareness has happened. And this is the
                miracle: those who have known awareness have not known anything of 
              anger or  greed. Not that they dropped them<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> they simply don't find them! Once 
              the light is  there, darkness is not there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Buddha is reported to have said when he 
              became  enlightened, the first moment of it, he smiled and he said: <span style="color: red;">"</span> <span style="color: blue;">‘</span>This is
                unbelievable! <span style="color: red;">– so</span> <span style="color: blue;">So,</span> I have been enlightened from the very 
              beginning<span style="color: red;">!</span>?  And all those chains and 
              all those imprisonments were just dreams?<span style="color: blue;">’</span><span style="color: red;">"</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When people would ask him, <span style="color: red;">"</span> <span style="color: blue;">‘</span>What should we do not to be angry<span style="color: blue;">’</span>, or <span style="color: blue;">‘</span>what
               should we  do not to be greedy<span style="color: blue;">’</span>, or <span style="color: blue;">‘</span>what should we do not to be so much 
              obsessed with  sex or food?<span style="color: blue;">’</span><span style="color: red;">"</span> his answer was always the same: <span style="color: red;">B</span> <span style="color: blue;">b</span>e aware.
               Bring awareness to your life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">His disciple, Ananda, listening again and again to every  kind
               of person<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> different problems, but the prescription of the physician remains the 
              same<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> became puzzled.  He said, <span style="color: red;">"</span> <span style="color: blue;">‘</span>What  is the matter with you? They bring 
              different kinds of illness<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span>somebody brings  greed and somebody sex and
               somebody food and somebody something else<span style="color: blue;">,</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> but your prescription  remains the 
              same<span style="color: blue;">’</span><span style="color: red;">!"</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And Buddha said, <span style="color: red;">" </span><span style="color: blue;">‘</span>Their 
              illnesses are different just as people can  dream different dreams.<span style="color: blue;">’</span><span style="color: red;">"</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here you are: if all of 
              you, all two thousand sannyasi<span style="color: red;">n</span>s, fall 
              asleep you will have two thousand dreams.  Remember, you cannot invite 
              anybody to share your dream<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span>it is very private<span style="color: blue;">,</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span>not even your wife 
              or your husband, nobody can  share it. So two thousand people will have 
              two thousand dreams. But if you come  to me and ask how to get rid of 
              this dream, the medicine will remain the same:  Wake up! It is not going
               to be different; the prescription is going to be the  same. You can 
              call it awareness, you can call it witnessing, you can call it  
              remembering, you can call it meditation<span style="color: blue;">–</span> <span style="color: red;">--</span> these are different names for the 
              same medicine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Act
               with more awareness.</span></p>

              <p>Btw going back to the topic of Osho... I just found a very well written (though I do not agree on a few points) article on Osho and his failings which I think is a very interesting read. It paints a realistic picture about 'gurus' and how enlightenment does not automatically make one into an infallible perfect human being like Buddha. <a href="http://rajneesh.info/">http://rajneesh.info/</a></p>
              <p>Thusness also commented to me on Osho in 2007 that Osho had non-dual insight,<em> but not
                                                  necessarily authenticated with the experience of
                                                  impersonality.. Once non-dual goes with 
                          impersonality &amp; this
                                                  experience is stabilized, then material gain or 
                          loss becomes
                                                  non-important.</em></p>
