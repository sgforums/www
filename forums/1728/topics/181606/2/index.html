Therefore it is important to learn about the Buddhist teachings and find a Buddhist teacher to guide you. Chanting and meditation is just a small part of Buddhism, and is one out of 84000 dharma doors. Cultivating in the midst of our living is most important.<br><br>But you must understand that the modern day taoism (i.e mediumship, deities, etc) is really different from buddhism. But the more ancient taoist teachings, i.e Tao te ching is still relevant and v close to buddhism.</div></blockquote>Finally, I could concur with one forumnite the closeness of the ancient Taoist and the Buddhism. I believe that both of these teachings centred on family and human values.</div>

My Buddhist master have read the Tao Te Ching and said that Lao Tzu was a highly enlightened person, one who achieved Pratyekabuddhahood. Not only my buddhist master, but many of my other high realised buddhist friends also liked many taoist teachings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This shows that Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, their core doctrines does not really contradict each other.<br><br>Check: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=180404" rel="nofollow">looking for the Tao article post</a><br><br><blockquote>I believe that both of these teachings centred on family and human values.</blockquote>Actually something I feel is... the original and ancient Taoist teachings is more towards the 'Chu1 Shi4 Jian1 Fa3', or supramundane dharma. In this aspect Buddhism is definitely close to Taoist teachings by Lao Tzu, but in terms of mundane dharma I think Taoist teachings does not has as much as say.. Confucianism or Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no4d.htm</a><br><br>2. Which religions do the teachings of Confucius and Mencius belong to?<br><br>The teachings of Confucius and Mencius are within the boundary of the laws of this secular world and are not considered to be religious. They constitute a form of academic ideology. Confucius and Mencius dealt with the laws of this secular world. Taoism deals with the laws that are beyond this secular world. Buddhism deals with the laws that are both within and beyond this secular world.</blockquote></div>

Metta Sutra is a pali scripture. But actually all Pali scriptures can also be found on its Chinese counterpart, the Chinese canon.
