            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Birth Dates Never Clash Negatively with those of 'Buddhist Gods' Â– 15 Feb 06<br>- Ven. Sik Kwang Sheng (Secretary-General of Singapore Buddhist Federation)</strong><br><br>IN THE article 'M-cyclist dies in 4-vehicle collision on PIE' (ST, Jan 31), it was reported that 'Mr Seah Peng Kee's relatives had asked him to give offerings and incense to the gods because he was born in the Year of the Dragon and his birth date clashed with that of a Buddhist god. 'To Buddhists, this means bad luck,' said an uncle who declined to be named.'<br><br>As we express our deep condolences to the family of the bereaved, please allow us to clarify that the above belief is not Buddhist in nature. In Buddhist teachings, there is no Buddha, Bodhisattva or god whose birth date clashes negatively with that of any person, which then requires some form of appeasement.<br><br>In Buddhism, so-called 'bad luck' can be averted by the active practice of generosity to aid the needy. This creates positive karma, which dilutes the ill effects of negative karma. However, due to the complex dynamics of karma, fortunes and misfortunes can be difficult to predict. What is of paramount importance is the continual practice of good.<br><br>In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the central subjects of spiritual refuge, not any god. While Buddhist cosmology acknowledges and respects the existence of many gods, some of whom are Buddhist, the historical Buddha is called 'the teacher of humans and gods' in the context of Buddhism.<br><br>In multi-religious Singapore, it is crucial to be mindful about use of religious terms. We hope there will be more caution and sensitivity in future, so as to preserve Singapore's religious harmony, which is as precious as it is delicate.</div>

Therefore it is important to learn about the Buddhist teachings and find a Buddhist teacher to guide you. Chanting and meditation is just a small part of Buddhism, and is one out of 84000 dharma doors. Cultivating in the midst of our living is most important.<br><br>But you must understand that the modern day taoism (i.e mediumship, deities, etc) is really different from buddhism. But the more ancient taoist teachings, i.e Tao te ching is still relevant and v close to buddhism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I find this letter by the Ven. insensitive and kind of out of line.<br><br>I acknowledge that the uncle's practice and opinion is not according to the correct Buddhist teachings.<br><br>However in this context the article was quoting the uncle ; it was his own perspective of his beliefs.  He doesn't represent any authority or the official stance of the religion.  I don't think anyone reading the article would take his word to be the absolute truth either.<br><br>For a letter to be issued to correct a man's beliefs at a time of loss is somewhat insensitive and distasteful IMO.</div>
