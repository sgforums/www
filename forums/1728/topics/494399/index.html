              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2017-08-07 Daily Mirror </span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">An objective analysis
              of Buddhism and science  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism has been described by Buddhist Scholar S.N. Goenka
              as “a pure science of mind and matter”. He substantiates this on the basis that
              Buddhism uses precise, analytical, philosophical and psychological terminology
              and reasoning . The Buddha explained the reality of things in terms of cause
              and effect. Buddhism is firmly founded on the principle that effects arise from
              causation. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual is due
              to the presence of causes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is undoubtedly the most profound and wholesome
              educational path available to mankind. It explains the true nature of life and
              the universe. In the Buddhist doctrine “life” refers to ourselves and the
              “universe” refers to the environment in which we live. Buddhism begins with
              mindfulness. One has to be mindful of the moment that is now, connected with
              what one is doing outside and what one is thinking and feeling inside. Thus,
              Buddhism is not only about withdrawal or detachment from this world but is also
              about living each moment meaningfully.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is essentially a teaching for the intelligentsia. It
              is based on a systematic and rational analysis of the problems of life and the
              way to their solution. The Buddha emphatically admonished everyone to “come and
              see”; not to “come and believe”. Buddhism does not rely on blind faith. On the
              contrary one is encouraged to probe and verify personally what the Buddha
              preached.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is undoubtedly the most profound and wholesome
              educational path available to mankind. It explains the true nature of life and
              the universe. In the Buddhist doctrine “life” refers to ourselves and the
              “universe” refers to the environment in which we live. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism has totally rejected belief by faith while
              encouraging personal conviction by investigation. Buddhism stands out
              singularly alone as the only system of thought that can be accepted by strict
              rationalization and comparison with already known phenomena. Every other
              religious system can be scientifically and rationally doubted. Buddhism is unique
              as in that not a single facet of its teaching can be disproved or even
              rationally doubted. On an intellectual basis, Buddhism has only one real
              contender to convince and that is the materialist. One does not need Buddhism
              to obviate the sparse rationalism of most religious systems. In fact most
              religions other than Buddhism are engaged in a desperate and pathetic struggle
              to keep up with the concepts of modern Science; so much so that with every new
              scientific discovery they have to adjust their sequence of thought and at times
              even the dogma.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism today is a hot topic in the science and religion
              dialogue. There is a basic understanding between Buddhist scholars and eminent
              scientists regarding the compatibility of Buddhism and science. The case is
              made that the philosophical and psychological teachings contained in Buddhism
              share commonalities with modern scientific and philosophical thought. For
              example Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of nature or Dhamma
              Vicaya; the principal object of such study being oneself. In fact some popular
              conceptions of Buddhism connect it to discourses regarding evolution, quantum
              theory and cosmology. Moreover, Buddhism has been described as rational and non
              – dogmatic. There is ample evidence to prove that it has been so from the
              earliest period of history. Among the common philosophical principles shared
              between Buddhism and science are causality, empiricism and suspicion of
              absolutes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Great scientist Albert Einstein has spelt out the common
              thread that binds Buddhism and science as follows. “The religion of the future
              will be cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal god and avoid dogmas
              and theology. Covering both the natural and spiritual it should be based on a
              religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual
              and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers to this description. If there is any
              religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be
              Buddhism”.Likewise, many scientists have observed similarities between science
              and Buddhism. The American physicist Robert Oppenheimer saw in Buddhism a
              scientific parallel to the puzzling riddles of modern physics.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science; The product of
              observations and experiments</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science is as old as man. It is also universal in the sense
              that the subjects of study, the methods employed and results obtained have been
              similar throughout history and across all civilizations. Science from its
              humble beginnings has come a long way. It has been successful in solving many
              human problems and making life ever more comfortable. Advances in medical
              science and new scientific inventions have contributed to relieving pain,
              eradicating disease, lengthening the life span and also made life healthier and
              more comfortable. But science up to date except in a few areas of human
              activity apparently has been oblivious to the damaging effect of fuelling the
              fires of human greed for more and more comforts and better quality of
              life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science is an understanding of matter whereas spiritualism is
              related to the consciousness of the individual. Usually we analyse them as
              separate entities. However in reality they are interdependent and inalienable
              parts of each other.In the west spiritualism is defined as a philosophical
              doctrine which perceives all reality as spiritual and not material. On the
              other hand science is knowledge gained by the study of the physical and natural
              world. The scientific method we use today in modern science is based on
              building up a hypothesis using data obtained through observations and arriving
              at a conclusion through experiments.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science is defined as systematic observation of natural
              events and conditions in order to discover facts about them and to formulate
              laws and principles based on these facts. Modern science relies on inductive
              reasoning from multiple observations of nature; thus working up from basic
              observation or experiment to generalization. However, the entire body of
              knowledge generated by scientists is not true. Thus, most scientists test
              theories knowing that future evidence may cause refinement, revision or even
              rejection of today’s theories that are held as true. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Experimentation in science is indispensable for it helps
              establish causal relationships. It is said that the ultimate purpose of science
              is to make sense of human beings and our nature. Science has discovered that
              all matter including human beings consist of particles. Further, it has been
              found that matter could be converted to energy and vice versa. Thus we are
              nothing but aggregates of energy. More than 2600 years ago the Buddha said that
              the “atom” is not the ultimate particle of matter; but that ultimate of matter
              exists in the form of energies. Modern science discovered the same about a
              three quarter of century ago. Likewise, there are many aspects of the teachings
              of the Buddha which we are unable to comprehend.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science has not found an answer to the question why are we
              here? What is the meaning of life? May be before long science will find out the
              origin of life and the universe. However, science may not be able to solve the
              problem of human suffering. Also, science has not found a solution to the
              malaise of insatiable greed and acquisitive craving. The whole world and it’s
              economy and all policies of governments are driven by human greed. The Buddha
              has shown us that the cause of suffering is greed. Apart from that ignorance of
              the true nature of the world keeps human beings in bondage. The Buddha has said
              that bondage could be severed by getting rid of ignorance. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The development of modern science paved the way for a deep
              spiritual crisis in the West which resulted in an irrevocable split between the
              established the monotheistic religious faith and scientific reason. Buddhism
              being an atheistic philosophy has the ability to bridge the worlds of matter
              and spirit estranged due to certain findings of modern science. Buddhists do
              understand that objects and individuals are comprised of an ever changing
              composite of elements of reality called “dharmas”. Even though Darwinism met
              with great resistance in the West; Buddhists ingrained in the transient nature
              of things found no difficulty in accepting that humans evolved from lesser
              forms of life. Thus, Buddhism has the potential to satisfy post Darwinian needs
              of religious beliefs grounded in new scientific findings.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Similarities between
              science and Buddhism</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are many similarities between Science and Buddhism.
              Both agree that there is no creator. Buddhism rejects accepting things merely
              on a teacher’s authority. Buddhism emphasizes personal verification. One of the
              cardinal doctrines of Buddhism is that of dependent or conditioned
              co-production (patitya samutpada) according to which no being or event arises
              without a conditioning factor. One of the principles on which science operates
              is universal causation, which means that all material things are caused.
              According to Buddhism the cosmos consists of thousands of spherical worlds
              (chakkavatas). In each world system there are thousands of suns, moons, earths
              etc. This bears a close resemblance to the modern scientific understanding of
              the universe with its galaxies. Science states that matter and energy can
              neither be created nor destroyed but only transformed. Buddhism says the same
              thing and extends this principle to the mind. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Buddhism mind means awareness of phenomena either
              conscious or unconscious and awareness of phenomena can neither be created nor
              destroyed but only be transformed. Thus, reincarnation is simply a
              transformation in the ongoing continuity of an individual’s awareness of
              phenomena, but now with the physical basis of another body. There are two types
              of wisdom in Buddhism namely conventional wisdom and ultimate wisdom.
              Conventional wisdom relates to the understanding of the conventional world and
              how it functions including science. Ultimate wisdom refers to a direct
              realization which is non dualistic and contradicts the way in which we
              ordinarily perceive the world. There are two methods available to the human
              being to acquire knowledge. They are left brain centred intuition method and
              the left brain centred scientific method. The Buddha had used the intuition
              method while modern science uses the scientific method.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is more consistent with the scientific method than
              traditional faith based religion. Accordingly the Kalama Sutta insists on a
              proper assessment of evidence, rather than a reliance on faith, hearsay or
              speculation. The general tenor of the Sutta is take no one’s word for it. The
              following is a gist of the Kalama Sutta. “ If you have a doubt do not be led by
              reports, or tradition or hearsay. Do not be led by authority of religious
              texts, not by mere logic or inference, nor by considering appearances nor by
              delight in speculative opinions, nor by seeming possibilities, nor by the idea
              this is our teacher. But when you know that certain things are unwholesome
              (Akusala) and wrong and bad then give them up. When you know that certain
              things are wholesome (Kusala) and good then accept them and follow them”.
                Up to about the 1960’s even though the super normal non materialistic
              knowledge flourished with one’s spiritual development described in Buddhism as
              “Panca Abihinna”; those attainments did not receive scientific acceptance.
              However today with the advancement of Metaphysics and Parapsychology the five
              Abhinna’s are now being accepted under the same classification given in
              Buddhism but with new names namely (1) Iddhivida nana or magical powers now
              called psycho kinesis (11) Dibba Sota Nana or divine ear now called
              clairaudience (111) Ceto Pariya Nana or penetration of mind now called
              telepathy (1V) Dibba Chakkhu Nana or divine eye now called clairvoyance and (V)
              Pubba Nivasanussati nana or remembering of former existences now called post
              cognition. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the 1970’s several experimental studies suggested that
              Buddhist meditation could produce insights into a wide range of psychological
              states. Interest in the use of meditation as a means of providing insight into
              mind states has recently been revived, following the availability of brain
              scanning technologies etc. It is worthy of note that in recent times Buddhist
              concepts have made most inroads into the psychological sciences. Some modern
              scientific theories such as Rogerian psychology show strong parallels with
              Buddhist thought. Some of the most interesting work on the relationship between
              Buddhism and science is being done in the area of comparison between Yogacara
              theories regarding the store consciousness and modern evolutionary biology
              especially DNA. It has been scientifically established that there is a
              co-relationship between Buddhist meditation and improved quality of life. It
              has been substantially proved that meditation thickens the brain tissues thus
              increasing attention and sensory processing . Also, it has been found that
              Pirith chanting not only has a sobering influence on the listener but also a
              beneficial impact on the heart function.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism and science
              can coexist harmoniously</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science works on the basis that nature fixes laws. But on the
              other hand Buddhism strives to solve the problem of human suffering which
              arises from both internal or mental and external or physical conditions, with
              an emphasis on human behaviour. At the same time Buddhism sees this as a
              natural process. Thus Buddhism has faith in nature as well as human beings.
              Science ignores human values; hence it has an incomplete or faulty view of
              nature. Science’s search for knowledge is both inadequate and incomplete
              because it ignores the internal nature of man. Science pays little attention to
              the development of the human being, whereas Buddhism pins great faith in the
              human potential and its full exploitation. Buddhist teachings rely on the
              ability of human potential to develop wisdom and realize the truth of the laws
              of nature. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Buddhism, real insight or right view has the capacity to
              liberate and bring about peace and happiness. The findings of science are also
              typical insight; for they can be applied in technology as well as in our daily
              behaviour to improve the quality of life and happiness. Thus, Buddhists and
              scientists can share with each other the ways of studying and practice and can
              profit from each one’s insights and experiences. The practice of mindfulness
              and concentration always brings insight. It can help both Buddhists and
              Scientists. Thus Buddhism and science can go hand in hand to promote more
              insight and bring greater liberation leading to a reduction of discrimination,
              separation, fear, anger and despair in the world.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The trend to link Buddhism and science has continued unabated
              so much so that today Buddhism and science are considered to be rivers leading
              to the same sea. Hence, the dire need for greater dialogue between Buddhist
              scholars and scientists to realize the importance of Buddhist wisdom to advance
              scientific wisdom.   </span></p>
