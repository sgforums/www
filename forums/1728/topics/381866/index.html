              <h1>Take Charge of Your Practice</h1>
              <p>Years ago, <strong>Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche</strong> realized that if he 
              didn’t take charge of his schedule, it would take charge of him. His 
              advice? Organize your schedule, let go of distractions, and make a clear
               aspiration to practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nowadays, even older people in their seventies feel they have a lot 
              of time to fool around. I don’t know where this comes from. Maybe it’s 
              because in modern cultures people stay healthier, active, and mobile 
              longer due to a better diet, more vitamins, and the latest medicines. 
              Elderly people also have more things to distract themselves with: 
              packaged holiday cruises, workshops, and different kinds of physical 
              activities. You hear people say, “The forties are the new thirties, and 
              the fifties are the new forties…” People put a lot of effort into 
              staying and looking young. This kind of thinking changes our concept of 
              aging and how we relate to growing old.</p>
              <p>When I first came to the West, most of my students were quite young, 
              except for a dedicated group of women who were forty and older. They 
              started a dharma study group, which they affectionately called the old 
              ladies’ group. I asked one of my older students in her seventies if she 
              attended the old ladies’ group, and she got offended. People are a 
              little eternalistic in this way.</p>
              <p>In more traditional cultures, seventy is considered old, and people 
              have no problem saying so. These cultures recognize old age as a time to
               prepare for death. People who in their youth engaged in naughty, 
              unwholesome behavior often start to soften and go in the direction of 
              practice as they get older. Instead of being diligently naughty, they 
              diligently dedicate their remaining years to saying mantras and doing 
              prostrations and prayers. I see this happen all the time, even in 
              myself.</p>
              <p>In Tibet, as people age their children will say, “Mom, you’re getting
               old, go do some mantras and circumambulations!” This has a dual 
              function: the children know this will get their parents out of their 
              hair, but it is also a cultural push—a push to prepare for death. People
               expect this; it helps them get ready.</p>
              <p>It’s good to look at life pragmatically, rather than as how we might 
              want it to be. Taking care of our bodies is intelligent enough; we 
              certainly don’t want to get old and infirm prematurely. We don’t want to
               lose our sense of curiosity and interest in life, our spark. But the 
              focus on prolonging life rather than accepting death is futile. Youth 
              goes by in a flash, and then we enter adulthood and old age. That’s 
              about it. Patrul Rinpoche suggests we look at our life cycle as the 
              length of a day: infancy at dawn, childhood and adolescence in the 
              morning hours, adulthood at noon, and old age with the setting of the 
              sun. If you want to prepare the mind for death, putting time into 
              perspective is a realistic thing to do.</p>
              <h2>Organizing Your Time</h2>
              <p>I’m not a planner by nature, but some years back I realized that if I
               didn’t take charge of my schedule, it would take charge of me. So now I
               fill my schedule with as much dharma practice and activity as I can. I 
              fill the pages of my calendar—one year in advance—with my mind’s 
              intention, then I follow and meet it. I know how many hours of practice I
               want to do each day, and I organize my time to complete that. I figure,
               this is my life, and if I don’t take charge no one else will. I find 
              myself thinking a lot about time, how much I have, and what I want to do
               with it.</p>
              <p>Practically speaking, there are only twenty-four hours in a day. How 
              do we want to spend them? Some of that time we need to sleep. But how 
              much sleep do we actually need? More than seven or eight hours usually 
              doesn’t support us, unless of course we are a teenager. Most of us have 
              jobs. We may work nine hours a day—that seems standard. This still 
              leaves us with seven or eight hours of spare time. Then there are family
               obligations, and we need to tend to those with care. With our remaining
               hours, how can we fit practice time into our lives?</p>
              <p>I am a night person, so I practice late at night. Some people prefer 
              to start before dawn. These are quiet hours—guaranteed practice 
              periods—because everyone else is asleep, or maybe practicing too. 
              Sometimes at night I get sleepy, but when I stay with it for a bit, I 
              find a whole new reserve of energy that sustains me throughout my 
              session. Anything that brings our actions together with our intentions 
              energizes us and brings deep meaning to our lives. I used to have 
              trouble sleeping, but now that I have a regular practice schedule, I 
              have a restful unbroken sleep.</p>
              <h2>Making a Clear Decision</h2>
              <p>If we have an aspiration to practice, we should make a clear decision
               to do so. It won’t help to have a “split mind.” In Tibetan there is a 
              term: <em>yi nyi te tsom</em>. <em>Yi nyi</em> means that we have two minds,
               or in other words, conflicting interests. <em>Te tsom</em> means that we 
              have doubts concerning which way we want to go. We may want to practice,
               yet somehow we fail to bring our aspirations together with our actions.</p>
              <p>I see a lot of people wanting to practice yet not finding the time. 
              It affects their self-esteem. We need to ask ourselves what prevents us 
              from meeting our aspirations in life. Are we using our life well, or are
               we simply working to maintain it? How are we using our time? Are we 
              considering what’s at stake? Are we tending to our desire for a 
              meaningful life, or are we simply avoiding it? If so, why?</p>
              <p>How we spend our time depends on how we organize our time, and how we
               organize our time depends on how we envision our lives. Once we have 
              sorted out these questions and have made a clear decision to make room 
              in our lives for practice, we have to exert ourselves rather than let 
              the mind become too loose and unorganized, and just wait for something 
              to happen.</p>
              <h2>Beware of Distraction</h2>
              <p>Distractions come in all sorts of disguises. Sometimes we feel we 
              need to manage everyone else’s problems. If we have this tendency, there
               will always be someone who wants to pull us in, in some way. They want 
              to <em>consult</em>, but they don’t necessarily want to hear what we have 
              to say. They just want to vent. They feel stressed, and then we get 
              stressed and no one profits in the end. Or, if in our work we are too 
              meticulous and fixate on perfecting everything, we may never get 
              anything done and run out of time for practice. We may also feel that we
               are the only ones who know how to do <em>anything</em>, so we end up 
              doing <em>everything. </em>Some people can never say no. These kinds of 
              distractions don’t even include the constant need for entertainment and 
              fun, and all the foreign, high-maintenance elements we invite into our 
              lives, such as puppies, personal-entertainment systems, and fancy 
              computers.</p>
              <p>Even in retreat, people can find all kinds of ways to occupy 
              themselves and avoid practice, like spending hours each day pondering 
              over their shopping lists. In India they say, “All you need are two <em>chapattis</em> a day.” I don’t think this means we need to subsist on two pieces of 
              Indian bread a day, become a <em>sadhu</em> [an ascetic who renounces his 
              body and all worldly things], or rough it. I think this is a metaphor 
              for doing without. How much do we actually need? How often do we get 
              distracted by what we want and figuring out how we can get it? Can we 
              free ourselves from this kind of distraction through simply doing 
              without? Whatever our tendency, it won’t do much good to blame anyone 
              else for our distractions. Kunchyen Longchenpa said, “Distractions are 
              limitless; only when you quit them will they leave.”</p>
              <h2>A Relaxed and Open Mind</h2>
              <p>If we don’t have a focus, we meander around like a restless tiger, 
              not finding any pleasure in anything. We find ourselves laying on the 
              bed, then turning on the TV and flipping through the channels, eating 
              when we’re not hungry, then picking up the phone. What are we trying to 
              do? We are trying to connect with the phenomenal world. But how can we 
              when we are not connected inwardly?</p>
              <p>The times we don’t feel connected inwardly are the best times to 
              practice. When our minds are restless, this might sound about as 
              appealing as dental work. We are tormented and distracted by our 
              thoughts, emotions, and fears. We come up with all kinds of physical 
              sensations too. We have a pain in our neck, then it moves to our back, 
              then our foot. All of a sudden we hear a ringing in our ears, or our 
              eyes start to itch. It’s a little suspicious, don’t you think?</p>
              <p>We need to give ourselves time to allow the nervous and restless 
              energy to settle in our bodies. When the body rests, the mind rests. 
              When the mind rests, the emotions rest, and we feel a profound sense of 
              contentment and relaxation, or <em>shenjong</em>. When the mind relaxes in
               a state of shenjong, it is available to us, to serve us or at least 
              help us understand what’s up. The space of shenjong means less 
              vulnerability, so our thoughts and emotions cannot simply shove us 
              around and rough us up as they usually do. All our fatigue falls away. 
              The heart clears. The body lightens and feels as weightless as feather.</p>
              <h2>It Takes Might and Clarity</h2>
              <p>We need a little strength to resist the habit of grasping at 
              distractions, even if we are halfway in. We don’t want to be like a 
              freshwater salmon that swims all the way upstream, and just when it is 
              halfway into a bear’s mouth, rather than trying to wiggle out, thinks, 
              “Oh well, I’m halfway in anyway.” Wiggling out of distraction takes some
               might and clarity.</p>
              <p>I’ve heard people say, “I’m too lazy and love
               my ego too much to dedicate my time to practice.” That kind of laziness
               and lack of intention will never support realization. The Buddha said 
              that if flies, grubs, and bacteria had a capacity to aspire for 
              enlightenment, they would attain it. That would be embarrassing, 
              wouldn’t it? A grub attaining enlightenment before we did. In the sutra 
              it says, “All things are circumstantial.” The circumstances we need are 
              created by the might and clarity of our intention and how we carry it 
              out in our lives.</p>
              <p>It’s not as if we have no diligence. The alarm 
              rings, it’s 4 a.m. The temperature has dropped into the single digits. 
              We don’t want to get out of bed, but it’s Monday and there will be 
              consequences. We get up. We scrape the snow off the windshield, heat up 
              the car, and head to work for nine hours, maybe more. To do this every 
              morning takes a little vision, a little might and clarity. Surely if we 
              can do this, we can find a little time to practice.</p>
              <h2>A Modern-Day Mango Grove</h2>
              <p>If we can put time into perspective, organize our schedules, wiggle 
              out of distraction with might and clarity, and think about what makes 
              life meaningful, we will surely find time to practice, to relax the 
              mind. Ordinarily, relaxing means taking our minds off our daily routine,
               laying on the couch, and watching a movie or going to sleep. Usually 
              relaxing means distracting ourselves from the stresses of daily life. 
              But we have spent half our lives sleeping without ever feeling rested. 
              This is because we haven’t focused on relaxing the mind itself.</p>
              <p>What could be more relaxing than letting go of preferences and 
              worries? What better way is there to reduce our self-clinging than by 
              contemplating bodhichitta? What can liberate our hopes and fears other 
              than letting them arise and disassemble themselves naturally in the 
              space of an open mind? Meditation leaves plenty of room for everything: 
              all of our hopes, fears, and anxieties as well as our joys and 
              aspirations. There is no need to control our thoughts, because when we 
              practice we have committed ourselves to letting them be—not judging them
               as good or bad, spiritual or not spiritual, helpful or harmful. Is 
              there any other activity that can accommodate the mind and its various 
              arisings in this way?</p>
              <p>The only thing we need to practice is a quiet place to sit: a room, a
               park bench, or our own bed. The sutras describe a peaceful mango grove 
              as an ideal place to practice. The Buddha and his disciples practiced 
              meditation in such a place. If you think about it, in the midst of our 
              busy lives, any quiet place to sit can be our modern-day mango grove.</p>
