              ‘Buddhist’ Globalisation’ India Isn’t Making the Most of Its Legacy</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Y P. STOBDAN May 15, 2017
              Kashmir Monitor</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Simply
              playing the ‘Dalai Lama card’, as many are prone to do, will not only restrict
              India’s ability to manoeuvre in the outside world, but also risks undermining
              its own Buddhist legacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India’s
              worst fears are becoming a reality as China rapidly develops a plan for a
              ‘Buddhist globalisation’ with its financial, political and marketing clout.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Unsurprisingly,
              President Xi Jinping is not just asserting territorial claims in the South
              China Sea and expanding China’s connectivity project through the One Belt, One
              Road (OBOR) initiative, he is also working to make China the world leader in
              Buddhism. Xi has had this idea for some time now – he started building a
              partnership between China’s communist party and the religion when he was only
              29 years old, serving as a bureaucrat in provinces. The story began when he
              encountered Shi Youming, a Buddhist monk who was restoring ruined temples of
              Zhengding County in Hebei Province.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Xi
              was probably also influenced by his father, Xi Zhongxun, who in 1980 had warned
              the party in his 11,000-word report ‘Document 19’ against banning religious
              activity, suggesting that this would alienate too many people. In fact, one of
              Xi’s father’s signature lines is said to have been, “If the people have faith,
              the nation has hope and the country has strength.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Chinese president has a strange history when it comes to religious freedom – he
              helped rebuild several famous temples, but ordered that 1, 500 crosses be
              pulled off the steeples of churches while he was chief of Zhejiang province
              between 2002 and 2007. It seems like Xi is biased against religions deemed
              ‘foreign’, like Christianity and Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Using
              faith to legitimise political rule is not new. Many see Xi’s policy akin to
              Vladimir Putin’s spiritual feat of adopting orthodox Christianity, which is
              seen as giving him the moral legitimacy to be leader of the Slavic world. This
              is despite Article 14 of Russia’s constitution declaring the country “a secular
              state”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nobody
              knows whether Xi is a practitioner himself, but he has firmly been putting
              Chinese Buddhism on the global stage since 2005. At the domestic level, it
              looks as though Xi is turning to religion not just to bolster his rule, but
              also to save the party from falling. He certainly sees Buddhism as useful for
              arresting the flagging moral values in China’s social fabric, and to prevent
              the angry middle class from crumbling under the weight of a deepening social
              crisis and economic downturn. Having felt the pains of an ageing society, the
              country had to abandon the Mao’s one-child policy. More importantly, Xi intends
              to imbibe moral ethics among party officials – deemed necessary to bring about
              further economic reforms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Under
              Xi, Buddhism is already making a strong comeback. The spectre of economic
              progress and affluence seems to be steering people’s quest for spirituality.
              Millions of Chinese seeking their yin guo (karmic) connections with Buddha
              Amitabha is becoming the new trend. The yin guo seems to have found strong
              secular resonance; from students to businessmen, ordinary Chinese are beginning
              to link their existential happiness to the inter-dependent nature of karmic
              cycles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to a Chinese Master Jingzong, China’s intent to realise its economic and
              political destiny would pale compared to the urge amongst millions to
              accomplish their spiritual fortunes. He cannot visualise the future of China
              without Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              looks as though China is reimagining the nation along the lines of the imperial
              Chinese state. With humanist Buddhist values diffusing into society, China is
              likely to see in the future what we witness in Thailand and other countries
              today. To be sure, this is having consequences for rest of Asia, where 97% of
              world’s Buddhist population live and where Buddhism is their core values.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              fear is that China will translate its economic weight into spiritual might.
              Chinese organisations are already on a Buddhist globalisation spree – building
              spiritual links with the people of other nations and regularly hosting the
              World Buddhist Forum, which that draws thousands of monks and scholars from
              across the world, and planning to build Lingshan City as the Vatican for
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China
              controls the World Buddhist Sangha Council founded in Sri Lanka in 1966. In
              2014, it hosted the World Fellowship of Buddhists meet. Across Theravada and
              Mahayana countries, the Chinese are helping repair, renovate and resurrect
              Buddhist institutions. Beijing lobbies for countries to hold major
              international events such as the UN Vesak Day – to be held in Sri Lanka this
              year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Taking
              a cue from the imperial-era practice, China could be even using the powerful
              Tibetan cultural connectivity for expanding its influence across the Indian
              Himalayan belt, Mongolia and Russia. Chinese media recently revealed that
              China’s communist party officials have been funding the Dalai Lama and his
              activities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Becoming
              a guardian of Buddhism is helping Xi successfully promote China as an
              acceptable world power with a soft image. Buddhist globalisation helps Beijing
              push its economic projects – religious diplomacy makes it easier for China to
              win economic and infrastructural projects in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal and
              elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China’s
              latest initiative, the OBOR, is also nothing but the ‘political geography of
              Buddhism’. Nepal is proposing to link the OBOR with Buddha’s birthplace,
              Lumbini. Pakistan is reviving the ‘Gandhara trail’ to link the Lahore, Taxila
              and Peshawar networks. Taxila relics are being sent to Sri Lanka for a public
              exposition during the Vesak month. If Sri Lankan monks visit Taxila to
              celebrate purnima, top Bhutanese monks visit the Saidu Sharif monastery in Swat
              Valley (the birthplace of Guru Padmasambava).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Surely,
              China edging in on its cultural space worries India. Prime Minister Narendra
              Modi was quick to gauge the importance of Buddhism after coming to power, and
              even put it at the centre of his diplomacy initiatives with key Asian
              countries. But two years down the line, his brilliant idea has seemingly been
              hijacked by those who are seeking to use Buddhism as a tool to counter China.
              Worse still, they likened Buddhism with Lamaism – perhaps due to a deficit in
              understanding – thus reducing the idea to playing the so-called ‘Tibet card’,
              ostensibly to offset China’s influence. The approach is doomed to end in
              failure, because Lamaism is a tool traditionally used only by rulers in the
              Chinese imperial court.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              ‘Lama card’ could not only restrict India’s ability to manoeuvre in the outside
              world, but also risks undermining its own Buddhist legacy, which rests on the
              eords Buddha, dharma and sangha, also known as tri-ranta (three jewels) that
              once spread to set the moral foundations of various Asian societies. In fact,
              these values still intersect with the social, political and economic contexts
              of many nations, as they spur the Asian quest for modernity, spirituality,
              democratic values and economic prosperity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              India wants to use its Buddhist’s legacy, it is ironic that India no longer has
              the fuel to spinning its own dharma wheel, let alone replenishing that of
              others. Here, it miserably lacks credible institutions; not a single Indian is
              rated amongst the world’s top Buddhist masters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Seeking
              rivalry with China over Buddhism seems unnecessary. Instead, the efforts should
              be to reach out to the swelling number of dharma followers in China, as Modi
              did by reaching out to people using the Weibo microblogging site on Buddha
              Jayanti in 2015. We should be rejoicing at the cultural transformation in China
              and the positive impact this may have on India’s future ties with the country
              and with Asia at large.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Most
              immediately, India needs to take immediate steps to restore millennia-old
              tourist Buddhist heritage sites lying in ruins. They are directly linked to
              spiritual destinies of millions. By improving infrastructure and connectivity,
              India could tap into potential Asian pilgrims. This could provide lucrative
              employment to millions of our youth.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              idea of seeking counter-offensive measures to play the ‘Buddhist game’
              vis-à-vis China seems misplaced. For India to seriously reaffirm its central
              role, it needs to embrace its own tradition of Buddha, dharma, sangha. It would
              be even worthwhile to envisage a pan-Indian Buddhist sangha with government
              patronage, if New Delhi is serious about anchoring global Buddhist affairs.</span></p>
