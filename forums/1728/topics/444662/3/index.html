              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Some good posts by Namdrol:</p>
              <p>Causes and effects are not the same, nor are they different.</p>
              <p>The mind that takes rebirth is not as same as the previous mind nor is it different.</p>
              <p>This is the reason why it is possible for sentients beings to experience serial rebirth through the appropriation of an infinite series of new physical bodies over time, relatively speaking.</p>
              <p>By saying that there is no actual rebirth, one is committing oneself to a metaphysical position called ucchedavada i.e. annihilationism. Commiting oneself to the position that there is an actual self, person, or entity that is reborn is called Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da, eternalism.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But when one understands that one instant of mind is neither the same nor different than the next instant of mind; since they are not the same, one avoids Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da; and since they are not different, one avoids ucchedavada — thus one can understand the truth of rebirth, karma and its result, and dependent origination in the manner in which the Buddha intended and leave off the metaphysical speculations that plague non-Buddhists about such issues. One can then also understand that since the mind has no beginning, it never arose; and since it never arose, it never ceases.</span></p>

              <p>The meaning of the heart sutra is very simple—it is about the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. That is simple, but it is also profound.</p>

              Muse over this
              
              What is permanent is truth (not dictionary meaning but existential truth). One is only experiencing relative truth and it will remain so as long as one is IDENTIFIED with oneâ€™s mind and body. It has been erroneously assumed to be the absolute truth, there is no truth, only truth that is relative to what is perceived,. why so? When one walks on the road, and falls down on the pavement, only then is the pavement a reality to him/her. Before that. it did not exist. It was always there but only became a reality when it was perceived by the one who fell down. The pavement does not call out to say I exist. The one who fell down thru his/her perception gave it existence. Eg, stock market crashes, it has only relevance for someone in the banking or .. Would it have relevance for a village peasant? Will the mountain goats be affected by the stock market crash? As such, â€˜realityâ€™ remains a mere psychological experience for many, it is only existential when it really happens to that person in a given situation and is always relative to oneâ€™s conditioning and so on so forth. One has to reconcile or at least understand that one could be confused or simply not know.
              
              Also, many assume that they exist in the mind or the body. The mind and the body exist in the source.
               The source cannot be found outside of onself. It is an inward journey and as long as there is no longing in oneâ€™s heart (love) to merge with the source (eg God, jesus, Mohd, Buddha heart soul soul, enligthenment, awakening) one has settled for mediocrity. The mind cannot use logic to get inside â€“ cos the mind is a limitation, it does not exist. it is a bundle of thoughts. can one find oneâ€™s mind?
              
              To know God, to know Jesus to know Krishna â€“ one has to â€˜dieâ€™ â€“ by that is meant die to the roles and be empty of â€¦. By that â€˜dyingâ€™ to roles, it is not meant that someone has to reject roles; accept and fulfil the roles but dont bring it home. By home is meant source (aka God, Jesus, Mohd, Buddha heart, soul, enligthenment, awakening) and one is always being a clean slate (emptiness). It is always being open to possibilities. However, the human mind cannot accept uncertainty and hence it is content with certainty and thus unwilling to risk enquiring and being resistant to  this willingness is akin to riding a stationary bicycle.  
              
              PS -  With any practice one's mind is involved. For eg when i say ''I meditate or practice ..'' As long as this questioning(#) does not arise and that is: for what and for whom , the mind is at play and the meditation that is practised is to most likely reach/attain a goal. Any goal, any craving, any desire does not emanate from one's being (presence or present) but from dipping into the past aka knwoledge, books, someone, sutras, texts and .... it cannot be from the present or presence of the moment. If one maintains this stance of practising without the (#) one is alreadly futurizing and one may reach/attain to that desired goal or ... cos it is now herenow; the practice is to get something that is not already here.
              
                However, when the (# )  is there, the mind is challenged to find out who is actually meditatiing? When one introspects one would realise that sth is absent and one is striving to attain what is absent - stemming from this one denies the presence of what is already present. Antything that is gained ffrom such a practice is temporal, it wont stay, cos its nature is not of eternity!
              However, the questioning of who is the meditator and what is the purpose of meditation may elicit answers, which is only possible on introspection.
