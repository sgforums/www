              @fugazzi: buddhism is not a theology but we cannot do away with right view. Having realized or having had glimpses of non-conceptual Presence is not enough to remove all our false view of reality causing subtle grasping, clinging and confusion. So one should not overly focus on experience and overlook the importance of right view. View, realization and experience are equally important if you read my other thread. Read my reply to sinweiy below and you'll understand.
              
              @sinweiy: there is no changing self. To say there is a changing self, you are implying reality is a substance that transforms itself as the myriad things that changes. 
              
              This is also non-Buddhist substantialist view, and is Thusness Stage 4 substantialist non-dualism. 
              
              In other words, one sees that there is an inherently existing One Mind that transforms itself as the myriad things.
              
              This is the view of Kashmir Shaivism (Shiva or pure nondual consciousness has both an unchanging and dynamic aspect, and since the world is not other than consciousness, the world is real as Shiva) and also the three steps of Advaita Vedanta - the world is illusory, Brahman alone is real, Brahman is the World.
              
              The insight of anatta in Buddhism however is very different. This insight is elucidated by Zen Master Dogen, firewood abides in the phenomenal expression of firewood, firewood does not turn/transform into ashes. 
              
              In other words, since all phenomena lack a substantial self, there is no One Mind transforming itself into the myriad things. It is not that the scent, the sight, the sound are all the expressions of One Consciousness (substantial non-dualism). Rathere, in seeing it is just sight, in hearing just sound, in smelling just the experience of scent, there is no agent or substratum that links or produces those phenomenon.
              
              Effectively, the view of inherency with regards to consciousness is seen through by realization. Through the insight of anatta, one realizes that 1) the view that a seer is seeing the seen ceases through realization that in seeing always just the seen, no seer, so the view of an agent, perceiver, controller permanently ceases, 2) the view that a self, one mind, ground that links, underlies, gives rise or transforms into the myriad things permanently ceases.
              
              So now you see why you cannot say there is a "changing self" since to say a self changes is to imply a substance or reality that transforms or changes, no different from the more advanced phase of Hindu schools. 
              
              To say that there is a self that is "neither unchanging nor changes" is equally erroneous, since it implies there is a substance that can sometimes change and sometimes not change, or that there is a substance that transforms (changes) yet remains unchanged, which is basically same as the view elucidated above. Such a substantialist view is false and seen through with the insight of anatta.
              
              In the substantialist non-dual phase, it is distinct from the I AM phase. In the I AM phase, one discovers oneself as all-pervading pure presence-existence-consciousness. One sees that as one's true self and everybody's true self. But since it only pertains to non-dual luminosity in the pure non-conceptual thought realm, one is unable to see non-dual luminosity in all realms, sensations, manifestation and perception. In other words, it is just luminosity experienced as one of the dhatus among the eighteen dhatus or six sense consciousnesses - pertaining to the mind level.
              
              Because of such realization and experience plus there is view of subject-object duality and the view of an inherent self, the Pure Presence is understood both dualistically and inherently.
              
              Therefore, one sees oneself as the pure Eternal Witness or Watcher behind thoughts and sense perceptions - thoughts come and go, only the true self or Witness remains unchanged.
              
              Then when one progresses to the substantial non-dual phase, one breaks the illusion of subject-object duality such that everything is no longer experienced as apart from oneself. Rather, there is just one seamless undivided field of consciousness expressing/transforming itself into the myriad phenomena, without observer-observed, subject-object split. Effectively the view of duality is gone but the view of inherency remains since one still sees an inherent Self or Mind transforming itself as the many. This is the phase of One Mind or Everything is Mind. This is the peak of the Hindu traditions - Brahman is the World. Even though non-dual luminosity is experienced as everything and it is blissful, it still causes great attachment because one does not understand the empty nature of awareness, so there is a referencing back to a source.
              
              In anatta, there is just breathe, scent, sight, not even "One Naked Awareness", not even a mirror-awareness that is inseparable from its reflections. Just the reflections alone IS, there is no substance serving as the substance, substratum, or reflector of all phenomena. Phenomena alone is the mirror. 
              
              At this point one no longer subsumes the six streams of consciousness into One Mind but sees No Mind - just the six streams of consciousness that affirms itself, since one realizes there is no inherent self. However there is a difference between the experience of No Mind and the realization of Anatta even though they are linked - more is elaborated in my other article on view, realization, experience, etc...
              
              There is no unchanging self, no changing self, no neither unchanging nor changing self, no both unchanging and changing self. No self can be pinned down inside or apart from the five aggregates as a truth, reality, or substance. 
              
              Btw mindstream is good - there is no "mind" apart from stream, just the stream alone is... The continuity happens as a causal process, not the continuity of any form of self-entity.

              @sinweiy: we cannot say that just chanting/nian fo means having right view or just because you chant means you are in no danger of falling into wrong views.
              
              This is because view is not dependent on your practice. View means a position, or a belief pertaining to self or reality. For example you can meditate and chant but still believe in an unchanging or eternal self, have a self-view, so you will not attain Buddhist awakening in this way. Or some people like Lee Kuan Yew also chant Catholic mantra, but he believes that the self annihilates after death - nihilist view.
              
              The externalists like Hindus also practice mantra, however they hold strongly to the view of eternalism. The Hindus are eternalists.
              
              Therefore, nian fo does not mean having right view. If you learn and understand dharma teachings, that is right view. But having an inferred right view does not mean enlightenment yet. Having a direct realization of the twofold emptiness is enlightenment, in which right view and others of the noble eightfold path are a requisite.

              <p>ok, maybe self is not a good word. i'm more thinking of units of mind/thoughts like animated films mechanism, one thought after another, dependent arising. it's so very close that not even Maitreya bodhisattva can discern the gap between the two mind/thoughts as stated in Avatamsaka sutra. like the mind1, mind2, mind3.... neither of them is real. as when u cling to mind1, it already become mind2. hence there's no permanent mind, yet does not reject the mind, hence not Nihilism. i think Hindu one think it's real as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whole</span>. hence think that there's permanent Self, Eternalist. they don't have dependent arising view.</p>
              <p>this emptiness concept go with reality. there's no real reality. but does not reject reality, which is å¦™æœ‰ dependent arising. or one can see it as atoms. yet atom is energy, no real substance.</p>
              <p>dependent arising also does not mean there's a beginning. there's no beginning.</p>

              <p>@sinweiy: we cannot say that just chanting/nian fo means having right view or just because you chant means you are in no danger of falling into wrong views.</p>
              <p>This is because view is not dependent on your practice. View means a position, or a belief pertaining to self or reality. For example you can meditate and chant but still believe in an unchanging or eternal self, have a self-view, so you will not attain Buddhist awakening in this way. Or some people like Lee Kuan Yew also chant Catholic mantra, but he believes that the self annihilates after death – nihilist view.</p>
              <p>The externalists like Hindus also practice mantra, however they hold strongly to the view of eternalism. The Hindus are eternalists.</p>
              <p>Therefore, nian fo does not mean having right view. If you learn and understand dharma teachings, that is right view. But having an inferred right view does not mean enlightenment yet. Having a direct realization of the twofold emptiness is enlightenment, in which right view and others of the noble eightfold path are a requisite.</p>

              <p>i think if does it right, no believing of what so ever thoughts/view can penetrate the nianfo samadhi. all views should be dropped of.. moreover it'll also be inpart with the power of Amitabha's virtue.</p>

              <p>@2009novice: self-view is latent in everybody. generally most materialist has an annihilationistic view - no rebirth, no karma, self ends in death. or those who have religions (non buddhist or buddhist with wrong understanding) believe that an eternal soul survives life after life.</p>
              <p>then there are those of an agnostic type, doesnt mean they dont have self-view as they still view or cling to an existent self, however they have not made up their minds whether the self ceases or continues immortal after death.</p>
              <p>buddhism on the other hand rejects self view altogether.</p>
              <p>secular view is ignorance, ignorance here means not knowing the four noble truths. if you dont know four noble truths you will be trapped in secular pursuits and will not seek for nirvana.</p>

              @sinweiy: it does not imply an existing self that changes or transforms (substantialist view), but rather is talking about the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, or the inseparability of emptiness, luminosity and appearance. miao here means magical and miraculous. Since everything is appearing due to dependent origination, appearing yet empty, being like a magical illusion, it appears miraculous and amazing. This is the "miao" of you. Zhen kong (emptiness) and miao you (miraculous appearance) are inseparable.
              
              See my article http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/06/magic-of-luminous-emptiness.html
              
              The Magic of Luminous Emptiness
              Emptiness... emptiness....
              
              In normal, everyday life, when someone uses the word â€œemptinessâ€�, it usually has a negative connotion.
              
              Like a 'lack of something'... like as if life is lacking something (e.g. "life feels so empty nowadays"). If anything, things lack â€˜inherent, unchanging, independent existenceâ€™â€¦ yet they are wondrously, intensely vividly luminous and apparent!
              
              Unfortunately, the teaching of 'emptiness', along with other teachings of Buddha (including the most common misperception of Buddha's teaching as 'Life is Suffering' which is certainly NOT what he said!*) gives the misconception of Buddhism as having a life-denying, pessimistic view of the world.
              
              But this is NOT the Buddhist understanding of Emptiness!
              
              Form is emptiness, emptiness IS form!
              
              Emptiness IS Fullness!
              
              I can assure you when you realize emptiness, you will marvel, be amazed, at the whole universe as a magical apparition... it's like Whoa, the universe is magic, luminous and empty, clearly manifest yet no-thing 'there'! No place of origin, place of abidance, and destination - to thoughts, to sensate experiences... just a clear display of luminous apparitions. Shunyata is a wonder.
              
              This is a wonderful truth... This is nothing dreadful... and is nothing short of Great Bliss.
              
              The luminous and empty universe is spontaneously perfected, lacking nothing, amazing!
              
              
              *The Buddha taught that suffering is a part and parcel of life, or to put it more simply, 'there is suffering in life', and that there is a way to end suffering. He did NOT say "Life is Suffering" or "Life can only be suffering" even though sadly, this is what many teachers are promoting - their own distortion of Buddha's original words. For more info see this well-written article: Life Isn't Just Suffering by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
              
              
              
              (update) p.s. found something from a great article,
              
              http://www.ktgrinpoche.org/KTGR%20Buddhadharm%20Flashing%20Lances.pdf 
              
              "When you put the two truths together in this
              way, you get Milarepaâ€™s two lines:
              
              E ma, the phenomena of the three realms
              of samsara,
              While not existing, they appear â€“
              how incredibly amazing!
              
              The three realms of samsara are dreamlike
              â€“ while not existing they appear, while appearing
              they are empty of inherent nature, and so they
              are miraculous."

              <p>forgot to answer 2009novice's main question:</p>
              <p>having righr view does not mean you are liberated or awakened.</p>
              <p>if your right view remains conceptual and inferred, maybe through reasoning and faith, that is essential as a factor for awakening, but is not awakening yet</p>
              <p>if you are awakened by not just inferrential or conceptual understanding of anatta and emptiness but through a direct experiential realization of it, the least is you become a stream enterer</p>
              <p>a stream enterer eradicated self view but has not eradicated other defilements or afflictions like anger, craving, etc</p>
              <p>as you progress through the stages you will progressively eliminate the rest of the fetters or afflictions and attain complete liberation</p>

              @sinweiy: through chanting you can attain a state of thoughtlessness, but it does not mean you overcome self-view. Like you go to sleep, you also forget your beliefs, but when you come back from sleep you still hold the same beliefs.
              
              Only realization can eradicate self view, samadhi alone cannot do it. Samadhi merely suspends defilements but does not permanently remove it. But when you realize originally no self, æœ¬æ�¥æ²¡æœ‰æˆ‘ï¼Œthen you will forever remove self view, it is like waking up from a dream, you realize all along your view of self is false
              
              Before realization we should at least have an understanding of anatta and emptiness even though it is not yet experiential it can help in our path.

              <p>yes, eventually,</p>
              <p>Form is emptiness, emptiness IS form. Emptiness IS Fullness.</p>
              <p>think we should do an indepth on  dependent arising. something from Nagarjuna perhaps.</p>
              <p>there were two schools in history of Mahayana, one more toward emptiness and one more toward dependent arising. this two is more of conflicting, normally they don't want their students to see the other's teaching scaring they'll be confused. there are schools that combine the two though. nowaday, most masters is into combining.</p>

              <p><br>mostly in the records, they would have rid the self-view when they woke up on half the way of their practice. yea it's unlogical, but nian fo is that inconcievable. it's said even the 7th bhumni and below cannot discern the logic.  hence it's easier for Ah gong and Ah ma that are more simple minded, instead for those who think too much.</p>

              <p>If there is the right pointing, right understanding and right contemplation, then with nian fo as an aid one can achieve realization. But if you just chant alone, I don't see it is possible if one does not have right understanding to attain realization. As said before other religions also do chanting but they don't attain enlightenment. Chanting alone is a form of shamatha which leads to samadhi, but if devoid of right view and contemplation as in vipasyana aspect like kong1ï¼�guan1ï¼Œrealization wont arise as chanting remains as a purely shamatha technique.</p>
              <p> My point is, self-view can only be eradicated through realization. You pointed out about enlightenment in pure land which I do believe is valid, however that is more of other-power, relying on amitabha to attain rebirth and thereby awaken there.</p>

              <p>indeed. it is like the repetitiveness of sutra helps instill

              <p>since many years ago, thusness tell me to summarize what i have
              learnt often as it helps me instill right view, and said this is an
              important factor that contributed to my experience and insight</p>
              <p>by writing your own summary of right dharma understanding you
              are strengthening re inforcing right understanding</p>

              <p>yes, time spent alone is very helpful to me!  In fact i needed alot of time alone to reflect and practice to offload the years of low-grade anxieties and other habitual patterns that i had implanted into myself from the earlier part of my life.  I attribute my time alone and practices and readings done during that time to be one major factor that helped me to become ripe and interested enough to tackle the important questions of insight into reality...  the present pace of life in current society is extremely unconducive to spiritual progress in my opinion, even though we should try our best to remain mindful and to simplify our commitments and activities. </p>

              <p>forgot to answer 2009novice's main question:</p>
              <p>having righr view does not mean you are liberated or awakened.</p>
              <p>if your right view remains conceptual and inferred, maybe through reasoning and faith, that is essential as a factor for awakening, but is not awakening yet</p>
              <p>if you are awakened by not just inferrential or conceptual understanding of anatta and emptiness but through a direct experiential realization of it, the least is you become a stream enterer</p>
              <p>a stream enterer eradicated self view but has not eradicated other defilements or afflictions like anger, craving, etc</p>
              <p>as you progress through the stages you will progressively eliminate the rest of the fetters or afflictions and attain complete liberation</p>

              <p>thx... erm ok last not to appear draggy- if a person read a book about 4 noble truth but he/she also appreciates it (ä½“ä¼š) it... can it be considered as realization...?</p>
              <p>Eradicated self view sounds abit complicated yet... most books impart knowledge but to have eradicated self view is another thing...</p>

              The four noble truths consist of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering (nirvana) and the path that ends suffering (noble eightfold path).
              
              If you say realize, does that mean he realized nirvana and completed his noble eightfold path? I think highly unlikely.
              
              It is more likely that by inference and faith, he accepted the four noble truths. You need faith in the Buddha in other to practice 4nt, you need faith there is such a thing as nirvana otherwise why practice?
              
              If through contemplating 4nt he realized impermanence, no-self and dependent origination and become a stream entrant, that can be considered as realization. But even that cannot be considered as complete realization of the four noble truths. Only an arahant and Buddha can say that.

              Some good posts by Namdrol:
              
              Causes and effects are not the same, nor are they different. 
              
              The mind that takes rebirth is not as same as the previous mind nor is it different. 
              
              This is the reason why it is possible for sentients beings to experience serial rebirth through the appropriation of an infinite series of new physical bodies over time, relatively speaking. 
              
              By saying that there is no actual rebirth, one is committing oneself to a metaphysical position called ucchedavada i.e. annihilationism. Commiting oneself to the position that there is an actual self, person, or entity that is reborn is called Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da, eternalism. 
              
              But when one understands that one instant of mind is neither the same nor different than the next instant of mind; since they are not the same, one avoids Å›Ä�Å›vatavÄ�da; and since they are not different, one avoids ucchedavada â€” thus one can understand the truth of rebirth, karma and its result, and dependent origination in the manner in which the Buddha intended and leave off the metaphysical speculations that plague non-Buddhists about such issues. One can then also understand that since the mind has no beginning, it never arose; and since it never arose, it never ceases.

              The meaning of the heart sutra is very simple -- it is about the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. That is simple, but it is also profound.
