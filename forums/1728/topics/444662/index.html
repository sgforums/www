              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion Ven. <a id="sariputta" name="sariputta">Sariputta</a> was staying near <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a> at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika</a>'s monastery. Now, at that time this evil supposition had arisen to <a id="yamaka" name="yamaka">Ven. Yamaka</a>:
               "As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a monk with
               no more (mental) effluents, on the break-up of the body, is 
              annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death." A large number
               of monks heard, "They say that this evil supposition has arisen to Ven.
               Yamaka: 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a 
              monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body, is 
              annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death.'" So they went 
              to Ven. Yamaka and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings. After an 
              exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, they sat to one side. 
              As they were sitting there, they said to Ven. Yamaka, "Is it true, 
              friend Yamaka, that this evil supposition has arisen to you: 'As I 
              understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a monk with no 
              more effluents, on the break-up of the body, is annihilated, perishes, 
              &amp; does not exist after death.'</p>
              <p>"Yes, friends. As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed 
              One, a monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body, is 
              annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death."</p>
              <p>"Don't say that, friend Yamaka. Don't misrepresent the Blessed One. 
              It's not good to misrepresent the Blessed One, for the Blessed One would
               not say, 'A monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body, 
              is annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death.'"</p>
              <p>But even though Ven. Yamaka was thus rebuked by those monks, he — 
              from stubbornness &amp; attachment — maintained his adherence to that 
              evil supposition: 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed
               One, a monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body, is 
              annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death.'</p>
              <p>When those monks could not pry Ven. Yamaka loose from his evil 
              supposition, they got up from their seats and went to Ven. Sariputta. On
               arrival they said to him: "Friend Sariputta, this evil supposition has 
              arisen to Ven. Yamaka: 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the 
              Blessed One, a monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body,
               is annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death.' It would 
              be good if you would go to Ven. Yamaka out of sympathy for his sake."</p>
              <p>Ven. Sariputta consented by remaining silent.</p>
              <p>Then in the evening Ven. Sariputta left his seclusion, went to Ven. 
              Yamaka, and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings. After an exchange 
              of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was 
              sitting there, he said to Ven. Yamaka, "Is it true, my friend Yamaka, 
              that this evil supposition has arisen to you: 'As I understand the 
              Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a monk with no more effluents, on
               the break-up of the body, is annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not 
              exist after death.'</p>
              <p>"Yes, my friend Sariputta. As I understand the Teaching explained by 
              the Blessed One, a monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the 
              body, is annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death."</p>
              <p>"What do you think, my friend Yamaka: Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, my friend."</p>
              <p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
              <p>"Stressful, my friend."</p>
              <p>"And is it proper to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to
               change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, my friend."...</p>
              <p>"Is perception constant or inconstant?"</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, my friend."...</p>
              <p>"Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, my friend."...</p>
              <p>"Is consciousness constant or inconstant?</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, my friend."</p>
              <p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
              <p>"Stressful, my friend."</p>
              <p>"And is it proper to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to
               change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"What do you think: Do you regard form as the Tathagata?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Do you regard feeling as the Tathagata?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Do you regard perception as the Tathagata?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Do you regard fabrications as the Tathagata?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Do you regard consciousness as the Tathagata?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"What do you think: Do you regard the Tathagata as being in form?... 
              Elsewhere than form?... In feeling?... Elsewhere than feeling?... In 
              perception?... Elsewhere than perception?... In fabrications?... 
              Elsewhere than fabrications?... In consciousness?... Elsewhere than 
              consciousness?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"What do you think: Do you regard the Tathagata as form-feeling-perception-fabrications-consciousness?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"Do you regard the Tathagata as that which is without form, without 
              feeling, without perception, without fabrications, without 
              consciousness?"</p>
              <p>"No, my friend."</p>
              <p>"And so, my friend Yamaka — when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a
               truth or reality even in the present life — is it proper for you to 
              declare, 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One, a 
              monk with no more effluents, on the break-up of the body, is 
              annihilated, perishes, &amp; does not exist after death'?"</p>
              <p>"Previously, my friend Sariputta, I did foolishly hold that evil 
              supposition. But now, having heard your explanation of the Dhamma, I 
              have abandoned that evil supposition, and have broken through to the 
              Dhamma."</p>
              <p>"Then, friend Yamaka, how would you answer if you are thus asked: A 
              monk, a worthy one, with no more mental effluents: what is he on the 
              break-up of the body, after death?"</p>
              <p>"Thus asked, I would answer, 'Form is inconstant... Feeling... 
              Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant. That which is
               inconstant is stressful. That which is stressful has ceased and gone to
               its end."</p>
              <p>"Very good, my friend Yamaka. Very good. In that case I will give you
               an analogy for the sake of taking your understanding of this point even
               further. <a id="servant" name="servant">Suppose there</a> were a 
              householder or householder's son — rich, wealthy, with many possessions —
               who was thoroughly well-guarded. Then suppose there came along a 
              certain man, desiring what was not his benefit, desiring what was not 
              his welfare, desiring his loss of security, desiring to kill him. The 
              thought would occur to this man: 'It would not be easy to kill this 
              person by force. What if I were to sneak in and then kill him?'</p>
              <p>"So he would go to the householder or householder's son and say, 'May
               you take me on as a servant, lord.' With that, the householder or 
              householder's son would take the man on as a servant.</p>
              <p>"Having been taken on as a servant, the man would rise in the morning
               before his master, go to bed in the evening only after his master, 
              doing whatever his master ordered, always acting to please him, speaking
               politely to him. Then the householder or householder's son would come 
              to regard him as a friend &amp; companion, and would fall into his 
              trust. When the man realizes, 'This householder or householder's son 
              trusts me,' then encountering him in a solitary place, he would kill him
               with a sharp knife.</p>
              <p>"Now what do you think, my friend Yamaka? When that man went to the 
              householder or householder's son and said, 'May you take me on as a 
              servant, lord': wasn't he even then a murderer? And yet although he was a
               murderer, the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my 
              murderer.' And when, taken on as a servant, he would rise in the morning
               before his master, go to bed in the evening only after his master, 
              doing whatever his master ordered, always acting to please him, speaking
               politely to him: wasn't he even then a murderer? And yet although he 
              was a murderer, the householder or householder's son did not know him as
               'my murderer.' And when he encountered him in a solitary place and 
              killed him with a sharp knife: wasn't he even then a murderer? And yet 
              although he was a murderer, the householder or householder's son did not
               know him as 'my murderer.'"</p>
              <p>"Yes, my friend."</p>
              <p>"In the same way, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has 
              no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their 
              Dhamma; who has no regard for men of integrity, is not well-versed or 
              disciplined in their Dhamma — assumes form (the body) to be the self, or

              Buddha exists surely, presupposing one is on an inward journey and willing to disappear cos the Buddha is in all of us, it merely needs recognising.
              The mind-body exists in consciousness, as long as the former is identified with (which is temporal in nature) the latter will always remain a mirage.
              When the mind is parked no-where one is consciousness

              <p>Haha I wanted to reply Fugazzi but my firefox probably closed and I forgot to reply.</p>
              <p>I wanted to say, to say Buddha exist is also as wrong as saying Buddha stops existing.</p>
              <p>The Buddha said:</p>

                                                          feeling,  without perception, without fabrications, without

                                                           'Friends,  the Tathagata — the supreme man, the superlative man,

                                                          death, does not  exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after
                                                           death,  neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</em><br> <br> <em>"No, lord."...</em></em></span></span></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br></div>
              <p>So what the Buddha is saying here is: You cannot pin down the Tathagata as a Self or Reality even in the present life, how can you speak of its existence and non-existence after death? To speak of existence you must be able to establish a core or essence of Tathagata, a Self of Tathagata, but one realizes there is no Self of Tathagata - Tathagata is merely a convention, a label, a name, but not a reality.</p>
              <p>This is his teaching of Anatta.</p>
              <p>And if you cannot pin down an Existence of Tathagata, how can you speak of the Non-Existence of Tathagata, since non-existence implies an existence that has ceased its being, i.e. annihilated?</p>
              <p>So existence, or non-existence, both don't apply.</p>
              <p>Both are equally erroneous.</p>
              <p>But if you ask for the severity between the two false views of eternalism and nihilism, the view of existence or eternalism is slightly better than the view of non-existence or annihilation.</p>
              <p>Holders of the view of eternalism can on account of this view do good deeds and gain a good samsaric rebirth, however such a person will never be able to attain liberation owing to his view of an immortal soul/self, which binds him to self-attachment. He will not attain Nirvana.</p>
              <p>Holders of the view of annihilation, i.e. the self annihilates after death and thus there is no reincarnation and no karma, are in far more danger of gaining bad karma that results in rebirth in lower realm. Those who do not believe in karma can on account of the false view of annihilation commit very unwholesome karma. Furthermore, just holding a false view itself already accumulate bad karma, as the Buddha warned that the karma of false view can lead to rebirth in
                   the animal realm, a realm where ignorance predominates one's mind. So it is important that we obtain the right view from the beginning.</p>
              <p>Those who holds the Right View of the middle way understands that rebirth and karma is valid in terms of conventional truth, whereby rebirth takes place as stream of karma takes effect as a form of causal continuity, but not in terms of the passing on of an unchanging self or entity.</p>
              <p>Since there is no self that can annihilate, what does Nirvana mean then? Here the sutta makes clear:</p>
              <p><em>"Then, friend Yamaka, how would you answer if you are thus
                                                                          asked: A monk, a worthy one, with no more mental effluents: what is
                                                                          he on the break-up of the body, after death?"</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>"Thus asked, I would answer, 'Form is inconstant... Feeling...
                                                                          Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant. That
                                                                          which is inconstant is stressful. That which is stressful has
                                                                          ceased and gone to its end."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Likewise if I were asked by Sariputta, "how would you answer if you are thus asked: A sentient being, an unworthy one, with much mental effluents: what is he on the break-up of the body, after death?</p>
              <p>Thus asked, I would answer, 'Form is inconstant... Feeling...
                                                                          Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness is inconstant. That which is inconstant is stressful. Not seeing dharma as it is, sentient beings take form as constant, as desirable, as self, as mine... Feeling...
                                                                          Perception... Fabrications... Consciousness as self, as mine. A sentient being, on account of ignorance and clinging, on the break-up of the body experiences the ripening of mental formation, which gives rise to consciousness, which in turn gives rise to mind and body, ...... up to birth, old age, decay and death and the entire mass of suffering arises, not seeing any end to the cycle of samsaric becoming.'</p>
              <p>In other words, it is entirely a causal process without an agent or self inside or apart from that process.</p>

              <p>No... not because 'it' is beyond defining.</p>
              <p>The Hindus take the non-conceptual, undefinable Presence as the ultimate Self.</p>
              <p>In other words, they reify the non-conceptual.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, we do not posit even an Atman-Brahman, even if it is non-conceptual.</p>
              <p>We do not say 'the ultimate reality of Brahman is beyond notions of existence or non-existence' because that would be tantamount to saying the Ultimate Existence is beyond notions of existence and non-existence, in other words, reifying Ultimate Existence as beyond concepts. We are treating our framework of taking something as permanent, independent, Self, ultimate, as being 'the way things are' when actually it is not.</p>

              </p><p>At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke 
              verses, saying,</p>
              <p><em>From the time I attained Buddhahood, <br>The eons that have passed <br>Are 
              limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads <br>Of kotis of asamkhyeyas in 
              number. <br>I always speak the Dharma to teach and transform <br>Countless 
              millions of living beings, <br>So they enter the Buddha Way. <br>And throughout 
              these limitless eons, <br>In order to save living beings, <br>I expediently 
              manifest Nirvana. <br>But in truth I do not pass into quiescence. <br>I remain 
              here, always speaking the Dharma. <br>I always stay right here, <br>And using 
              the power of spiritual penetrations, <br>I cause inverted living beings, 
              <br>Although near me, not to see me. <br>The multitudes see me as passing into 
              quiescence. <br>They extensively make offerings to my sharira. <br>All cherish 
              ardent longing for me, <br>And their hearts look up to me in thirst. <br>Living 
              beings, then faithful and subdued, <br>Straightforward, with compliant minds, 
              <br>Single-mindedly wish to see the Buddha, <br>Caring not for their very lives. 
              <br>At that time I and the Sangha assembly <br>All appear together on Magic 
              Vulture Mountain, <br>Where I say to living beings <br>That I am always here and 
              never cease to be. <br>But using the power of expedient devices <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I manifest 
              "ceasing" and "not ceasing" to be. </span><br>For living beings in other lands, 
              <br>Reverent, faithful, and aspiring, <br>I speak the Unsurpassed Dharma. 
              <br>But you who do not hear this <br>Think that I have passed into quiescence. 
              <br>I see living beings <br>Sunk in misery, and yet <br>I refrain from 
              manifesting for them <br>In order to cause them to look up in thirst, <br>Then, 
              when their minds are filled with longing, <br>I emerge and speak the Dharma. 
              <br>With such powerful spiritual penetrations, <br>Throughout asamkhyeyas of 
              eons, <br>I remain always on Magic Vulture Mountain <br>And also dwell in other 
              places. <br>When beings see the eon ending <br>And ravaged by the great fire, 
              <br>My land is peaceful and secure, <br>Always filled with gods and humans, 
              <br>Gardens and groves, halls and pavilions, <br>And various precious 
              adornments. <br>There are jeweled trees with many flowers and fruits <br>Where 
              living beings roam in delight. <br>The gods play celestial drums, <br>Always 
              making various kinds of music, <br>And mandarava flowers <br>Are scattered on 
              the Buddha and the great assembly. <br>My Pure Land is not destroyed, <br>But 
              the multitudes see it being burned entirely. <br>Worried, terrified, and 
              miserable, <br>Such ones are everywhere. <br>All these beings with offenses, 
              <br>Because of their evil karmic causes and conditions, <br>Pass through 
              asamkhyeyas of eons, <br>Without hearing the name of the Triple Jewel. <br>All 
              who have cultivated merit and virtue, <br>Who are compliant, agreeable, and 
              honest <br>They all see me <br>Here, speaking the Dharma. <br>Sometimes for this 
              assembly, <br>I speak of the Buddhaï¿½s life span as limitless. <br>To those who 
              see the Buddha only after long intervals, <br>I speak of the Buddha as being 
              difficult to meet. <br>The power of my wisdom <br>The unlimited illumination of 
              my wisdom <br>Is such that my life span is one of countless eons <br>Attained 
              through long cultivation and work. <br>Those of you with wisdom, <br>Should not 
              have doubts about this. <br>Cut them off entirely and forever, <br>For the 
              Buddhaï¿½s words are real, not false. <br>They are like the clever expedients of

              practice the Way and those who do not. <br>I speak various Dharmas for their

              quickly perfect the body of a Buddha?"</em></p>

              <p><br>i don't read it as no Tathagata non there's Tathagata. i also read it as no birth and no cessation. Lotus sutra is categorize under Buddhayana/One vehicle sutras, along with Brahma Net.   Brahma Net is more of a quantum idea. Lotus, i think is more of teaching that everyone, including the icantika, evil ones, animal, women etcs are Buddha "originally", i.e. all have Buddha-nature; teaching about Upeksha, equanimity. so it's trying to say don't discriminate the people around you. everyone is in a way teaching the Dharma. i think tantra also do that. Emptiness is more under Prajna sutras.</p>

              Lotus Sutra also talk about emptiness but not as main emphasis because it wants to elaborate other topics. But emptiness is still the main thing in Buddhism. Buddha-nature is also empty. If it were not empty then it would have been the same as Brahman of other religions. There are a number of valid explanation what buddhanature is. Some sees it as the potentiality in all living beings to attain buddhahood. Zen Master Dogen sees buddhanature in terms of activities. In Vajrayana, buddhanature is known as the union of luminosity and emptiness.
              
              In any case, it should not be misunderstood as some eternalistic substratum which will be no different from the ideas of Brahman or God in other religions. In buddhism, buddhanature is empty and unestablished. Unfortunately some people like the Shentong and Jonang tend to have this non-Buddhist eternalistic misunderstanding of tathagatagarbha, making their teaching no different from hinduism in buddhist drag.

Of one with this view it may be expected that '[the perception of] unloathsomeness of becoming will not occur to him, and [the perception of] loathsomeness of the cessation of becoming will not occur to him.' And there are beings who have this view. Yet even in the beings who have this view there is still aberration, there is change. Seeing this, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that. Being disenchanted with that, he becomes dispassionate toward what is supreme, and even more so toward what is inferior.</span></span></div>

              Budda is not theology, Buddhism is! Buddha simply wants one to be, neither doing, nor not-doing, but just being .... Hence, the hint is that one has no ''God'' to preach to onself, no rituals to be followed; Buddha in his being hinted to the freedom of being ... The  ultimate ''prerogative'' of every living creature.
              When one does not believe in persons, one does not believe in ideologies. And when , a great knowing explodes, a trusting in existential manifestations (manifesting is more apt) eg,s in trees, in  rocks, in people, in ....., in all that is. The ''buddhas'' are part of it, n yet not part of it ( a paradox that human mind can only experience when the mind is parked no-where). One Simply abides in being .....
              
              PS - those ... in quotes are in quotes cos of the constraints of language and that which one cannot pinpoint to or define.

              <p>was wondering how Hinduism actually do their practice and their spiritual goal, and found this (other than some other funny views in the net):-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Hinduism views mankind as divine. Because Brahma is everything, Hinduism asserts that everyone is divine. Atman, or self, is one with Brahman. All of reality outside of Brahman is considered mere illusion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The spiritual goal of a Hindu is to become one with Brahma, thus ceasing to exist in its illusory form of “individual self.” This freedom is referred to as “moksha.” Until moksha is achieved, a Hindu believes that he/she will be repeatedly reincarnated in order that he/she may work towards self-realization of the truth (the truth being that only Brahman exists, nothing else). </span>How a person is reincarnated is determined by karma, which is a principle of cause and effect governed by nature's balance. What one did in the past affects and corresponds with what happens in the future, past and future lives included.</p>
