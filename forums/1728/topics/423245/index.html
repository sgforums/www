              <p>I wonder if we continue to respect ä¸�å¦‚æ³•çš„äºº, will there be any "side effect"? As if we are encouraging and agree with their wrongful act. I know it is good for our practice to continue respecting them but is it good for them and Buddhism ? I've heard followers from other religion commented that sometimes Buddhists abuse compassion æ»¥ç”¨æ…ˆæ‚².</p>
              <p>May be I am not enlightened so I can't fully understand why we have to  respect ä¸�å¦‚æ³•çš„äºº or respect the evil people. I guess only those who are enlightened know better. Afterall , all these wisdom verses are coming from the high monks. The verses must be true. I'm yet to understand.</p>

              Just the waves of the sea, it rises and it ebbs, so combination of folk and buddhist will decline as need for it diminishes.
               Buddhism with the emphasis on insight will ascend. It indeed has as in the west where the conditions are ripe, but here a little bit slower, as there is not a void like in the west.

              <p>if a group of apples belong to me, and i wish to decrease those that are bad and increase those that are good, is different from wishing to decrease those bad apples that belong to others. it's same as wishing to get rid of those bad habits within me.</p>

              <p>sinweiy. you did say "<strong>Better still, they decline</strong>" Didn't you? I didnt say that ... Is it right for you to harbour thoughts to see them decline? if they decline means they will come embrace Buddhism? U did not answer me at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: u miss out the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">folk-believe-pray-pray buddhists</span> in front of the better still. "</span><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> i don't mind the decline in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">folk-believe-pray-pray buddhists</span>. better still."<br></span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">what "They" are u talking about? ok grammer issue.<br></span><br>Since you found no evidence of me saying "MCK sect" to decline, please apologise for your own speech and if you do not, its ok, cos its your integrity now not mine.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: evidences are all over the place when u Disagree with MCK.<br></span><br>Please also do not consider giving Buddhist views as bashing, if Ven Jingkong can make a public talk, he should be able to be scrutinized by the hearers. Morever, I have been giving my views and backing up with Buddhist "evidences", how can this be bashing?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: ok, then i use "disagreeing".<br></span><br>So do you mean that as long Buddhism teachings are too high for you then resort to non buddhist teachings such as bible, quran also? </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: it's just mistaking/mixed up of MCK is directing to Christian and directing to Muslim and directing to Buddhist. that i'm sorry.</span></p>
              <p>Are you also saying that Buddhism have no elementary fundamental teachings which only non buddhist scriptures has?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: like mentioned, moral is not belong to who's. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">no one is advocating Buddhist to learn them all right to every word, every stanza and every meaning. <br><br></span><br>Can you as a fellow purelander tell me since when did the Buddha or pureland grandmasters advocate reliance on Quran and bible to gain rebirth in Pureland?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: to u i say no, grandmasters does not advocate reliance on Quran and bible to gain rebirth in Pureland.</span></p>
