            <div class='col-md body'><p>sinweiy, <br><br>You are not answering my question. Did you say those folk buddhist decline <span style="color: #ff0000;">BETTER STILL</span>?  <strong>DID YOU ? <br><br></strong>Is it right for you to harbour thoughts or rejoice for these group of people to decline ? Our responsibility as Buddhist is to harbour bad thoughts and rejoice for people's decline or to spread the Buddha's teachings to them? <br><br>Yes, I think its unbuddhistic and I cannot represent all Buddhist, this is the perfect reason why we are here discussing and to engage in a healthy discussion, we should all support our views with proper Buddhist teachings. If you think it is Buddhistic for Buddhists to believe in God, Bible, Quran etc etc etc etc .. support it with Buddhist teachings. I welcome a healthy exchange. So far, my discussions have always distanced away from personal attacks and self assumptions and backing up my views with proper buddhist scriptures and I look forward to this kind of healthy exchnage with you as well. <br><br>Precepts problem, you can open another topic and we talk about that.<br><br>Here i also ask you, do you mean that  Buddha's teachings is no longer suitable for this time and age that we have to resort to relying on bible,qurans, diziguis, tao teh ching, God, Allah, Jesus, Mary etc etc ??  <br><br>May I also know what basic tenets of Buddhism ought to be changed to fit into this current world of 2011? Such as importing teachings and God from other religion into Buddhism to replace what Shakyamuni Buddha has taught? Also importing "new methods" to gain rebirth to Amituofo's Pureland because whatever Buddha and our Pureland Masters taught no longer suit this era??<br><br>Becos "put it the way i like?" clearly, this is your assumption. Got it? Can your mistake in assuming me happen exactly to what you assume your personal understanding of Dharma? By the way, I accept your apology and I am happy that you are a responsible person for your speech. I too can apologise for saying that I mistook your other religions but the main core again, is all forms of beliefs and religions.. refer to my past posts. <br><br>I don't know and don't want to judge what is wrong for Buddhism, as a Buddhist. I know the BUDDHA's TEACHINGS is defintely right for Buddhists. Take faith, practise and share it. simple enough. <br><br>Oh .. yr <br><br>æ³•æ— å®šæ³•ï¼Œå®šæ³•é�žæ³•<br>é�žæ³•å�³æ³•  æ³•å�³é�žæ³• and so on .....<br><br>come out again ? <br><br><br></p></div>

As a good friend and good teacher, we should only bear thoughts of wanting the student to excel. It's not the same as you said. <br><br>Theravada and Mahayan got its own set of arguments, however it is within the boundry of Buddhism, but when bible and god, allah, bible, quran comes into the picture, its outside the topic of Buddhism.
