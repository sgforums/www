                  are claiming persecution in Myanmar. Across North Africa and the Middle East
                  millions are suffering the violence of bigotry. Throughout Europe indigenous
                  cultures are under threat due to mass illegal immigration and there is fear
                  worldwide of further atrocities like 9/11 and 7/7 being committed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">The
                  people of the south of Thailand are not alone in their resistance to setting up
                  camps for Muslim migrants. The UK is officially refusing to accept further
                  migrants from Islamic countries. Australia is resisting criticism from rights
                  organisations in rejecting illegal immigration. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";         ' lang="EN"> <br> All this fear and unrest and alleged persecution has one single cause, and that
                  is Islam. The media and politicians evade the truth by speaking and writing of
                  terrorism, of extremism, of radicalism and fundamentalism. The last noun is
                  close but as an adjective it tells the truth: fundamental Islam.<br> <br> Islam was invented in the 7th century by a warlord in Saudi Arabia who claimed
                  his ideas to be sanctioned by god. It was born of the sword and has grown by
                  instilling fear in both its followers and those who oppose it. Nothing has
                  changed as we see from its activities around the globe.<br> <br> There is a genuine, realistic reason for Muslims to be attacked in Myanmar;
                  Muslims are seen to represent Islam. Most of the atrocities worldwide are
                  perpetrated in the name of Islam. The most murderous atrocities are carried out
                  by the Islamic State, ISIS. Israel is under permanent threat from Islam. Europe
                  is under severe threat of Islamisation with mosques appearing like mushrooms.
                  Christians in Egypt were murdered only recently by Islamists because of their
                  religion. Almost all the terror, misery and demographic revolution is due to
                  Islam. Every day this is more apparent with the abduction of school children
                  and the desecration of historic Buddhist images, car bombs in Iraq and
                  inter-Islamic war between Sunnis and Shias in Yemen.<br> <br> This is not opinion, it is a matter of undeniable fact. Judeo-Christian
                  democracies and Buddhist countries are completely incompatible with Islam,
                  which is a totalitarian political ideology. The two cannot co-exist any more
                  than Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims can accept each other on equal terms.<br> <br> Such a root cause of this troubled world must be confronted. Failure to do so
                  will only result in even greater misery for both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
                  This rapidly growing major global threat can no longer be ignored.<br> <br> Migrating Muslims, due to their faith, are unable to integrate into
                  Judeo-Christian democratic societies. They should better be absorbed into
                  Islamic countries who share their ideology. This would avoid civil conflict. <br> <br> There is no point in Muslims seeking asylum in countries whose paramount law is
                  freedom of expression and whose laws take precedent over Islamic law, Sharia. <br> <br> Successful integration can only take place when migrants fully accept the ways
                  and laws of their host country. Muslims have shown they cannot do that. They
                  seek to impose their ideology on countries where they have been received. <br> </span></p>
