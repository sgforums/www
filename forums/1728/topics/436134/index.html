The ultimately real is that which strictly corresponds to pure sensation alone. We can only cognize the imagined superstructure of reality, but not reality itself.

It is non-empirical, it is transcendental and unutterable. There is no other reality than this, as all other reality is borrowed from it. An object which is not connected with a sensation, with sensible reality, is either pure imagination, or a mere names or a metaphysical object. Reality is synonymous with sensible existence. It is opposed to Ideality, generality and thought construction.</span></p>

              <p>for example, Mr A is tall, Mr B is short &lt;---- conventional truth</p>
              <p>then ---- ultimate truth ---&gt; there is no tall or short</p>

It is non-empirical, it is transcendental and unutterable. There is no other reality than this, as all other reality is borrowed from it. An object which is not connected with a sensation, with sensible reality, is either pure imagination, or a mere names or a metaphysical object. Reality is synonymous with sensible existence. It is opposed to Ideality, generality and thought construction.</span></p>

If one should take all three persons in isolation and not in dependence on each other, the term tall, short, beautiful, ugly, etc would not apply. Yes, it is necessary and serves as a function for worldly living. It is when our mind dichotomized what is ‘seen’ into subjects and objects that eventually lead to problems such as clinging, greed etc. Ultimate truth is the intuitive knowledge of the real without any comparison or distortion. It leads on to the understanding and realization that ultimately, self and all objects are empty of any essence. That they arise in dependence on causes and conditions only.</span></span></p>

              <p>Let me put it this way: conventional truth is the truth most people subscribed to (i.e. by convention).  Ask members of City Harvest Church when they go to Suntec Convention Centre to listen to the truth!</p>
              <p>Ultimate truth is what Buddhists subscribed to because of the doctrine of emptiness.</p>
              <p>Both subscriptions don't make sense. Truth is not the same as reality.  When one holds a proposition, conjecture, or thought as true, then it is the truth.</p>
              <p>In a court of law, witnesses swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.  Counsels swear to tear the truth.  Even if a witness lied thru his teeth, the court can do nothing.  Why?  Because the witness believed what he said, saw, done, etc. to be nothing (emptiness) but the truth!</p>

              <p>To cut a long story short, Buddhist logicians's concept of reality is as much an imagination or mental construct as any other concept, whatever reality is called - conventional, ultimate or pure.  To label a past event that has transpired as unreal distort the true meaning of reality.  I can accept that a past event no longer exist.  And basically the flaw I see in Buddhist logicians' view is that they see only the present as real.  They are 'caught' up by the doctrinal dogma rather than reality. That's why I make the assertion that their views are narrow.</p>
              <p>A concept or thought is a mental construct.  We don't attribute 'reality' to them in everyday usage though a concept or thought exists in the mind.  I am sure one can easily understand that an imagination is not to be treated as real regardless of how the person making the imagination would treat it.  As an example: a person imagines or conceptualises that it would be nice if the earth's temperature is evenly spread such that there is no extreme cold or heat.  Would you treat his imagination as real and just to add, the imagination is make right at this moment, now.</p>
