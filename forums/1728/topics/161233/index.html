It is called the 'Lonely hell', and it is known as the hell on Earth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a><br><br>10. Is there really a hell on earth? How does it manifest?<br><br><strong>Sufferings from retribution of negative karma constitute hell on earth.</strong><br>'Hell' on earth exists everywhere and it is there for everyone to see. In fact, we see it very frequently.<br><br>The term 'hell on earth' is not found in the Buddhist Sutras. However, whilst in deep meditation one day, I realized that this is in fact the hell on earth. In the Sutras, it is referred to as the 'lonely hell'. The karma or deeds that we commit can be classified as collective karma meaning the deeds collectively committed by a group of people, or individual karma meaning deeds committed by an individual acting alone. If everyone in the family is very fine and only one person is suffering from the retribution of his negative karma that he himself has committed, then this is the lonely hell or hell on earth. The father of a wealthy family, bedridden and suffering as a result of a stroke that left him paralysed is an example of hell on earth. The mind creates all things and phenomena. As human beings, we must transform the hell on earth so that everyone can be in the heaven on earth.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And why is it said that rebirth happens every moment? Hopefully the following excerpt should provide insights:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises.

'Eternal Life' probably refers to our True Self/Buddha Nature, but our individual 'self' is illusional. It is this 'individual self'/'false self' that leads us to go through cyclic rebirth.

This is always seen as an interaction between external conditions and inner tendencies; the same conditions (the same workplace, for example) that will be experienced by one person as unremitting misery may be a source of exhilarating challenge and satisfaction to another. Strengthening our inner state so that we are able to resist and even transform the most difficult and negative conditions is the purpose of Buddhist practice.<br><br>Based on his reading of the Lotus Sutra, the sixth-century Chinese Buddhist T'ien-t'ai developed a system that classifies human experience into ten states or "worlds." This Ten Worlds teaching was adopted and elaborated by Nichiren, who stressed the inner, subjective nature of these worlds: "As to the question of where exactly Hell and the Buddha exist, one sutra reads that Hell exists underground and another sutra says that the Buddha is in the west. However, closer examination reveals that both exist in our five-foot body."<br><br>The 10 Worlds:<br><br>1. Hell--a condition of despair in which one is completely overwhelmed by suffering<br><br>2. Hunger--a state dominated by deluded desire that can never be satisfied<br><br>3. Animality--an instinctual state of fearing the strong and bullying the weak<br><br>4. Anger--a state characterized by an unrestrained competitive urge to surpass and dominate others and often a pretence of being good and wise<br><br>These four states above are referred to as the Four Evil Paths because of the destructive negativity that marks them.<br><br>5. Humanity--is a tranquil state marked by the ability to reason and make calm judgments. While fundamental to our identity as humans, this state can also represent a fragile balance that yields to one of the lower states when confronted with negative conditions<br><br>6. Rapture is a state of joy typically experienced when desire is fulfilled or suffering escaped<br><br>The worlds thus far are sometimes grouped together as the Six Lower Worlds. These are all basically reactions to changing external conditions in which we experience a lack of real freedom and autonomy.<br><br>What Buddhism refers to as the Four Noble States represent the effort to live with integrity, inner freedom and compassion. Below are the Four Noble States.<br><br>7. Learning-- describes a condition of aspiration to enlightenment<br><br>8. Realization--indicates the ability to perceive unaided the true nature of phenomena. Together, these are sometimes referred to as the Two Vehicles as people manifesting these states are partially enlightened and free from some deluded desires<br><br>But these worlds above can be very self-absorbed, and in many Buddhist texts we find the Buddha admonishing the people of the Two Vehicles for their selfishness and complacency.<br><br>9. Bodhisattva--is a state of compassion in which we overcome the restraints of egotism and work tirelessly for the welfare of others. Mahayana Buddhism in particular emphasizes the Bodhisattva as an ideal of human behavior<br><br>10. Buddhahood--is a state of completeness and perfect freedom, in which one is able to savor a sense of unity with the fundamental life-force of the cosmos. For a person in the state of Buddhahood, everything--including the inevitable trials of illness, aging and death--can be experienced as an opportunity for joy and fulfillment. The inner life-state of Buddhahood makes itself visible through altruistic commitment and actions enacted in the world of Bodhisattva<br><br>Buddhahood continues to exist even within a person whose life is dominated by the lower life-states of Hell, Hunger or Animality. The reverse is also true. The life-state of Buddhahood is not separate or discontinuous from the other nine worlds. Rather, the wisdom, vitality and courage of Buddhahood can infuse and transform the manner in which a tendency toward, for example, Anger, functions in a person's life. When Anger is directed by the compassion of the worlds of Buddhahood and Bodhisattva, it can be a vital force in challenging injustice and transforming human society.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>31 planes of existences is the elaborated version of 6 realms, whereby 10 worlds is based on the 6 samsaric realms (hells, ghosts, animals, asuras, men, devas) plus the 4 other Bodhi 'realms' (sravakas, pratyeka-buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas). All are valid explanations. It is also true that every moment we undergo samsaric 'rebirth' (however ordinary people cannot easily transcend the 6 samsaric realms into the 4 'Bodhi' in a short time. it requires practise). In reality, Buddhahood is not far away from us, because Buddha Nature is always present even during the most obscured moments. We simply cannot perceive it. Therefore it requires practise and cultivation before we can attain enlightenment. Another thing is although the 6 realms can happen right now, if we commit unwholesome karma, we will certainly be reborned in a REAL place called hell in the future, it is clearly stated in the suttas, and even described them. There are also real places called heaven, the suttas also clearly described them. Therefore it is not very right to think that there is no literal hell and heaven in future lifetimes. There are 6 samsaric realms, not just the human world.</div>

It is also true that everyone process the buddha nature, it is under constant practise of buddhism that we can awaken the buddha nature in us. When a person is feeding an animal or helping a person he/she is displaying a state of buddhahood in them because they are showing compassion which is one of the characteristic of buddhahood. A person that gained enlightenment(eg. Shakyamuni) is one whose always at the state of buddhahood, meaning to be able to treat everything calmly and not falling into the lower state of life. A buddha is a person of courage, tenacity and continuous action; and one who struggles ceaselessly against devilish functions. Buddhahood is not about being a god or being a superior it's a state of mind that a person manifest. Therefore one who has attained a state of buddhahood is not free from problems, pain and sufferings; he is still subject to temptation by devilish forces. It is thus that ceaseless effort to advance and improve our faith has to be made lest it be destroyed in just a moment.<br><br></div>

A Buddha is completely pure and therefore liberated from Greed, Hatred, Ignorance. There is absolutely no need to struggle against 'devillish functions' (do you mean the Maras?) or any form of temptations and desire. Not even one such temptation will arise in his pure mind. After his enlightenment, the Maras have no power over him any more. Also, you should know that after enlightenment, a person is completely freed and liberated from sufferings. He still feels pain at times, pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. And when he is enlightened he no longer suffers.<br><br>If you go back to the basics you would know about the 4 Noble Truths, and the very first teaching is already dealing with the total liberation of sufferings.</div>
