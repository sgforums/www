It is also true that everyone process the buddha nature, it is under constant practise of buddhism that we can awaken the buddha nature in us. When a person is feeding an animal or helping a person he/she is displaying a state of buddhahood in them because they are showing compassion which is one of the characteristic of buddhahood. A person that gained enlightenment(eg. Shakyamuni) is one whose always at the state of buddhahood, meaning to be able to treat everything calmly and not falling into the lower state of life. A buddha is a person of courage, tenacity and continuous action; and one who struggles ceaselessly against devilish functions. Buddhahood is not about being a god or being a superior it's a state of mind that a person manifest. Therefore one who has attained a state of buddhahood is not free from problems, pain and sufferings; he is still subject to temptation by devilish forces. It is thus that ceaseless effort to advance and improve our faith has to be made lest it be destroyed in just a moment.<br><br></div></blockquote>erm let me said something ..<br><br>Buddha will have physical suffering ,like boils on the feet after long distance of travelling to preach from Magadha kingdom to Vulture Peak<br><br>but He is not afflicted by it Mentally<br><br>He is composed and very much unaffected by those physical suffering every human beings does<br><br>i dun think devillish will be able to hurt him, remember he was a deity in the heaven and help so many deities .THose deities stop the evil ppl from even coming near to him ....<br><br>that is the fruition of Perfect Karma and Vows ..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Vimalakirti Nirdesa SUtra<br><br>The Buddha then said to the venerable Ã�nanda, "Ã�nanda, go to the Licchavi Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness."<br><br>Ã�nanda replied, "Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness. Why? Lord, I remember one day when the body of the Lord manifested some indisposition and he required some milk; I took the bowl and went to the door of the mansion of a great Brahman family. The Licchavi Vimalakirti came there, and, having saluted me, said, 'Reverend Ã�nanda, what are you doing on the threshold of this house with your bowl in your hand so early in the morning?'<br><br>"I replied: 'the body of the Lord manifests some indisposition, and he needs some milk. Therefore, I have come to fetch some.'<br><br>"Vimalakirti then said to me, 'Reverend Ã�nanda, do not say such a thing! Reverend Ã�nanda, the body of the TathÃ¡gata is tough as a diamond, having eliminated all the instinctual traces of evil and being endowed with all goodness. How could disease or discomfort affect such a body?<br><br>"'Reverend Ã�nanda, go in silence, and do not belittle the Lord. Do not say such things to others. It would not be good for the powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various Buddha-fields to hear such words.<br><br>"'Reverend Ã�nanda, a universal monarch, who is endowed only with a small root of virtue, is free of diseases.<br><br>How then could the Lord, who has an infinite root of virtue, have any disease? It is impossible.<br><br>"'Reverend Ã�nanda, do not bring shame upon us, but go in silence, lest the heterodox sectarians should hear your words. They would say, "For shame! The teacher of these people cannot even cure his own sicknesses. How then can he cure the sicknesses of others?" Reverend Ã�nanda, go then discreetly so that no one observes you.<br><br>"'Reverend Ã�nanda, the TathÃ¡gatas have the body of the Dharma - not a body that is sustained by material food.<br><br><strong>The TathÃ¡gatas have a transcendental body that has transcended all mundane qualities.<br><br>There is no injury to the body of a TathÃ¡gata, as it is rid of all defilements. The body of a TathÃ¡gata is uncompounded and free of all formative activity. Reverend Ã�nanda, to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemly!'</strong><br>"When I had heard these words, I wondered if I had previously misheard and misunderstood the Buddha, and I was very much ashamed. Then I heard a voice from the sky: 'Ã�nanda! The householder speaks to you truly.<br>........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">originally posted by An Eternal Now</div><div class="quote_body">I do not agree with the part that Buddha still has to struggle with 'devilish functions' or 'sufferings'. A Buddha is completely pure and therefore liberated from Greed, Hatred, Ignorance. There is absolutely no need to struggle against 'devillish functions' (do you mean the Maras?) or any form of temptations and desire. Not even one such temptation will arise in his pure mind. After his enlightenment, the Maras have no power over him any more. Also, you should know that after enlightenment, a person is completely freed and liberated from sufferings. He still feels pain at times, pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. And when he is enlightened he no longer suffers.<br><br>If you go back to the basics you would know about the 4 Noble Truths, and the very first teaching is already dealing with the total liberation of sufferings.</div></blockquote>A Buddha is any being who has become awakened to the ultimate truth of life, one who perceives the true entity of all phenomena, and who leads others to attain the same truth of life. In Hinayana the word means one who has entered the state of nenlightenment. In India the word buddha was originally a common noun meaning "awakened one," but in Buddhism it is used to mean one who has become awakened to the ultimate irvana, in which both body and mind are extinguished. Provisional Mahayana generally teaches that one becomes a Buddha after eradicating illusions through aeons of austere and meritorious practices, gradually acquiring the thirty-two features of a Buddha. Although a Buddha is ridded off the 3 poisons of buddhism(Greed, Hatred, Ignorance) and is always at the higher states of life. He/she still can experience the 4 lower states of life but will not be influenced or trapped in the lower states of life. Thus due to a Buddha's wisdom and high life condtion he/she can easily return to the higher states of life and not trap or get influenced in the lower states of life. When Shakyamuni was savouring the joy of enlightenment under the pipal tree, he was simultaneously troubled by the dilemma of whether he should preach the law to others. The devilish functions continued to plague Shakyamuni even after he had become a Buddha. They vied to attack him through even the smallest breach in his heart.<br><br>When a person beomes a Buddha he/she still has to under go sufferings. Sufferings and pain are not optional, it is a process of life. However due to a Buddha's states of life, he/she can view sufferings as a part of life and a joy in life. When Shakyamuni became a buddha he is not ridded of sufferings, because he still has to experience; bith, age, sick, death. These 4 points are considered sufferings, but due to a buddha's high life condition and wisdom he is able to view sufferings as a joy. Buddhism recogisnes the suffering in this world thus buddhism teaches us how to discover the ultimate truth within themselves, tapping an inner source of happiness and the strength and wisdom to overcome suffering. The eightfold path are right views, thinking, speech, action, right way of life, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right meditation. These paths are the eradication of suffering, all these eight paths are set to change our views about sufferings they do not rid sufferings from the face of the earth. Sufferings are part of life and not optional, it is whether one views it in a different way that one can release from sufferings.<br><br>Four Noble Truths:<br>The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering. Shakyamuni is said to have expounded the four noble truths at Deer Park in Varanasi, India, during his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. They are: (1) all existence is suffering; (2) suffering is caused by selfish craving; (3) the eradication of selfish craving brings about the cessation of suffering and enables one to attain nirvana; and (4) there is a path by which this eradication can be achieved, namely, the discipline of the eightfold path. The eightfold path consists of right views, right thinking, right speech, right action, right way of life, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right meditation.<br><br></div>

Shariputra did not attain enlightenment faster than another of Shakyamuni's disciple who is slower, though Shariputra has the most wisdom. this is because Shariputra thought that he is too clever, and ironically, this arrogrance resulted in him not realising the Law of life. Shakyamuni commented on Shariputra's arrogrance, and upon realising, he changed his ways and attained enlightenment.<br><br>I think this is a friendly exchange of ideas.
