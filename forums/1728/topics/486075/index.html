              <p>The
               path of anatta and emptiness is truly the path of total uncontrivance. 
              Isn't it so? If in our mind we have an image of what awareness, or what 
              our practice should be like, there will be contrivance -- trying to get 
              back to a supposed inherent space of awareness, background, etc, or what
               we think awareness is or should be based on a captured memory -- we 
              will unconsciously contrive to get back to a 'state', except we don't 
              see it as a state, we don't see the contrivance involved -- we see it as
               inherently existing changeless Self -- inherently so.</p>
              <p>In anatta,
               truly there is zero movement -- the zero movement is not to rest in a 
              state of immutable 'Being' which is still a form of grasping and caging 
              of clarity. The zero movement is from not moving a step away from the 
              spontaneous manifestation of transience, not holding back, no essence or
               substance hiding anywhere. Because there is absolutely no changeless 
              self/Self behind anything, there is absolutely no fixed manner 
              awareness/experience is, everything is absolutely fluid and vanishing 
              and there is constant renewal. Every moment is utterly new and 
              completely unpredictable, therefore naturally there is resting in the 
              unpredictable spontaneity of appearance/manifestation/activity rather 
              than with something familiar -- holding back to something familiar is 
              merely clinging to a reification based on memory. We don't fixate on 
              something transcending waking, dream and deep sleep, we simply let 
              waking be waking, dream be dream, deep sleep be deep sleep, in its 
              actual condition or luminous-wisdom-display. The qualities of deep and 
              intense clarity, transparency, bliss, naturally manifest without 
              contrivance in spontaneous manifestation without any trace of self/Self.
               If we try to contrive a state of clarity, if we try to contrive the 
              spaciousness, the transparency, the bliss, that won't do -- we are 
              merely caging clarity, holding back to a self.</p>
              <p>And we don't let 
              the luminous-wisdom-display blind us from afflictive dependent 
              origination. What is this karmic propensities? It is really just your 
              very face -- experience -- as it is! There is nothing beyond, behind, or
               within karmic propensities -- the very delusionally shaped experience. 
              It's like seeing those picture puzzles, at first it seems like black 
              random shapes, yes? And then suddenly you saw "aha! there's a cow in 
              there" and from then on, you cannot unsee that cow anymore. It's no 
              longer black random shapes, there's clearly a cow very prominently shown
               in the picture. Now, this analogy has been used as representing 
              'awakening' -- a sudden shift of perception from ignorance to wisdom, 
              seeing things as it is. However, this analogy is also perfect for the 
              total exertion of karmic propensities. Whereas previously you see a 
              rope, suddenly rope becomes 'meaningful', now you see it as a snake, and
               it seemingly can't be unseen. Your mental conditioning has shaped the 
              way you perceive and experience those 'black, random colours' into 
              something truly solid and inherently existing in a certain manner. It is
               a magical 'creation' of a new experiential reality, the total exertion 
              of our mental conditioning. That is like our delusional vision of self 
              and inherent existence. It is our very experience itself shaped by 
              karmic propensities into our very apparent reality. That is how delusion
               and karmic propensities manifest in our experience -- there is nothing 
              hiding behind our experience influencing experience (some people may 
              believe there is a hidden 'subconscious' pulling the strings on 
              experience) or inside the very delusional appearance -- and just that is
               the total exertion of our afflicted conditionings. And this is no 
              different from emptiness of self, the subject, where it is seen there is
               no inherent self/awareness/subject behind or within or beyond the very 
              manifestation... but emptiness of self can be applied to all other 
              things including 'karmic propensities'.</p>
              <p>And likewise there is 
              nothing behind, beyond, nor arising, abiding, and ceasing in the pure 
              luminous-wisdom-display of our pure sensory experience. All things are 
              ultimately empty of inherent existence, or real arising, and 
              simultaneously its emptiness of inherent existence allows us to see its 
              conventional reality that is the total exertion of all conditions. The 
              two truths are inseparable, what dependently originates is fundamentally
               non-arising, and the emptiness of something reveals its conventional 
              reality. When we have the view of the inseparability of two truths, to 
              see the total exertion of appearance is also to see its non-arising, to 
              see its fundamental non-arising is to see the very appearance as mere 
              appearance of total exertion without anything created or existing 
              behind/beyond/within the appearance. Though sometimes we skew towards 
              one side of the two truths.</p>
