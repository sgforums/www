              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              mother adjusts to her son’s new way of being in the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There’s
              a saying I’ve heard among some Western Buddhists: to lose yourself, either
              meditate or travel. What about doing both at once, while keeping pace with your
              28-year-old son, whom you named Nathan Dale at birth but who is now Tan
              Nisabho, a Thai Forest monk? Long gone is the wavy cap of nut-brown hair and
              thick eyebrows; his gleaming skull appears and disappears like stages of the
              moon between his fortnightly shavings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              those just-shaved full moon days, Tan Nisabho (Tan Po for short) looks a lot
              like the infant whose newborn eyes gazed unflinchingly into mine, prompting me
              to say aloud something utterly unexpected after he was cleaned and swaddled:
              “Oh! This one’s not going the normal route! A monastic!” My mother, standing beside
              me and looking down at his face, had a similar reaction, calling him “Old
              Soul.” Intuitions like these are rare, but not unheard of for mothers; I know
              that this first hello with my boy made it easier years later to say good-bye
              when he stepped on the plane to Asia with the intention of finding a monastic
              home to replace the one he’d grown up in.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              did Buddhism wend its way into my son’s life to prompt the radical step of
              ordination in his twenties? Born in Marin County, California, he began asking
              ontological unanswerables during toddlerhood: “How can you be sure your dreams
              aren’t the real life, and your real life isn’t a dream?” Indeed. We raised Nate
              on a menu of Buddhism lite: silent dinners using Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village
              chanting book and an evening metta meditation; as he grew older, we initiated a
              Teen Dharma Circle, mostly comprising Nate’s best friends, all eager to explore
              the processes and contents of their minds. According to our son, these
              encounters with the dharma plus the fact that his parents were spiritual
              companions primed him. Yet the certainty that monasticism would shape his
              future occurred when, at 15, he read Hermann Hesse’s Siddhartha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Keeping
              a couple of toes in the dharma through meditation, books, and a few retreats,
              our son dove into an intense courseload at Reed College in Portland, Oregon,
              into group sing-alongs that he convened, into love affairs and ensuing
              breakups, into mountaineering and all that the Northwest offers in the way of
              outdoor bliss. Yet during his junior year at college, he told us in private
              that he’d already seen enough of human suffering to know that society’s
              approaches to unhappiness did not address its root causes. He felt ready to
              pursue the life of a monk. We asked him to finish college first, just in case.
              Always the Golden Boy in everyone’s eyes, he had the talent, the charisma, and
              the smarts to pursue any career.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              that Tan Po has been ordained for nearly five years, missing, along with his
              hair and every possession, is his fireplug physique. On our Skype calls between
              our home in Spokane, Washington, and his monastery in Thailand, I insist that
              he back up from the camera and turn sideways. My motherly eye assesses any
              further corporeal diminishment. What’s left of the old Nate? Not much. But
              that’s the point of monasticism, isn’t it, to cast off, bit by bit, every
              dimension of what we identify as self?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Monasticism
              is truly a world apart from the mainstream, mentally and physically; no
              individual leaps across that rift without leaving behind bewildered, bereft
              non-Buddhist friends and relatives. Tan Po’s choice necessitated relinquishing
              almost every aspect of his former identity, and that included his former social
              life. His first visit back home, for a memorial—a special leniency for a monk
              with less than five years of practice—was as awkward for him as it was for
              friends and relatives. He kept a rigid monastic schedule right in the midst of
              events, as his teacher had instructed him to do. Refraining from idle speech,
              he found he had much less in common with his friends who were now all about
              career and relationships. An indelible memory sticks with me of a breakfast in
              a Seattle restaurant with some of his friends from Reed College: staring at Tan
              Po’s transformation, sensing the scope of the chasm between them now, his
              friend Cathy sat speechless, tears dripping into her untouched food over the
              course of two hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Monastics
              cannot ordain without their parents’ permission, and some go to radical lengths
              for the go-ahead. I know monks who have refused to eat until their parents
              agreed to let them ordain. Western, non-Buddhist parents of monks must navigate
              a huge stretch in understanding between their disparate worlds. We’ve heard of
              many sad, befuddled, and confused families, but in general, says my son,
              Western parents, whether they are Buddhist or not, come around after they see
              how content their child is. Some Thai parents, especially the wealthy, put up
              considerable resistance when their sons incline toward a lifetime commitment of
              monasticism, trying to entice them with such prizes as a fancy car, an arranged
              marriage, or a top CEO job in the family business.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              Doug and I are Buddhist practitioners and have always supported Tan Po’s
              monasticism, we have worried. Our first two visits to Thailand were not
              reassuring—neither the first trip, a visit to witness his ordination in the
              middle of the alien environment of a Thai wat; nor the second trip, a junket
              across the country to meet the living saints he’d heard so much about from fellow
              monks. (In an oversized karaoke van with the Playboy signage on the doors that
              one sees all over Thailand, we rushed from one town to the next—Doug and I, Tan
              Po, his sister, Jamey, and a more senior monk to guide the younger in the
              protocols of being in public.) During those trips, we were caught unaware at
              moments when grief over our boy’s absence would surface: for Doug, it was a
              gut-wrenching sobbing in the bathroom of our first return flight from Bangkok;
              I thought I was just fine until Tan Po asked me face-to-face during our second
              visit if his new life was hard for me. We were casually walking on a monastery
              road, sun shining, tropical birds singing. Overcome with sudden anguish, I
              found myself nearly unable to stand. He didn’t know what to do. Neither did I
              at the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the tail end of 2016, while the United States was wildly disoriented with
              postelection euphoria or despair, Doug and I landed across the planet for a
              let’s-try-skipping-Christmas family reunion. The last of our family’s elders,
              my sweet 93-year-old mother, had died in May, and we hadn’t seen Tan Po in
              person in almost two years. Jamey, and her boyfriend, Max, not practitioners,
              planned to be with us for two weeks. Doug and I planned to stay six.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sister
              and brother longed for this reunion, but it soon became clear that their travel
              agendas weren’t compatible in the least. One wanted to follow the threads of
              intrigue hidden in Bangkok backstreets till the wee hours; the other would rise
              a few hours later for meditation and chanting. Because of Tan Po’s monastic
              rules restricting entertainment, the daytime tourism menu we could enjoy
              together included sacred monuments and monasteries, as many as we wanted, all
              the day long. Oh, and I forgot museums. We could also see museums together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              no accident that the Vinaya, the Buddhist monastic code, makes it nigh
              impossible to blend lay and monk lives easily. A monastic’s purpose is
              singular; this is hardly so for most laypeople, and our attempt at togetherness
              exposed the fault line between us that often feels unbridgeable. Following a
              monk wasn’t turning out to be what Jamey or Max had envisioned for Max’s first
              trip abroad. Tan Po, Doug and I gave them our blessings to go seek out their
              own adventures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Scrapping
              our original group plan, we three decided to dedicate the next month to a
              tudong, a mobile retreat to monasteries and sacred sites of the Thai Forest
              tradition. Tudong is a Thai word that derives from the Pali dhutanga, referring
              to one who “polishes off defilements, an ascetic.” These days, the term is
              shorthand for a Forest monk’s wandering through the countryside by foot,
              vulnerable to the elements and dependent on people’s kindness. Many of the
              great spiritual masters of Thailand have practiced tudong for years at a time. Our
              version had little in common with their asceticism, but maybe there was a
              similarity in spiritual focus, an openness to the ways in which life and dharma
              might meet us—and change us—down the road.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              decision marked a shift in our own perceptions, as well as a shift in the
              perceptions of the Thai people we encountered. We were no longer seen as
              tourists. Instead, we comprised a perhaps never-seen-before trio walking on the
              side of busy highways and quiet back roads, apparently deserving of an outpouring
              of generosity. Indeed we were an odd trifecta: a heavenly messenger—the
              Buddha’s term for monastics, sickness, old age, and death—and two
              late-middle-aged foreigners with large backpacks. (With Doug and me hovering at
              60 years old, we might have had two of the four heavenly messengers covered.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tan
              Po wore ocher robes he had sewn himself and carried the classic gear of a
              traveling mendicant: his gallon-sized alms bowl and canvas cover; a
              ground-sheet; a glot (an umbrella with mosquito netting that serves as a tent);
              and a canvas bag with three books, a journal, and CDs of his teacher’s dharma
              talks to give away. I weighed his gear against my own and found we were equal,
              but his looked specially designed for blisters and backaches. “It’s supposed to
              be unwieldy, Mom—that’s part of what makes it a practice.” Oh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Doug
              and I looked like tourists who had taken the wrong turn on the way to a beach
              resort. Doug wore a baseball cap and almost-monastery-worthy whites so we’d be
              viewed, maybe just a little, as religious pilgrims. Because Thailand’s beloved
              king had recently died, I wore black slacks in his honor (also because I can’t
              keep anything white clean) and the women’s lavender polyester top ubiquitous at
              Thai monasteries. My sun-blocking umbrella, much needed along the shadeless
              roads, completed the tableau.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No
              one passed by us without taking a long, long look, stopping to offer a ride, or
              returning in their vehicle five minutes later to offer refreshments and ask
              questions. Our inside joke became “Why do Thai people always look so confused?”
              A few times we availed ourselves of those rides as well as an overnight train
              and bus. Unlike the ascetics, we also cheated with a handy iPhone to evade
              scary highways and walk empty back roads wherever possible past rice paddies
              and through jungle. This strategy bewildered the Thais even more. Unable to
              believe that we weren’t lost, they inevitably herded us, very sweetly, back to
              the busy streets.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              Doug and I were Buddhist practitioners supporting our son’s life in the dharma
              struck a deep chord with many we met. In our tudong, says Tan Po, Doug and I
              occupied a role similar to his in Thailand—providing signposts of practice
              along the path that is the heart of Thai culture. In calling ourselves
              Buddhists and encouraging our son’s training, we honored Thailand’s great
              teachers and tradition. Says Tan Po: “If some Westerners with all their wealth
              can give up their son to the dharma, the Thais perceive it as a call back to
              their native faith.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              we left the comfort of his mother ship, as I call his home monastery, I marked
              our travels by the kindnesses heaped upon us—in fact, they amassed so fast that
              both my husband and I began journaling a list halfway through our trip and
              couldn’t keep up. We began our walking tudong at the outskirts of the city of
              Ubon</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ratchathani
              in the early morning. Within five minutes, the main road bisected a food market
              for farmworkers—food stands sheltered from rain or sun by makeshift roofs
              resting at rakish angles on jury-rigged walls. Tan Po hadn’t eaten his one meal
              of the day, so this would likely be his alms round.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No
              sooner had we passed the first stall than word of the foreign monk and the two
              old persons following him flew from one family to the next. A few stalls and
              steps later, his bowl topped out, but the bounty continued. If a monk turns
              down an offering, he is not allowed to eat. By the time we reached the finish
              line, Tan Po had chanted a number of blessings and his parent-porters carried
              the rest of the largess. These offerings of food are given in silence without
              eye contact; if the givers wanted a blessing, they’d ask by kneeling, barefoot,
              on a bamboo mat laid down in anticipation. Once they were kneeling, with their
              heads bowed, Tan Po would then chant a prayer that ended with these words:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“May
              the angels always protect you. By all the power of the Buddha may you always be
              well; by all the power of dhamma may you always be well; by all the power of
              the sangha may you always be well.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              laity offer food to something far greater than any individual present. Buddhist
              tradition, says my son, frowns upon a monk responding with a flimsy
              two-syllable “Thank you,” as it diminishes the immense beauty of the act. The
              offering is made to the monastic robes, to the ideal of awakening, not to the
              individual monk, who merely expresses that ideal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              old ladies bowing to Tan Po on the street and the ubiquitous generosity toward
              Thailand’s monks used to embarrass him. “After a while,” he says now, “you shut
              up and take it. It’s not for you; it becomes another opportunity to shed self.”
              He is regularly gifted dental checkups, and physicians treat him when needed,
              as they did last year, when he suffered from a mosquito-borne staph infection.
              Physical therapy if necessary. Sutures. Nothing is expected in return, not even
              for the multiple tattoo removals. Nor will any of these folks accept payment
              from us, his parents.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Being
              on tudong with our son shifted our understanding of the depth and beauty of
              what he has chosen to do with his life. The context of being in a Buddhist
              country and traveling by foot refined the awareness: the unbounded generosity
              toward his robes allowed us to see clearly that he represented a shared
              experience of virtue for laity and monastic alike, a gift to both. What we witnessed
              was never a give-and-take, but more like a give-and-give. All the great ajahns,
              or teachers, speak of monastic renunciation—the trainings to abandon evil,
              distraction, sensual pleasures, hindrances, and ignorance—as an offering. To
              watch how a light shone in people’s faces as they ran up to Tan Po with food,
              to see my son in his new role softly chant a blessing on the side of a busy
              street, to feel time stop and witness those on both sides create something
              intimate, shared, and sacred, brought tears to my eyes many times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tan
              Po is unwavering in earnestness when he asserts that he can’t imagine a more
              beautiful life than his present one. But mothers understandably gasp when I
              tell them I’m not allowed to hug my son. (My personal addendum to the rule: not
              allowed to hug him in public.) And coming to terms with Tan Po’s new life has
              been quite a challenge for his sister, Jamey. At first, she felt it as a stark
              desertion—no more brother to pal around with, no more sing-alongs, no more
              Thanksgivings or birthdays. No more Christmas presents to open together or
              jelly bean trails to follow to an Easter basket (we’ve kept up the cultural
              rituals of Christianity that Doug and I grew up with). Angry, she would taunt
              him instead of giving voice to her pain. But when she went to visit him on her
              own a few years after his ordination, she said, “Seeing him at the monastery
              was like seeing an animal in its natural habitat.” She couldn’t envision him
              doing anything else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              of Tan Po’s friends and relatives continue to feel abandoned, certain also that
              he’s wasting his true potential. Even though I angle into discussions with
              “It’s a calling! What healthy young 20-something would give up so much if it
              weren’t?” the bare fact stands that seclusion from normal society is central to
              a monastic’s mindfulness and practice, essential not only to learn to abide by
              hundreds of rules for living in community with his brother monks but also to
              follow that elusive, fragile spiritual thread. I am reminded of the first few
              lines of William Stafford’s “The Way It Is”: There’s a thread you follow. It
              goes among / things that change. But it doesn’t change. / People wonder what
              you are pursuing. Many still wonder what Tan Po pursues, but he can’t imagine a
              better life than one wherein cultivating inner goodness is what you do all day.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              arc of my relationship with my son over the past five years began with cheery
              if somewhat naive parental support for his decision, tinged with keen moments
              of letting go and a tentative faith that we’d eventually all find our footing.
              I believe we have, and he has. He writes and calls friends and relatives from
              time to time. He and his sister stay connected. We speak with Tan Po every
              other week for two hours or so about dharma. On our recent tudong, the Thai
              faithful honored us as practitioner-parents of a monk, showing us that the
              dharma is a shared home, spilling over with the goodness of its occupants. I
              had homed in on the contrasts between a monastery and lay life on our first
              visits to Thailand, but our tudong built a bridge between the two, ushering us
              through a door that our son opened wide, a way of being in the world with
              spirituality at its core for both monk and layperson. For Doug and me, there’s
              a growing recognition and astonishment that Tan Po is now leading the way, just
              as he did on tudong.</span></p>
