              <p>The concept of no-self or non-attachment is not hard to grasp, though I would argue that it is rather irrational. As a buddhist it would seem to me that you have understood this, then why aren't you considered enlightened? I mean, if Buddha sat under the Bo tree to understand something that has eluded man, and assuming he has communicated it correctly, then followers should also be able to be enlightened just like him. Isn't it pretty much a knowledge issue? The solution is "no-self", right?</p>

              <p>I think the swimming analogy is not appropriate at all. Swimming is a skill, not a cognitive thing. Moreover, we are talking about truth. The ability to swim is not  truth issue.

              <p>No-self does not deny sentience, awareness, cognizance. It however does mean that it would be inaccurate to assert and reify awareness into a self or cognizer, it is pure cognition without self. In realization, there is simply a moment of realization and recognition of what the nature of mind is, this does not require a seer/cognizer and there never was one.<br><br>The nature of mind is an inseparability of luminous clarity and emptiness. Because of its luminosity, which is pure Knowingness without which no experience can be seen or illuminated, the mind is able to perceive, see, hear, taste, smell... in fact this description is not right - there is no mind that 'sees' (as that would impute a seer and a seen) - rather, mind is just a label for that pure seeing, tasting, hearing, sensing, even as a mental sense of presence (as a thought) without a seer/hearer/be-er. Pure aliveness and clarity and knowingness and intelligence that is manifesting moment to moment in all experiences.<br><br>The luminous factor of the nature of mind is only one part, the other part is the empty aspect of our mind. As luminous and clear and vivid as mind is, manifesting as everything whatsoever, nonetheless no entity or selfhood can be pinned down in this luminous mind or experience. There is no soul, agent, perceiver, Self, apart from moment to moment experience - impermanent, dependently originated and self-less. Everything is empty of true graspable existence or self.<br><br>As a Lama, Tsultrim said:<br><br>"Mind has often been likened to a mirror, but the analogy goes only so far, because mirrors exist and mind doesn't, well let's say that one can touch mirrors. What existence means, particularly at these levels, would be a fruitful topic, but one that I will not cover. Also, mind doesn't really reflect phenomena, it is the phenomena themselves. This is covered further down in these 4 prajnas, but for clarity I thought I should mention that."<br><br>"Thusness' or "suchness" is what one feels with the experience of emptiness. It is a solid sense of being (yes, emptiness has a solid or one could say rich feeling). The luminescence of mind can be compared the the surface of a mirror. If the mirror is dirty it doesn't have a bright surface, and if mind is filled with obscuration its awareness is dimmed. With the experience of emptiness, phenomena become more vivid. It is said in the post that this confirms one's entrance into Zen. In the Vajrayana, this vividness of mind is called "osel" in Tibetan, and it is a sign that one has entered the Vajrayana."</p>

Everything is empty of true graspable existence or self.<br><br>As a Lama, Tsultrim said:<br><br>"Mind has often been likened to a mirror, but the analogy goes only so far, because mirrors exist and mind doesn't, well let's say that one can touch mirrors. What existence means, particularly at these levels, would be a fruitful topic, but one that I will not cover. Also, mind doesn't really reflect phenomena, it is the phenomena themselves. This is covered further down in these 4 prajnas, but for clarity I thought I should mention that."<br><br>"Thusness' or "suchness" is what one feels with the experience of emptiness. It is a solid sense of being (yes, emptiness has a solid or one could say rich feeling). The luminescence of mind can be compared the the surface of a mirror. If the mirror is dirty it doesn't have a bright surface, and if mind is filled with obscuration its awareness is dimmed. With the experience of emptiness, phenomena become more vivid. It is said in the post that this confirms one's entrance into Zen. In the Vajrayana, this vividness of mind is called "osel" in Tibetan, and it is a sign that one has entered the Vajrayana."</p>

              <p>We have been through this before, and as such I would only point out again that it is incoherent to speak of things like realisation or cognizance or awareness while denying a self or calling it an illusion of self, be it a contingent being like man or a necessary being like God. The human experience is that the self exists. Again I would point out that the self would have to exist for any denial of self to take place. Even to speak of an illusion of self would require that some self is having that illusion. Of course the reply would be that such are mere conventions or parlance, not ultimate truths. But I would then say that words communicate truths. The same language system is used to communicate both kinds of "truths".</p>

              <p>Hi Spnw07,</p>
              <p>just writing to add up on Point 3... about this afterlife
                  thingy..</p>
              <p>i think there is afterlife... only if the mind still have
                  attachment to the previous life... the very last thought propells
                  to the craving for another rebirth... and then followed by
                  suffering... in a cycle.</p>
              <p>but I'm sure Buddha doesn't want to talk whether he existed
                  after death, where is he etc... I searched Accesstoinsight and
                  there are plenty of suttas that stated clearly... e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html">Anuradha Sutta ?<br></a></p>
              <p>since all beings are formed by 5 aggregates... dependent
                  originated... there shouldn't have any speculation about whether
                  there is any existence or non-existence after death... is like
                  eternalistic or nihilistic views...?</p>

              <p>This Christian website is heading awry, hopefully it does not move into the direction of cult. Ought to be wise in explaining, otherwise, the Christian faith may be unwisely drawn into Theravada tradition :p Theravada basically only acknowledges Buddha Sakyamuni, no other buddha in Theravada sutta, similar to Christian only acknowledge God. In Mahayana, there are plentiful of buddhas because human alone are alot and there are other world system as well to accomodate science. These many other buddha worlds is in view of vow before their buddha fruition. Sakyamuni compassionate vow is established for samsara world to liberate suffering beings. In samsara, the suffering are alot more than other worlds as the beings in samsara lack clear understanding on the 5 aggregates of form and non forms, self, no self and emptiness :D</p>

              <p>There is orthodoxy and orthopraxy. I am referring to the former. One can make truth claims or statements about reality. e.g. life is an illusion or the universe is not real. The issue is whether this claim is true or whether there are good reasons to conclude it is true. While theory and practice is distinct, practice should flow from theory or at least confim or be consistent with the theory. For example, if the theory is that stepping on brake will stop the car, the practical aspect should reflect that.</p>
              <p>Re turning the other cheek with God's help. What is so funny about that? Are you thinking that we need God to physically turn our cheek the other way? If so, that would be laughing at your own strawman. What we mean is that our human nature is to return a slap for a slap. The Christian is asking for God's help to mold our character continuously to refrain from retaliation.</p>
              <p>Re the depth of illusion. The question that needs to be answered is this, is there an illusion in the first place?</p>
              <p>Frankly I take it as a compliment that you noted that my answers seems to come from the Bible and not of myself. The problem in churches today is that most believers do not have a Biblical worldview. As such they lack the certainty of the answers. You say my Biblical answers lack wisdom, but what wisdom are you talking about? Human wisdom? The Bible says that the wisdom of God is foolishness to man. How true! The ways of God are indeed higher than man. Man thinks that the strong prevails, but God uses the weak things to demonstrate strength.</p>
              <p>Re the flag and the wind. This is the fallacy of false dilemma. It is not either/or, but both! Both the flag and the wind moves.</p>

              <p>Thanks, that wasn't a helpful answer at all. It was a dodgeful one for sure though.</p>
              <p>I can read Chinese though not very well, which is why I asked you to translate. Does Buddhism requires all to learn Chinese before one can understand the essence of it? And can you understand Sanskrit? If not, what hope do most of us have? And if you cannot translate the essense of it, is it because you yourself does not understand it too?</p>
              <p>Consider the Bible, written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. It is translated into many languages around the world. In fact it is the most translated book in the world. Why? To communicate God's Word to people in their own language without requiring them to learn the languages in which it was written.</p>

              <p>nope it aint dodgeful at all, it is just telling you that the best way to understand that doesn't come from a translated version. If all you want is a half true understanding of anything, then go and read the translations then. Precisely cause i haven't read the sanskrit version, thats why i dont claim other religions wrong and buddhism the one true only and go around preaching pressing answers.</p>
              <p>It is translated because ppl cant read the hebrews aramaic and greek. But it doesn't mean reading a translated version made them much nearer than being further.</p>
              <p>if i tell you "impress"=å�°è±¡, how accurate is that? but assuming you dont understand english, you are going to take it that "impress"=å�°è±¡ while we know that it aint the same. So, how accurate can translation get? while it helps, it may not in certain circumstance. From personal experience,reading whatever that is taught in buddhism in chinese is way too different in english.</p>
              <p>Anyway that post aint quite meant for u... so yeap you probably dont have to know it.</p>

              <p>The purpose of translation is not to make you closer to God. Translations do not do such a thing at all. You have misconstrued the purpose and use of translation. Translation is merely to communicate one thing in the language of another. If one must know original languages to know the essence of the religion, then I submit to you that perhaps more tha 90% of religious people do not know the essence of their religion. I don't think you would agree to that.</p>

              <p>Frankly I take it as a compliment that you noted that my answers seems to come from the Bible and not of myself. The problem in churches today is that most believers do not have a Biblical worldview. As such they lack the certainty of the answers. You say my Biblical answers lack wisdom, but what wisdom are you talking about? Human wisdom? The Bible says that the wisdom of God is foolishness to man. How true! The ways of God are indeed higher than man. Man thinks that the strong prevails, but God uses the weak things to demonstrate strength.</p>

              <p>btw , in Buddhism, if a buddhist is like u, so clinging or obsessed with the dharma and start to discriminate or become bias in an extreme way, something like extremists, we can also call them a "hinayana", small vehicle, buddhism. they are too attached to the apparent buddhism but not the inner meaning of buddhism. they are like following next to Buddha, but in fact are far from Buddha. they do not see the real Buddha.</p>
