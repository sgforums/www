              <p>Most people feel that they are an independent separate Self distinct from their experiences, perceptions and action. They feel alienated, self-contracted, distant from the world as a result and they become attached to the sense of I, me, and mine. This is a root cause of delusion and attachment.<br><br>It can be realized that in reality, there never was a seer apart from the act of seeing/seen, a doer apart from an action, hearer apart from heard, etc.<br><br>The experience is one of at-oneness with everything but there is not even an 'I' left to 'feel' the at oneness. Instead there is just one act of perception, one action, happening as crystal clarity without any self, separation or division.<br><br>Athletes do sometimes feel this 'oneness' but only temporarily, even though intentionality is totally factored into their total exertion in action, there is no self consciousness but his entire being is exerted as that intentionality+action. After realization, that feeling can become sort of permanent. And total exertion becomes a natural path of practice.</p>

              <p>I can understand that sometimes people feel alienated or distant, but I think that's just how they are feeling. Feelings come and go and IMO are too flippant to reflect truth or reality. That said, regardless of such feelings I don't suppose people, when they do reflect during their sober moments, will separate their experiences from their very beings i.e. self.</p>
              <p>Re the point about experiencing at-oneness with everything. I think what needs to be established is really whether we are one with everything, some kind of monism? I think that sometimes some people do claim that they are experience "the moment" in time when everything seems to be "one" but again these would be personal-to-holder experiences. It's hard to quibble with experiences, if you know what I mean.</p>
              <p>I guess what I am trying to say is that feelings are not a good basis to judge the truth of a claim or belief.</p>

              <p>If something is false in the ultimate sense, then it is false, regardless of how one thinks it is true, or even if one calls it a conventional truth.</p>
              <p>From what you described, correct me if I am wrong but it seems that Buddhism tends to have a rather reductionistic view of existence.</p>

              <p>Just clicked on the weblink above and what caught me was the "I AM" claim. I suppose you would know that in the Bible God called Himself "I AM" which is also known as the tetragrammaton, the name by which God revealed Himself to Moses on Mt Sinai. What you would call an experience would be what in Christianity be God Himself. Jesus even called Himself "I AM" which the religious leaders saw clearly as a claim to being God.</p>

              <p>If I am not wrong, the article says that the Buddha set aside
                  the question of whether the self exists or not, i.e. refuses to
                  answer because the answer will lead to suffering and stress.
                  Personally I would take issue with a refusal to answer because the
                  consequences of the answer (whether leading to stress or suffering
                  or not) is distinct from the answer itself. One can always answer a
                  question with a yes or a no, provided one knows the answer.</p>

              <p>That depends on what is your question. If I cannot answer your question my answer would be, I don't know. It won't be that you cannot question God.</p>
              <p>But then again I would say that it is true that you cannot question ultimate authority because that's what it means to be ultimate. If you can question authority or make that ultimate authority obligated to you and subjected to you, then you are the ultimate authority who cannot be questioned, because there is nothing above ultimate.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I am of the view you can ask questions to God, but what you can't demand from God is that He must answer you. God is God. God owes no man anything. You do not owe your creation an answer. The decision to answer is entirely your prerogative. Even if man does not have the satisfaction of an answer, God remains God. That should be the humble attitude of man, which Job finally realises as we read in the OT book of Job.</p>

              <p>Oh I see. For the record I believe answers to these questions can be given. The issue is whether you wish to accept the answer. Speaking for myself, my style is to give answers based on what the Bible says, or what can be inferred from the Bible, and if the Bible does not explicitly teaches it, then my suggested answer must not contradict any part of the Bible. For example, your first question has an answer. In Colossians 1:15 it is written:</p>
              <p>"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation, for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him—all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers—<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all things were create through him and FOR him</span></strong>."</p>
              <p>So this answer really answers the question, "Why is there anything rather than nothing?" Why create, not just man, but anything at all for that matter?</p>
              <p>I recommend this website which you can get many answers as well.</p>

              <p>1) There is no creator. No one created you. There's no really "You" as there's no self and each of us is just combinations å› ç¼˜å�ˆå’Œ</p>
              <p>2) You can become a perfect person if you practice according to Buddha's teachings. We are "perfect" right from the start as our true nature (Buddha nature) is "perfect", however due to the 3 unwholesome roots or 3 poisons, greed, attachments and aversions etc. that we become sinners. Our true nature is neither good nor bad.</p>
              <p>3) No one can atone sins for another person. Your sins can be lighten if you repent sincerely.</p>
              <p>4) You can never live happily if you did not cease your greed, aversions, attachments etc.</p>

              <p>Wiki says that the conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.</p>
              <p>Would you like to clarify that further? It would seem that Buddhism holds that conventional truth can be false, but ultimate truth is..well...truth i.e. what is.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There will always be debates and arguments between different schools of thoughts in the same religion. Some feels that their interpretation of the teachings of the founder is more correct and representative of the founder. It is up to individual to decide for themselves which school they are more comfortable and at home with. Buddhism grows from a pluralistic form of teaching, then on to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Absolutism</span>, than Idealism and at the end stage in its history in India to Logic in its defense of the religion. In all these development, the core teachings of the Blessed One the Buddha is still there, except interpreted differently. It is a natural progression in the growth of the religion itself. If it has stay static in its original form, it would have attract only certain type of believers and the population of Buddhists in the world would certainly be smaller than it is now. As far as I am concern, there is no ultimate truth as to who is more correct. Pick the chose that one is comfortable with.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As pointed out in an earlier posting above, there is, in the conventional sense. Our thinking process is riddle with contradictions which is the way it works, it is dualistic in nature. Buddhist <span style="color: #ff0000;">Absolutism</span> implies that to know what reality is, one have to go beyond concepts and thoughts to intuitive experience and realization. That is where the Buddhist teaching of Emptiness comes in. </span></p>

              <p>My understanding is in Christianity, it is believed that every human is born sinful because of the sin committed by Adam and Eve. They disobeyed the command of God, passes on to all human making them sinner by birth. So; “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners". It is not so much of the sins committed due to being immoral but the original sin or ancestral sin from Adam and Eve, the inheritance of sin. Jesus was crucified to save us from our original sin.</p>

              When relating to Buddhism, we just have focus on suffering, more rightly, our existence being unsatisfactory owing to impermanence. Cultivating ourselves when attempt reach Nirvana or Bliss, alongside as we unclinging ourselves to conditionality of "Self" or "I", we will find less affected to issues that we reacted negatively. We have in fact become less unhappy! As for pleasurable activities, while we may enjoy them, but we do not get attached knowing  it is impermanent.
              Thus as we realise the wisdom in Buddhist practice that faith develops!
              "Self" is  "I" reference, or "Me-ness", "Soul-consciousness", "Atman" which aspect we choose to identify ourselves. It is simply an identity which deal with all aspects of our life.
              As long we cling to this frame of mind we are doomed to stuck in a rut which we are unable to get out of  (samsara). It is extremely difficult to get out off, because of centering on "I". Perceived gain and profit is always directly or indirectly in relation to "I".

              "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want".
                  Each time when someone accept Christ, an repent his sins he/she is said to be reborn as, by Divine Grace all their sins, including the Original  Sin is washed away!
                  Yet despite accepting Christ, how many are still found wanting and be reborn to be a unsinner? So accepting Christ does'nt mean a person able stop temptations  or stop commiting sins.
                  When the pious succumbs and repents and succumbs, one develops a guilt complex.  Suffering to others and oneself(inner torment) do not end until truly able to repent! Kinda make the reborn thing redundant!

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhist do not visit unwholesome activity as "Sins", but as activity which causes suffering. However, wholesome  activity are not seen as useless, therefore one is encouraged to do good as it contribute to the individual's betterment! Every kind of considerate activity serves not only himself but others also!</div>

              With karma, rebirth at work, anybody can either damn themselves or redeem themselves, thus nobody shall  condemn themselves to eternal damnation!
              Thus is the unconditional love and compassion of Buddhism,  if even if one does not understand "No-Self", you simply reap what you sow, no more no less.

            <div class='col-md body'>One the most effective methods a Christian can do is pray to God and asking repentance. It is very similiar to  Buddhist way of repentance and repairing  one's karma. The key word is sincerity!  It makes one to be mindful of one's past, present and future action. But not being accountable for one's action and not understanding root cause, one will still continue to suffer and cause sufferings to others!</div>

              <p>Quote from broinchrist"1. You have understood correctly! Yes, on his own man can NEVER earn enough merit to be made right with God. That's the reason why sacrifices are required throughout the OT. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Another being must take your sins and atone for them so you can live. But the blood of bulls and sheep are only temporary and a shadow. Only a perfect sinless man can make that perfect sacrifice that forever satisfy the holiness and justice of God. Which is why the Bible teaches that salvation is by grace and not by works, so that no one can boast."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">i am against the use of animal sacrifices or human sacrifices because it is too cruel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can the christians call themselves righteous by pushing the blame on an innocent being and then profiteering from the death of others?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">i would rather follow buddhism and avoid sinning rather than to follow christianity and use other people as sacrifice.</span></p>

              <p>Hi Spnw07,</p>
              <p>just writing to add up on Point 3... about this afterlife thingy..</p>
              <p>i think there is afterlife... only if the mind still have attachment to the previous life... the very last thought propells to the craving for another rebirth... and then followed by suffering... in a cycle.</p>
              <p>but I'm sure Buddha doesn't want to talk whether he existed after death, where is he etc... I searched Accesstoinsight and there are plenty of suttas that stated clearly... e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html">Anuradha Sutta ?<br></a></p>
              <p>since all beings are formed by 5 aggregates... dependent originated... there shouldn't have any speculation about whether there is any existence or non-existence after death... is like eternalistic or nihilistic views...?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I'm not sure if the Christian's terminology of 'afterlife' corresponds to the Buddhist term of 'rebirth', maybe someone else knows more about this.</p>
              <p>I have read such answers from various suttas too. However, I do think it's alright to say our existence after death is not permanent as we have to go through cycles of rebirth till we are finally spiritually liberated. Just for the benefit of allowing beginner Buddhists or people from other faiths to have some form of simple understanding.</p>

              <p>It shows the brainwaves of meditative states including witnessing, non-dual, etc.<br><br>It would be interesting to get someone who has attained Nirvana to do a brainwave test. I believe the results will tell and correspond to the Buddhist descriptions of what Nirvana actually entails.<br><br>A perpetual state of no suffering, no mental afflictions, bliss and clarity.</p>
