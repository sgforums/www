              <p>Subject and object may be spoken merely for convenience of communication, putting very gross labels is necessary for communication. It does not necessarily imply that there is a true inherent existence of subject or object. Anyway, we are not using laws of logic or dualistic concepts to reject dualistic concepts. We are just challenging, investigating, and pointing out at the fallacy of inherent and dualistic concepts that we have been employing in our perception and communication in day to day living. We do not create new concepts, we simply investigate and expose our existing concepts/views.<br><br>For example, we know there is no inherently, independently, unchangingly existing thing called a "weather" that can be pinned down as an entity.</p>
              <p>But for convenience we say "how is the weather like tomorrow"? "Weather" is simply a convenient label or convention for pragmatic purposes of communication. It does not correspond to a solid reality. 'Weather' is empty of any inherent core or essence that can be pinned down or located anywhere, it is merely a name imputed on an ever-changing process of clouds forming and parting, rain falling, wind blowing, lightning, snow, etc etc.</p>
              <p>The same goes for 'car' and 'self'. Even though there is no inherently, solidly existing 'car', we speak of car for convenience. No inherently existing car can be pinned down or established, merely an aggregated appearance that functions interdependently as a gestalt.<br><br>See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2009/03/conceptions-of-self-in-western-and.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2009/03/conceptions-of-self-in-western-and.html</a></p>
              <p><span>It is important to realize what is meant by the “self” rejected by the Buddha as illusory. Not only are human beings declared to lack a soul or self, but so is everything else: rivers, mountains, this paper, and your pencil, all lack a separate self. What this means is that they cannot have any existence except in terms of the interconnected net of causal conditions that made their existence possible. All things (including human beings) are composites, in other words, they are composed of parts, and have no real existence other than as temporary (impermanent) collections of parts. They are essentially patterns, configurations, or <em>Gestalt</em>en rather than objectively existing separate entities. They possess no separate essence, self, or soul that could exist by itself, apart from the component parts and conditions.</span></p>
              <p><span>Consider, for example, an automobile. Does it have an essence or a “soul” when separated from its component parts? Does it have any real existence apart from its parts? One could try the following mental exercise. Removing one of the tires of the car, one could ask oneself, is this the car? Successively taking away the windshield, a door, a piston, a bolt, the radiator cap, and continuing until the last piece of metal, plastic, glass, or rubber has been removed, one would never find the part which, if removed, transforms what remains into a non-car. Such part, if found, would have represented the essence or the “soul” of the car, and yet it was nowhere to be found. Now all we have is a pile of parts—where is the car? At which point did the car disappear? If we reflect carefully we are left with the realization that <em>there never was a car there</em>—all that was there was a conglomerate of parts temporarily connected in a certain way, so as to result in a particular mode of functioning, and “car” was just a convenient label to designate this working arrangement. The word “car” is nothing but a label for the <em>gestalt</em> formed by the constituent parts, and although it is true (as realized by Wertheimer and the other <em>Gestaltists</em>) that the whole is more than the sum of the parts (one cannot drive sitting on any of the separate parts, or on a random heap of them, but driving is possible when one puts them together in a certain way), it is equally true that a <em>gestalt</em> cannot continue to exist when separated from its parts. The <em>gestalt</em>, the “whole,” cannot exist by itself; it does not have a separate self or “soul.”</span></p>
              <p><span>But what about a person? According to Buddhist psychology, what we call a “person” is the composite of five groups of elements or <em>skandha</em>s. The <em>skandha</em>s are form, feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness. Just as an automobile is a temporary collection of car parts, a person is a temporary arrangement of these five aggregates or <em>skandha</em>s. There is no separate, independent self or soul that would be left if we removed form (which includes the body), feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness. While these aggregates are together, the functioning <em>gestalt</em> we call a person exists; if they are removed, the <em>gestalt</em> ceases to be. For this reason, the self can be said to be “empty” of reality when separated from its component aggregates— a view of the self radically different from Western perspectives. But it is not only the self that is empty, and cannot exist by itself; the <em>skandha</em>s themselves are also empty.</span></p>
              <p><span>The five <em>skandha</em>s, like everything else, are dependently arisen, and cannot exist by themselves. Take the form of one’s body, for example. What would remain of it, if one removed one’s perception of it, one’s feelings about it, one’s impulses to act on it or with it, and one’s conscious awareness of it? Form is empty of reality when separated from perceptions, feelings, impulses, and consciousness. And what about feelings? They also cannot exist by themselves. Feelings are feelings about something, about one’s body, one’s perceptions, one’s impulses, one’s state of consciousness. The same is true of the remaining <em>skandha</em>s—each one is composed of the other four. They are in a state of interdependent co-origination, they inter-are (Hanh, 1988).</span></p>
              <p><span>The teaching of “dependent origination” is at the core of the Buddha’s teaching or <em>Dharma</em>. In its simplest expression, dependent origination is a law of causality that says “<em>this is, because that is; this is not, because that is not; when this arises, that arises; when this ceases, that ceases.</em>” Despite the apparent simplicity of this formulation, it is a farreaching principle, that leaves nothing untouched, and, in fact, causally connects everything in the universe, for it implies that all phenomena, whether they be external objective events or internal subjective experiences, come into existence depending on causes and conditions without which they could not be. These causes and conditions can themselves be either internal mental states or external events.</span></p>
              <p><span>Borrowing an example from Hanh (1988), consider a piece of paper: it can be, because a tree was, since the tree had to be in order to be cut down to make the paper. This same piece of paper, is also because there was rain and sunshine, for without them the tree could not have grown. The same is true for the seed and the fertile soil, and for the logger who cut the tree down, for without them, the tree would not have been there for the paper to be. But for the logger to be, his parents had to be, and the food they consumed, and all the conditions that made their lives possible, and those lives upon which theirs in turn depended, and on, and on. There is no end to this causal interconnectedness. Everything in the universe is connected to this piece of paper through a web of causal conditions. If the component conditions are regarded as elements, we can say that this piece of paper is composed of non-paper elements, or, in other words, that conditions other than the paper itself are necessary for the paper to exist. Stated differently, the paper cannot exist by itself; it lacks a separate self, soul, or essence. The same is true for anything else in the universe, including a person. It is also true of cognitive or mental states, because for every emotion, for every perception, for every thought, there are necessary causal conditions without which they would not have come into being. Everything is dependently arisen, everything exists only if the necessary conditions are there. This means that nothing is ever truly independent or separate from everything else.</span></p>

              <p>I agree that while it does not necessarily imply that there is a true inherent existence of subject or object, neither does it necessarily imply there is none. And the word in dispute would be "inherent" which I suspect could be subjected to equivocation.</p>
              <p>The word "weather" is used to describe the conditions like raining, snowing, hot, cold etc etc. I have yet come across anyone who is of sound mind who thinks that weather is a thing, it is not. Since no one attributes such a notion to weather, why talk as if people do? But I have yet come across anyone who thinks that a car is not a car or does not exist when he has just driven it and parked it. And it surely doesn't work when your car gets clamped or you get a parking violation ticket.</p>
              <p>I think I understand your point about dependent origination. But it is infinite regress and not an answer if you do not have a necessary being. Which is where God comes into the picture. A self-existent, independent being, eternal, spiritual being, who is the source of all that exists but who Himself is not dependent on any other. Instead of there being no-self or each one recognising himself as "I am", there is a God who exists eternally and who is known as "I AM", through whom an by whom all things are made, in heaven and on earth i.e. the universe.</p>

The stresses of life is the result of our neurotic relationship with our experience, our fixation with giving experiences labels (nothing wrong) but then treating them as fixed in time, treating them to belong to someone, immune to interaction from their surrounding. </p>

              <p>I agree that we live in a world of conventions i.e. agreed or generally accepted norms and standards. But it still leaves the question open, where do you draw the line? All words are convention. If so, how can you talk about ultimate truth or reality without using conventions, and without begging the question or engaging in special pleading for your views?</p>
              <p>If you experience a headache yesterday, what's wrong with identifying that you actually had a headache yesterday? There would be a cause, or causes, for why you had that headache but it would be incorrect to say that the headache did not happen. Yes, the headache is not an entity, but it is simply to describe the state of pain or the experience of pain you felt in your head.</p>
              <p>You affirmed the statement I provided as example as false. So what does it mean to say that an object or subject is emptiness? And is it meaningful to talk about experiencing a self?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am not saying that in the blind men analogy the narrator is God. What I am trying to communicate is that objective truth exists, and that it is independent of our views about it.</p>

              <p>It is interesting the number of times the word "yourself" was

              is always inconsistent with itself. Think of the following

              <p>Re the point about the sun and the car. I would say that the
              problem is in trying to deconstruct things or to engage in some
              kind of reductionism as a worldview. Yes, a car is the sum of it
              parts and taken apart I do not have a car. So I won't call the
              unassembled parts a car, any more than I would call a bagful of
              alphabet letters a novel. We should call things as they are and not
              deconstruct for the sake of deconstructing. The unassembled parts
              of a car in a workshop is just as real as a completed car in

              <p>It is not contradictory because Jui is using 'self' in a conventional manner, he has never implied that there is a truly existing, independent self. He is only rejecting a view of self that has ultimate, inherent, unchanging, independent existence. We do not need to reject the usage of conventional self as a label for communication just like we do not need to reject the word/imputation 'weather' for convenience.<br><br>Re-read this: <br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html</a></p>
              <h3>Would an arahant say "I" or "mine"?</h3>
              <p>Other devas had more sophisticated queries. One deva, for example, 
              asked the Buddha if an arahant could use words that refer to a self:</p>
              <blockquote> "Consummate with taints destroyed,<br> One who bears his final body,<br> Would he still say 'I speak'?<br> And would he say 'They speak to me'?" </blockquote>
              <p>This deva realized that arahantship means the end of rebirth and 
              suffering by uprooting mental defilements; he knew that arahants have no
               belief in any self or soul. But he was puzzled to hear monks reputed to
               be arahants continuing to use such self-referential expressions.</p>
              <p>The Buddha replied that an arahant might say "I" always aware of the merely pragmatic value of common terms:</p>
              <blockquote> "Skillful, knowing the world's parlance,<br> He uses such terms as mere expressions." </blockquote>
              <p>The deva, trying to grasp the Buddha's meaning, asked whether an 
              arahant would use such expressions because he is still prone to conceit.
               The Buddha made it clear that the arahant has no delusions about his 
              true nature. He has uprooted all notions of self and removed all traces 
              of pride and conceit:</p>
              <blockquote> "No knots exist for one with conceit cast off;<br> For him all knots of conceit are consumed.<br> When the wise one has transcended the conceived<br> He might still say 'I speak,'<br> And he might say 'They speak to me.'<br> Skillful, knowing the world's parlance,<br> He uses such terms as mere expressions."

              <p>Why would being clamped etc imply an inherently existing essence? None of that implies an ultimate essence either. It does however prove that the law of inter-dependent origination works. Via inter-dependent origination, a conglomerate, a gestalt results in a function called 'driving', and such a functional conglomeration is being imputed as a 'car', and due to many necessary reasons, human laws are enacted upon the 'imputed car'.</p>
              <p>What I'm saying is that 99.999% of the world population has not realized a fundamental truth, and they are living in a delusion, the delusion of an 'I' that is driving their suffering and cyclic existence. If they knew better they would never have thought that 'I' and 'things' have any thingness at all.<br><br>And this can be directly investigated and realized to have never been. It is just a false notion that can be exposed as a false belief, just like the notion that the sun revolves around the earth or that the earth is flat, or that santa claus is real, can be investigated and exposed.<br><br>I also understand your view about I AM and the ground of being, however I would add that Buddhism is unique among all other religions in that it accepts infinite regress of the stream of causality without an ultimate beginning, it teaches it, and it does not present itself as a problem in our teaching. <br><br>The Buddha:<br><br>"At Savatthi.

Instead everything is a gestalt that dependently originates.</strong> We are not denying experience (we are not nihilists), we are simply rejecting a solid view of core-essence in self and phenomena. This allows us to experience the world as fluid, dynamic, interdependently manifesting from moment to moment, which is the true nature of phenomena: ever-changing, empty of a self and dependently arisen. As Thusness puts it in 2005: "Viewing things as solid entities and categorizing them as 'this' or 'that' is due to the poverty of our thinking mechanism, it is not reality."<br><br>As I wrote before:<br><em><br>Emptiness is not a thing, but emptiness is also not a nothing. By saying 'emptiness is not ...' is simply to negate the false conceptions of what the Buddhist teachings on Emptiness is about.<br><br>Shunyata (Emptiness) means whatever appears are empty of independent or inherent existence, be it a sound, a form, or any other phenomena. This is because it is the 'interconnectedness' that give rise to the sound or experience (The person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, ears, etc, i.e. the conditions).<br><br>Thus, whatever arises interdependently is vividly clear and luminous, but empty of any *independent* or *inherent* existence. This is not the same as nothing or nihilism.<br><br>Nagarjuna:<br><br>Whatever is dependently co-arisen,<br>That is explained to be emptiness.<br>That, being a dependent designation,<br>Is itself the middle way.

              <p>Words are convention. Convention does not correspond to ultimate reality. So when does words convey ultimate reality? Let's just be clear that I am not saying that words = reality. I am saying that words convey truths. If we don't use words, labels, conventions then we are not communicating. I think when we communicate we use the plain sense method. The laws of logic are applicable. When we talk about a dog, the law of identity says we are talking about a dog, not a cat, or a non-dog that has been deconstructed.</p>
              <p>You said you reject an unchanging, independent, separate, existence that can be established, pinned down, located, as some core essence of self and things. But that depends on exactly what is the object or subject in question, isn't it? The God of the Bible is unchanging, independent, separate, whose existence that can be established but not pinned down or located since God is Spirit, and who is the source and origination of all things in the universe, seen and unseen.<br></p>

              <p>It is not contradictory because Jui is using 'self' in a conventional manner, he has never implied that there is a truly existing, independent self. He is only rejecting a view of self that has ultimate, inherent, unchanging, independent existence. We do not need to reject the usage of conventional self as a label for communication just like we do not need to reject the word/imputation 'weather' for convenience.<br><br>Re-read this:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html</a></p>
              <h3>Would an arahant say "I" or "mine"?</h3>
              <p>Other devas had more sophisticated queries. One deva, for example, asked the Buddha if an arahant could use words that refer to a self:</p>
              <p>This deva realized that arahantship means the end of rebirth and suffering by uprooting mental defilements; he knew that arahants have no belief in any self or soul. But he was puzzled to hear monks reputed to be arahants continuing to use such self-referential expressions.</p>
              <p>The Buddha replied that an arahant might say "I" always aware of the merely pragmatic value of common terms:</p>
              <p>The deva, trying to grasp the Buddha's meaning, asked whether an arahant would use such expressions because he is still prone to conceit. The Buddha made it clear that the arahant has no delusions about his true nature. He has uprooted all notions of self and removed all traces of pride and conceit:</p>

              <p>But I think the point is that Buddhists need to show that that there is really no such thing as a truly existing, independent self. It would be perfectly fine to reject a view of self that has ultimate, inherent, unchanging, independent existence if we are talking about finite beings like us. But how does this applies to God who by definition does not fall into this category?</p>

              <p>Why would being clamped etc imply an inherently existing essence? None of that implies an ultimate essence either. It does however prove that the law of inter-dependent origination works. Via inter-dependent origination, a conglomerate, a gestalt results in a function called 'driving', and such a functional conglomeration is being imputed as a 'car', and due to many necessary reasons, human laws are enacted upon the 'imputed car'.</p>
              <p>What I'm saying is that 99.999% of the world population has not realized a fundamental truth, and they are living in a delusion, the delusion of an 'I' that is driving their suffering and cyclic existence. If they knew better they would never have thought that 'I' and 'things' have any thingness at all.<br><br>And this can be directly investigated and realized to have never been. It is just a false notion that can be exposed as a false belief, just like the notion that the sun revolves around the earth or that the earth is flat, or that santa claus is real, can be investigated and exposed.<br><br>I also understand your view about I AM and the ground of being, however I would add that Buddhism is unique among all other religions in that it accepts infinite regress of the stream of causality without an ultimate beginning, it teaches it, and it does not present itself as a problem in our teaching.<br><br>The Buddha:<br><br>"At Savatthi. There the Blessed One said: "From an inconstruable (sic) beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. What do you think, monks: Which is greater, the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time — crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — or the water in the four great oceans?"<br><br>"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the tears we have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time — crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans."<br><br>"Excellent, monks. Excellent. It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.<br><br>"This is the greater: the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time — crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans.<br><br>"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a mother.

              <p>People would not talk about the essence of a car or its inherent existence in normal conversation. Either the car exists or it does not. Why not see things as they really are instead of trying to deconstruct everything but yet living as though nothing is being deconstructed?</p>
              <p>If 99.9999% are living in a delusion, then what would exclude that small percentage from being the exception? How does one even know that everyone is deluded except him? What is the evidence that virtually everyone is living in a delusion? False notions of the sun revolving around the earth or a flat earth can be proven simply because the truth can be discovered somehow. That the earth is round is not a mere conventional truth, it is objectively true that the earth is round. We can test this. But there is no test or evidence to show that everyone's self is a delusion.</p>
              <p>The problem with an infinite regress is that it answers nothing and explains nothing.  You can have a being who is infinite like God, but you cannot have an endless chain of cause and effects. Given that nothing in the universe is the cause of its own existence, the universe cannot be explained by an infinite regress of causation. If there were infinite regress then the series would not have gotten started in the first place. The universe is here, no one doubts that so there must either be a first cause for the universe that accounts for the chain of causation that we see everywhere in the world or the universe has eternally existed. But then we already know the universe did not always existed.</p>

                                                  who are enlightened). Buddhist cosmology teaches that this universe

              <p>Perhaps the issue is over the following:</p>
              <p>1. Does anything exist?</p>
              <p>2. Why does something exist instead of nothing?</p>
              <p>3. Contingent vs necessary existence.</p>
              <p>For #3 it seems to me that Buddhism is teaching that it is a misconception that things possess necessary existence i.e. inherent existence, where things exists independently apart from causes and conditions arising. That's why there is no inherent essence for car or cup. For Christian theism, only God is a necessary being, all others being contingent. So I would agree with you that all created beings/things have no independent or inherent existence by themselves, but this does not apply to God who is a necessary being. I may or may not exist, thus I am a contingent being. But God cannot not exist or else nothing would exist. But since something exists, contingency cannot go on forever. I don't consider myself an expert philosopher but I think this line of argument makes good sense.</p>

              <h3>2.8 Monotheism</h3>
              <h4>This is the big one, the view that concerns most westerners. There is a long and venerable history of discussion between the monotheistic tradition and Buddhism. This dialogue between the two traditions often centers on whether or not at core these two traditions have a common understanding. The need for this dialogue appears because at a certain obvious level Buddhism simply does not have a supreme being, what the monotheistic tradition generally means by God.</h4>
              <h4>I distinguish two components of ultimacy that are unique to the monotheistic tradition. Given that the monotheistic tradition believes in the existence of only one God, the monotheistic tradition conceives of God as the ultimate; furthermore God in this tradition is the creator of all existence and also bears moral responsibility for the activities which occur in this existence.</h4>
              <h4>Both of these components are absent from the Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist tradition lacks a being who has created existence. Instead, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation, Buddhism conceives of existence as always existing, without beginning and without end. Furthermore, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation, there is no specific locus of creation, no specific being is responsible for bringing existence into existence. Rather, creativity is an aspect of all existing things and therefore the source of existence is the things of existence, spread out over all of existence, throughout all space, throughout all time.</h4>
              <h4>John Reynolds, among western scholars I am familiar with, has written with clarity on this issue:</h4>
              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation, is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly to this discussion:</h4>
              <h4>Both of the above quoted passages are rooted in the understanding of existence as a causal matrix, the view of Intedependent Transformation. It is somewhat astonishing to think of God as deluded, as Reynolds suggests. God thinks he has created this world system because, due to his karma, he was the first conscious being in this world system. Unaware of his past karma which created the conditions for his rebirth in this world system, and not observing any other conscious beings in this world system, God then concludes that he is the creator of this world system. Unaware that there are other world systems, incalculably numerous, God/Ishvara concludes that he is the creator of all of existence.</h4>
              <h4>It takes some time to take in all the implications of such a world view. It is breathtaking in scope and rich in implications. One of the implications is that being reborn as God is not, from a Buddhist perspective, a fortunate rebirth. It is not a rebirth that will lead to liberation, to <em>nirvana</em>, and the cessation of all sorrow because such a rebirth re-enforces the idea that there is something that exists independently, and it is this very idea/belief/feeling that is the source of sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>It might seem that this is the end of the story; Buddhism doesn’t believe in a creator Deity that bears moral responsibility for existence while the monotheistic tradition has this view at its core. The two traditions, therefore, diverge.</h4>
              <h4>However, God has many names and many meanings and Interdependent Transformation has many facets. Though the view of Interdependent Transformation does lead to a view of existence that in some respects differs from that of the monotheistic tradition, we should not stop at this conclusion. I have previously mentioned in the discussion on the basic implications of Intedependent Transformation that this core view of the Buddha means that all things exist dependently. Because the monotheistic tradition regards God as the creator of all existing things and of existence itself, the monotheistic tradition views all things as existing dependently, as in a totally dependent state. From this perspective, the perspective of dependence, the Buddhist and Monotheistic tradition share a common insight into the transcendent nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h4>Or take the view that God is love. It is out of God’s love that existence emerges. Existence is an expression of the generosity and benign nature of God. In the Buddhist tradition it is the realization that all things exist interdependently that gives rise to the blossoming of the compassionate heart. Love and Compassion are always present, but they are covered over by ignorance, self-concern, and distraction. I think that these two insights are very close for they both proclaim that in some sense love and compassion are the true nature of existence, that love and compassion blossom when we comprehend the transcendental.</h4>
              <h4>What I am suggesting is that even if I put aside the idea of a Creator Being, even if I put aside the idea of a Being who bears moral responsibility for existence, there are still significant, broad areas for dialogue between the two traditions because there is more to the idea of God than the idea of a Creator. From a Buddhist perspective, the most important aspects might lie outside of the Creator view.</h4>
              <h4>How do we access this broader understanding that lies at the core of the monotheistic tradition? I would suggest using those traditions centered on positive theology. Positive theology is that theology which explores the Divine Names and Attributes of God. For example, Dionysius the Areopagite wrote a theological work called <em>The Divine Names</em>. I think it would be an excellent place to start making such a comparison. For example, Dionysius writes:</h4>
              <h4>Now, turn to the Buddhist tradition and uncover the names that the Buddha in the Discourses uses for <em>nirvana</em>. He uses such terms as the “cessation of suffering”, “the non-clinging”, “peace”, “serenity”, “the lovely”, “the unconditioned”, “love”, “the unborn”, “the deathless”, etc.. Just as the core view of the monotheistic tradition is multi-faceted, so also the ultimate goal and core notion of the Buddhist tradition has many facets and many names. Once I move away from a fixation on the idea of God as a creator of existence, I am actually able to find a lot of similarity between these core views, many overlaps. It is useful to compare these two because how they arrive at these core understandings, such as dependence, differs, but often the core understandings themselves are amazingly similar. Thus, both traditions are mutually enriched by broadening their understanding.</h4>
              <h4>This is not the place to go into a systematic treatment of these two core views. It would require a book in and of itself. I believe what would be required is to compare and contrast the facets of ultimacy that each tradition has lived with down through the centuries. In addition to comparing and contrasting, I would also suggest comprehending how each tradition arrives at this understanding.</h4>
              <h4>I believe the result of such a project would produce a mosaic of overlapping and divergent understandings. From the perspective of a particular facet X, the two traditions have a shared view. From the perspective of facet Y, the two traditions diverge. From the persective of how they arrive at the same view X, there will also appear similarities and contrasts. When engaging in this project it is also important to keep in mind that monotheism is not a uniform tradition; it is actually more accurate to say “monotheisms”, and the same applies to Buddhism. The personalism of Christianity, for example, is something not shared by Judaism or Islam. Similarly, the view of the ontological status of suffering is quite different in different Buddhist traditions. Though this complicates the task, I do not consider it an insurmountable obstacle as long as one maintains a broad focus.</h4>
              <h4>This may seem like a lot of work, but I believe the results of such a project would be an ability to speak clearly to each other, from the views that each tradition holds, and come to a genuine and deep mutual understanding and appreciation. A good way to start such a project would be to compare two specific core texts, such as <em>The Divine Names</em> with something like the <em>Udana</em> in the Buddhist tradition. This may seem to narrow the focus from the broad focus I just suggested. However, the virtue of taking two specific works and comparing them is that it grounds the investigation in a specific work and tradition so that it reduces mere speculation.</h4>
              <h4>The dialogue between monotheism and Buddhism has been going on for a long time. I believe such an exchange can prove fruitful for both traditions. I would hope that such an exchange of views could be expanded to include other traditions as well, such as the western philosophical tradition, the secular humanist tradition, and the many spiritual traditions in the world today. With a good heart, mutual respect, and the capacity to perceive all people as equal, such an endeavor will help all concerned.</h4>

              <p>actually, ‘suffering’ as in birth, old age, illness, and death, is in line with impermance and Impersonality. it's real and universal, and it's as ultimate as Impermanence and Impersonality.</p>

              <p>Three Universal Characteristics ä¸‰æ³•å�°</p>
              <p>A characteristic is a fact which tells us something about the nature of a things. If a fact is sometimes connected with a things and sometimes not, then it is not a characteristic and will not help us very much to understand the nature of that thing. Heat, for example, is a fact. Heat is not characteristic of water, as water is not always hot. The heat of water depends upon other factors like sun or an electric stove. But heat is a characteristic of fire because fire is always hot and heat of fire does not depend on any other factors. Heat is always connected with fire and tells us something about the nature of fire. When the Buddha taught that there are three characteristics of facts of existence. They are generally found in all that exists and so they can tell us something about the nature of existence. The three characteristics of existence taught by the Buddha are Impermanence, Suffering and Impersonality.</p>

              <p>I agree that we live in a world of conventions i.e. agreed or
              generally accepted norms and standards. But it still leaves the
              question open, where do you draw the line? All words are
              convention. If so, how can you talk about ultimate truth or reality
              without using conventions, and without begging the question or
              engaging in special pleading for your views?</p>
              <p>If you experience a headache yesterday, what's wrong with
              identifying that you actually had a headache yesterday? There would
              be a cause, or causes, for why you had that headache but it would
              be incorrect to say that the headache did not happen. Yes, the
              headache is not an entity, but it is simply to describe the state
              of pain or the experience of pain you felt in your head.</p>
              <p>You affirmed the statement I provided as example as false. So
              what does it mean to say that an object or subject is emptiness?
              And is it meaningful to talk about experiencing a self?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am not saying that in the blind men analogy the
              narrator is God. What I am trying to communicate is that objective
              truth exists, and that it is independent of our views about it.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry but I don't understand why we were still on the topic of establishing whether things exist/existed here. I could've sworn that I've stated that things exist and given examples of them actually being able to cause and effect change. Actually, to me the very fact that we use words to describe something "ultimate" is already a problem, since it's already one step removed from "ultimate". Just to be sure we're even talking about the same thing, the "ultimate truth" here is used like this: "yeah that car exists but ultimately it's.....". But maybe the word "ultimate" used is actually not proper, or something.</p>
              <p>Emptiness just means that an object, event or experience exists through causes. While nothingness is referred here as object, event or experience not even existing.</p>
              <p>With regards to realising the "you" part of the topic, the precise problem that buddhism is trying to solve is that people act like they've experienced a self, which is considered a delusion. So it's definitely meaningful since we're talking about buddhism here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that's all I have to say about the matter, not sure if you've got anything useful from our exchange, but it seems like your problems are better replied by the senior members of the forum so I hope we are able to eventually establish some common ground. In fact it seems like we're doing that already.</p>
              <p>If you don't mind though, can you help me by pointing out parts where I'm "engaging in special pleading for my views"? Unfortunately I don't quite understand that part. Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Agreeable with what you said to the extent that suffering is contingent. Only living and conscious beings suffer. So what does it mean when someone says "I am suffering" yet there is no "I" or self?</p>
              <p>Again if the point is that you and I do not have independent existence, that I agree. We won't be alive if our parents did not meet and fell in love and got married and had sexual relations and then conceived us etc etc. Neither would we be alive if there is no air or food or water to sustain us. Our continued physical existence is dependent on many factors. This is not a matter of dispute as far as I am concerned. What I am saying is that even then it does not negate the existence of "self". Just because we are contingent beings does not make us any less real or that our self or existence is an illusion.</p>

              <p>Indeed. But Heart Sutra says 'no birth, no old age, no illness and no death'... however this does not deny birth, old age, illness or death. It is not a nihilistic denial. This is why Buddhism is still concerned with soteriology, with suffering and the release from suffering.<br><br>It may be true that in the dream there is no inherently existing tiger, yet the experience/appearance of suffering and fear in the dream, though illusory and empty, nonetheless cannot be denied. In short: although dreams and suffering are equally unreal, they appear due to karmic traces and propensities and this cannot be denied.</p>

              <p>I guess the reason why I am not yet over the existence issue is because of the confounding use of "conventional" and "ultimate" in relation to truth or reality.</p>
              <p>A car either exists or it does not. To speak of whether it conventionally or ultimately exists is to my mind a rather incoherent and illogical way of looking at it. Perhaps "emptiness" itself is not an appriopriate choice of word! Since it is meant to describe that things which exists are dependent on others, I would think the best choice of word is "contingent". Less confusing I think.</p>
              <p>You said that self is a delusion, but have you thought that perhaps it is precisely because it is not a delusion that we speak in terms of self? Again I do not hold the delusion that I am independent of anything for my existence. I don't think people think like that. We see ourselves as individuals, you, me, him, her, etc but not people who are independent of any causes. If there is such a person then he is indeed deluded. All you need to wake this person up is to deprive him of food and water!</p>
              <p>Special pleading basically means making exceptions for yourself, as in "what you are speaking is conventional truths but what I am speaking is ultimate truths" or that "99.999% of people is deluded but not me."</p>

              <p>1. A dream has no tangible existence, if that's what you mean. The same with a thought or an experience. But they are real nonetheless, even if it can only be verified by you since no one can take your dream or thought to examine it and test it. Still, there is an "I" or self to have a dream or thought. Having flesh and bone is not a conventional truth, don't you agree? One can also say that life is like a dream or a box of chocolate, but that's different from saying that life IS a dream or that it is indeed a box of chocolate.</p>
              <p>2. The law of identity applies when we talk about objects like red flower. Either the flower is red or it is not. It cannot be red and not-red in the same sense at the same time. Scientists will tell you that the rose is red because the other colours of light have been absorbed and only red is reflected into our eyes and provided we are not colour blind we will all experience the same thing. Animals cannot perceive colours is because that's how they were created. I can make a black/white TV or a coloured TV for differing purpose.</p>
              <p>3. To say that there is no reality outside the mind, how does the mind knows that? You cannot get out of your mind to affirm that.</p>
              <p>4. A car is a solid machine. It has existence. People involved in accidents can tell you that. We are not just dealing with appearances when we say that a red car exists. It exists in reality. But what you are doing is deconstructing the car in your mind to say that it has no real existence. That IMO is merely theorizing in abstract terms, but you would have to abandon that the moment you call a red Toyota Wish taxi and step into one. Of course if you dismantle a car you do not have a car. No sane person would call it a car, except to call it a dismantled car to be precise.</p>

Everything being dependently originated is empty ultimately. Empty does not mean non-existing but empty of a substantial core, unchanging, independent existence.<br><br>2. Redness is an experience of vision in human kind. You cannot speak of redness apart from vision. Redness is a dependently originated phenomena, neither existing in mind nor in outer objects, for both mind and outer objects are conventions for dependently originated activities that are empty and cannot be pinned down as a substantial entity.<br><br>Anyway there is an interesting article by Kyle:</p>

                      "sensible" I mean capable of being sensed or  that which is perceived by
                       the senses. So audible, visible, tangible,  etc... and for this we'll 
                      go with what is immediately perceived. Not  mediately (through the 
                      intervention of something else). For example;  when reading a book what 
                      you <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> perceive is letters on the page, but <span style="font-style: italic;">mediately</span> or by means of these, notions of truth, virtue, vice etc are suggested
                        to the mind. So though notions such as truth, vice, virtue etc are  
                      suggested and signified to the mind by sensible marks with which they  
                      have an arbitrary connection with, it would be absurd to designate  
                      these(truth, virtue etc..) as sensible things. So 'sensible things'  
                      means only what is immediately perceived by the senses and sensible  
                      things that we investigate don't include such designations inherently.  
                      To add; in instances such as a situation where one sees both red and  
                      blue in the sky, and thus it is inferred that there must be a cause for 
                       the differences in colors, that cause cannot be said to be a sensible  
                      quality immediately perceived by eyesight. Likewise, when one hears a  
                      variety of sounds it cannot be said that you hear their causes, and when
                        one touches something hot or feels something heavy; one cannot say 
                      with  truth that you feel the cause of the heat or weight. Hopefully we 
                      can  agree that the senses perceive only what is perceived immediately  
                      because they do not make inferences.<br> <br> So immediate sensible qualities include:<br> Sight -  light, colors, shapes.<br> Hearing - sounds.<br> The palate - tastes.<br> Smell - odors.<br> Touch - tangible qualities.<br> (And obviously combinations of these.)<br> <br> The  purpose for this is to obviously stay with the theme I mentioned in
                       an  earlier post which was based on the premise that experience 
                      suggests  nothing about itself. Aside from our conceptualizations about 
                       experience, experience itself communicates nothing. So staying with 
                      what  is immediately perceived allows us to remain objective (no pun  
                      intended) and allows a mutually shared middle ground (non-conceptual  
                      awareness) apart from our contrasting notions about that middle ground. 
                       So like I said we're empirically investigating the nature of experience
                        itself, and the emptiness or non-emptiness of an objective field in  
                      relation to it's validity in being a substantiated attribute of  
                      experience.<br> <br> The underlying inquiry consists of two contrasting  notions which are; 
                      does the reality of sensible things consist of being  perceived? Or do 
                      things in fact exist as inherent exterior objects  independent of 
                      sensual perception, distinct from, and having no relation  to being<br> perceived? And related notions of objectivity,  subjectivity, 
                      physicality, etc. Inherent separate existence vs. Empty  dependent 
                      origination.<br> <br> You started with salt before so...  beginning with salt; inquiring into 
                      salts characteristics and attributes  we'll look into whether salt 
                      exists as an objective independent agent  which inherently exists and 
                      posses these attributes or the contrary.<br> <br> Salt  as it's usually experienced is predominantly comprised of vision, 
                       tactile sensation and obviously taste. I suppose salt can, on occasion 
                       be heard and also undoubtably bears an aroma to match it's pungent 
                      taste  but those senses are secondary. So I think approaching salt  
                      sense-by-sense will be appropriate so that we can ensure that each  
                      sensory field can be properly isolated and examined. The reason for this
                        is that in my opinion the different sense fields are heterogeneous  
                      instead of how they are usually taken to be (homogeneous). So even  
                      though they seem to amalgamate and interact to create what appears to be
                        an organized and coordinated experience of reality, they are in fact  
                      separate fields which only communicate with one another via inferential 
                       projection. <br> <br> This issue was examined rather thoroughly in a  philosophical 
                      thought-experiment called Molyneux's Problem which  consisted of 
                      attempting to understand the level of sensorial  coordination one would 
                      possess upon immediate recovery from blindness.  Taken from wikipedia; 
                      The problem can be stated in brief, "if a man born  blind can feel the 
                      differences between shapes such as spheres and  cubes, could he 
                      similarly distinguish those objects by sight if given  the ability to 
                      see?"<br> <br> The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher William Molyneux, whose wife was blind:<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Suppose  a man born blind, and now 
                      adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish  between a cube and a 
                      sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same  bigness, so as to 
                      tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the  cube, which is the 
                      sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed  on a table, and the
                       blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight,  before he touched 
                      them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the  globe, which the 
                      cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer  answers: ‘Not. For 
                      though he has obtained the experience of how a globe,  and how a cube, 
                      affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the  experience, that 
                      what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight  so or so…’</span><br> <br> To which Locke responds in "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding":<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">I  agree with this thinking gentleman,
                       whom I am proud to call my friend,  in his answer to this problem; and 
                      am of opinion that the blind man, at  first sight, would not be able 
                      with certainty to say which was the  globe, which the cube, whilst he 
                      only saw them; though he could  unerringly name them by his touch, and 
                      certainly distinguish them by the  difference of their figures felt.</span><br> <br> In 1709, in “A New  Theory of Vision,” George Berkeley also concluded 
                      that there was no  necessary connection between a tactile world and a 
                      sight world—that a  connection between them could be established only on
                       the basis of  experience. He speculated:<br> <span style="font-style: italic;">the  objects to which he had hitherto 
                      used to apply the terms up and down,  high and low, were such as only 
                      affected or were in some way perceived  by touch; but the proper objects
                       of vision make a new set of ideas,  perfectly distinct and different 
                      from the former, and which can in no  sort make themselves perceived by 
                      touch (sect. 95).</span><br> <br> There  have been events matching this predicament which actually 
                      verified these  philosopher's educated speculations; one of them being 
                      the case of "a  woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she 
                      underwent surgery for  dense bilateral congenital cataracts. They report
                       that the subject could  recognize family members by sight six months 
                      after surgery, but took up  to a year to recognize most household 
                      objects purely by sight."<br> <br> So starting with vision; I included a reference image we can both use to avoid conflicting imagery.<br> <br> <img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/301ddh4.jpg" alt="Image"><br> (image A)<br> <br> Salt  on a table is a fairly common affair (if one is making a mess) and
                       is  good because it entails fairly limited differences in <span style="font-style: italic;">color</span>, which as it ends up is pretty much equivalent to the very sense of vision we're exploring. <br> <br> My  argument to start is going to be that color is exactly vision and  
                      vision is exactly color, they are synonymous in nature and  
                      manifestation. The common presupposition that the process of visually  
                      perceiving an object consists of 'seeing' a 'color' (which exists  
                      separately from said act of seeing) is a misnomer. Wherever there is  
                      color there is seeing and vice versa. The two go hand-in-hand and you  
                      cannot have one without the other. With color we also get 'shape' which 
                       is a result of colors bordering each other in various ways. So color  
                      also implies shape, and shape likewise will imply color. Ultimately the 
                       object of vision is color and therefore shape. <br> <br> Vision standing  alone as an isolated sense is much like Image A posted 
                      above. If we  attend to the visual evidence in the image alone we get a 
                      circular patch  of white surrounded by brown. There is no separating 
                      line between the  colors and vision. And likewise there is no separating
                       line between the  colors and you, no evidence in the colors of being 
                      "out there" and no  evidence of yourself being an observer "in here". 
                      The conclusion that  the colors are external to us is based on the 
                      principle that these  colors change over time. So we accept a story that
                       the colors (object)  is separate from us even though the basis for this
                       conclusion is lacking  in the visual evidence in-and-of-itself. This 
                      aligns with my previous  statement that experience suggests nothing 
                      about itself. Experience  instead receives projected conceptual overlay 
                      which over time serves to  create habitually solidified subconscious 
                      presuppositions conveying a  compelling sense of separation. <br> <br> Separation in general is based  on spatiality. We usually conceive of 
                      two opposite aspects existing on  opposite sides of unbridgeable spatial
                       gaps. In truth we never  experience spatial externality or 
                      independence. These designations are  based on the formation of a subtle
                       reference point of a subjective self  "here" as opposed to "there". The
                       feeling of subjectivity is never  anything more than a tendency to 
                      identify with certain clusters of  sensation and project that the 
                      remainder is objective and "other". But  by looking at experience very 
                      directly it can actually be ascertained  that this "otherness" is never a
                       part of our experience. <br> <br> So back  to the white salt on the brown table... this image that arises 
                      as  vision is composed of these colors, we see a white circular expanse 
                      of  color, and various shades of white within that circular shape. 
                      Bordering  that we see a brown expanse of color which seems to surround 
                      the white,  and if we could back up and see a larger image the colors 
                      would unfold  as we went along. <br> These colors are all there is to vision. So to  examine the 
                      'objectivity' of vision let's examine the 'whiteness' in the  image(and 
                      you can do this by putting salt on a table in front of  you)... speaking
                       specifically about the shades of the 'whiteness' and  the particular 
                      value of the color. Can we say that the shade itself is  salt? Can it be
                       said that wherever you have that particular shade(white)  you have salt
                       - and wherever you have salt you have that particular  shade(white)? 
                      Obviously not. So white itself isn't definitive of salt.  Now would you 
                      say that there is salt on the far side of that color? Do  you directly 
                      experience salt behind the white? Because we just  established that we 
                      wouldn't take the shade of white itself to be salt  one should naturally
                       inquire as to whether there is salt behind the  white. We'll find that 
                      there is in fact no salt to be found on the  posterior side of the 
                      white. Now on the near side of the color, do we  experience any 
                      separation between the seeing of the color and the color  itself? 
                      Attending exclusively to vision and letting go of any arising  concepts 
                      or beliefs, is there any distance experienced between the  seeing of the
                       white and the white itself? You can't see the 'seeing'...  so there 
                      can't be any distance, the color simply arises. So there's no  salt on 
                      the far side of the white, and no salt on the near side, and no  
                      distance or gap between the white and the seeing of the white itself.  
                      Wherever white appears, vision is occurring, there's no access to white 
                       without vision, so the objectivity of the salt should melt or fuse into
                        vision itself. The color should disappear into vision, because at that
                        point it makes no sense to say one is "seeing" a "color" in the first 
                       place... the two are inseparable. Vision itself means color is arising,
                        they're one and the same. It's not as if you have independent access 
                      to  colors where you can notice a color out of the visual field and then
                       say  now i'm seeing that color, there couldn't be a color unless vision
                       was  already there. <br> <br> Now the idea that there is a bordering line  between an internal aspect 
                      of the body and an external aspect apart from  the body has to be taken 
                      into account as well. This 'bordering line'  creating the dichotomy of 
                      internal/external is based on identification  with 'the body'. But the 
                      body itself is not separate from vision either,  there are other colors 
                      and shades which are identified as 'my body' but  just like the colors 
                      which composed the salt, these colors appearing as  a 'body' do not 
                      communicate a possessive nature. The colors simply  arise no different 
                      than any other color in the field of vision. We only  impute a notion of
                       'my body' over these colors. There are other  faculties that seem to 
                      correlate with vision to give the appearance of a  homogeneous cluster 
                      of sensations conventionally called the body and we  can discuss those 
                      separately, but all are merely qualities appearing to  awareness as 
                      awareness itself. So the notion of an 'subject inside'  viewing an 
                      'object outside' is not self-evident in vision. Vision simply  appears 
                      and is completely non-discriminitive. Another thing which isn't  
                      self-evident in vision is the presence of 'eyes' doing the seeing, we  
                      never experience or see our own eyes at any time, even in the act of  
                      looking at a mirror we only are ever seeing colors and shapes arise that
                        we identify with as 'me' and 'my eyes' but the eyes appear nowhere  
                      within vision itself, we again only accept a story about this. <br> <br> About this Nagarjuna states: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Through 
                       this the eyes, visible forms and so forth, which are described as the  
                      elements, these should be known also as [the twelve] sense-fields, and  
                      as the objects and the subjects as well. <br> <br> Neither atom of form  exists nor is sense organ elsewhere; even more no 
                      sense organ as agent  exists; so the producer and the produced are 
                      utterly unsuited for  production." - Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">"In  terms of objects and subjects, 
                      whatever appears to the consciousness,  apart from the cognitions 
                      themselves, no external objects exist  anywhere.<br> <br> So there are no external objects at all existing in the  mode of 
                      entities. The very perceptions of the individual  consciousnesses arise 
                      as appearances of the forms." - Nagarjuna</span><br> <br> So  vision is color. You can't even say they arise as mutually  
                      interdependent co-emergent qualities because the duality is lacking to  
                      begin with. The notion of the duality between observing and observed is a
                        conceptual imputation. A story simply arises and say "i'm seeing 
                      white"  and we accept this story, but the story is never evident in 
                      vision  itself. The objectivity of color as an external quality isn't  
                      substantiated by experience. Now vision itself doesn't appear separate  
                      from awareness, or 'that' which 'knows' vision to be apparent. But  
                      that-which-knows is the appearance itself, there is no duality, even to 
                       say appearance implies something to which the appearance would  
                      appear-to, so what "is" escapes all such conceptualizations (aside from 
                       conventional descriptive concepts). So the objectivity of the salt  
                      collapses, the objectivity of color collapses, the objectivity of vision
                        collapses as well. We can't say that vision is a 'thing' out there  
                      which is separate that we have access to sometimes and not at other  
                      times. Vision is awareness, there is no separation and there are no  
                      'objects', all we have is awareness. And this same exercise is done for 
                       every sense modality. (Awareness itself must also be refuted as such.)<br> <br> For  the salty taste; my argument would be much like what has been 
                      proposed  for vision, i saw that namdrol used the example of MSG in 
                      showing the  appearance of 'saltiness' to not be unique to salt itself. 
                      So following  the same examination done with vision and focusing on the 
                      palate alone  one can successfully find taste to be empty as well. I 
                      would also add  that with your argument being that saltiness is an 
                      innate quality with  which salt itself is inherently endowed with; if 
                      one runs the gamut of  taste congruent with other sensory appearances 
                      such as heat; it can be  seen that an intense level of taste such as 
                      spiciness correlates with an  intense heat in that at the highest volume
                       of appearance both arise as  pain. The pain that arises is in fact the 
                      taste. There are not two  appearances such as taste and then also pain, 
                      they are one and the same.  So to posit that an external objective thing
                       like salt inherently  contains it's taste would be akin to claiming it 
                      also contains the  appearances of pain and pleasure. One also cannot 
                      attribute lesser  volumes of the same spectrum such as a general mild 
                      taste to an object  without naturally accrediting higher and lower 
                      volumes of that same  spectrum. So salt cannot be said to contain it's 
                      taste. And taste cannot  be said to be anything more than awareness 
                      itself and empty. This  insight combined with the former which coincides
                       with the experiment  done in vision should hopefully annihilate this 
                      false designation(of  inherent objective existence) apart from mere 
                      conventional usage. <br> <br> Ultimately  awareness itself is empty. Because for one to claim that 
                      this inquiry  has successfully reached a foundation at 'awareness' 
                      implies a 'ground'  of being of some type where none can be found. Yet 
                      conventionally  awareness is a clear and proper concept to use in 
                      describing  that-which-is, for such an awareness likewise cannot be 
                      denied. <br> <br> The Buddha attempted to capture these realizations in The Heart Sutra when he stated: <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">There  are no eyes, no ears, no nose, 
                      no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no  seeing, no hearing, no 
                      smelling, no tasting, no touching, no imagining.  There is nothing seen,
                       nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted, nor touched,  nor imagined.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Devoid of all real entities; <br> Utterly discarding all objects and subjects,<br> Such as aggregates, elements and sense-fields;<br> Due to sameness of selflessness of all phenomena,<br> One's mind is primordially unborn;<br> It is in the nature of emptiness.<br> - Nagarjuna</span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"><br> </span></p>

              <p>but do you agree that all the things in the universe, inculding u and me are made up of atoms, molecules, to mere energy by science? that's sort of Impersonality in Buddhism already in laymen term.</p>
