              <p>So it seems that in Buddhism everything (as in everything) changes and nothing (as in really nothing) does not change. And the fact of change is = emptiness. Am I correct?</p>

              Love, hate and fears are emotional process of "I", that is why we cannot find them. Similiarly "Self" is the continuous series of processes of the consciousness of the living body,  that's why we mistaken it asa independent entity and yet we are unable to locate it!

              <p>1. The human being is body/soul/spirit, comprising the material
              and immaterial aspects. The body is the house whereas the self is
              the occupant if you like, it is complete and whole in this way. And
              because the self or "I" is the immaterial aspect it therefore makes
              little sense to ask where the "I" is located. Just like you cannot
              locate love, hate, fear, or thoughts.</p>
              <p>2. Words are words, we use them to communicate. Truth claims can
              be true or false. That is what we try to examine as best as we
              can.</p>
              <p>3. See #1 above. Just because we cannot locate an "I" in the
              body it does not mean there is no "I" or "self" or "me" to speak
              of. Again the point is that we are not just matter, but spirit/soul
              too.</p>
              <p>4. The Bible does not teach God as a process, much less an
              all-encompassing or embracing principle. The Bible teaches that God
              is a Person, a Spirit who created the universe and all that is in
              it, be it things visible or invisible. God is distinct from His
              creation, and so should not be identified with the creation, or
              seen as being part of the creation.</p>

              Self is not easy to debunk, as most people see it as self evident. Nevertheless, one has to investigate and some "soul" searching  pun intended to debunk no self

              <p>Misunderstood you indeed have.</p>
              <p>Jesus laid down His life on His own accord. He CHOSE to do His Father's will. In His humanity He obeyed His Father even unto the cross. In John 10:17 Jesus said, "This is why the Father loves me—because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again. No one takes it away from me, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I lay it down of my own free will.</span></strong> I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again." In His humanity Jesus prayed and asked if the cup of suffering can pass by, and we know that it can. In Matt 26:53 Jesus said at the time of His arrest, "Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?" In the same way, in His humanity Jesus experienced the separation between God and man while He was on the cross bearing the sins of the whole world. It was a cry that pointed back to the OT Scripture, it was also to signify that the OT was being fulfilled in Christ, in that the work of atonement is being accomplished.</p>
              <p>BTW, God is not an old man.</p>
              <p>Jesus said, "No one has greater love than this—that one lays down his life for his friends." Acts of sacrifices are being done all over the world, we know of many who did so in the gun tragedy in the US. The teachers and staff willingly sacrificed themselves for the kids. The kids should not feel righteous (for that was not the purpose of saving their lives) but the kids should feel loved and treasured. Now you asked me, will I lay down my life for you? That depends on the purpose of the sacrifice, wouldn't it? It would be silly to die just because you ask me to!</p>

              <p>Hi Bro-in -christ,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, to use the Sandy Hook Elementary School is distasteful as a lot of innocent lives were lost on that day . Nonetheless, since you have brought it up as an illustration, I would take the opportunity to help you to see the difference between a blood sacrifice and a national tragedy.</p>

              <p>Hi Bro-in -christ,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, to use the Sandy Hook Elementary School is distasteful as a lot of innocent lives were lost on that day . Nonetheless, since you have brought it up as an illustration, I would take the opportunity to help you to see the difference between a blood sacrifice and a national tragedy.</p>
              <p>In the Sandy Hook Elementary School Massacre, the teachers acted out of a sense of professionalism to protect their charges. They made their commitment to protect the little ones and they do so <span style="color: #ff0000;">willingly</span>.</p>

              <p>1. I don't see how using the school tragedy is distasteful as it was meant to illustrate the self-sacrifice of the teachers for the kids under their care. But frankly I don't see that as an act of professionalism at all. An act of self-sacrifice (dying for others) has IMO nothing to do with being professional which is more of a work ethic. There is nothing in the teaching profession, or any other profession for that matter, that stipulates you have to die for your students or clients or customers or that it is professional to do that, is there?</p>
              <p>2. Yes, the teachers died willingly for their students, out of genuine love for them. This is no less than the love that God has for us all. Jesus died WILLINGLY for us and went to the cross, like a lamb led to the slaughter, for God so loved the world...you know the rest of the verse I think. Thus the comparison is apt and hardly distasteful.</p>
              <p>3. I believe I did answer the question you posed to me. I said it depends. One doesn't just give up living just because you tell me to. What benefits are you talking about? In any case, whether I do lay down my life or be a coward when the time comes, it will be my call and mine only, not yours or anyone's else. But how is this at all relevant to the prior discussions? It does not call into question the willing atoning sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for the sins of the world.</p>

              <p>The Christian view of God is not a process or a principle, or some nebulous "force" that fills the universe. God is a divine being, a Person. Indeed God neither needs our approval or acceptance to exist. That, however, is not the interesting question. The more interesting question, and one of constant debate and the key subject of philosophy is the question, Does God exist?</p>

              <p>Asking what comes before God is not a coherent question at all, because God does not exist in time. In fact, time is created by God because time has a beginning. To say change just is, is not explaining anything about the existence of anything. Change is simply what transpires between any two states for the object/subject. But where did the object/subject come from? The issue of existence is distinct from the issue of change. Change is predicated on existence. If there is nothing, then there is no change to speak about.</p>
              <p>There is no reality in minus zero if you get what I mean. It is a mathematical abstract term. There is no real thing as a -1. It simply does not exist in reality. If you know, please show me. Sure, we can have a temperature scale that runs in minus degrees but it is simply a mathematical measurement of how cold things are. Even if your bank balance shows minus, it is merely a symbol of debt on your part. The use of minus zero is only mathematical and in abstract terms. You cannot touch or handle -$3000. Either you have no cows or you have more than one cow, you cannot have a minus zero cow or entity. </p>

              <p>When you see yourself in the mirror you see an image of yourself. In the same way, God has created us such that we reflect Him, or aspects of Him, to be more theologically precise. In theological terms in refers to the communicable attibutes of God. Sin only ruins the image of God in mn, but does not remove or obliviate it. And the Bible does not say that it was an apple that Adam ate.</p>

              <p>The Christian view of God is that He is the Creator who is infinite. While His infinite being cannot be fathomed or comprehended, He can make Himself known to and by His creation. As a Person, God willed the universe into existence from nothing and created man with rational faculties and the ability to know Him. God created man in His image, thus man has moral faculties. God is not an impersonal force, for an impersonal force has no moral faculties. How does the concept of Dharmakaya make sense of our moral faculties and why we are moral beings?</p>

              <p>The teaching or claim is that all living beings are basically buddhas, or enlightened ones. Where did these buddhas come from? But why would these enlightened ones be transformed into un-enlightened ordinary beings?  It would seem to also imply that we have always existed for eternity, does it not, but only in different bodies and forms?</p>

              <h4>Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, 
                                      no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a 
                                      divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana 
                                      Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?</h4>
              <p><strong>A: </strong>I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha 
                                      Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the 
                                      space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is 
                                      the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of 
                                      your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the 
                                      Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; 
                                      this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this 
                                      clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the 
                                      conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great 
                                      Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in 
                                      meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been 
                                      realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere 
                                      he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is 
                                      immersed in a state of great bliss.</p>
              <p>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to 
                                      the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or 
                                      nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, 
                                      we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, 
                                      a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of 
                                      Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We 
                                      must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are 
                                      speaking on an individual level.</p>
              <p>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate 
                                      the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. 
                                      Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the 
                                      origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all 
                                      worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique 
                                      entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis 
                                      of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. 
                                      All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the 
                                      intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various 
                                      manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle 
                                      consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your 
                                      experiences take shape.</p>
              <p>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross 
                                      manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to 
                                      that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form 
                                      the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light 
                                      is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so 
                                      on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial 
                                      Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of 
                                      clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.</p>
              <p>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a 
                                      grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from 
                                      beginningless time. If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the 
                                      explanations given in the <em>Pramanavartika, </em>the "Compendium of Valid 
                                      Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by 
                                      Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, 
                                      would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial 
                                      Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations 
                                      which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the 
                                      Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this 
                                      assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an 
                                      "interpretable" sutra.</p>
              <p>Dalai Lama's answer. </p>
              <p>ps: we and Buddhas sits at equal level. unlike you all always sit under God. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Buddhism is more into democracy already, while u all are still into imperialism. </span></p>

              Without the clinging to "Self",  we do not require the carriage of  eternal soul, much less a belief in God. We need to perpetuate our existence and wishing to continue our existence beyond death. With the belief of Eternal God perhaps we may sleep better knowing there is an afterlife. But since God is not self evidencing, God adherents simply attribute events and occurrence to God and his omnipotence!
