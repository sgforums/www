              <p>1. Yes, defending Christianity does take some effort. Usually that is so because most critics of Christianity know little about what they criticise.</p>
              <p>2. What do you mean by loop holes in the Bible.</p>
              <p>3. Sure, anyone with the money can come up with their own version of the Bible, but what's this point supposed to prove about the Bible?</p>
              <p>4. God created man in His image, simply means that humans reflect God in SOME ways, not in every aspect. It is not that God is like man, but man is like God.</p>
              <p>5. Certainly God can make man do His bidding. But then you won't be man, but robot. What kind of meaningful reciprocal relationship is there? And indeed none of redemption history was for fun. God is not a capricious God.</p>
              <p>6. If you have read the Bible you would know that those who are in Christ i.e. the church is God's dwelling place. God lives in us since we are the spiritual temple, to those who believe in Him and trust in Him. That's the God revealed, not some distant aloof being, but One who dwells in His people. Transcendent yet immanent.</p>

              Then accordingly to you beliefs, Man as a creation is flawed, either by default or design. Also, the presence or belief in god is not essential nor providing a moral compass, I do not believe I am alone.
                          <blockquote>
                            <div class="quote_from">
                              Originally posted by BroInChrist:

              <p>1. In the Bible it is not self, or the clinging to it, that
              cause suffering. It is sin i.e. rebellion against God, that causes
              suffering. Had Adam and Eve obeyed God rather than the serpent
              there would have been no suffering and death. Other than God who is
              independent and necessary, all of creation is contingent, dependent
              on many things, ultimately dependent upon God's upholding of the
              creation. That does not negate self, but only points to the fact
              that apart from God, nothing can exists, not even life.</p>
              <p>2. Our self shares similarities with the shadows only in the
              sense that both are contingent, dependent arising as you say. But
              just because we are contingent beings it does not mean that such
              are illusory or even likened to being illusory. Illusory means
              illusion, not real. Things that are contingent or temporary are not
              necessarily illusory. You can say that man is made up of 5
              aggregates, I can say that man is made up of many "parts". But the
              question is, who created man or designed man to function as he
              does? Again, creation presupposes an intelligent Mind.</p>
              <p>3. You are right to say that software and hardware are created
              by humans. This points to intelligent design. Same with humans. We
              are specially designed to function the way we do, and this points
              to a being of supreme intelligence, God. Life exists not because
              the conditions are right, but because God created life. Having the
              right conditions for life is necessary but not sufficient. A dead
              body have all the necessary ingredients for life, but it is dead.
              God breathed into Adam and he became "nephesh Chayah", a living
              soul.</p>
              <p>4. The point about monsters under the bed is that there is such
              a thing as objective truth. If there are none under the bed, then
              the belief that there is must be false.</p>
              <p>5. I understand that Buddhism is about no self, I just find that
              this idea is incoherent and inconsistent in so many ways and run
              counter to daily experience. It is like saying that there is no
              such thing as language or logic, one would have to presuppose them
              to even deny them!</p>
              <p>6. The past is not infinite simply because time has a beginning.
              While a beginning must have a cause, what has begun may or may not
              have an end. We do not have now if there was no past. To understand
              now we need information about the past, otherwise we only work with
              incomplete knowledge and may apply wrong solution.</p>
              <p>7. Suffering comes when Adam wilfully ignored God's command and
              disobeyed God by eating from the forbidden tree. The Bible does not
              teach that man is ignorant, but that man is in rebellion against
              his Creator.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>1. Christianity does not teach about a permanent self. Or a
                  nonexistent self for that matter. The Bible teaches that there is a
                  God who created everything, including humans in His image. Every
                  human being is a distinct and unique person. So there is a you, me,
                  him, her, to speak of in real terms. All creation is contingent,
                  having no existence apart from God who always existed. The Bible
                  does not mention about permanence. It does mention about things
                  eternal, things immortal. The universe is not permanent or eternal.
                  But God can sustain it forever if He so chooses to.</p>
              <p>2. The Bible speaks of the present heavens and earth passing
                  away with a big bang. Ironically this big bang is something coming,
                  not something that has happened 14 billion years ago. The present
                  universe is observed to be expanding still, and the Bible speaks
                  about God stretching out the heavens. Hmmm....</p>
              <p>3. Man sinned against God and the whole creation was cursed. Sin
                  affects everything. Death entered the world, the whole of creation
                  groans as taught in the epistle of Romans. If you kill someone,
                  it's not just you and the dead person, it's more than that.</p>
              <p>4. I do not quite get your point about only the intelligent
                  designer can question the human intelligence. Can you clarify that
                  part? Why would the existence of God makes you feel regrettable
                  about anything?</p>
              <p>5. The Bible says God created man in His image but does not tell
                  us explicitly why. But if I may offer my opinions, it would be so
                  that we can have fellowhip with Him. Animals are not created in
                  God's image, thus they do not worship God or have any personal
                  relationship with God. Whether Ang Moh or Black or White, we are
                  all human beings, descended from Adam and Eve. Our so-called racial
                  differences are only skin deep. Do you know that we are all of one
                  blood? We are of the same human race. We are of the same mankind.
                  We are of the same colour, just different shades of the same
                  pigment melanin. The more you have the darker you are. Race has NO
                  biological meaning, it is entirely a social construct, and one that
                  cause no small amount of misery and division.</p>
              <p>6. God created Adam and Eve perfect, innocent, without sin. But
                  God also endowed Adam with free will. It was the wrong choice and
                  action that led to Adam's fall from perfection. Nothing is wrong
                  with God at all.</p>
              <p>7. What happens to a good person? Does he go to hell? Well, what
                  do you mean by a good person to begin with? Good in terms of what?
                  Compared to what? Whose standard of goodness are you using to call
                  someone good? Yours, Hitler, Mother Teresa, or God Himself? You
                  need an absolute yardstick of morality. Being morally good is not
                  good enough, you need to be morally PERFECT, just like God is.</p>
              <p>8. You said your questions have nothing to do with God but only
                  interpretation. I don't see how that is so. In any case, God is the
                  subject and undergirds the Christian answer. Even if you think my
                  interpretation is incorrect, you have to show that your
                  interpretation is correct.</p>
              <p>10. Why I choose Christianity? Well, I became a Christian at a
                  young age. But through the years as I study and learn about my
                  faith (and others) I see that the Christian worldview is the only
                  true worldview. This may not be politically correct to say, but I
                  believe it.</p>
              <p>11. I am in this forum to exchange views, and in the process to
                  correct wrong views about Christianity that Buddhists may have. And
                  I hope that I have conducted myself well so far and have been
                  cordial and polite. In the process I am also corrected on my wrong
                  views concerning Buddhism. I will be frank to say upfront that I
                  believe many teachings of BuddhismÂ are false, and I believe
                  you will also say that many teachings of Christianity are false
                  too. But such need not cause offense at all. It is only logical
                  that two contradictory teachings on a given subject cannot be both
                  true at the same time and in the same sense.</p>
              <p>12. You need to make the right distinction between contingent
                  and necessary beings. The entire creation is contingent, it does
                  not have existence apart from God calling it into existence. It is
                  not permanent or eternal unless God decides it to be so. All
                  observed phenomena that we observe is contingent upon God's
                  sustaining power. God sets the laws of nature in place. If He
                  withholds His hand then everything will fall apart.</p>
              <p>13. In the Bible there is lots of suffering, so what makes you
                  say that you will become a Christian if God will end your
                  suffering? Even Christ suffered. Just to end suffering is a very
                  myopic view of life. Life is more than just trying to end
                  suffering. In this world there will be tribulation because this is
                  a fallen world. But God promises to restore all things.</p>
              <p>14. To ask me not to use God to answer your questions is
                  likeÂ to ask the soldier to lay down his weapons in fighting
                  the enemy.Â If I do not use God or the Bible, then what do I
                  use? My opinions? They count for nothing. But God's Word is
                  infallible and trustworthy. It is not a convenient answer, that
                  would be an insult and mocking my efforts and time in answering the
                  questions here, but I believe they areÂ true answers that
                  explains what needs explaining.</p>

                   me being straightforward, what you said is sound contradictory. For

              8. Man,  according to you is created in the likeness of God, and by God and through no other. Rebelliousness is therefore an aspect of God through no fault of man.
              Ever heard of forewarned is forearmed? It acknowledges lessons learned in hindsight. The practice of a Buddhist is vigilant, that we are mindful of now. Being mindful is taking the first step from ignorance. With each experience grounded in the present leads to unknotting the lump we call "Self". As "Self" is ever present in our consciousness, what better and available subject for our investigations.

              Believing in God is integral to a Christian's identity, especially pious ones. Devotees of other religon is no different. Only when one find kinks in perfection in one's devotion, disillusionment sets. There will be many more like him wandering in samsara. In the meantime, good practice for bodhisattva path, developing wisdom and compassion!

              <p>Believing in God is integral to a Christian's identity, especially pious ones. Devotees of other religon is no different. Only when one find kinks in perfection in one's devotion, disillusionment sets. There will be many more like him wandering in samsara.

              <p>As mentioned, the Bible says that even demons believe there is a God. So it is not just that belief in God is integral to a Christian's identity.

              <p>1. I think the allegation against the Bible's credibility due to so-called different versions of the Bible is toothless when you also take into consideration the similar situation with regards to Buddhist texts. <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/sacredbuddhisttexts/a/buddhist-scriptures.htm">http://buddhism.about.com/od/sacredbuddhisttexts/a/buddhist-scriptures.htm</a>Â  Moreover, the charge is easier alleged than substantiated. What do you/critics really mean when they say the Bible has different versions? Do you understand what a Bible version is?</p>
              <p>2. To denigrate the Bible as nothing more than a bedtime story book, you would need support the allegation that it is nothing more than a bedtime story book.</p>
              <p>3. The Bible addresses many of the fundamental questions, perhaps the problem is your refusal to acknowledge or accept the answers? God created humans, and everything for that matter, according to His eternal purpose. You asked how I know God created man in His image. This can only be known if God chooses to tell us, which He did through the Bible. No human reasoning can come to this conclusion. The most humans can do is to say that you resemble a monkey, you were evolved in an ape's image. That doesn't do much for self-esteem, does it?</p>
              <p>4. Â Why would you be offended that God would only dwell in those who believe in Him? It only makes sense that I enter the house if you open the door to me. Jesus said that He stood at the door and knock and will come in to those who open the door to Him.</p>
              <p>5. Just because you can stop something from happening, and didn't, does negate your existence. Yet many critics somehow make this irrational argument that God's apparent "failure" to do this or that means He does not exist! God allows man to make decisions based on his free will. It is not as though Adam was a 3 year old baby who cannot discern anything. Yes, toddlers must be protected and parents should step right in before any mishap can happen. But now you are dealing with matured and functioning adults who can make the right choice.</p>

              So is rebelliousness is by default or by design?

               As long as one misidentify "Self" as permanent soul, it will not be unusual to identify a higher existence as "God". As each person's relationship and perception of God is different, as there are different levels of awareness. Each case is different. For example, even though I am not my dog's creator, to it I am God!
              I am not familiar with Sir Antony Flew so unable to relate to his opinions and views, and neither should he be the final arbiter in the existence  of God.

              Another example, sinweiy made allusion to your God as Mahabrahma,  I see differently. You see, I take into account of the destructive violent propensites of your God, eg. the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. God's jealousy,( exodus 20;5), and God's vanity, the seraphims, whose job is to sing praises of him!
              I tend to view to see your God as of tavatimsa / asuric realms, given the struggles with other  Gods and Demons.
