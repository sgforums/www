              <p>While the meaning of a word may change over time due to usage, it only means there are more than one meaning to the word depending on the context. Which is why a dictionary always have a few entries for each word. But the word universe cannot mean a multiverse, it's incoherent and contradictory. Really, you need to understand that this agenda to prove the existence of multiverses is to steer people away from the notion that this universe is uniquely designed for life. People do not want there to be purposeful design in the universe, so positing the existence of billions of multiverses would give people (mainly those who do not want there to be a God) the comfort that one of these billions must be suitable for life, and that is us. It's philosophy at work here, not science. It is purely hypothetical and mathematical with no empirical evidence. It is the arbitrary multiplying of probabilistic resources to make the impossible or improbable more probable. Nothing conclusive has been found, but people are still looking for it, I'd say it is wishful thinking.</p>

              <p>sometimes, it's quite far-fetched to say a person did an act (as in died at the cross) and this act had "paid" for our sins. so it can be any kind of act like even traveling around the world by foot, or climb the highest mountain, etc?. and that act had said to "finish" another act(of payment). a bit magical to me. </p>

              <p>sometimes, it's quite far-fetched to say a person did an act (as in died at the cross) and this act had "paid" for our sins. so it can be any kind of act like even traveling around the world by foot, or climb the highest mountain, etc?. and that act had said to "finish" another act(of payment). a bit magical to me. </p>

              <p>I think by now you would have appreciate the fact that both Christianity and Buddhism are worldviews. I see the world through the Bible, you see the world through the Sutras. These are the glasses through which we view the world. Both glasses can't be equally right or true at the same time in the same sense. Either both are wrong or only one is right.</p>
              <p>Just because an act can accomplish so much, and so sound "magical" to you, does not invalidate it. That would be an appeal to personal incredulity which is also a fallacious form of argument from ignorance.</p>

              <p>I wonder if your understanding of omniscient is the same as mine? Omniscient means all-knowing i.e. nothing can ever occur to such a being, no new information or new knowledge can be gained. It would seems that your idea of Buddha is equivalent of the theistic God.

              <p>The universe we live in is certainly not eternal, this is a fact that cannot be denied. But the new creation is also not eternal, but it can be forever. Something can last forever without being eternally existing. If everything happen in a loop or cycle, there is the issue of how it can be so. No, I have never experienced eternity, so neither me nor you can say anything about it being boring or not. One can also say that Nirvana is boring, but on what basis?</p>
              <p>Satan is a creation o God, a fallen angel. Discrimination is not wrong in itself. Discrimination involves making judgement, and making judgement is necessary in life, and not all jugement is wrong. You cannot live without making judgement. If you do not discriminate then you see no difference between Hitler and Mother Teresa. I don't think you agree to that. Buddhism rejects dualism, but it must be first be shown that dualism is a wrong worldview.</p>

              <p>I also agree on this. One looks at what Buddhism itself teaches about an issue, and whether it coheres with itself and with what we know. And then one can also explain how Christianity looks at the same issue to point out the different ways in which to explain the same issue.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with such line of thoughts.

              <p>1. Where do you get the idea that Buddhism does not advocate finding truth? Why else would Buddha then come up with the 4 Noble Truths? And why is it wrong to insist that there is only one true God, even if Buddhists do not believe it and insist that the Christian God does not exist at all?</p>
              <p>2. Can Buddhists here point out what's wrong with Buddhism? Can you point out what's wrong with atheism if you are an atheist? I believe I have been very broadminded to engage in dialogue with some equally broadminded Buddhists here. We have interacted with ideas and beliefs on both sides. A discussion may be about winning one side over, or putting ideas on the table to examine.</p>
              <p>3. Every honest Christian or honest Buddhist would believe their religion is true and others false. Can Buddhists honestly beleve that Christianity is true? They can't. So your pluralistic idea is just plain wrong. And honestly, whether you believe it or not, I have also learned some things from my Buddhists friends here.</p>

              <p>1. Hitler and Mother Teresa are certainly no different from the POV that they are humans. But that's not exactly what I am talking about. I am asking if Buddhists hold that the moral character of both these people are no different at all. The issue I also see is that of accumulating positive karma. Does that negate the negative karma? If Hitler killed 6 million Jews, does telling others not to do so negate the fact that he was a genocidal murderer?</p>
              <p>2. Attaining Buddhahood 8000 times, I don't quite understand that, wouldn't one time be enough? If you have to come back as a human 8000 times, that would mean that Buddha never did escape Samsara on first try? And since there is no-self in "ultimate truth" sense, how could one still speak of a "he" concerning Buddha which implies he has a self?</p>
              <p>3. Interesting, how can Nirvana be boring when there is no self to be bored with in the first place? Exactly "who" is being bored? Again it seems that the idea of "self" comes back up while it is being suppressed and denied.</p>

                              that of accumulating positive karma. Does that negate the negative
                              karma? If Hitler killed 6 million Jews, does telling others not to
                              do so negate the fact that he was a genocidal murderer?</p>
              <p>2. Attaining Buddhahood 8000 times, I don't quite understand
                              that, wouldn't one time be enough? If you have to come back as a
                              human 8000 times, that would mean that Buddha never did escape
                              Samsara on first try? And since there is no-self in "ultimate
                              truth" sense, how could one still speak of a "he" concerning Buddha
                              which implies he has a self?</p>
              <p>3. Interesting, how can Nirvana be boring when there is no self
                              to be bored with in the first place? Exactly "who" is being bored?
                              Again it seems that the idea of "self" comes back up while it is
                              being suppressed and denied.</p>

              <p>2. Can Buddhists here point out what's wrong with Buddhism? Can you point out what's wrong with atheism if you are an atheist? I believe I have been very broadminded to engage in dialogue with some equally broadminded Buddhists here. We have interacted with ideas and beliefs on both sides. A discussion may be about winning one side over, or putting ideas on the table to examine.</p>
              <p>3. Every honest Christian or honest Buddhist would believe their religion is true and others false. Can Buddhists honestly beleve that Christianity is true? They can't.

              </p><p>when some buddhism masters speaks Jesus/God from the perspective of buddhism scripture, and for world peace, it tweets the term God in a more approachable, most kind, lovely, awesomic, same as Buddha / buddhahood.

When a christians speak God, there is this dualistic, psychological and philosophical flavour and totally succumb to God judgement similar to heaven dieties inferior to king of heaven.  And these dieties akin to angels in Holy Bible from the xtians point of view. Doubtful from Jesus point of view and definitely not from God as the latter has no way to show it to any xtians besides through Jesus and buddhism masters.</p>

              <p>When there is void in biblical basis, Bible is a religion that is about EQ and IQ stuff, and it also deals with psychology and philosophy. It is not easy to achieve heaven, benevolence without boundary is the only way. In bible there is no tell tale signs of the realms the corpse or the dead is attaining. So, when buddhists are helping you religion to have faith in God, you are going back to yes/no basis of God, in which, in the name of God, may you be commanded to be faithful and learn from Buddhism :)</p>

              <p>1. As mentioned elsewhere, countless rebirth would mean infinity and thus practically if not absolutely impossible. Imagine someone telling you that it takes countless number of attempts to get a driving license. Does that make you anymore hopeful that you would get it this time, or the next? Wouldn't it be really just wishful thinking?</p>
              <p>2. I used to think that Nirvana was a place, then I was corrected on it. And now I take the view that true Buddhism teaches Nirvana is a psychological state of mind. There is no material observable physical difference between one person who has attained nirvana and another person who has not.</p>
              <p>3. Does Buddhism teach annihilism/nihilism? You keep saying that I fell for this extreme view. But I take the view that if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. There are many ideas in Buddhism that easily lends to this conclusion. Extinguishing is one of them. No-self is another. Taking the Middle Way is trying to explain something that is neither here nor there. It can also result in Buddhists speaking in self-negating and self-refuting terms but somehow still accepted as logical and true.</p>
              <p>Interesting also is the view of noted philosopher Frederick Nietzsche here <a href="http://thus-spoke-nietzsche.tumblr.com/post/19194412041/nietzsche-on-buddhism">http://thus-spoke-nietzsche.tumblr.com/post/19194412041/nietzsche-on-buddhism</a></p>
              <p>4. I still think that to avoid the unnecessary confusion, Buddhists should use terms like contingent beings and necessary beings which are better easily understood among philosophy.</p>

              <p>Again you confused a truth issue with a posture issue. Either God exists or He does not, it is a truth issue. Your interest in this issue is a posture issue. Your apathy or "can't be bothered" attitude is a posture issue. It does not answer the question. Instead it throws up smoke by saying that the question is speculative, meaningless, asker not mature etc etc. Again silence can be a reflection of ignorance, or a disguise of ignorance.</p>
              <p>The "Does God exist?" question is to be answered with "Yes, No, or I don't know". You only answer with "I don't care" if the question is "What do you personally think or feel about the question of whether God exist or not?" So I am only pressing you to answer the right question. To say I am forcing you is to exaggerate things. I will be happy with an "I don't know" answer from you. But take note that I will also ask, "Then don't you want to know?"</p>
              <p>Every worldview has its "problems" so to speak. Even though I believe Christianity is true, my understanding of it is limited, thus it is inevitable that there will be questions posed by critics that I have difficulty answering. But we all are entitled to invoking a rescue device to maintain our worldview. The question is whether this rescue device is arbitrary and ad hoc with no good basis. Use it often enough and the cracks in the worldview will quickly show. Yes, we try to fit explanations to our worldview, EVERYONE does that. It is a paradigm thing. We will see with it until we realise that it cannot cope and we then change paradigm, or change lenses, or change worldview, or change religion.</p>
              <p>Having a discussion would be consistent with being broadminded, though it does not necessarily means being broadminded. But then again, a narrow minded person would not want to discuss anything, would he? What's there to discuss anyway? It is disagreement that encourages dialogue and discussion. If everyone agrees, then there is no need to discuss.</p>

Doubtful from Jesus point of view and definitely not from God as the latter has no way to show it to any xtians besides through Jesus and buddhism masters.</p>

              <p>Yes, Christians speak of God in a way that maintains a Creator-Creation distinction. The question is whether this distinction is true and that there are good reasons to believe it.</p>
