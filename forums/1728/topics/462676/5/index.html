              <p><br>BroInChrist, thank you for patient and earnest replies to all questioners. So the question now is with Jesus as an advocate, is the sins committed after acceptance of Christ absolved or mitigated, especially those committed in name of God, causing much sufferings. Or sufferings don't matter?</p>

              <p>I am not sure what you mean by sins committed in the name of God, perhaps you can elaborate further? Sin always carry with it consequences, be it on yourself or on those around you. Christians who sinned in times of weakness can always seek the forgiveness that is ever available in Christ's perfect work on the cross. Being a Christian is not a license to sin, but being a Christian avails one to God's throne of mercy that we can confidently come to in times of need as stated in Hebrews 4:14</p>
              <p>"So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe. <span id="en-NLT-29990" class="text Heb-4-15">This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.</span> <span id="en-NLT-29991" class="text Heb-4-16"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God.

              <p><span class="text Heb-4-16">When forgiveness is sought, Christians should seek to give restitution to those whom they have sinned against, and faced up to the consequences of their own actions. </span></p>

              The concept of "Self" is very ingrained in many of us that we cannot imagine our existence without "Self". Without great quietitude we cannot begin unravel this lumping. Everything aspect of our conscious lives evolved around this "Self", if we unable to transcend this, it is the only reality.
              Let us examine our consciousness in dreams, for eg. those who are born blind will never dream in visual images as it was never part of the consciousness whereas those who have visual faculties before being retain the ability to "see" dreams. Likewise, a person born without with limbs will have no consciousness of having such, unlike amputees who may experience phantom limbs!
              Therefore, if we are devoid of one aggregate, that sense consciousness does not contribute to the total sum of our experience. The consciousness is not independent entity apart from our body.
              We, our"I" consciousness are made of different senses, not unlike operating system software in a computer! "I", is simply an awareness mechanism of our human body.

              <p>Yes it's a bit bizarre when you try to wrap your head around this 
              concept. I know I certainly had a terrible time with it. But upon 
              reflection, I discovered that sensing is simply a result of having sense
               organs, and thinking, a result of having a brain do its work,
               where the resulting mental processes are labelled "thought". I'm sure 
              that nobody can refute that, with or without thought, there will still 
              be experience and experiencing.</p>
              <p>So does that mean that there's an experiencer experiencing experience (heh heh!)? After all, you can say that since there's a constant experiencing there <em>has </em>to be a constant <em>something</em> right? True, but you need to look properly at what this something is. Under observation, you'll find that there is no experience of "literally having no experience" which has zero content, just the experience of "nothing", where there is content. There's really is no experiencer outside of experiencing i.e. experiencer and experiencing are actually one thing.</p>
              <p>And what is experience if not everything happening at this very moment? So if every moment (and thus, experience) is new, aren't "we" being reborn every single moement?</p>
              <p>Just to be clear, by "self-destruction" you're talking about being nihilistic right? Since my understanding of buddhism is not as clear as I would like, and that some schools apparently do not hold the exact view, I can only offer how much I know.</p>
              <p>The buddhist answer is that things really do exist in the sense that they have their causes and are able to effect change. The problem is that there's nothing you can really do to prove objective existance of their qualities, since our world really is just a construct of our sense organs and mind. The world really does exist, just not the way we think we do.</p>
              <p>People suffering from mental illness, people with brain damage or born without certain sense organs etc, their view of reality certainly aren't the same as ours, and the fact that we're susceptible to optical illusions, mis-hearing of sound, smelling non-existant smells and other tricks of the mind already prove that we're not that immune to having a false understanding of what is out there. What is conventionally true is just true "to us", and frequently but not necessarily true "to everyone".</p>
              <p>Conventional truth: You experience seeing a pretty girl in red". Ultimate truth: You <em>really don't know</em> if that's true, could be the lighting that's showing her dressed in red, heck she could be a transvestite for all you know. And all your experiencing as the conventional truth is a result of everything in that situation: Your state of mind, you previous experiences, the functioning of your senses and a lot of other factors.</p>
              <p>So conventional truths are essentially false, because everyone has a different take on their experience. But that said we all have to operate conventionally, just that with the understanding that ultimately this experience is not what we think it is, we can work at being a better functioning human being, conventionally :) .</p>

              You would have realised that the Yahweh in the Old Testament and the God of Jesus Christ has different roles. One is a patron deity of the tribes of Israel  has much anger, that wage much destruction on Israelis' enemies and anyone, including Israelis who worship other gods.
              The other is the New Testament God that embraces Gentiles but with a double standard with Jews as chosen people and professing(conditional) love and forgiveness.
              This are aspects of Christianity I more familiar with. Please pardon my ignorance.

              <p>1. I am sorry if my ramblings here are causing you some frustration. It will take some time to be acquainted with the diverse interpretations within Buddhism. So I would rather dialogue over what you think the Buddha taught on some of these things. In the same way, I will not burden you with having to know all the diverse views of Christians over a topic but on what I believe is the correct view.</p>
              <p>2. The issue of God's existence IMO is not a matter of conventional or ultimate truth. God either exists or He does not. If God does not exist and I believe He does, then I am wrong.</p>
              <p>3. Why would it be irrelevant to speak of truth and error even in an ultimate sense? Whatever subjects that the Buddha touched upon, you believe he spoke the truth and not error. Again I am not focusing on experience because as I have said one cannot quibble with an experience. But I would like to focus on the teaching/belief aspect which can be evaluated. The laws of logic are a negative test for truth. So we can see if a teaching is self-refuting, or contradict itself. If it does, it means it is false. But the converse is not necessarily true. A logical statement does not mean it is true, just that the conclusion follows correctly from the premises.</p>
              <p>4. I understand that one link or article written by a Buddhist does not mean you accept that as well. However, I do think that most, if not all Buddhists, should agree on a core set of doctrines. Even within Christianity, the essentials are not disputed, but sadly we are divided over many peripheral issues.</p>

              <p>The concept of “Self” is very ingrained in many of us that we cannot imagine our existence without “Self”. Without great quietitude we cannot begin unravel this lumping. Everything aspect of our conscious lives evolved around this “Self”, if we unable to transcend this, it is the only reality.<br>Let us examine our consciousness in dreams, for eg. those who are born blind will never dream in visual images as it was never part of the consciousness whereas those who have visual faculties before being retain the ability to “see” dreams. Likewise, a person born without with limbs will have no consciousness of having such, unlike amputees who may experience phantom limbs!<br>Therefore, if we are devoid of one aggregate, that sense consciousness does not contribute to the total sum of our experience. The consciousness is not independent entity apart from our body.<br>We, our”I” consciousness are made of different senses, not unlike operating system software in a computer! “I”, is simply an awareness mechanism of our human body.</p>

              <p>When I refer to Self it means the person, regardless of whether he is physically complete or not. Yes, a blind person cannot know what it means to see. But he is a person with a self no less. He may lack the experience, but that in no way calls into question his existence or his personhood or self. Hope you can get my point.</p>

              Upon one's demise,  we can either choose whether "Self" ends which discussion ends.
              Or when we die, the "Self" remains, residual of karmic consciousness, subject to our habitual clinging. It is with this identify that we cling "Self as "Soul".
              When only if we are born with human parents that we develop a human consciousness. Again investigation shows one's"Self" is developed in this human body, pending its functionalities. The provision of "Self" comes with being born and not with introduction of "Self".
              Similiarly, if being born an animal, similiarly the consciousness will be that of an animal. Just a dog would have dog "Self" or a cat with cat"Self"!
              I think the Christian belief is that animals have not "Soul", but when we observe or interact with animals, we will find that they are capable of acting for "Self", exhibiting free will.

                                            existence but only a dozen or less of these are
                                            considered as early.  These are the Upanishads commented on by the 
                                            Medieval Hindu commentator Sankara<a href="http://www.vgweb.org/bsq/upan.htm#n9">[9]</a> who flourished in the eighth century CE.  They are also the ones that were considered as the “principal
                                            Upanishads” by early Western commentators like Paul Deussen.<a href="http://www.vgweb.org/bsq/upan.htm#n10">[10]</a> The earliest of the extant Upanishads
                                            are the  Bá¹›ihadÄ�raá¹‡yaka and the ChÄ�ndogya Upanishads all in prose.  Not only are they
                                            the earliest but also the longest accounting for over three-quarters of the principal Upanishads. They are considered
                                            as being composed about the sixth century BCE.  Three other prose Upanishads are also considered pre-Buddhist.
                                            These are the Taittiriya, Aitreya and Kausitaki Upanishads. The other “principal” Upanishads were the Kena, the
                                            Kaá¹­ha, the IÅ›Ä�, the Muá¹‡á¸�aka, the PraÅ›na, the
                                            MÄ�á¹‡á¸�Å«kya, and the ÅšvetÄ�Å›vatara. To these the Maitri Upanishad is
                                            sometimes added although it is clearly post-Buddhist. As stated this essay will be confined to the five pre-Buddhist
                                            Upanishads and only few references will be made to the other principal Upanishads.</p>

              <p><em>This deva realized that arahantship means the end of rebirth and 
              suffering by uprooting mental defilements; he knew that arahants have no

              <p><em> </em></p>

                                                          a sensor. If there are thoughts, then it presupposes a thinker. To
                                                          say that there is no self seems to me more than just

Raining rains, raining IS rain.<br><br>Wind blowing does not require a blower, etc. Blowing = the wind. We are not denying that causes and conditions are required for wind: for example, the interaction of air pressure, etc. But we are saying there is no ultimate self, controller or agent that 'controls' wind.

No such 'self' exists whether you are ignorant of the truth of no-self or not. Always already, there has never been a seer apart from seeing/seen, a doer apart from deed.

              <p>There should be some clarity of what the Buddhists are refuting.<br><br>The Buddhists are not saying that a person cannot have unique personality. Obviously I have a unique personality that is distinct from other people's personality. Personality in the sense of traits, behaviours, habits, etc etc.<br><br>The Buddhists however are rejecting a Self that is: A separate, or independent, or changeless self or agent, apart from and unaffected by all conditioned experiences.<br><br><br>Instead as Jui has very nicely explained, it is this flow of experiences, thoughts, senses, etc, that flows, is ever-changing, not separate from our moment to moment flow of thoughts and actions and experiences, and displays its personality but with no inherently existing, substantial entity, or 'core' of its existence.<br><br>For example: a car has no 'car-essence' apart from the various parts that function interdependently to give rise to a function called 'driving'. No unchanging, separate, independent car-essence can be pinned down in the engine, in the wheels, etc, nor can it be pinned down or established apart from all its parts. Yet we can observe certain 'traits' or 'personality' of that car. That however does not imply a substantial existence that can be located or pinned down somewhere.<br><br>Likewise, the 'self' and the 'five aggregates' are likewise. There is no central Self or controller or self-essence of a being, yet it does not deny a unique personality and mindstream of each individual person conventionally speaking.</p>

              <p>No, that is not the case. You are thinking that the person, as an individual person, becomes deified. It is not the case that the person is God. There is no ego involved (if it is the individual person that is 'God' then that would certainly be an 'egoic' kind of position), instead the ego dissolves in this realization.<br><br>Actually what the person experiences is a dissolving of his 'old me', a dissolving of a sense of a separate or individual existence, so there is no question of the person or old me becoming deified. (as mentioned in the 'salt doll' example in the upanishads example) Instead, what 'takes over' is transpersonal true I AM/Self that is all-pervasive consciousness underlying and giving rise to life, and an animating life force that transcends him and lives him. And this realization and experience is common to all the mystical/contemplative traditions of all religions throughout the world, whether or not you agree with the mystics' understanding of God.<br><br>This is why I find that this quote is very similar to the mystic's experience and there is no doubt to me that this author has experienced similar states: <br><em><br></em></p>

              <p>Not exactly. Existence implies some <em>thing</em> that is truly there, inherently and independently regardless of conditions. We know that our dream tiger has no real existence upon waking up but is mere-appearance, but we mistakenly think that our waking world has true existence. Dependent origination dissolves the view of 'existence' and 'non-existence'. Emptiness means empty of extremes. The four extremes are seen through: existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence. Even though everything is vividly appearing, they are fundamentally empty of any true existence that can be pinned down, so they are entirely illusory like a magic trick, an apparition, a mirage.

              Zen teacher Tung-shan, speaks of the very same Awareness that the Buddha
               pointed to. This image of a jewel mirror was used as a way to express 
              the source from which all things issue. All the myriad things, thoughts,
               and feelings we experience appear like images in a mirror: vivid yet 
              insubstantial. The ungraspable mirror is what's Real, while the 
              seemingly isolated things that appear in it are not.<br> <br> Consider for example, the simple act of smelling a rose. We see the 
              rose, feel the rose, bring it close, breathe in through our nose. We 
              "smell the rose," as we say, though this refers more to how we 
              conceptualize our experience than it does to what is actually 
              experienced. To say we smell a fragrance would be closer to the actual 
              experience.<br> <br> But where does the act of smelling a fragrance takes place? If we attend
               carefully, we can see that all of our usual accounts of the experience 
              start to break down.<br> <br> Is the fragrance in the rose? If it was, how could you smell it? You're 
              here while the rose is "out there" somewhere. On the other hand, if the 
              rose were removed, you surely wouldn't smell the fragrance. But if you 
              were removed - or if the air in between you and the rose were removed - 
              you also wouldn't smell it.<br> <br> So is the fragrance in the rose? Is it in your nose? Is it in the air in
               between? Is it in the air if no one is around to smell it? If so, how 
              could we tell?  Is the fragrance in your brain, then? And if it's in 
              your brain, then why is the rose necessary at all?<br> <br> Ultimately, the simple act of "smelling a rose" - or any other act 
              involving a subject and object - becomes impossible to pin down and 
              utterly insubstantial.<br> <br> Gradually, however, we can begin to appreciate what the experience of 
              smelling a rose actually entails. It's of the nature of the mirror 
              itself - that is, that the source of all experience is Mind. As such, 
              the act of smelling - or seeing or hearing or touching or thinking - 
              literally has no location. This non-locality is the very essence of 
              Mind.</p>

              <p>Yes it's a bit bizarre when you try to wrap your head around this concept. I know I certainly had a terrible time with it. But upon reflection, I discovered that sensing is simply a result of having sense organs, and thinking, a result of having a brain do its work, where the resulting mental processes are labelled "thought". I'm sure that nobody can refute that, with or without thought, there will still be experience and experiencing.</p>
              <p>So does that mean that there's an experiencer experiencing experience (heh heh!)? After all, you can say that since there's a constant experiencing there <em>has</em> to be a constant <em>something</em> right? True, but you need to look properly at what this something is. Under observation, you'll find that there is no experience of "literally having no experience" which has zero content, just the experience of "nothing", where there is content. There's really is no experiencer outside of experiencing i.e. experiencer and experiencing are actually one thing.</p>
              <p>And what is experience if not everything happening at this very moment? So if every moment (and thus, experience) is new, aren't "we" being reborn every single moement?</p>
              <p>Just to be clear, by "self-destruction" you're talking about being nihilistic right? Since my understanding of buddhism is not as clear as I would like, and that some schools apparently do not hold the exact view, I can only offer how much I know.</p>
              <p>The buddhist answer is that things really do exist in the sense that they have their causes and are able to effect change. The problem is that there's nothing you can really do to prove objective existance of their qualities, since our world really is just a construct of our sense organs and mind. The world really does exist, just not the way we think we do.</p>
              <p>People suffering from mental illness, people with brain damage or born without certain sense organs etc, their view of reality certainly aren't the same as ours, and the fact that we're susceptible to optical illusions, mis-hearing of sound, smelling non-existant smells and other tricks of the mind already prove that we're not that immune to having a false understanding of what is out there. What is conventionally true is just true "to us", and frequently but not necessarily true "to everyone".</p>
              <p>Conventional truth: You experience seeing a pretty girl in red". Ultimate truth: You <em>really don't know</em> if that's true, could be the lighting that's showing her dressed in red, heck she could be a transvestite for all you know. And all your experiencing as the conventional truth is a result of everything in that situation: Your state of mind, you previous experiences, the functioning of your senses and a lot of other factors.</p>
              <p>So conventional truths are essentially false, because everyone has a different take on their experience. But that said we all have to operate conventionally, just that with the understanding that ultimately this experience is not what we think it is, we can work at being a better functioning human being, conventionally :) .</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. I don't quite get the point you made about there really is no experiencer outside of experiencing i.e. experiencer and experiencing are actually one thing. It seems to be again to be just making the distinction between the noun and the verb. I would not identify the experience with the actual person. A person may experience many things in life, but the person =/= experience. I don't think that makes logical sense. Neither would I see every passing moment or experience as being "reborn". I think that is equivocating on the word "reborn".</p>
              <p>2. By self-destruction I mean in the sense that the person "blows up" himself into pieces aka self-refuting. I am not sure if you are referring to some kind of matrix-like existence that we are all bound to. Even if we are, obviously the person who can "escape" from this matrix world knows that there is a real universe/world which is unlike what the others are experiencing. In short, objective reality exist. Does the universe exist? I am sure nobody would deny that. But what do you mean by not the way we think we do?</p>
              <p>3. I think the crux of the issue is whether objective truth exists i.e. independent of what people believe, or prefer, or feel about it. The sun exists whether the blind man sees it or not. His experience of the sun may be lesser from those of us who can see and feel it, but that does not negate the existence of the sun. I think what you call conventional truths may be more akin to relativism, some form of subjective views about reality. Something like the blind man and the elephant analogy?</p>

              <p>So the next question to ask is whether this “Self” consciousness is dependent on being alive or is “Self” independent of the living body. So does “Self” still exist if a living person is unconscious, eg. in a coma, without brain activity.</p>

              <p>The Bible teaches that God created first Adam from earth material. That was just a lifeless body until God later breathed into it and Adam became a living soul. In other words, the Bible knows nothing about pre-existence of spirits/souls. Having said that, every living person has a soul. When the person dies his soul/spirit lives on. It is the soul/spirit that "animates" a body and makes it alive. Neither can a dead person be made alive again even with all the genuis of man. The mortuary is full of dead people, all the ingredients for life is present, but without the soul/spirit it is just dead. The soul/spirit is what I would call the self, which is immaterial but when it is in the body, when I point to you or to myself or another living human being, I am referring to yourSELF, mySELF or himSELF. Even an unconscious person has a self, just that it is not communicating to us. In my view the self does not cease to exist during coma and then come back when awake.</p>
