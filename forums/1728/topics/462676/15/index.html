              <p>Dr francesca stavrakopoulou in the video above is a biblical scholar and historian. She tells us that according to archaelogy and scriptural research (meaning they look into the difference between the original Hebrew text and compare it with the modern Christian bible) concludes that much of the bible is fiction.

               Thank you for helping put forward my point," very good" simply indicates satisfaction, we may even stretch it further to mean "perfecto" , much like a Italian kissing his fingers.
                  But whether Man is flawed by default or design is not established, thus let us look at man and his actions ask yourselves, what is your position?

              Unfortunately, you are unable to grasp "No self", therefore, more time is actually spent on the creation myth and whether God is omniscient or imperfect owing to man being in the image of God. Violence is violence and the anger is  very personal, without  love and compassion, and certainly without wisdom or all this flawed  creation and following destruction would not have happened in the first place. I would such an entity; powerful?yes, low eq? also yes, wisdom? No! Love and compassion? Very conditional!

              <p>BTW, Dr Stavrakopoulou, a senior lecturer in the department of theology and religion at Exeter University, does not believe in God. She said: <em>‘I’m an atheist with a huge respect for religion’.</em> It is thus no wonder that her views would undermine Christianity since that would be consistent with her atheism. But there are other Biblical scholars who disagree with her. You just need to read both sides.</p>

              <p>1. Is man created flawed?</p>

              <p>I have already answered question 1, that man was NOT created flawed in any way. This is the meaning of "very good". If you disagree then please explain in what way was man flawed in Genesis 1?</p>

              <p>Yes you are imperfect because you believe you descended from the imperfect Adam made by God who said very good! Sin nature is inherent in God's design! God was never forgiving in the Old Testament, there even the Covenant of the Ark, a fearsome machine, the New Testament is where Jesus Christ professes love and forgiveness, unless you are talking about two different Gods.</p>

              <p>Again I need to reiterate the point that Adam was NOT created imperfect. He was created perfect, without sin. But because he chose to disobey, he fell into sin. Thus the Bible explains that we are all dead in Adam but we can be made alive in Christ who is the Last Adam.</p>
              <p>To say that God was "never forgiving" in the OT betrays an utter lack of knowledge of the OT. It is a claim that is easily refuted, just one example would suffice! But there's more than enough to completely bury this claim deep down. See the links below</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, you are unable to grasp “No self”, therefore, more time is actually spent on the creation myth and whether God is omniscient or imperfect owing to man being in the image of God. Violence is violence and the anger is very personal, without love and compassion, and certainly without wisdom or all this flawed creation and following destruction would not have happened in the first place. I would such an entity; powerful?yes, low eq? also yes, wisdom? No! Love and compassion? Very conditional! Why we should accept and worship such an entity!</p>

              <p>On the contrary, I do understand the meaning of "no self" but I have shown how such an idea is really incoherent. It probably suffers as a bad or inappropriate label to use. Better to call it as philosophers call it, contingent vs necessary being.</p>
              <p>To call it a creation myth is simply another question-begging fallacy you committed. You first need to establish that it is a myth, but you failed to do so. Let me ask you, do you honor and respect any of the Chief Justices who served Singapore in the past many years? Why? On one hand, many who know the CJs can speak of them as loving husbands or compassionate people, yet they also know of the CJs as men of integrity and justice and who will mete down the harshest of punishment on criminals. If you think about this, then I think you can answer the question of why God deserve our worship. If you think of God as just a love-machine then again I am sorry to say that you have only rejected a false God or a straw-God.</p>

              <p>Ex-atheist Anthony Flew realises that naturalism is untenable and cannot account for the existence of the universe and the complexity of life. As an atheist he also knows that the universe has a beginning and rejected the idea of an eternal/beginningless universe. Your view that life as we know it has been going on since beginningless is at odds with what we know about the universe. But yes, in one area you are right, Life begets life. The law of Karma is unable to account for the existence of life since it was conceded earlier that it is inanimate and impersonal. But the Bible teaches that God is Spirit and is Life, and thus God can create life.</p>

              <p>So, you think a six day creation week by an almight God is fictional, mythical, and un-scientific but that your BELIEF that first there was nothing, then something come out of nothing, then over millions of years some of that something become living, and then over millions of years that living something become more complex until it becomes human, is true, fact, and scientific?</p>
              <p>In short, you think that God making the universe is myth but that the universe made itself is fact. I think you have not gone through the thinking process enough to know what that implies.</p>
              <p>BTW, the Biblical account is not un-scientific, but it is certainly written in a non-scientific way. Do you know the difference?</p>
