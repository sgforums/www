              <p>The meaning is that just feeding but not teaching would mean that the father is at fault. Teaching without discipline is the laziness of the teacher. Children not learning is not right. Not learning from young then what will become of old?</p>

              <p>1. You have understood correctly! Yes, on his own man can NEVER earn enough merit to be made right with God. That's the reason why sacrifices are required throughout the OT. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Another being must take your sins and atone for them so you can live. But the blood of bulls and sheep are only temporary and a shadow. Only a perfect sinless man can make that perfect sacrifice that forever satisfy the holiness and justice of God. Which is why the Bible teaches that salvation is by grace and not by works, so that no one can boast.</p>
              <p>2. Perhaps you can further clarify on what Buddhism teaches as I think I am hearing different views here. It seems that there are three views in Buddhism, Self, No-Self, and Not-Self?</p>
              <p>3. By my understanding, love, compassion and mercy can only come from self-conscious and self-aware beings. It is either true that the Self exists or it does not. In Christianity it is not the liberation from self that is the issue, but the liberation from sin.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta, often translated as no-self. This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons. First, the idea of there being no self doesn't fit well with other Buddhist teachings, such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth: If there's no self, what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth? Second, it doesn't fit well with our own Judeo-Christian background, which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition: If there's no self, what's the purpose of a spiritual life? Many books try to answer these questions, but if you look at the Pali canon — the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings — you won't find them addressed at all. In fact, the one place where the Buddha was asked point-blank whether or not there was a self, he refused to answer. When later asked why, he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible. Thus the question should be put aside. To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta, we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered, and how to interpret his answers.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>The Buddha divided all questions into four classes: those that deserve a categorical (straight yes or no) answer; those that deserve an analytical answer, defining and qualifying the terms of the question; those that deserve a counter-question, putting the ball back in the questioner's court; and those that deserve to be put aside. The last class of question consists of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress. The first duty of a teacher, when asked a question, is to figure out which class the question belongs to, and then to respond in the appropriate way. You don't, for example, say yes or no to a question that should be put aside. If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer, you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted. The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him: those who draw inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them, and those who don't draw inferences from those that should.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings, but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine, we find these ground rules ignored. Some writers try to qualify the no-self interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self, but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside. Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self, but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside, one is drawing inferences where they shouldn't be drawn.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>So, instead of answering "no" to the question of whether or not there is a self — interconnected or separate, eternal or not — the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with. Why? No matter how you define the line between "self" and "other," the notion of self involves an element of self-identification and clinging, and thus suffering and stress. This holds as much for an interconnected self, which recognizes no "other," as it does for a separate self. If one identifies with all of nature, one is pained by every felled tree. It also holds for an entirely "other" universe, in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness — one's own or that of others — impossible. For these reasons, the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as "Do I exist?" or "Don't I exist?" for however you answer them, they lead to suffering and stress.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of "self" and "other," he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience: the four Noble Truths of stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other, he said, one should recognize them simply for what they are, in and of themselves, as they are directly experienced, and then perform the duty appropriate to each. Stress should be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation realized, and the path to its cessation developed. These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood. If you develop the path of virtue, concentration, and discernment to a state of calm well-being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths, the questions that occur to the mind are not "Is there a self? What is my self?" but rather "Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on?" These last questions merit straightforward answers, as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging — the residual sense of self-identification — that cause it, until ultimately all traces of self-identification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #111111;  '>In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness. At that point, questions of self, no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once there's the experience of such total freedom, where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it, or whether or not it's a self?</span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>&lt;!-- robots content="none" --&gt;&lt;!-- #H_meta --&gt;&lt;!-- #H_billboard --&gt;&lt;!-- /robots --&gt;One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta, often translated as no-self. This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons. First, the idea of there being no self doesn't fit well with other Buddhist teachings, such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth: If there's no self, what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth? Second, it doesn't fit well with our own Judeo-Christian background, which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition: If there's no self, what's the purpose of a spiritual life? Many books try to answer these questions, but if you look at the Pali canon — the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings — you won't find them addressed at all. In fact, the one place where the Buddha was asked point-blank whether or not there was a self, he refused to answer. When later asked why, he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible. Thus the question should be put aside. To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta, we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered, and how to interpret his answers.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>The Buddha divided all questions into four classes: those that deserve a categorical (straight yes or no) answer; those that deserve an analytical answer, defining and qualifying the terms of the question; those that deserve a counter-question, putting the ball back in the questioner's court; and those that deserve to be put aside. The last class of question consists of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress. The first duty of a teacher, when asked a question, is to figure out which class the question belongs to, and then to respond in the appropriate way. You don't, for example, say yes or no to a question that should be put aside. If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer, you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted. The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him: those who draw inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them, and those who don't draw inferences from those that should.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings, but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine, we find these ground rules ignored. Some writers try to qualify the no-self interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self, but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside. Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self, but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside, one is drawing inferences where they shouldn't be drawn.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>So, instead of answering "no" to the question of whether or not there is a self — interconnected or separate, eternal or not — the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with. Why? No matter how you define the line between "self" and "other," the notion of self involves an element of self-identification and clinging, and thus suffering and stress. This holds as much for an interconnected self, which recognizes no "other," as it does for a separate self. If one identifies with all of nature, one is pained by every felled tree. It also holds for an entirely "other" universe, in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness — one's own or that of others — impossible. For these reasons, the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as "Do I exist?" or "Don't I exist?" for however you answer them, they lead to suffering and stress.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of "self" and "other," he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience: the four Noble Truths of stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other, he said, one should recognize them simply for what they are, in and of themselves, as they are directly experienced, and then perform the duty appropriate to each. Stress should be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation realized, and the path to its cessation developed. These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood. If you develop the path of virtue, concentration, and discernment to a state of calm well-being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths, the questions that occur to the mind are not "Is there a self? What is my self?" but rather "Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on?" These last questions merit straightforward answers, as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging — the residual sense of self-identification — that cause it, until ultimately all traces of self-identification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 130%;"><span>In this sense, the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self, but a not-self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause, leading to the highest, undying happiness. At that point, questions of self, no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once there's the experience of such total freedom, where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it, or whether or not it's a self?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="color: #1f497d;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000080;">It is either true that the Self exists or it does not. In Christianity it is not the liberation from self that is the issue, but the liberation from sin.</span></span></span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It would be best if you can elaborate for me more on what exactly is the ‘Self’ in the Christian concept, otherwise we will just be going about speaking on thing each of us interpreted very differently.</span></span></p>

              <p>If I am not wrong, the article says that the Buddha set aside the question of whether the self exists or not, i.e. refuses to answer because the answer will lead to suffering and stress. Personally I would take issue with a refusal to answer because the consequences of the answer (whether leading to stress or suffering or not) is distinct from the answer itself. One can always answer a question with a yes or a no, provided one knows the answer.</p>
              <p>For the Christian, the self is simply the "I", as in myself, yourself, himself, herself. It refers to the self-aware and self-conscious individual, the person. It is really not that complicated. It is the everyday usage of the meaning.</p>

              <p>I understand that Buddhism denies that salvation is by grace but that it is by some personal works of merit, something that one has to attain to. However, this is the part where Christianity says that works-salvation cannot be reached, simply because there is nothing we can do (since we have a sinful nature) to get right with a holy God.</p>
              <p>When the Bible says that salvation is by grace and not by works so that none may boast it means that no one can say that he did it on his own i.e. that he earned his salvation by doing such and such. Salvation is a gift. No one earns a gift, it is simply given to him by the sender to be freely accepted or rejected. Thus when the sinner repents and receives the free gift of salvation by grace alone through faith alone, the Bible says that he is a new creation.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Moral perfection is not an impossibility to Buddhists. Granted that most of us may never be able to do so in just one lifetime. In Buddhism, we have the 3 path of purifications to work on to arrived at it. Moral purification is just one of the paths which have to be practiced in conjunction with the other 2 path of purifications. Of course, we also do have the more detail form of the 6 Perfections which do lead to moral perfection.<span>  </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>

                              taught the middle way which is free from extremes. This

              <br> Co-dependently arisen hydrogen and oxygen are empty of water, but       
                                is conventionally called water. Hydrogen and oxygen 
              are not                         attributes of an entity "water" (no such
               thing can be pinned down),                         not contained by an 
              entity called "water", nor is there a "water"                         
              that is "made up of" hydrogen and oxygen. Rather, two hydrogen and      
                                 one oxygen atoms co-dependently arising ARE what is 
              conventionally                         imputed as water.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Self</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Eternalism</strong><br> <br>

              <br> Self view is the held position that there is a self. Self truly exists. 
              Self may be seen as                         attributeless (as some 
              attributeless pure consciousness as in                         advaita),
               or a self that owns or contains attributes, or an agent                
                       that manifests, owns, observes, or controls, its aggregates. 
              The precise view of self varies from eternal, partially eternal, to 
              nihilistic (for a lengthy discourse by Buddha on the numerous "thicket 
              of views", refer to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html</a>).
               From an eternalist perspective, the self remains unchanged despite the 
              changes in life. It remains unchanged even after bodily death. It is 
              either seen as the unchanging self [as an individual soul], or the Self 
              [as an infinite Self or Presence] that is unaffected by the passing 
              aggregates or phenomena.<br> <br> <strong>Nihilism</strong><br> <br>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TtHimayw8IU/T925UHfS5xI/AAAAAAAAAGE/OuxN0R30UPE/s1600/Blank-room.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TtHimayw8IU/T925UHfS5xI/AAAAAAAAAGE/OuxN0R30UPE/s1600/Blank-room.png" alt="" width="288" height="288"></a></div>
              <br> The self does not exist. OR The self in this life annihilates upon death. There is no karma, cause and effect, or rebirth.<br> <br> <strong>Middle Way</strong><br> <br>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2QHGqs13sY/T924eYUSgBI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Q-fAi1FsnHg/s1600/conventional+self.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2QHGqs13sY/T924eYUSgBI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Q-fAi1FsnHg/s1600/conventional+self.png" alt="" width="288" height="266"></a></div>
              <br> Co-dependently arisen five aggregates are empty of self, but is         
                              conventionally called self. Seeing is not a self seeing,
               but is                         simply the experience being seen. 
              Volition is not via a doer, but                         is simply 
              action-activity-process, co-dependently arisen.                         
              Consciousness is not a self, it is simply auditory consciousness        
                               manifested dependent on ear, sound and attention, so on
               and so                         forth. Taste of chocolate has nothing to
               do with a taster but is simply the process or seamless activity of 
              biting, tongue touching chocolate, consciousness of taste, etc. 
              Ultimately, whatever dependently originates is also empty of any true 
              existence (five aggregates are also empty) - but appearances are not 
              denied.<br> <br> <br> <br> Now replace "water" or "self" with anything - mind, matter,             
                          Buddha-nature, Truth, awareness, cars, houses, atoms, 
              universe,                         etc. All applies the same way.<br> <br> Diamond Sutra: "Subhuti, all dharmas are spoken of as no dharmas.                         Therefore they are called dharmas."<br> <br> Anuradha Sutta: "And so, Anuradha — when you can't pin down the         
                              Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life
               — is it                         proper for you to declare, 'Friends, 
              the Tathagata — the supreme                         man, the superlative
               man, attainer of the superlative attainment —                         
              being described, is described otherwise than with these four            
                           positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist
               after                         death, both does &amp; does not exist 
              after death, neither exists                         nor does not exist 
              after death'?"<br> <br> Ted Biringer: "...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not      
                                 contain the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad
               forms – it is                         the myriad forms themselves. The 
              same instruction is provided at                         the beginning of
               Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he                      
                 asserts that, “as all Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho),   
                                    so too, “all dharmas are enlightenment” which he 
              says does not mean                         they are simply “one” nature 
              or mind."<br> <br> Thusness (2008): The key is in "emptiness" so that there is complete non
               abiding and                         (non-)staying (thus avoiding 
              eternalism) and "luminosity" so that there is aliveness and clarity     
                                  without falling into nihilism. <br> <br> <br> Note: does that mean that conventionally self truly exists? No.         
                              Conventional truths are not in fact true nor existing 
              but are                         merely deluded projections as a result 
              of ignorance. Five                         aggregates are deludedly 
              conceived as a self. Such a self may                         
              conventionally be considered true, yet there is actually no truth       
                                to it. It is merely a false name used by the 
              enlightened for                         pragmatic purpose, but taken to 
              be true and existing by the                         ignorant. Nagarjuna:
               "Since the Jina proclaims that nirvana                         alone is
               true, what wise person would not reject the rest as                    
                   false?"<br> <br> The diagrams are inspired by Julian Baggini's speech on Ted talk: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html</a></div>

              <p>Aik TC, I don't agree with Thanissaro Bhikkhu's interpretation, nor is his positions generally supported by the standard orthodox teachings or the teachings of Buddha.<br><br>Do keep this in mind:<br><br><strong>‘’We should carefully heed the two reasons that the Buddha does 
                      not declare, ‘’There is no self’’:  not because he recognizes a 
                      transcendent self of some kind (as some interpreters allege), or because
                       he is concerned only with delineating ‘’a strategy of perception’’ 
                      devoid of ontological implications (as others hold), but (i) because 
                      such a mode of expression was used by the annihilationists, and the 
                      Buddha wanted to avoid aligning his teaching with theirs; and (ii) 
                      because he wished to avoid causing confusion in those already attached 
                      to the idea of self.  The Buddha declares that ‘all phenomena are 
                      nonself’’ (sabbe dhamma anatta), which means that if one seeks a self 
                      anywhere one will not find one.  Since ‘’all phenomena’’ includes both 
                      the conditioned and the unconditioned, this precludes an utterly 
                      transcendent, ineffable self.<br>Part of Note 385 on Page 1457 of The 
                      Connected Discourses of the Buddha  (A New Translation of the Samyutta 
                      Nikaya by Bhikkhu Bodhi).<br><br>.................<br><br></strong><br>It is ironic that Thanissaro's outright attack on Orthodox theravada is now being held up as some type of New Orthodox position.<br>I have little time so I hope this old post from Dhammanando is sufficient to explain:<br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php...33364&amp;st=60">http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index. ... 3364&amp;st=60</a><br>Citing
               the relevant suttas is unlikely to be persuasive  for Thanissaro would 
              simply interpret them differently or else would translate them 
              differently so as to make them support his view. A good example of this 
              is the following passage from the AlagaddÅ«pamasutta, which is one of the
               starkest and most uncompromising assertions of the non-existence of

               the seven renderings above, those of Horner and Law are completely off 
              the map, while the remaining five are more or less defensible so far as 
              purely philological considerations go.<br><br>There are two key terms in
               the passage that give rise to disagreement: firstly, the participle 
              "anupalabbhamÄ�ne"; secondly, the phrase "saccato thetato". How one 
              conceives the meaning of these will determine how one interprets the 
              passage; and how one interprets the passage will determine how one goes 
              about translating it. The problem, of course, is that every translator's
               interpretation of the above phrases will be determined - or at least 
              influenced - by his prior assumptions about the Buddha's teaching.<br><br>Let's
               start with anupalabbhamÄ�ne. This is the present participle of the 
              passive form of the verb upalabhati, inflected in the locative case. In 
              front of it is placed the negative particle na ('not'), which changes to
               an- in accordance with the rules of euphonic junction.<br><br>Upalabhati
               means to obtain, get or find. So in the passive voice it would mean to 
              be obtained, gotten or found. With the addition of the negative particle
               'na' the meaning would be "not to be found."<br><br>Here's one familiar example of the verb, to be found in every Indian logic textbook:<br><br>vañjhÄ�ya putto na upalabbhati.<br>"A son of a barren woman is not to be found."<br><br>(Or
               as western philosophers would phrase it, " 'Son of a barren woman' does
               not obtain."). Elsewhere the same will be predicated of "horns of a 
              hare", "flowers in the sky", etc.<br><br>And here arises the first point
               of controversy among translators and interpreters of this sutta: does 
              the phrase "not to be obtained" mean the same as "not exist"? ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli, 
              Bodhi and myself would answer yes. A mystically-inclined monk like 
              Thanissaro would answer no. Unsurprisingly Thanissaro has chosen a 
              rendering ("not pinned down") that stresses the epistemic or cognitive, 
              and would tend to imply that a self does (or at least might) exist, but 
              one that is too inscrutable to say anything about.<br><br>To continue, 
              when the verb na upalabbhati is made into a present participle, the 
              meaning would be "non-obtaining" (or more precisely, a 
              "not-being-obtained-ness"). When this present participle is inflected in
               the locative case, then various meanings are possible, and here arises 
              the second point of controversy. What function does the locative have in
               this context? There are three possibilities:<br><br>Spatial or situational stipulative: "Where there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br>Temporal stipulative: "When there is a non-obtaining of self...."<br>Causative: "Because there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli,
               Bodhi and I of course favour the causative, for the other two would 
              leave a loophole that there might be some time or place where self does 
              obtain. Thanissaro of course favours a reading that will leave his 
              mysticism intact. So here too it's a case of our prior assumptions 
              determining how we translate.<br><br>Now for "saccato thetato". Sacca 
              means true or a truth; theta means sure, firm, or reliable, or something
               that has these features. Adding the suffix -to turns these words into 
              adverbs. Here I'm not really sure about the relative merits of the above
               translations, or even if there is a difference between "X does not 
              obtain as a truth" or "X does not in truth obtain." Not that this 
              matters greatly; the crux of the matter is obviously the word 
              anupalabbhamÄ�ne. The difference between my old rendering and the 
              ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi one is that I had taken saccato thetato to be an 
              adverbial qualification of anupalabbhamÄ�ne, whereas ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli and Bodhi 
              make it more like an adjectival qualification of "self and what belongs 
              to self." I now think that their rendering is more likely to be correct.
               At least it seems to accord better with the á¹¬Ä«kÄ� to this sutta.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Dhammanando Bhikkhu

              <p>I understand that Buddhism denies that salvation is by grace but

              <p>No. It is not by personal works of merit that we gain liberation from samsara. Merits can only lead you as far as a rebirth in one of the higher planes including so called 'heaven' (which in Buddhist worldview are not eternal places despite their long life).<br><br><strong>Buddhism is far from being just a teaching about morality.</strong> Morality is just a part of it.<br><br>The highest bliss of Nirvana which is achieved in the ending of all mental afflictions (craving, aversion/aggression and delusion) driving the mass of suffering or the cycle of rebirth in samsara, is achievable through the development of wisdom or insight.</p>
              <p>This is why Buddhist practice is more about Awareness, more about discovering the true nature of mind in meditation which leads to liberation. We become aware of the luminous/bright [vivid, aware, cognizant] and empty nature of our minds. We become mindful and aware of our every experience until we penetrate their impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self nature. This leads to dispassion and letting go.</p>
              <p>In addition to 'doing good, avoiding evil', the rather unique teaching of Buddhism is that it stresses also or even more on the 'purification of mind'. But this 'purification of mind' is not an endless endeavor or a kind of 'work'. Rather, purification of mind happens through the arising of wisdom, so it is awareness that naturally leads to the purification of mind and not through mental efforts or acts of suppression. Liberation in Buddhism is <strong>not by works or by grace, but by wisdom.</strong></p>
              <p>Not only has the Buddha achieved liberation, thousands of his students then have achieved liberation, and countless until today have also achieved liberation.</p>
              <p><br><br>p.s. if you achieve Nirvana, it is also impossible that you will commit an immoral act, not because you uphold precepts/rules very well, but simply because the mental afflictions driving immorality: craving, aggression/ill-will, and delusion, has been ended in Wisdom-Awareness. Morality becomes secondary, albeit also important, and is actually automatically fulfilled as your path of wisdom grows.</p>

              <p>When a person lumps and identifies with "Self", when one have to witness what happens when we references ourselves, our interactions revolving around "Self".
                        
                   The cumulative effect of centering our worldview around "Self" carries over at point of death, where clinging over "Self" persist, identifying the consciousness with an identity as "Soul", which reifies one's existence. 
                      
                    However, examining oneself within this lifetime, one will realise one consciousness is conditioned more so by one's present life, and one's "Self", that on an identity of the present life rather than with some  karmic propensities from previous life! 
                      
                  
                   One cannot animate a dead body by infusing "Soul", it has to be born of living beings.  A "Soul" may inhabit a living body, it may leave a living body, but it does not reanimate a dead body!
                         
                       Soul is not central to one identity but created by "Self" consciousness!
                          Only with a body with aggregates is then that we can identify with "Self". 
                              If you investigate further, you even realise that "Self" is formed when only our mental faculties are fully functional, as in thinking and acting out of our free will as an individual.</p>

              In each lives that we live, we carry the karmic propensities we created due to our clinging to "Self" consciousness, and it attracts to a forming life which attracts such propensities.
              Breaking out of samsara means breaking out of this habit of clinging to "Self" in which ever names we care to label.
              Even with a relationship with God also means attachment to  "Self" exist.

              <p>Yes. The sense of self is constructed, it is built. That deluded sense [not reality] of "Self" is formed out of delusion, out of a mental habit of referencing with what we mistakenly view as a 'substantial self' (I, me) and 'that which belongs to self' (mine). The sense of 'self' matures as a person grows up.</p>
              <p>As insight of anatta arises, we realize there never was a doer apart from a deed or a thinker apart from a thought or a seer apart from seeing/sight.<br><br>Then action arises not out of self-consciousness, there is no self-consciousness of an entity apart from action but instead whole being is just action. There is still free flow of will and intentionality but not pertaining to any self.</p>

              <p>Wiki says that the conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.</p>
              <p>Would you like to clarify that further? It would seem that Buddhism holds that conventional truth can be false, but ultimate truth is..well...truth i.e. what is.</p>
              <p>In Christianity the distinction is between truth and error.</p>
              <p>Re the point about the arrow analogy, what would be the underlying message? It would seem to me that you may have taken an either/or approach, i.e. don't ask or get treatment. I think it can be a both/and approach.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, moral perfection means that a person has never sinned against God  throughout his entire life. Which is why I mentioned that it is impossible to attain moral perfection. The Bible also says that it is appointed for man to die once and after that to face judgement, so this means that there is no second chance at life, one life is all we have got.</p>

              <br>Co-dependently arisen hydrogen and oxygen are empty of water, but is conventionally called water. Hydrogen and oxygen are not attributes of an entity "water" (no such thing can be pinned down), not contained by an entity called "water", nor is there a "water" that is "made up of" hydrogen and oxygen. Rather, two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms co-dependently arising ARE what is conventionally imputed as water.<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Self</strong></span><br><br><strong>Eternalism</strong><br><br>

              <br>Self view is the held position that there is a self. Self truly exists. Self may be seen as attributeless (as some attributeless pure consciousness as in advaita), or a self that owns or contains attributes, or an agent that manifests, owns, observes, or controls, its aggregates. The precise view of self varies from eternal, partially eternal, to nihilistic (for a lengthy discourse by Buddha on the numerous "thicket of views", refer to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html</a>). From an eternalist perspective, the self remains unchanged despite the changes in life. It remains unchanged even after bodily death. It is either seen as the unchanging self [as an individual soul], or the Self [as an infinite Self or Presence] that is unaffected by the passing aggregates or phenomena.<br><br><strong>Nihilism</strong><br><br>

              <br>Co-dependently arisen five aggregates are empty of self, but is conventionally called self. Seeing is not a self seeing, but is simply the experience being seen. Volition is not via a doer, but is simply action-activity-process, co-dependently arisen. Consciousness is not a self, it is simply auditory consciousness manifested dependent on ear, sound and attention, so on and so forth. Taste of chocolate has nothing to do with a taster but is simply the process or seamless activity of biting, tongue touching chocolate, consciousness of taste, etc. Ultimately, whatever dependently originates is also empty of any true existence (five aggregates are also empty) - but appearances are not denied.<br><br><br><br>Now replace "water" or "self" with anything - mind, matter, Buddha-nature, Truth, awareness, cars, houses, atoms, universe, etc. All applies the same way.<br><br>Diamond Sutra: "Subhuti, all dharmas are spoken of as no dharmas. Therefore they are called dharmas."<br><br>Anuradha Sutta: "And so, Anuradha — when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life — is it proper for you to declare, 'Friends, the Tathagata — the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment — being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"<br><br>Ted Biringer: "...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not contain the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad forms – it is the myriad forms themselves. The same instruction is provided at the beginning of Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he asserts that, “as all Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho), so too, “all dharmas are enlightenment” which he says does not mean they are simply “one” nature or mind."<br><br>Thusness (2008): The key is in "emptiness" so that there is complete non abiding and (non-)staying (thus avoiding eternalism) and "luminosity" so that there is aliveness and clarity without falling into nihilism.<br><br><br>Note: does that mean that conventionally self truly exists? No. Conventional truths are not in fact true nor existing but are merely deluded projections as a result of ignorance. Five aggregates are deludedly conceived as a self. Such a self may conventionally be considered true, yet there is actually no truth to it. It is merely a false name used by the enlightened for pragmatic purpose, but taken to be true and existing by the ignorant. Nagarjuna: "Since the Jina proclaims that nirvana alone is true, what wise person would not reject the rest as false?"<br><br>The diagrams are inspired by Julian Baggini's speech on Ted talk: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html</a></div>

              <p>No. It is not by personal works of merit that we gain liberation from samsara. Merits can only lead you as far as a rebirth in one of the higher planes including so called 'heaven' (which in Buddhist worldview are not eternal places despite their long life).<br><br><strong>Buddhism is far from being just a teaching about morality.</strong> Morality is just a part of it.<br><br>The highest bliss of Nirvana which is achieved in the ending of all mental afflictions (craving, aversion/aggression and delusion) driving the mass of suffering or the cycle of rebirth in samsara, is achievable through the development of wisdom or insight.</p>
              <p>This is why Buddhist practice is more about Awareness, more about discovering the true nature of mind in meditation which leads to liberation. We become aware of the luminous/bright [vivid, aware, cognizant] and empty nature of our minds. We become mindful and aware of our every experience until we penetrate their impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self nature. This leads to dispassion and letting go.</p>
              <p>In addition to 'doing good, avoiding evil', the rather unique teaching of Buddhism is that it stresses also or even more on the 'purification of mind'. But this 'purification of mind' is not an endless endeavor or a kind of 'work'. Rather, purification of mind happens through the arising of wisdom, so it is awareness that naturally leads to the purification of mind and not through mental efforts or acts of suppression. Liberation in Buddhism is <strong>not by works or by grace, but by wisdom.</strong></p>
              <p>Not only has the Buddha achieved liberation, thousands of his students then have achieved liberation, and countless until today have also achieved liberation.</p>
              <p><br><br>p.s. if you achieve Nirvana, it is also impossible that you will commit an immoral act, not because you uphold precepts/rules very well, but simply because the mental afflictions driving immorality: craving, aggression/ill-will, and delusion, has been ended in Wisdom-Awareness. Morality becomes secondary, albeit also important, and is actually automatically fulfilled as your path of wisdom grows.</p>

              <p>Yes. The sense of self is constructed, it is built. That deluded sense [not reality] of "Self" is formed out of delusion, out of a mental habit of referencing with what we mistakenly view as a 'substantial self' (I, me) and 'that which belongs to self' (mine). The sense of 'self' matures as a person grows up.</p>
              <p>As insight of anatta arises, we realize there never was a doer apart from a deed or a thinker apart from a thought or a seer apart from seeing/sight.<br><br>Then action arises not out of self-consciousness, there is no self-consciousness of an entity apart from action but instead whole being is just action.

              <p>Most people feel that they are an independent separate Self distinct from their experiences, perceptions and action. They feel alienated, self-contracted, distant from the world as a result and they become attached to the sense of I, me, and mine. This is a root cause of delusion and attachment. <br><br>It can be realized that in reality, there never was a seer apart from the act of seeing/seen, a doer apart from an action, hearer apart from heard, etc. <br><br>The experience is one of at-oneness with everything but there is not even an 'I' left to 'feel' the at oneness. Instead there is just one act of perception, one action, happening as crystal clarity without any self, separation or division.<br><br>Athletes do sometimes feel this 'oneness' but only temporarily, even though intentionality is totally factored into their total exertion in action, there is no self consciousness but his entire being is exerted as that intentionality+action. After realization, that feeling can become sort of permanent. And total exertion becomes a natural path of practice.</p>
