              <p>The above description is very close to what the Buddha said. Further, records from Buddhist scriptures match very well with what astronomers of today have found. It is in this manner that the world is returned to the great natural phenomenon of the universe.<br><br>During the first phase of the formation of earth, the earth's crust covering the ground was not fully solidified. The ground surface appeared milky in colour. Looking from the celestial plane, the earth shone brightly and afar. In the heaven of Radiant Lustre, many of those celestial beings whose blissful life in the heaven was coming to an end and who by disposition were more restless and impetuous, on seeing the brightness, and out of curiosity, began to travel down to the earth. They used their "clairvoyance feats" to fly down and reached different continents of the earth. They saw fluid springing out from the ground and they dipped their fingers in it. They tasted the fluid and found it extremely tasty, sweet like honey. While the fluid was so tasty, everyone craved for more. Those who had most, their bodies became rough and heavier. They began to lose their light illusory physical forms and their bodies slowly formed into the material body of bone and flesh. The weight forced them to the ground and they lost their "clairvoyance feats" and "natural heavenly clothes", and were unable to fly through the skies to return to the celestial world. They began to lose many of their intrinsic celestial qualities such as celestial colours, fragrant scent, brightness, beauty, wisdom and their innate miraculous quality. In particular, their "clairvoyance eyes" turned into human eyes; and their "clairvoyance ears" became human ears. They became unable to remember their past lives. They lost their special ability to read the minds of others. They were unable to communicate by radiant light from their mouths and they needed to depend on sounds from the movements of their tongues. While without sufficient languages and vocabulary, they needed sign language to assist them to fully communicate with each other. They became ordinary human beings on earth. After running out of the tasty fluid, they resorted to feed on thick weedy plants, then hard crops from the wild. At that time, the life span of human being was long and there was no disease or sickness. Later, they learned to plant crops and vegetables. During the period of feeding from nature, those who were greedy in feeding themselves acquired darker skin colours, ranging from brown to black. Others who did not feed as much and those who arrived later had lighter skin colour, ranging from fair to yellow. As time went on, together with the influence by climatic conditions of different regions (equatorial, temperate and cold regions), various skin coloured races of people were formed.</p>

              <p>So, you think a six day creation week by an almight God is fictional, mythical, and un-scientific but that your BELIEF that first there was nothing, then something come out of nothing, then over millions of years some of that something become living, and then over millions of years that living something become more complex until it becomes human, is true, fact, and scientific?</p>
              <p>In short, you think that God making the universe is myth but that the universe made itself is fact. I think you have not gone through the thinking process enough to know what that implies.</p>
              <p>BTW, the Biblical account is not un-scientific, but it is certainly written in a non-scientific way. Do you know the difference?</p>

              <p>Oh, so you were just saying that some people in the Judeo-Christian world thought centre of the universe was earth, but you do not agree that the Bible teaches this. If so, I'm perfectly fine with that. BTW, it wasn't just Christians who believed that, almost everyone at that time believed that, since that was really the Aristotelian worldview which the church also subscribed to, without Biblical basis. The same problem exists today that many Christians also subscribed to the evolution worldview which is contrary to what the Bible plainly teaches.</p>

              <p>Oh, so you were just saying that some people in the
                  Judeo-Christian world thought centre of the universe was earth, but
                  you do not agree that the Bible teaches this. If so, I'm perfectly
                  fine with that. BTW, it wasn't just Christians who believed that,
                  almost everyone at that time believed that, since that was really
                  the Aristotelian worldview which the church also subscribed to,
                  without Biblical basis. The same problem exists today that many
                  Christians also subscribed to the evolution worldview which is
                  contrary to what the Bible plainly teaches.</p>

You have to agree to this if you wish to be scientific. The universe did not exist in space, that would be a wrong understanding. The universe is the totality of time, space and matter." </span></p>

              <p>You said that Buddha is all-knowing, you mean omniscient as traditionally an attribute of God?</p>
              <p>So now you you have qualified your statement that we were all originally Buddha to mean having the potential to become Buddha. It would seem to be a wrong choice of words you used as it conveys a completely different idea! Of course, it is a matter of debate as to whether anyone can become a Buddha. Given the Buddhist's premise that we have infinity past or countless lives, we should all have become Buddhas already. It's the same with the idea of an eternal universe. If it were true, we would have reached heat death infinite time ago. But since we have not, then clearly the universe is not eternal.</p>
              <p>Sin doesn't come from anywhere. Sin is disobedience against God. It first took root in Satan, and then man. Only free-will moral creatures can sin. God gave free will to angels and man, who then exercised the wrong choice.</p>

              <p>While the meaning of a word may change over time due to usage, it only means there are more than one meaning to the word depending on the context.

              <p>all ur answers i see had always being in the context of Bible/Creation, and it also make u want to hear answers <span style="line-height: 1.231;">that are more in the context of Bible. But </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">while mine is in context of Buddhism. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Buddhism talks about C</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ontinuum/Change</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. </span></p>
              <p>sometimes, it's quite far-fetched to say a person did an act (as in died at the cross) and this act had "paid" for our sins. so it can be any kind of act like even traveling around the world by foot, or climb the highest mountain, etc?. and that act had said to "finish" another act(of payment). a bit magical to me. </p>

              <p>You said that Buddha is all-knowing, you mean omniscient as
                              traditionally an attribute of God?</p>
              <p>So now you you have qualified your statement that we were all
                              originally Buddha to mean having the potential to become Buddha. It
                              would seem to be a wrong choice of words you used as it conveys a
                              completely different idea! Of course, it is a matter of debate as
                              to whether anyone can become a Buddha. Given the Buddhist's premise
                              that we have infinity past or countless lives, we should all have
                              become Buddhas already. It's the same with the idea of an eternal
                              universe. If it were true, we would have reached heat death
                              infinite time ago. But since we have not, then clearly the universe
                              is not eternal.</p>
              <p>Sin doesn't come from anywhere. Sin is disobedience against God.
                              It first took root in Satan, and then man. Only free-will moral
                              creatures can sin. God gave free will to angels and man, who then
                              exercised the wrong choice.</p>

              <p> Buddha is truely <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">omniscient, but omnipotent need more explaination, and clarification due to karma. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Though Buddha is the highest enlightened beings with unconceiveable spiritual 
                          power, he is unable to do the following: </span></p>
              <p>1. to eliminate or change the 
                          karmic retribution <br>2. to cross over those who reject Buddhism <br>3. to 
                          cross over the entire sentient beings in the Dharma Realms </p>
              <p>Buddha attained Buddhahood the 8000 times stated in Lotus Sutra. if Buddha said that one can be lost again after Buddhahood, then no one will want to become Buddha. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">universe is not eternal? then after heaven, it become eternal? another magical saying. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if everything happen in a loop or cycle, then there's no issue. </span></p>
              <p>have u imagine living eternally and what would it take to live eternally? would it be bore after some very long time? that's when change/freshness is helpful in an eternal living. </p>
              <p>where Satan come from? seems like there's always discrimination in Bible. but in Buddhism we are to get rid of <span style="line-height: 1.231;">discrimination</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> aka dualism in the end.</span></p>
