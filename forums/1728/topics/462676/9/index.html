              You are an entity currently  being in existence. Your consciousness belongs to your living body, part of your functionality of being human, which when you die your body no longer carries the consciousness anymore. Your "I" is simply a process, that's why you are unable find any where in the body "I".

              means by which we communicate truths, real truths. If words cannot
              communicate truth, then it also means they cannot communicate
              ultimate truths, and any distinction between so-called conventional
              and ultimate truths becomes incoherent and meaningless. Language is
              more than just a convenient way of relating objective and
              subjective, it really communicates what is has happened, is
              happening, or perhaps what will happen. You said "I" is a finger
              pointing to an occurrence, but what occurred? And who is the "one"
              that moves on? Again I hope you see the problem with denying the
              existence of self. I know it may seem that I am actually
              challenging a central tenet of Buddhism, but I hope I am not
              causing offense to you or any Buddhist here, anymore than I would
              be offended that atheists challenge me on the existence of God
              issue.</p>

                Living being strive to live, it is an intrinsic part being alive. Only "I" of a person is capable of being jealous or any other emotions. Anger,selfishness, ignorance, desire, jealousy and pride all bring us misery. Being jealous is only relevant if "I" am alive and make a person unhappy because we crave to possess the object of our desire and wish to own it exclusively. Because "I" is mainly a construct, not found anywhere within the body, we accept it is simply of process of being human.

              categorised under idle speculation. Why? Because it assumes wrongly
              that self is nothing but matter. It is not. It is like trying to
              ask which part of you is jealous when you see your girlfriend
              talking to another guy. The person consists of both the material
              and the immaterial. If the person is dead you call it a corpse, the
              word implying the loss of something inherent that makes a living
              person alive. It is the same question like asking who caused God?
              But by definition an eternal God has no beginning and thus begs no
              cause. So the question is mistaken and meaningless to begin with,
              unless one assumes a wrong view of God as one that has a beginning.
              But that's not the view of the God spoken of in the Bible.</p>

              If you wish to say God is a process, a principle that embodies everything within the universe, then it needs neither accepting or not accepting because it, God simply is.  No need to press the fact, 
              as God neither needs our approval or acceptence to exist.

              By the way I am not offended by you challenging any the tenets of Buddhism. If it serves as a good practice to see if there is any false views I may be holding that my peers here may correct me.
              The less "I" view I have, the less there is any negative emotions to arise. 
              It makes more mindful that I may have is the lack of wisdom and skilful means to articulate more effectively.

              I understand the possible breeding of ill will.
              However, we are within a confine of a Buddhist discussion forum to raise awareness.
               And also personally refining my views especially if I am holding any false views. Also,neither is there any conscious attempt to denigrate.
              The Lord Buddha did not steer away for any debate, we should emulate his compassion.
              Another thing to ponder, Mangala Suttanta, discourse on blessings,of which one sentence:"religious discussion at due season, that is the highest blessing."

              <p>You have misunderstood. It is not about pushing the blame on some animal or on Jesus. It is about atonement for sin to escape the wrath of a holy God who must judge sin. Animal sacrifices in the OT was a temporary provision for atoning for sins. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. ThatÂ blood must be shed reflects the seriousness of sin.Â But Christ, being the perfect sinless Son of God, died once and for all. He laid down His life willingly for us. You may not like this but I would argueÂ that one's likes or dislikes does not negate a truth.Â Â ChristiansÂ are toÂ avoid sinning but when they do fall into sin, they can seek forgiveness in Christ's finished work on the cross. No more animal sacrifices, and neither does Christ need to die again.Â Â </p>

              <p>I think that's where the danger of reductionism (we are nothing but atoms etc) or deconstructionism (we are made up of parts) lies, it removes personhood. Take a car for example, it is not the parts that make the car. You can have a junkyard full of parts but no car. You have the materials to make the car, but you can still have no car. What is the difference? It is the application of intelligence, information, or MIND if you like.</p>
              <p>Likewise, breaking down the human beingÂ into little parts (sounds gross!) only prove the point of what we are made up of, but it does not mean we are nothing but such things or just the sum of those things. Like I mentioned before, a corpse has everything you need but it is just not alive. When God created Adam from the dust of the earth (know you know why humans sometimes treat each other like dirt! LOL!) Adam was not a corpse since he was never alive to begin with. But God "breathed" life into Adam and he became a nephesh chayah, a living soul/person.Â It is the very image of God in which we are created that makes us special. We are not re-arranged pondscum.</p>

              <p>Misunderstood you indeed have.</p>
              <p>Jesus laid down His life on His own accord. He CHOSE to do His Father's will. In His humanity He obeyed His Father even unto the cross. In John 10:17 Jesus said, "This is why the Father loves meâbecause I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again.Â No one takes it away from me, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I lay it down of my own free will.</span></strong> I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again." In His humanity Jesus prayed and asked if the cup of suffering can pass by, and we know that it can. In Matt 26:53 Jesus said at the time of His arrest, "Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?" In the same way, in His humanity Jesus experienced the separation between God and man while He was on the cross bearing the sins of the whole world. It was a cry that pointed back to the OT Scripture, it was also to signify that the OT was being fulfilled in Christ, in that the work of atonement is being accomplished.</p>
              <p>BTW, God is not an old man.</p>
              <p>Jesus said, "No one has greater love than thisâthat one lays down his life for his friends." Acts of sacrifices are being done all over the world, we know of many who did so in the gun tragedy in the US. The teachers and staff willingly sacrificed themselves for the kids. The kids should not feel righteous (for that was not the purpose of saving their lives) but the kids should feel loved and treasured. Now you asked me, will I lay down my life for you? That depends on the purpose of the sacrifice, wouldn't it? It would be silly to die just because you ask me to!</p>

              <p>I don't think it is meaningless at all. Debating, not mere rhetoric or polemic, will help us to see how robust our beliefs are and whether it can withstand examination. I think theÂ way we debate is just asÂ important as what weÂ debate. We should let the debateÂ or rather, discussion, be cordial and maintain harmony. WeÂ judge (in the sense of trying to discern right from wrong, truth from error) views,Â and not judge the person holding theÂ views. Thus we refrain from personal attack or character assassination.Â Â </p>

              <p>You are an entity currently being in existence. Your consciousness belongs to your living body, part of your functionality of being human, which when you die your body no longer carries the consciousness anymore. Your "I" is simply a process, that's why you are unable find any where in the body "I".</p>

              <p>Living being strive to live, it is an intrinsic part being alive. Only "I" of a person is capable of being jealous or any other emotions. Anger,selfishness, ignorance, desire, jealousy and pride all bring us misery. Being jealous is only relevant if "I" am alive and make a person unhappy because we crave to possess the object of our desire and wish to own it exclusively. Because "I" is mainly a construct, not found anywhere within the body, we accept it is simply of process of being human.</p>
              <p>If you wish to say God is a process, a principle that embodies everything within the universe, then it needs neither accepting or not accepting because it, God simply is. No need to press the fact,<br>as God neither needs our approval or acceptence to exist.</p>

              <p>1. The human being is body/soul/spirit, comprising the material and immaterial aspects. The body is the house whereas the self is the occupant if you like, it is complete and whole in this way. And because the self or "I" is the immaterial aspect it therefore makes little sense to ask where the "I" is located. Just like you cannot locate love, hate, fear, or thoughts.</p>
              <p>2. Words are words, we use them to communicate. Truth claims can be true or false. That is what we try to examine as best as we can.</p>
              <p>3. See #1 above. Just because we cannot locate an "I" in the body it does not mean there is no "I" or "self" or "me" to speak of. Again the point is that we are not just matter, but spirit/soul too.</p>
              <p>4. The Bible does not teach God as a process, much less an all-encompassing or embracing principle. The Bible teaches that God is a Person, a Spirit who created the universe and all that is in it, be it things visible or invisible. God is distinct from His creation, and so should not be identified with the creation, or seen as being part of the creation.</p>

              <p>3.

              <p>4. Being killed by a car is conventional efficacy of cause and effect. But it does not mean however that car has substantial core or existence ultimately. Everything being dependently originated is empty ultimately. Empty does not mean non-existing but empty of a substantial core, unchanging, independent existence.<br><br>2. Redness is an experience of vision in human kind. You cannot speak of redness apart from vision. Redness is a dependently originated phenomena, neither existing in mind nor in outer objects, for both mind and outer objects are conventions for dependently originated activities that are empty and cannot be pinned down as a substantial entity.<br><br>Anyway there is an interesting article by Kyle:</p>

              <p>1. AgreedÂ (albeit reluctantly) insofar as you are saying that the universe is a contingent "entity" though I would not call it illusory or empty or lack inherent existence as such terms can give wrong impression and you need to qualify them always.</p>
              <p>2. Reality is simply what is, it should not be treated as an entity or spoken as if it is. Actually I don't think people hae a problem with this at all.Â </p>
              <p>3. If someone is killed by a car, then that is the reality and the truth, regardless of whether you see it as conventional or ultimate. Again the issue of the car being a contingent thing is not in dispute, though the use of the word "empty" IMO is most unfortunate.</p>
              <p>4. A blind person has nothing to see as he cannot see at all. So yes, colour and vision goes hand in hand though I would not go to the extent of saying that vision = color. Our eyes are designed and created (by God) for the purpose of seeing. And a properly working eye with brain functions will result in a seeing of colour for human beings.</p>

Take a car for example, it is not the parts that make the car. You can have a junkyard full of parts but no car. You have the materials to make the car, but you can still have no car.

              <p>I thought Buddhism isÂ not about nothingness? (pardon the play on words) Emptiness is not nothingness was what I think I heard from some others here.</p>

              <p>And this "God" is not an entity but some kind of ethereal presence that permeates everything? Now it sounds like pantheism, if it is not monism.</p>

              <p>Just look from the perspective of realization. The original teachings of Buddha did not stress too much about it, but nonetheless it cannot be denied that there is such a realization.<br><br>We stress more on the realization of anatta and emptiness that liberates self view and suffering.<br><br>However it does not mean anatta and emptiness is a dead nothingness. There is a total intelligence, total vitality and total clarity of pure consciousness. The Buddha also talks about a "luminous mind" that is merely temporarily obscured from our view by adventitious defilements (such as our attachment to 'self'). However because our view of anatta and emptiness is nonsubstantialist, ultimately Buddhism is not to be labelled as a kind of pantheism since we are careful to be free of any kind of substantialist view. Our Buddha Nature is known as the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. One must neither skew towards emptiness or to luminosity. We say that Hinduism skews towards luminosity, and certain teachings that preach emptiness intellectually might be skewing towards emptiness. The luminous presence is very important but the moment we form an image or concept about it and grasp after it, we have missed its nature, we have 'defiled' it with our notions so we have to cleanse it with the truth of anatta and emptiness.<br><br>Also, for example the luminous factor is also spoken in a Dzogchen tantra (not by Buddha though, a later text expounded in the Tibetan tradition) 'the all creating king':<br><em><br> </em></p>

              <p>Just look from the perspective of realization. The original teachings of Buddha did not stress too much about it, but nonetheless it cannot be denied that there is such a realization.<br><br>We stress more on the realization of anatta and emptiness that liberates self view and suffering.<br><br>However it does not mean anatta and emptiness is a dead nothingness. The Buddha also talks about a "luminous mind" that is merely temporarily obscured from our view by adventitious defilements (such as our attachment to 'self'). However because our view of anatta and emptiness is nonsubstantialist, ultimately Buddhism is not to be labelled as a kind of pantheism. Our Buddha Nature is known as the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. One must neither skew towards emptiness or to luminosity. We say that Hinduism skews towards luminosity, and certain teachings that preach emptiness intellectually might be skewing towards emptiness. The luminous presence is very important but the moment we form an image or concept about it and grasp after it, we have missed its nature, we have 'defiled' it with our notions so we have to cleanse it with the truth of anatta and emptiness.<br><br>Also, for example the luminous factor is also spoken in a Dzogchen tantra (not by Buddha though, a later text expounded in the Tibetan tradition) 'the all creating king':<br><em><br></em></p>

This self-arising fundamental substance, not produced by causes and condition, governs all things and gives life to all things ... As my nature is unhindered and all-pervading, it is the celestial abode of wisdom and luminous space: therein abides only self-arising wisdom. As I am the substance whence everything arises, the five great elements, the three worlds [i.e. the worlds of Desire, Form, and Formlessness] and the six classes of beings [hell-denizens, ghosts, animals, humans, Titans, and gods] are only my body, my voice, and my mind: I myself create my own nature ...

              <p>1. So everyone of "us" is actually I AMness but man just don't know it? Or man knows it on an intellectual level but not in a realisation level?</p>
              <p>2. Why would the "supreme source" refers to "I"? Why does it speaks as if it is a Person? Is this supreme source an impersonal force or a personal being?</p>
