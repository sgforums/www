              <p>When there is void in biblical basis, Bible is a religion that is about EQ and IQ stuff, and it also deals with psychology and philosophy. It is not easy to achieve heaven, benevolence without boundary is the only way. In bible there is no tell tale signs of the realms the corpse or the dead is attaining. So, when buddhists are helping you religion to have faith in God, you are going back to yes/no basis of God, in which, in the name of God, may you be commanded to be faithful and learn from Buddhism :)</p>

              <p>Again you confused a truth issue with a posture issue. Either God exists or He does not, it is a truth issue. Your interest in this issue is a posture issue. Your apathy or "can't be bothered" attitude is a posture issue. It does not answer the question. Instead it throws up smoke by saying that the question is speculative, meaningless, asker not mature etc etc. Again silence can be a reflection of ignorance, or a disguise of ignorance.</p>
              <p>The "Does God exist?" question is to be answered with "Yes, No, or I don't know". You only answer with "I don't care" if the question is "What do you personally think or feel about the question of whether God exist or not?" So I am only pressing you to answer the right question. To say I am forcing you is to exaggerate things. I will be happy with an "I don't know" answer from you. But take note that I will also ask, "Then don't you want to know?"</p>
              <p>Every worldview has its "problems" so to speak. Even though I believe Christianity is true, my understanding of it is limited, thus it is inevitable that there will be questions posed by critics that I have difficulty answering. But we all are entitled to invoking a rescue device to maintain our worldview. The question is whether this rescue device is arbitrary and ad hoc with no good basis. Use it often enough and the cracks in the worldview will quickly show. Yes, we try to fit explanations to our worldview, EVERYONE does that. It is a paradigm thing. We will see with it until we realise that it cannot cope and we then change paradigm, or change lenses, or change worldview, or change religion.</p>
              <p>Having a discussion would be consistent with being broadminded, though it does not necessarily means being broadminded. But then again, a narrow minded person would not want to discuss anything, would he? What's there to discuss anyway? It is disagreement that encourages dialogue and discussion. If everyone agrees, then there is no need to discuss.</p>

              <p>the issue here is the agenda of "why must we know if god exists a not" in the discussion of religion, respecting the other religions is of utmost importance. However, in the push for an answer which does not mean that much to other religions, thats not respecting. You have confused your own belief in the question of "god's existence" to be answered with other religions. In actual fact, i believe you've undermined other religions. It is in xtian worldview that the arguement for god's existance existed and so why would it be an essential question to buddhist?</p>
              <p>"i dont care" in here, is a legitimate answer, because it doesn't matter. He exist, he doesn't exists doesn't matter to me at all. Once again, it is in YOUR worldview, YOUR religious believes that he either has to or not has to exist. But for us(or me) we are NOT interested on the issue whether he exists or not even. You may feel im avoiding or im a non thinker, but no, it is through thinking that ppl came out with a " i dont care" or there's "no need to care" reply. Step out of the circle and stop burying.</p>
              <p>Lastly, spare some respect for others. When others gives you a reply you do not want, spare some respect for if all you want is a reply that suits you, all you need to do is to keep asking yourself... and the same reply will keep occuring.</p>

                  How is "I don't care" a thoughtful answer???
                  
                  <p>Neither is it a legitimate answer because it does not even attempt to answer the question. The question of God's existence is perhaps the most fundamental and essential questions ever asked by man. It is unfortunate that for a religion that positions itself as deeply philosophical it cavalierly brushes aside a question that is perhaps the most important and most debated ever. The implications of the existence of God reaches deep and wide, so to say that it doesn't matter would reflect how out of touch one is with human needs and desires.
              
              </p><p>Last but not least, it is considered disrespectful to answer "I don't care" to a reasonable question. Try answering that to the PM or your parents or even the judge in a court room if he ask you a question?

              <p>1. As mentioned elsewhere, countless rebirth would mean infinity and thus practically if not absolutely impossible. Imagine someone telling you that it takes countless number of attempts to get a driving license. Does that make you anymore hopeful that you would get it this time, or the next? Wouldn't it be really just wishful thinking?</p>
              <p>2. I used to think that Nirvana was a place, then I was corrected on it. And now I take the view that true Buddhism teaches Nirvana is a psychological state of mind. There is no material observable physical difference between one person who has attained nirvana and another person who has not.</p>
              <p>3. Does Buddhism teach annihilism/nihilism? You keep saying that I fell for this extreme view. But I take the view that if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. There are many ideas in Buddhism that easily lends to this conclusion. Extinguishing is one of them. No-self is another. Taking the Middle Way is trying to explain something that is neither here nor there. It can also result in Buddhists speaking in self-negating and self-refuting terms but somehow still accepted as logical and true.</p>
              <p>Interesting also is the view of noted philosopher Frederick Nietzsche here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thus-spoke-nietzsche.tumblr.com/post/19194412041/nietzsche-on-buddhism">http://thus-spoke-nietzsche.tumblr.com/post/19194412041/nietzsche-on-buddhism</a></p>
              <p>4. I still think that to avoid the unnecessary confusion, Buddhists should use terms like contingent beings and necessary beings which are better easily understood among philosophy.</p>

              <p>1. The facts speak for themselves concerning the importance of the question of God's importance. In any case, your failure to grasp the importance and implications of this question does not invalidate its importance at all.</p>
              <p>2. The existence of God impacts upon the meaning of life, the purpose of life, and also the moral values.</p>
              <p>3. I wasn't defining anything when I said that Buddhism evades the question of God. Merely making an observation.</p>
              <p>4. Disrespectful to the asker. And yes, the question of God's existence is a very reasonable question. It is asked and pontificated on every philosophy's textbook, debated in public and online, and even appears in Buddhist websites. Apparently people are asking this question. You can't missed it, unless you wilfully choose to ignore it.</p>
              <p>5. Why would the question of God's existence not be a real question? What defines a real question? Regardless of the content of the question I am just saying that it is disrespectful to respond with apathy towards a reasonable question.</p>
              <p>6. Sorry, I do not buy the false notion that whats true for you is true for you but not for me. Is such a notion just true for you but not for me? Or do you expect that notion to be true for both you and me? If so, then you have just stepped on your own feet and contradicted yourself.</p>

              <p>considering the 6 realms of existences. it's extremely rare as stated in Buddhism to be born a human. as the analogy goes, if u place a ring in the ocean and expect a turtle to surface right into the ring is a human rebirth. and even if u are born human, enlightenment is also not easy in the sense, u do not encounter the Buddha or his dharma. its way much much more difficult then winning a toto. the chance is almost zero.  one have to build up affinities. sometimes, it's also about whether one is still attached to desire realm. like the monkey trap. how to u expect the monkey to release its hands? u can't, as its too attached.</p>
              <p>u need to check for yourself on Bliss/rewarding body. all Buddhas and some bodhisattvas has it.</p>
              <p>not-self also does not deny the <em>idea</em> of self. self keep changing, hence the meaning of no self/emptiness. object are also changing of atoms/energy, hence the meaning of emptiness. in lay man term, if one cannot understand the profundity, it's just plain selflessness/not to be selfish.</p>
              <p>see link for the benefits of <em>emptiness</em>.</p>

              <p>Buddhism aim is to want us to let go of attachment. as in the monkey trap example. Everything is false IS part of the teaching of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>considering the 6 realms of existences. it's extremely rare as stated in Buddhism to be born a human. as the analogy goes, if u place a ring in the ocean and expect a turtle to surface right into the ring is a human rebirth. and even if u are born human, enlightenment is also not easy in the sense, u do not encounter the Buddha or his dharma. its way much much more difficult then winning a toto. the chance is almost zero.  one have to build up affinities. sometimes, it's also about whether one is still attached to desire realm. like the monkey trap. how to u expect the monkey to release its hands? u can't, as its too attached.</p>
              <p>u need to check for yourself on Bliss/rewarding body. all Buddhas and some bodhisattvas has it.</p>
              <p>not-self also does not deny the <em>idea</em> of self. self keep changing, hence the meaning of no self/emptiness. object are also changing of atoms/energy, hence the meaning of emptiness. in lay man term, if one cannot understand the profundity, it's just plain selflessness/not to be selfish.</p>
              <p>see link for the benefits of <em>emptiness</em>.</p>

              <p>Buddhism aim is to want us to let go of attachment. as in the monkey trap example. Everything is false IS part of the teaching of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>1. I don't know if it is indeed extremely rare to be born a human, considering the population growth explosion in the last century alone. Furthermore, if the chance is almost zero, any hope you may have to attain it in this life is depressingly remote. You can only hope that you don't come back as an ant in the next life which would really set things back.</p>
              <p>2. Re the Blissful body, I am interested to know how it is like. Is there anyone alive now who has this?</p>
              <p>3. The idea of a changing self is problematic. I think it is a result of confusion between the immaterial "I" versus the physical body that changes throughout one's life. Yes, things do change over time, but I think it is rather erroneous to call it emptiness.</p>
              <p>4. Thanks for the book link. Re the point about letting go of attachment. I think the issue is not attachment per se, but what one is attached to. Should one be attached to Buddha's teaching? Should one seek to be free of samsara? Should one desire the attainment of nirvana? Should one desire not to have any desire?</p>

              <p>yea, people tends to use the living beings on this earth only. like say we have 10 billion world systems in one Buddhaland, and not to mention hell and heavenly realms. Buddha also use another analogy to explain the rareness of human encountering dharma by grabing fine sands and releasing them, the number of sands that are left inside his finger nails. Buddha also pointed that ants are the most stubborn beings. 7 Buddhas were Born before they are reborn into higher realms. samsara is indeed a infinity rebirth. to get out, the monkey just don't grab the food, and it will be free! u can say if u miss this train, then to the next life, u might not know the next encountering could be, given how our karmic wind may blow, as Xtian may say forever in hell, but for us is a very very long time in samsara. however an affinity with dharma, is a seed planted in the subconsciousness, and that seed will grow into fruition one day.</p>

              <p>in the sense dharma is only like medicine that u take and cure attachment. when u talk a boat to the other shore, u leave the boat behind. dharma is just a teaching tool. i think u heard that. and yes it's indepthness will also lead to the detachment of dharma and attaining nirvana, and returning back to samsara to help others, selflessly forever.  the ultimate happiness/bliss is not just nirvana but helping others åŠ©äººä¸ºå¿«ä¹�ä¹‹æœ¬ its the root cause of bliss. when u reached the end of the road, there's actually no reward. the reward IS the way there. the Right attachment is Right Mindfulness, a practice of Buddhism. yes, sometimes u do need to use posion to cure posion per se.  non attachment is only the first stage, there's second stage of non-discrimination and third, non-wandering thoughts or Equanimity. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">its ok to attached to helping others giving that one had already realised not-self. as there's no suffering or karma without a self. </span></p>

After offering this analogy, the Buddha<br>would pose the question, “What happened to the snake when the<br>coil of rope was recognized?” The answer is, nothing. Nothing<br>happened to the snake because there never was one.<br>So, similarly, when people ask, “What happens to the self<br>when the body dies?” The answer is basically the same. The<br>whole conception of the self is based upon a misapprehension, so<br>the question doesn’t apply. The way we see our “selves” is a fundamental<br>misapprehension that needs to be corrected.

              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Why would the question of God's existence not be a real question' -&gt; why should it? </div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'What defines a real question? ' -&gt; what do you think?</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Regardless of the content of the question I am just saying that it is disrespectful to respond with apathy towards a reasonable question.' -&gt; again, to you. The answer itself is apathy. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>6. Sorry, I do not buy the false notion that whats true for you is true for you but not for me. Is such a notion just true for you but not for me? Or do you expect that notion to be true for both you and me? If so, then you have just stepped on your own feet and contradicted yourself.</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'the false notion that whats true for you is true for you but not for me.' -&gt; you determine what's right and wrong? LOL.</div>
              <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Or do you expect that notion to be true for both you and me? If so, then you have just stepped on your own feet and contradicted yourself.' -&gt; LOL!! You're really cracking me up. Whether you choose or don't choose, your choice is right for you. LOL! did I step on my feet ? LOL!!! </div>

              <p>1. The facts which I have laid out which you failed to see. I spoke about the fact that the question of God's existence is one that has been asked since antiquity, that it is addressed in philosophy, and that there are debates (online and public) that are being conducted on this. If this does not speak to the importance of the issue then I don't know what does.</p>
              <p>2. The "true for you not for me" and "speak for yourself" retort is vacuous. It also show that you have not been able to refute or rebutt my arguments. Again apathy is not the relevant answer. You have confused your response with an answer. If you leave an MCQ unanswered because you did not care, the MCQ is still not answered!</p>
              <p>3. Yes, you did step on your own feet. Even more tragic is that you failed to discern the self-refuting nature of your own beliefs.</p>

              <p>yea, people tends to use the living beings on this earth only. like say we have 10 billion world systems in one Buddhaland, and not to mention hell and heavenly realms. Buddha also use another analogy to explain the rareness of human encountering dharma by grabing fine sands and releasing them, the number of sands that are left inside his finger nails. Buddha also pointed that ants are the most stubborn beings. 7 Buddhas were Born before they are reborn into higher realms. samsara is indeed a infinity rebirth. to get out, the monkey just don't grab the food, and it will be free! u can say if u miss this train, then to the next life, u might not know the next encountering could be, given how our karmic wind may blow, as Xtian may say forever in hell, but for us is a very very long time in samsara. however an affinity with dharma, is a seed planted in the subconsciousness, and that seed will grow into fruition on day.</p>

              <p>in the sense dharma is only like medicine that u take and cure attachment. when u talk a boat to the other shore, u leave the boat behind. dharma is just a teaching tool. i think u heard that. and yes it's indepthness will also lead to the detachment of dharma and attaining nirvana, and returning back to samsara to help others, selflessly forever.  the ultimate happiness/bliss is not just nirvana but helping others åŠ©äººä¸ºå¿«ä¹�ä¹‹æœ¬ its the root cause of bliss. when u reached the end of the road, there's actually no reward. the reward IS the way there. the Right attachment is Right Mindfulness, a practice of Buddhism. yes, sometimes u do need to use posion to cure posion per se.  non attachment is only the first stage, there's second stage of non-discrimination and third, non-wandering thoughts or Equanimity. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">its ok to attached to helping others giving that one had already realised not-self. as there's no suffering or karma without a self. </span></p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 16px;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #888888;">The Buddha’s analogy of the snake and the rope is very relevant<br>here. Suppose you are walking along through the grass when<br>suddenly you see a circular shape on the pathway. It looks like a<br>snake, and you become frozen with fear. But when you look<br>closely you see that it’s not a snake at all, it’s just a coil of rope.<br>Relief rushes through your body and the fear disappears.<br>Everything is OK again. After offering this analogy, the Buddha<br>would pose the question, “What happened to the snake when the<br>coil of rope was recognized?” The answer is, nothing. Nothing<br>happened to the snake because there never was one.<br>So, similarly, when people ask, “What happens to the self<br>when the body dies?” The answer is basically the same. The<br>whole conception of the self is based upon a misapprehension, so<br>the question doesn’t apply. The way we see our “selves” is a fundamental<br>misapprehension that needs to be corrected. The practice<br>is about learning to see clearly, to awaken to what really is.”</span></span></span></h5>

              <p>The concept of no-self or non-attachment is not hard to grasp, though I would argue that it is rather irrational. As a buddhist it would seem to me that you have understood this, then why aren't you considered enlightened? I mean, if Buddha sat under the Bo tree to understand something that has eluded man, and assuming he has communicated it correctly, then followers should also be able to be enlightened just like him. Isn't it pretty much a knowledge issue? The solution is "no-self", right?</p>
