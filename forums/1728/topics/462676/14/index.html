              <p>After reading your replies, I have to accept what you said. I don't want to comment anything about God. I felt outsiders will think I'm not showing respect.</p>
              <p>All the questions I asked points at <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>how people interpret their God</strong></span>. Practically speaking, you think what God is and you say God is everything. I have no choice but to end further discussions.</p>
              <p>Pardon me being straightforward, what you said is sound contradictory. For example, in 1, you said self is not permanent... i thought all along self is permanent in Christianity... then suddenly now it changed there is no permanent self because the Bible say so.</p>
              <p>In the earlier post you said the universe has a beginning, but when i pose the question of permanence in my previous post, you said God sustains it. Then my question of whether permanence is valid or not becomes side-tracked. Conveniently.</p>
              <p>I mentioned that it is the wisdom of our ancestors that provide what we have today. Otherwise i think we don't even know how to grow rice. But you attributed the wisdom or intelligence to the God you mentioned. The counter-question you asked makes me wonder what you mean, arguing back again why i felt regrettable.<br><br>If I were to tell my friends about this, they will think you damn ungrateful lot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The question you asked: how good is good? I really don't how to reply. Is good quantitative...? Measurable or comparable..? Or even perfect? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You have been cordial, but the replies shows that you don't understand and tries to put God in the front picture, leaving us no alternatives.<br><br>I got a sense of ill-will from you when i read the last paragraph. Describing yourself as a soldier to lay down the weapon and fight the enemies.</p>
              <p>Anyway.... that's not the main point. I have already mentioned debating fundamental difference in religions is pointless (in fact, very early in this thread). No matter how much you bring in Christian concepts is wasting your time and effort here. You can't bring in Christian values to question emptiness, karma etc etc.... It doesn't fit!</p>

              <p><br>1. Thanks for reading my replies. It is perfectly fine by me if you choose to offer your comments. I am not easily offended by fair and thought-out comments.</p>
              <p>2. The fact that people have various views/interpretations about God does not detract or negate the fact that objective truth about God exists. Logically not all views are equally true.</p>
              <p>3. What you saw as contradictory is really more of your misunderstanding.Remember, a contradiction takes the form that A is non-A at the same time in the same sense. The Bible does not teach a permanent self in the sense that Buddhism says. Only God is eternal, everything else is contingent upon God. The only "permanent" self to speak of would be God Himself who is self-existing and uncaused and the ground of all that exist.</p>
              <p>4. Since the universe has a beginning, it cannot be permanent in the Buddhist sense of having "inherent existence" of itself. The universe is a contingent entity, brought into existence by an eternal all powerful God. God, who is eternal, can sustain the universe for as long as He wishes, even for all eternity. Again the source of this sustenance is God.</p>
              <p>5. You are mistaken if you think I am undermining the wisdom of our forefathers. My point is that only God can explain why human beings are intelligent. All other naturalistic explanations fall flat as inadequate to account for what needs to be explained.</p>
              <p>6. I am asking about the standard of good you use to call something good. And yes, I was referring to moral perfection.</p>
              <p>7. I am not so much putting God in the front picture as much as putting God in the whole picture. Apart from God, nothing can be explained. God's world must be seen through God's Word to be understood and seen correctly.</p>
              <p>8. The soldier analogy is just that, no ill will intended. The Bible uses the metaphor of war, battle, soldier many times.</p>
              <p>9. I think the main point is to compare and contrast the two religions in some ways, to see similarities and appreciate the differences. Ultimately what we have are two worldviews, or ways of looking at the world to make sense of the world we live in. They are two fundamentally different worldviews. Logically both cannot be true at the same time in the same sense. </p>

              <p>As long as one misidentify "Self" as permanent soul, it will not be unusual to identify a higher existence as "God". As each person's relationship and perception of God is different, as there are different levels of awareness. Each case is different.

You see, I take into account of the destructive violent propensites of your God, eg. the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

              So the question rephrased for  you BroInChrist is whether the rebelliousness of man is an inherent through faultly creation or is rebelliousness a deliberate inclusion in man's creation.
                  I should have read genesis 3 but don't recall its contents, maybe you would post what you would like to highlight to me?

              Even though I am with flaws even to the inconsistent care of my dog, it does not judge me, I am shown adoration even I am not perfect! As a simile, my dog shows blind faith in me! It does not require reason to show affection to me!

              For Antony Flew, I can only speculate that he fallen to the two extremes of views at different point of his life.
                  As an atheist he may have held a nihilistic views and to a greater awareness later on develop an eternalistic view.
                  Perhaps someone more acqainted with Antony Flew can comment further.
                  Holding views of god may mean there are concurrence in the possibility of god. Existence of god is still not established.

              <p>3. The point is that Anthony Flew was a noted atheist philosopher who debated many years for atheism, but gave up atheism when the case for theism was overwhelmingly too strong to refute. I'm not saying that he is the finer arbiter for the existence of God. But if you have not considered his reasons for abandoning atheism, then you have not considered enough the case for theism.</p>

              Is it a very good"sia" with an afterglow  smile of satisfaction or a diabolical manical smile of glee and added effect of wringing of both hands!
              So "very good" can be interpreted either way and not very helpful. The end product "man"  is flawed either way.

              Actually God does not need defending, God can anything you want to be. If God is good then just let yourself be good. If you as a human being is flawed that accept that you are created flawed. 
              The god we have conversed about is ver.1.0 god in the Old Testament. There also the improved ver.1.1 and other updated versions in New Testament which talk of love and forgiveness; but still with strings attached. 
              What you have not realised is that you are just defending "Self" , your beliefs, your world view, your conviction, your existence.
