              <p><br>which is why i wrote that chinese saying... easy logic but hard to realise it.</p>
              <p>anyway a discussion involves hearing and being heard. Involves having a big heart to acknowledge many various viewpoints. It however doesn't involve the assertion of one/one's view. Which is why many a times, ppl dunno how to have to discussion. They merely thought they were discussing :)</p>

              <p><br>Hah, no is also not the answer. hint: people tend to only see the retrospect, but Neglect the Introspect. true god/mind IS about the Introspect. people tend to blame the outside world, but neglect the inner world.</p>
              <p>for example, when ur thing fell into a hole, and u cannot reached it, people tend to blame the hole is too deep, but never say why my hand is too short. some time the answer is inside us. finger pointing at the moon, don't just see the finger.</p>

              <p>btw , in Buddhism, if a buddhist is like u, so clinging or obsessed with the dharma and start to discriminate or become bias in an extreme way, something like extremists, we can also call them a "hinayana", small vehicle, buddhism. they are too attached to the apparent buddhism but not the inner meaning of buddhism. they are like following next to Buddha, but in fact are far from Buddha. they do not see the real Buddha.</p>

              <p>Then what is the answer re the flag and the wind? Not this not that is not an answer either, that would be playing mind games! The issue here is that you have to demonstrate that the answer given is tantamount to looking at finger but not the moon.</p>
              <p>Jesus said that He is the Truth. God's Word is Truth. The Truth will set you free. The notion of truth is also prevalent in Buddhism. You cannot afford to play fast and loose with truth. Because truth can be a matter of life and death. Truth by definition involves judgement and discrimination. We should judge what is true and discriminate truth from error. Would the Buddha himself disagree with this? You spoke about the inner meaning of Buddhism. What is it? Is it to be held closely or loosely?</p>

              <p>Purify whose mind? Our mind. Again the notion of self is inevitable. And you have not explained what is this true nature of the mind. Humans possess minds. We are conscious beings with minds. And this points to a greater divine Mind that created us, God. Indeed Mind precedes matter. When the Bible says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth (Hebrew merism to denote the entire universe) it speaks of mind preceding matter.</p>

                                      that is not an answer either, that would be playing mind games! The
                                      issue here is that you have to demonstrate that the answer given is
                                      tantamount to looking at finger but not the moon.</p>
              <p>Jesus said that He is the Truth. God's Word is Truth. The Truth
                                      will set you free. The notion of truth is also prevalent in
                                      Buddhism. You cannot afford to play fast and loose with truth.
                                      Because truth can be a matter of life and death. Truth by
                                      definition involves judgement and discrimination. We should judge
                                      what is true and discriminate truth from error. Would the Buddha
                                      himself disagree with this? You spoke about the inner meaning of
                                      Buddhism. What is it? Is it to be held closely or loosely?</p>
