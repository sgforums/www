Apparently, she was a prominent female Buddhist master in Asia and around the world, but I was still studying and didn’t have time to learn more about her. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

It was by Amy Schmidt and titled,<em> Dipa Ma - The Life and Legacy of a Buddhist Master</em>. I read it several times and also revisited an interview with Dipa Ma called “Enlightenment in this lifetime: Meetings with a remarkable woman” was published by <em>Tricycle </em>in 2004. The interview was hosted by Jack Engler and took place in Calcutta in 1977. Delving deeper, I phoned Venerable Shilananda, one of my masters in Bangladesh, and asked about Dipa Ma. I was astonished when he told me that she was born in my neighboring village, Padua, in Chittagong. I never met this woman and she has long gone. But her proximity to my home and heart led me to feel that I <em>actually</em> met her, and that I will never forget her.</span></span></p>

She was a meditation master with profound wisdom and compassion. While she was not a “celebrity Buddhist” in the mold of Ajahn Brahm or Thich Nhat Hanh, she was surprisingly influential. Joseph Goldstein and Jack Engler were both deeply motivated by Dipa Ma and her teacher Anagarik Munindra, another meditation master from Bangladesh. To develop Buddhist spirituality in the West, they invited Dipa Ma to the United States in1980 and 1984. She made two trips to the West, both to teach and to learn. Her meditation retreats were immersion courses in which people developed their capacity to find stillness of mind and greater awareness.She was also a teacher of Joseph Goldstein, Sylvia Boorstein, Jack Kornfield, Michelle Levey, and Sharon Salzberg – now all household names in Western Buddhism.</span></span></p>

She taught me silently that the answer to any internal problem was in the basic mind state and not in her words or in my technical adjustment of attention. She gave me the answer to my difficulties by sharing another state of consciousness in which that problem simply didn’t exist. It was a sudden, instant shift, like a psychic chiropractic adjustment.”</span></span></p>

Dipa Ma (Nani Bala Barua) was born in Chittagong of Bangladesh where Buddhists claim to enjoy a lineage all the way back to the Buddha. But after the Pala Dynasty, Buddhism in Bengal experienced an enormous decline throughout Islamic times. Meditation practices were almost wiped out of existence, leaving behind only rituals and rites. However, Buddhists in Arakan in Myanmar did not forget their heritage. Dipa Ma’s thinking was shaped by this consciousness of "endangerment" as well as by Myanmar’s culture and customs she experienced while living in Yangon.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Dipa Ma was married at the age of twelve and after two years left for Yangon with her husband. She gave birth to three children but her happiness was short-lived. She not only outlived her parents but also her husband and two of her children. Only her daughter, Dipa survived. The heartbreaking sudden loss of her loved ones crippled and paralyzed her emotionally. To make matters worse, she was diagnosed with high blood pressure, to the stage where doctors expected her to die at any time. Aware of her imminent death, she decided to move to a meditation center. Though she knew nothing about practice, she started to meditate. She learnt basic instructions on mindfulness and realized the Buddha's teaching of impermanence. Gradually, her fear of death subsided and her health miraculously improved. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Munandraji encouraged her to come to Thathana Yeiktha, the meditation center where the eminent Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw taught. After studying under Mahasi Sayadaw’s guidance, she felt she had truly transformed herself. No longer did she feel the sorrow that had constricted her heart for so long. Through the classical phases of insight meditation, she even experienced a brilliant light. In an interview she said, "Once, with Munindraji’s guidance, I made the resolution to enter and remain in the eighth <em>jhana</em> for three days, eight hours, three minutes, and twenty seconds. That’s just what happened. But <em>jhana</em> practice doesn’t end suffering."</span></span></p>

Her first formal student was a woman called Malati Barua. This was the beginning of Dipa Ma's long career of teaching householders, especially women.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Although many were forced out of the country, she alone got an offer from some monks to remain there thanks to her meditation service. But out of concern for her daughter, she left for Calcutta in India. Shabby as it was, her abode in Calcutta’s shantytowns was where she practiced meditation and taught others. She single-mindedly devoted herself to helping other spiritual practitioners and experienced deep levels of meditative absorption. She did not make herself known outside her immediate circle of acquaintances, keeping a traditional instructional style yet always being available for those who wanted to receive meditation guidance.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

She has also influenced the women’s movement within Buddhism, thanks to what was perhaps the only disagreement between her and her teacher Munandraji. Once, he was teaching some of Dipa Ma's older female students about rebirth and claimed a woman must take birth in a male body to become a Buddha, but suddenly Dipa Ma exclaimed, “I can do anything a man can do!” Therefore, it seems right that American <em>bhikkhuni </em>Ajahn Thanasanti should have the last word:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">"Coming from California, my personal image of a powerful woman was an amazon who jumps in the back of a pickup truck with a chainsaw and is going to short out the world. But the power of Dipa Ma was the power of touching the heart. I felt completely known by her. And yet I didn't need to hide or be ashamed, because I felt both totally known and totally loved at the same time. I remember writing a letter home to my friends after experiencing that kind of love, telling them that if my journey had ended at that point, it would have been good enough. Just having made contact with that profound love was enough."</span></span></p>

Dipa Ma could be in two places at once and walk through walls.  She could remember past lives and go back to the time of the Buddha and listen to what he was saying.  She could travel into the future and hear what was being said and visit the different realms of existence.  And more, these abilities were scientifically verified.  I had grown up perceiving a woman’s power in one who would be jumping into a pick up truck with a chain saw.  But the quality of power that was Dipa Ma was love.  It felt as if I was in a vast ocean, still, timeless, penetrating – as if she could see me clearly and nothing was excluded or judged.  Every part of me felt embraced and accepted.  Nothing I had experienced had touched me like that before.</em></p>

              <p>Not true. Attaining jhanas dun equate to having supernormal powers. With jhanas, still needed are specific instructions needed to activate each power. And karma or in other words talent plays an important part as to whether one can develop the power or not. For example, Mogallana is extremely talented in this. </p>

                  though physical handicap, can also develop such divine power.</span></p>
