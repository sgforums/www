              135 - CULA-KAMMA VIBHANGA SUTTA</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">THE SHORT DISCOURSE ON KAMMA</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Thus I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One
              was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery.</span> <br><span>Then Subha the student, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed
              One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange
              of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side.</span> <br><span>As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One:
              "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness &amp;
              excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?</span> <br><span>For short-lived &amp; long-lived people are to be seen,
              sickly &amp; healthy, ugly &amp; beautiful, uninfluential &amp; influential,
              poor &amp; rich, low-born &amp; high-born, stupid &amp; discerning people
              are to be seen.</span> <br><span>So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness
              &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"</span></p>
              <p><span>"Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of
              their actions, born of their actions, related through their actions, and
              have their actions as their arbitrator.</span> <br><span>Action is what differentiates beings in terms of baseness
              &amp; excellence."</span></p>
              <p><span>"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's
              statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning.</span> <br><span>It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma
              so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statement."</span></p>
              <p><span>"In that case, student, listen &amp; pay close attention.
              I will speak."</span></p>
              <p><span>"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Blessed One said: "There is the case, student, where
              a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given
              to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,
              on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane
              of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell.</span> <br><span>If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead
              of reappearing in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower
              realms, hell — he/she comes to the human state,</span> <br><span>then he/she is short-lived wherever reborn. This is the
              way leading to a short life: to be a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed,
              given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.</span></p>
              <p><span>"But then there is the case where a woman or man, having
              abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings,
              and dwells with the rod laid down,</span> <br><span>the knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic
              for the welfare of all living beings.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,
              on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination,
              in the heavenly world.</span> <br><span>If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead
              of reappearing in a good destination, in the heavenly world — he/she comes
              to the human state, then he/she is long-lived wherever reborn.</span> <br><span>This is the way leading to a long life: to have abandoned
              the killing of living beings, to abstain from killing living beings, to
              dwell with one's rod laid down,</span> <br><span>one's knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic
              for the welfare of all living beings.</span></p>
              <p><span>"There is the case where a woman or man is one who harms
              beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,
              on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane
              of deprivation...</span> <br><span>If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she
              is sickly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to sickliness: to be
              one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with
              knives.</span></p>
              <p><span>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not
              one who harms beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with
              knives.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,
              on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination...</span> <br><span>If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she
              is healthy wherever reborn. This is the way leading to health: not to be
              one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with
              knives.</span></p>
              <p><span>"There is the case, where a woman or man is ill-tempered
              &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, he/she grows offended,</span> <br><span>provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; shows annoyance,
              aversion, &amp; bitterness.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,

              is ugly wherever reborn.</span> <br><span>This is the way leading to ugliness: to be ill-tempered
              &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, to grow offended, provoked,
              malicious, &amp; resentful; to show annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.</span></p>
              <p><span>"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not
              ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, he/she doesn't
              grow offended,</span> <br><span>provoked, malicious, or resentful; doesn't show annoyance,
              aversion, or bitterness.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,

              is beautiful wherever reborn.</span> <br><span>This is the way leading to beauty: not to be ill-tempered
              or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, not to be offended, provoked,

              <p><span>"There is the case where a woman or man is envious. He/she
              envies, begrudges, &amp; broods about others' gains, honor, respect, reverence,
              salutations, &amp; veneration.</span> <br><span>Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions,

              gains no prominence wherever reborn.</span> <br><span>This is the way leading to no prominence: to be envious,

              <p>"There are eight reasons for giving. What eight? People may give out of affection; or in an angry mood;<a id="fnt-8-5" class="noteTag" name="fnt-8-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel238.html#fn-8-5">[5]</a> out of stupidity;<a id="fnt-8-6" class="noteTag" name="fnt-8-6" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel238.html#fn-8-6">[6]</a> out of fear; or because they think: 'Such gifts have been given before 
              by my father and grandfather and it was done by them before; hence it 
              will be unworthy of me to give up this old family tradition'; or because
               of thinking, 'By giving this gift, I shall — after the body's break-up,
               after death — be reborn in a happy realm of existence, in a heavenly 
              world'; or because of thinking, 'When giving this gift, my heart will be
               glad, and happiness and joy will arise in me'; or one gives because it 
              ennobles and adorns the mind."</p>

              <p>Marvellously short discourse of Master Gotama on the beauty of kamma. However, it may not be entirely accepted by most beings cause there is no direct experience / basis involved from beings' pov.</p>
              <p>Let me share with you the kamma that can directly experience by beings themselves from their own organ - eyes.</p>
              <p><img src="http://thumb14.webshots.net/t/48/48/2/94/30/344529430joeSas_th.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Pay close attention to the sleeping of this baby with partially open eyes. <br>Eyes are for seeing. Eyes alone without consciousness or spirit or soul as commonly known it, can't see. But, this baby did not see even his eyes are open. So what is sleeping is consciousness and not the eyes, as the eyes never sleep nor not sleep <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>There is another deeper insight from Master Gotama that the kamma on shared sight of beings' eyes is beyond life &amp; death known as Buddha of all beings. So, givings are so amazingly joys and blissful for peace &amp; harmony in this life and life after this, and everlastingly. For there are beings created and developing that existence, giving is so much needed and heartening for the aspect of upgrading human to heavenly and to buddhahood.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
