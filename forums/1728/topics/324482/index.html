              <h3 class="h3"><a id="n81bd74091f96f76c8" name="n81bd74091f96f76c8"></a> How Voidness Is Known</h3>
              <p>There are two levels of voidness (<em>stong-pa-nyid</em>, Skt. <em>shunyata</em>, emptiness):</p>
              <ol>
              <li>voidness that is a conceptual construct,</li>
              <li>voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs.<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Voidness, as an absolute absence (<em>med-dgag</em>,
              nonimplicative negation) of true existence as “this” or “that,” is the
              conceptual construct or abstraction “there is no such thing as truly
              existent ‘this’s and ‘that’s.” It can only be known conceptually and is
              that to which the word or concept “voidness” refers.<br> <br> Cognizing
              this level of voidness is a necessary stepping-stone to cognizing
              definitive voidness, which is beyond all conceptual categories and
              beyond all words. Although voidness can be referred to by a conceptual
              construct or word, voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs
              (definitive voidness) does not correspond to anything a word or concept
              would correspond to, namely something existing in the fixed box or
              category of “voidness.”<br> <br> Thus, the two levels of voidness are
              not contradictory. It is not that voidness “beyond” is a transcendental
              level in the sense of being beyond the limits of all possible
              experience and knowledge, and only accessed through a mystical
              experience, perhaps gained by the grace of God. It merely means that it
              is beyond the limits of what conceptual cognition and nonconceptual
              sensory and mental cognition can cognize.<br> <br> Voidness as a
              conceptual construct can only be cognized conceptually. We cognize it
              conceptually by our mental consciousness giving rise to a mental aspect
              resembling an empty or blank space, and superimposing or projecting
              onto it the audio and meaning categories “voidness.” This does not
              mean, however, that when conceptually focusing on voidness, we
              necessarily also must have a mental aspect resembling the sound of the
              vowels and consonants of the word “voidness.” The conceptual cognition
              of voidness may be nonverbal. Nevertheless, since the mental
              representations (the conceptual categories) that appear in conceptual
              cognition are necessarily appearances of true existence, the empty or
              blank space appears to be a voidness that truly exists in the concrete
              category “voidness.” The meaning category associated with it, however,
              is the correct meaning of voidness – namely, the absolute absence of
              true existence.<br> <br> Voidness that is beyond concepts can only be
              cognized nonconceptually, but it cannot be cognized by nonconceptual
              mental cognition. Nonconceptual mental cognition produces a mental
              aspect of something not truly existing as a “this” or a “that.”
              However, voidness that is beyond concepts is beyond all four extremes:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>not truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>both truly and not truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>neither truly nor non-truly existing as a “this” or a “that.”<br> </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Therefore,
              voidness that is beyond concepts does not cognitively appear as a
              mental aspect of an empty or blank space that appears to be a voidness
              in the category of a non-truly existent “ voidness.” </p>

              <p>Only
              clear light mental activity can have nonconceptual cognition of
              voidness beyond concepts, and when it does, it has nonconceptual
              cognition of the two truths (<em>bden-gnyis</em>) simultaneously.<br> <br> In this context, the two truths are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>voidness beyond concepts,</li>
              <li>pure appearances (<em>dag-pa’i snang-ba</em>) – appearances that are beyond impure appearances (<em>ma-dag-pa’i snang-ba</em>).<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Impure appearances include:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>appearances of truly existent “this”s and “that”s,</li>
              <li>appearances
              of sensibilia, such as momentary collections of patchs of colored
              shapes, that are not truly existent as “this”s and “that”s.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><span class="reference">[See: <a href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/advanced/tantra/level3_intermediate_theory/divisions_causes_elimination.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Divisions, Causes, and Elimination of Unpurified Appearance-Making According to Non-Gelug</span></a>.]</span></p>
              <p>Cognition
              of impure appearances resembles “periscope vision,” with which we view
              reality through a limited perspective, as if through a periscope. We
              see only what is in front of our noses, seemingly separated and
              isolated from the state beyond the seemingly solid categories of words
              and concepts.<br> <br> Clear light cognition, on the other hand,
              produces and cognizes appearances of what are beyond truly and
              non-truly existent “this”s and “that”s. That does not mean, however,
              that with clear light cognition, everything becomes an undifferentiated
              oneness. Objects retain their conventional identities. Moreover, clear
              light mental activity produces and cognizes appearances both of all
              phenomena and of itself, for instance as a Buddha-figure.
              Simultaneously, it also cognizes the voidness of them that is beyond
              words and concepts.<br> <br> Clear light cognition, however, may be divided into two:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>clear light that does not know that the two truths it cognizes are true,</li>
              <li>clear light that knows that they are true.</li>

                  dualistic mind. When we name and label them as such, it will have
                  subtle power over us so subtle that it may go undetected. Our mind will
                  be confused by these definitions until we are able to go beyond the
                  effect of these subtle imprints and stabilize our intuitive experience,
                  further understanding of the source will be limited because in Buddhism
                  it is this intuitive mind (not the conceptual mind) that can understand
                  the source. </span></p>

              <p>Welcome...</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.</p>
              <p>I am beginning to move more into 'non-conceptuality'..</p>
              <p>My experience is that the more concepts and beliefs that we have
                                        accumulated the more confusing this stage is.</p>
              <p>Those of us who like to 'collect' all kinds of spiritual
                                        informations will have a very hard time here. The arising of the
                                        memories of these informations will cause the mind to grasp onto
                                        them for verification and validation. In the process, one will
                                        discover that all these informations are just mental words or
                                        imageries ... with no reality at all. But nevertheless, the
                                        clinging bond (of semantics and meaning) to these spiritual
                                        informations will make 'letting go' of the desire hard and
                                        fearful.</p>
              <p>Even the initial insights that we have about non-duality and
                                        other stuffs, are also presented as mental concepts. At this stage,
                                        the mental narrative of these insights will have to be 'recognised'
                                        as mental concepts also and be allowed to 'liberate'. In another
                                        word, the insights themselves were accompanied by 'conceptual
                                        wordings'. These conceptual wordings must also be recognised and
                                        released.</p>

              <p>Regarding "Even the initial insights that we have about non-duality and
                                        other stuffs, are also presented as mental concepts."</p>
              <p>Thusness told me my (initial) non-dual experiences (though different from realising the nature of reality as non-dual) were the result of summarising what I have learnt... and that when the mind is searching for an answer it stumbles onto the non-dual experience, if I get what he is saying. It's like the mind has the answer subconsciously (through learning of dharma knowledge) even though it is not known in conscious awareness. That is why he told me to continue summarising, and of cos to continue practicing hard so that we can go beyond the conceptual understanding into direct experience.</p>

              <p>Hi, does this part from the first article describe what you're
              going through?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3><a id="n81bd74091f96f76c8" rel="nofollow" name="n81bd74091f96f76c8"></a> How Voidness Is Known</h3>
              <p>There are two levels of voidness (<em>stong-pa-nyid</em>, Skt.
              <em>shunyata</em>, emptiness):</p>
              <ol>
              <li>voidness that is a conceptual construct,</li>
              <li>voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Voidness, as an absolute absence (<em>med-dgag</em>,
              nonimplicative negation) of true existence as “this” or “that,” is
              the conceptual construct or abstraction “there is no such thing as
              truly existent ‘this’s and ‘that’s.” It can only be known
              conceptually and is that to which the word or concept “voidness”
              refers.<br> <br> Cognizing this level of voidness is a necessary stepping-stone to
              cognizing definitive voidness, which is beyond all conceptual
              categories and beyond all words. Although voidness can be referred
              to by a conceptual construct or word, voidness that is beyond
              conceptual constructs (definitive voidness) does not correspond to
              anything a word or concept would correspond to, namely something
              existing in the fixed box or category of “voidness.”<br> <br> Thus, the two levels of voidness are not contradictory. It is not
              that voidness “beyond” is a transcendental level in the sense of
              being beyond the limits of all possible experience and knowledge,
              and only accessed through a mystical experience, perhaps gained by
              the grace of God. It merely means that it is beyond the limits of
              what conceptual cognition and nonconceptual sensory and mental
              cognition can cognize.<br> <br> Voidness as a conceptual construct can only be cognized
              conceptually. We cognize it conceptually by our mental
              consciousness giving rise to a mental aspect resembling an empty or
              blank space, and superimposing or projecting onto it the audio and
              meaning categories “voidness.” This does not mean, however, that
              when conceptually focusing on voidness, we necessarily also must
              have a mental aspect resembling the sound of the vowels and
              consonants of the word “voidness.” The conceptual cognition of
              voidness may be nonverbal. Nevertheless, since the mental
              representations (the conceptual categories) that appear in
              conceptual cognition are necessarily appearances of true existence,
              the empty or blank space appears to be a voidness that truly exists
              in the concrete category “voidness.” The meaning category
              associated with it, however, is the correct meaning of voidness –
              namely, the absolute absence of true existence.<br> <br> Voidness that is beyond concepts can only be cognized
              nonconceptually, but it cannot be cognized by nonconceptual mental
              cognition. Nonconceptual mental cognition produces a mental aspect
              of something not truly existing as a “this” or a “that.” However,
              voidness that is beyond concepts is beyond all four extremes:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>not truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>both truly and not truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>
              <li>neither truly nor non-truly existing as a “this” or a
              “that.”<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Therefore, voidness that is beyond concepts does not cognitively
              appear as a mental aspect of an empty or blank space that appears
              to be a voidness in the category of a non-truly existent “
              voidness.” </p>

              Cognize Voidness beyond Concepts</h3>
              <p>Only clear light mental activity can have nonconceptual
              cognition of voidness beyond concepts, and when it does, it has
              nonconceptual cognition of the two truths (<em>bden-gnyis</em>)
              simultaneously.<br> <br> In this context, the two truths are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>voidness beyond concepts,</li>
              <li>pure appearances (<em>dag-pa’i snang-ba</em>) – appearances
              that are beyond impure appearances (<em>ma-dag-pa’i
              snang-ba</em>).<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Impure appearances include:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>appearances of truly existent “this”s and “that”s,</li>
              <li>appearances of sensibilia, such as momentary collections of
              patchs of colored shapes, that are not truly existent as “this”s
              and “that”s.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><span>[See: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/advanced/tantra/level3_intermediate_theory/divisions_causes_elimination.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Divisions,
              Causes, and Elimination of Unpurified Appearance-Making According
              to Non-Gelug</span></a>.]</span></p>
              <p>Cognition of impure appearances resembles “periscope vision,”
              with which we view reality through a limited perspective, as if
              through a periscope. We see only what is in front of our noses,
              seemingly separated and isolated from the state beyond the
              seemingly solid categories of words and concepts.<br> <br> Clear light cognition, on the other hand, produces and cognizes
              appearances of what are beyond truly and non-truly existent “this”s
              and “that”s. That does not mean, however, that with clear light
              cognition, everything becomes an undifferentiated oneness. Objects
              retain their conventional identities. Moreover, clear light mental
              activity produces and cognizes appearances both of all phenomena
              and of itself, for instance as a Buddha-figure. Simultaneously, it
              also cognizes the voidness of them that is beyond words and
              concepts.<br> <br> Clear light cognition, however, may be divided into two:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>clear light that does not know that the two truths it cognizes
              are true,</li>
              <li>clear light that knows that they are true.</li>
              </ol></div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The first part, yes.</p>
              <p>However, i don't think i am at full clear light cognition yet.</p>
              <p>Basically, at this stage, more of the mental conceptualization can be 'clearly seen'. This allows the movement beyond the “periscope vision,” which is how things are seem when in dualistic mode.</p>
              <p>Here, one can see how 'recognizing' mental concepts and releasing them creates a sense of freedom and liberation.</p>

              <p>A.H.Almaas: "Well the first thing about inquiry, is to
                                              recognise that we don't know basic things about ourselves and
                                              reality. To have the humility to NOT KNOW. And also to have the
                                              courage. It's very scary to say 'I don't know who I am; what I am',
                                              or to know what is going on now. First that's the opening is the
                                              humility to acknowledge we don't know. In science they call it
                                              doubt or scepticism. But here it is not really doubt or scepticism.
                                              The doubt and scepticism turns into an emotional thing. What here
                                              is just an openness. 'I don't really know'. After that, is the love
                                              to find out. The heart-felt appreciation of 'What is the truth of
                                              us? What I am? What am I? What is humanity? What is reality? What
                                              is God?', from a loving and also curious place. So that's the
                                              general inquiry about knowing about spiritual nature. There are
                                              many things that will help us - steadfastness; courageous; an
                                              openness and curiosity that brings in questions."</p>

              <p class="bodytext"><br> When I first began practicing
                        Zen under Dainin Katagiri Roshi, he asked me to comment on a Zen koan.
                      I told him, in all honesty, that I found the koan puzzling. Immediately
                    his face wrinkled up as if he had bitten into a lemon. “Not puzzle!” he
                        shouted. He quickly made it clear to me that Zen teachings are not
                    puzzles to which we students are expected to come up with clever answers.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">People often think of koans as riddles or problems
              that need to be solved. But this is not the case at all. With every
              koan, the point is not to arrive at an answer through our ordinary,
              conceptualizing minds. Rather, the point is to <em>see</em> for
                  ourselves that our concepts can never provide us with a satisfying answer.
                  (This is not that satisfaction cannot be found. It can—but not through
              any concept or explanation.)</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Unlike school exams, koans are not a matter of
              coming up with the right answer and thereby winning an endorsement or
              gaining the teacher’s approval. There is a great deal more at play in
              these exchanges between Zen teachers and their students. Indeed, if it
              were merely a matter of coming up with the right answer, you could
              simply look it up in one of several volumes that claim to provide
              answers to koans. But in an exchange with a true teacher, this isn’t
              going to do you much good. If you don’t understand the heart of a koan,
              it will be quite obvious the moment you’re asked a follow-up
              question—one that’s
              not in one of the books.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">No concept, no idea, no piece
                  of intellection will ever give you “the answer.” Whether we’re
                  talking about life or koans (the same thing, really), there are no pat answers
              or solutions.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">For this reason, koans have often been labeled
              anti-intellectual, or irrational, or as invitations for us to abandon
              ourselves to our impulses or our irrational minds. Indeed, some people
              unfamiliar with Zen think that Zen practice is about acting strange and
              silly, or making outlandish statements, or forgetting everything and
              just letting the flowers bloom. Some scholars and writers have even
              claimed that the purpose of koans is to break down and destroy the
              intellect. None of this, however, is true.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Though koans do reach beyond
                  reason, they’re not a call to destroy or deny the intellect. They simply
                  point out that Reality is not to be captured in a thought, or a phrase, or
              an explanation. Reality is the direct <em>seeing </em>of the world as it is, not as our intellects map it, describe it, or conceive it.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">It’s not that human intellect is bad or that we
              must get rid of it; but we must bring ourselves back to the fact that
              the intellect can only construct models of Reality, never Reality
              itself. Our problem, however, is that we get taken in by our mental
              constructions, mistaking them for Reality. The fact is that Reality
              cannot be constructed, nor does it need to be. It’s already <em>here</em>—and we’re all inseparable from it. If we
                  could only <em>see this</em>, we’d be freed from a great and painful burden. We’d
              no longer be confused or cowed by human life.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Another common misunderstanding of koans is that
              they are exercises of wit in which the teacher asks the question, and
              the student must immediately come back with an adroit response. In this
              erroneous view, koans are a jousting game in which teacher and student
              strike and counter-strike, each trying to best the other. Though some
              teacher/student exchanges may give this appearance, to use the model of
              a debate or contest is to miss the point entirely.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Koans also have a reputation
                  for being paradoxical, enigmatic, and inscrutable—and, thus, Zen itself
                  has gotten a reputation for being the same. But koans themselves are not
                  paradoxes at all. Rather, they direct our attention to the sense of contradiction
                  or paradox that naturally arises in any conception of the world. Koans help
              us to <em>see</em> that these apparent contradictions in fact occur only within our minds, not within the world itself.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Rather than serving up an
                  idea or conceptual framework that will supposedly save us, koans help us
                  to recognize how we constantly do indeed reach for prefabricated explanations
                  and answers. They also help us to see that this never gets us anywhere. Indeed,
                  it is this very grasping for conceptual solutions and explanations that causes
                  us so many problems. Yet even as we grasp at concepts, we overlook the supreme
              treasure that is right at hand—Reality itself.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The term <em>koan</em> is
                  generally translated as “public case.” But what, exactly, makes
                  a koan public? Simply this: every koan is a finger pointing to Reality, to
                  what is <em>right now</em>, <em>right here</em>.
              Reality is totally and immediately available to everyone all the time.
              It doesn’t have to be transmitted to you by a teacher. In fact, it
              can’t be. You can’t get it from a book, either. Nobody can hand it to
              you. It’s already <em>right here</em>. We’re inseparable from it. There’s
              nothing in our experience more public that Truth or Reality itself.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The koans presented in this volume were collected
              in the eighteenth century C.E by Genro, a Soto Zen master. This may
              seem somewhat unusual, since koans are thought to be more widely used
              by Rinzai Zen teachers. The Soto school generally does not use koans in
              one-to-one teacher/student interactions. This is probably due to Dogen
              Zenji, who transmitted Soto Zen from China to Japan in the thirteenth
              century C.E. Though he used koans as teaching stories, he frowned on
              their regular use as hoops for students to jump through. He found such
              graduated training to be wide of the mark and short on delivery.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Dogen defined the term <em>ko</em> as “sameness” or “ultimate equality.” According
                  to Dogen, every thing, thought, or emotion we encounter or experience is
                  an equal and necessary component of Reality. Nothing is superfluous. Nothing
                  is left out. In fact, nothing <em>can</em> be left out. Whether we recognize
                  it or not, we’re always dealing with Totality, which is utterly beyond
              our concepts of part or whole, equal or unequal.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The term <em>an</em>, according
                  to Dogen, means that everything within Totality has its own natural territory
                  or sphere. For Dogen, then, a true koan is an authentic expression of the
                  merging of difference and unity, the thoroughgoing interpenetration of the
              Whole and its “parts.”</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Related to the matter of
                  Totality is non-duality. Our conceptualizing minds are highly dualistic.
                  They keep themselves busy thinking, analyzing, controlling, and scheming.
                  To such a mind, everything is either good or bad, right or wrong, friend
                  or foe, this or that—or else off our personal radar altogether. But
                  koans point beyond all this, to the immediate and first-hand non-duality
              of Reality. Koans are expressions of immediate awareness—<em>before</em> we categorize, label, arrange, or evaluate everything.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Koans also point to the freedom of non-attachment—a
              major theme in Zen. Non-attachment is the recognition that thoughts of
              “this is right and that is wrong,” “this we should do and that we
              shouldn’t do,” “it ought to be like this,” or “this is what I want, and
              that is what I don’t want,” only serve to make our lives complicated,
              contradictory, confusing, and ultimately unbearable. Such thinking
              fills our hearts and minds with longing and loathing—all of which
              drives us to anger, frustration, and despair. Koans cut through such
              confusion and draw our attention to things as they are, before we make
              judgments about them and create contradictions for ourselves.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Non-attachment is not the
                  same as detachment. Detachment presumes the realness of the objects of our
                  longing and loathing, then counsels us to turn away from them. It’s
                  an attempt to escape from Reality. But there is no escape from Reality. Non-attachment,
              on the other hand, is to <em>see</em> the emptiness, the non-particularity, of every thing or thought we encounter.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Koans speak of genuineness and ordinariness—actual,
              True, Reality—without any need for explanation, embellishment, or
              improvement. They remind us that we don’t
              need to push the river, or add legs to the snake.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Reality is always <em>right there</em>,
                  out in the open—a public case. Dealing with it is forever a matter
                  of calming down, focussing, and noticing how we spend the greater portion
                  of our time explaining everything to ourselves. Koans—like meditation—are
                  a practical way of watching our own minds, paying careful attention to what
                  is really going on, and perceiving Reality directly, free of our ideas about
              it, explanations for it, and habitual responses to it.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">In short, koans are serious business. They’re about
              life and death, about all our deepest questions and concerns—the ones

              <h2><strong> </strong>The Main Case</h2>
              <p>Venerable Bodhidharma was about to go back to India. He 
              said to his students, "The time has come. Can you express your understanding?" 
              <sup>1 </sup><br>One of the students, Daofu said, "My present view is that we 
              should neither be attached to letters, nor be apart from letters, and to allow 
              the Way to function freely." <sup>2<br></sup>Bodhidharma said, "You have 
              attained my skin." <sup>3</sup><br>Nun Zongchi said, "My view is that it is like 
              the joy of seeing Akshobhya Buddha’s land just once and not again." 
              <sup>4</sup><br>Bodhidharma said, "You have attained my flesh." 
              <sup>5</sup><br>Daoyu said, "The four great elements are originally empty and 
              the five skandhas do not exist. Therefore, I see nothing to be attained." 
              <sup>6</sup><br>Bodhidharma said, "You have attained my bones." 
              <sup>7</sup><br>Finally Huike came forward, made a full bow, stood up, and 
              returned to where he was. <sup>8</sup><br>Bodhidharma said, "You have attained 
              my marrow." <sup>9<br></sup>Thus he transmitted the Dharma and robe to Huike. 
              <sup>10<br></sup></p>

              <h2>The Commentary</h2>
              <p>If you take these different responses as being 
              superior or inferior to each other, you have missed the intent of the Ancestor. 
              We should realize that although each disciple’s expression of the Dharma was 
              different than the others, nonetheless, each in his or her own way contained the 
              teacher’s whole being. Given that Bodhidharma was not approving the depth of 
              understanding by the use of the terms "skin, flesh, bones and marrow," who did 
              he transmit the Dharma to? If you say all four received the Dharma, why then is 
              it said that "thus he transmitted the Dharma and robe to Huike" alone? If you 
              are able to see into it here, you will understand the heart of the Ancestor.</p>
              <h2>The Capping Verse</h2>
              <h3>Before a step is taken,<br>You have already arrived.<br>Before a word is 
              spoken,<br>The truth has been expressed.<br></h3>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ai yoo...why sink back to "Apparent in Real"....but anyway time to
                              take a break….</span> You may want to take leisure read on the 5 degree of Tozan. <a href="/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=198803"><span style="color: windowtext;">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=198803</span></a> <br> <br> The doctrine of no-self cuts through everything and bring us face to face with
                              emotion, impression, sensation, thoughts…and all mental states, directly
                              ‘seeing’ no one there, just it! <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Next one must go beyond the subtle imprints of words and labels and sees the
                              essence of these sensations, impressions and all mental states. Just like
                              laying a book on a patch of grass leaving a temporary imprint, words and labels
                              create these subtle imprints that confuse the mind. It will take 2-3 years
                              before the experience of “Real in the Apparent’ is stabilized. Dissolve
                              completely (self and all views including your scientific views) into the
                              incredible realness and vividness of the Apparent. </strong></span><br> <br> If we spend even a thought moment sinking back to the source, we immediately
                              fall prey to the habitual energy and descend back to the “Apparent in the
                              Real”. This makes no-self a dead “AMness”. <br> <br> From the experience of the “Real in Apparent”, everything is the One Mind;
                              there is nothing else. The non-inherent nature creates all manifestations in
                              lightning flash moments and the Apparent becomes the ‘otherness’. Great mystics
                              though experienced the ‘Apparent in the Real’ knows not the emptiness nature
                              seek the invisible from the visible, hold tightly to the formless. Not knowing
                              that neither the form nor formless are both notions of the marvelous activities
                              of emptiness nature. Get used to this experience and don’t waste your
                              experience.....but it will take some years...happy journey...</p>

              <p><br>The 'clear light' is the 'luminosity'.  In actuality there is no 'Emptiness' to be cognized beyond concepts for 'Emptiness' is just a 'raft' that exist only in conceptuality.  The purpose is to negate the dualistic and inherent views so that the true nature that is beyond the four extremes can be correctly intuit.  When the mind is still deeply rooted in seeing things dualitically and inherently, it cannot know what is the true meaning of 'non-conceptuality', 'non-abiding'</p>
              <p>'no-self' and so on.  Therefore 'Emptiness nature' is taught but in essence it is pathless. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In actual practice there is no 'the pathless path' but when seen by a dualistic mind, there appears to be a 'truly existing pathless path' to be followed.  This is similar to the senario when someone remark that  'everything changes' and we asked 'what about change?'.  The dualistic and inherent mind is quick to objectify and is unable to 'understand' beyond its own dualistic/inherent framework.  When a mind is deeply rooted in seeing things dualistically/inherently, whatever experiences is distorted due to story telling. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever mental activity that is 'this' or 'that' is within the dualistic/inherent framework.  Whatever arising phenomena be it thought, emotion, forms and so on are already the Luminosity itself when without the story telling.  Everything 'already is' and is the One Reality but because of story there appears to be a 'separation' and when 'Emptiness' becomes a story, it fails to serve as the antedote for our dualistic/inherent views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus only for the purpose of communication the above quote is written that way; there is only 'Emptiness' to be cognized by a dualistic/inherent mind, no 'Emptiness' to be cognized in true luminosity.   </p>

                  <span style="color: #0000ff;">This is more like creating the necessary condition for knowing ‘voidness’ by first knowing ‘voidness’ conceptually. Perhaps ‘Why’ this is possible is a more important question from a practical standpoint. It relates directly to how consciousness works.</span>
                  <p>There are two levels of voidness (<em>stong-pa-nyid</em>, Skt. <em>shunyata</em>, emptiness):</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>voidness that is a conceptual construct,</li>
                  <li>voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs.</li>
                  <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In my opinion, there is no ‘voidness’ that is beyond conceptual constructs. “Voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs” is the direct experience of the Luminosity as the One Reality. Bonded within a dualistic and inherent framework of seeing things, we fail to correctly understand the Emptiness Nature of Luminosity.</span></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Voidness, as an absolute absence (<em>med-dgag</em>, nonimplicative negation) of true existence as “this” or “that,” is the conceptual construct or abstraction “there is no such thing as truly existent ‘this’s and ‘that’s.” It can only be known conceptually and is that to which the word or concept “voidness” refers.<br><br>Cognizing this level of voidness is a necessary stepping-stone to cognizing definitive voidness, which is beyond all conceptual categories and beyond all words. Although voidness can be referred to by a conceptual construct or word, voidness that is beyond conceptual constructs (definitive voidness) does not correspond to anything a word or concept would correspond to, namely something existing in the fixed box or category of “voidness.”<br><br>Thus, the two levels of voidness are not contradictory. It is not that voidness “beyond” is a transcendental level in the sense of being beyond the limits of all possible experience and knowledge, and only accessed through a mystical experience, perhaps gained by the grace of God. It merely means that it is beyond the limits of what conceptual cognition and nonconceptual sensory and mental cognition can cognize.<br><br>Voidness as a conceptual construct can only be cognized conceptually. We cognize it conceptually by our mental consciousness giving rise to a mental aspect resembling an empty or blank space, and superimposing or projecting onto it the audio and meaning categories “voidness.” This does not mean, however, that when conceptually focusing on voidness, we necessarily also must have a mental aspect resembling the sound of the vowels and consonants of the word “voidness.” The conceptual cognition of voidness may be nonverbal. Nevertheless, since the mental representations (the conceptual categories) that appear in conceptual cognition are necessarily appearances of true existence, the empty or blank space appears to be a voidness that truly exists in the concrete category “voidness.” The meaning category associated with it, however, is the correct meaning of voidness – namely, the absolute absence of true existence.<br><br>Voidness that is beyond concepts can only be cognized nonconceptually, but it cannot be cognized by nonconceptual mental cognition. Nonconceptual mental cognition produces a mental aspect of something not truly existing as a “this” or a “that.” However, voidness that is beyond concepts is beyond all four extremes:</p>

                  <li>truly existing as a “this” or a “that,”</li>

                  <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are few important points that the above para is trying to convey. First 'non-conceptuality' lies in understanding ‘voidness’ conceptually first. That is, having clarity of the ‘concept of voidness’ is an important condition for the arising of non-conceptuality. This is not separating 'conditions' from the arising of a phenomenon. <strong>That is when the propensity to divide is there, understanding conceptually is necessary -- conceptuality leading to non-conceptuality.</strong> There are other conditions for prajna wisdom it arise like practicing ‘bare attention’.  Second is the emphasis of a 'void background' is an illusion of the mind rather than a direct experience of 'voidness'.  </span></p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think there is a missing link here. In my opinion strong emphasis should also be place on the idea of why non dualistic and non-inherent view is of such importance for leading one to right view of non-conceptuality. Otherwise the dualistic and inherent mind will fabricate various assumed states of non-conceptuality due to its latent tendencies.  That is to 'transform' a limited view to a boundless views lies not in doing away totally with concepts but simply seeing 'non-inherently'.  'Non-conceptuality' and naked awareness will arise eventually with the stability of this important condition.  </span></p>

                  <p>Only clear light mental activity can have nonconceptual cognition of voidness beyond concepts, and when it does, it has nonconceptual cognition of the two truths (<em>bden-gnyis</em>) simultaneously.<br><br>In this context, the two truths are:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>voidness beyond concepts,</li>
                  <li>pure appearances (<em>dag-pa’i snang-ba</em>) – appearances that are beyond impure appearances (<em>ma-dag-pa’i snang-ba</em>).<br></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Impure appearances include:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>appearances of truly existent “this”s and “that”s,</li>
                  <li>appearances of sensibilia, such as momentary collections of patchs of colored shapes, that are not truly existent as “this”s and “that”s.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><span>[See: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/advanced/tantra/level3_intermediate_theory/divisions_causes_elimination.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Divisions, Causes, and Elimination of Unpurified Appearance-Making According to Non-Gelug</span></a>.]</span></p>
                  <p>Cognition of impure appearances resembles “periscope vision,” with which we view reality through a limited perspective, as if through a periscope. We see only what is in front of our noses, seemingly separated and isolated from the state beyond the seemingly solid categories of words and concepts.<br><br>Clear light cognition, on the other hand, produces and cognizes appearances of what are beyond truly and non-truly existent “this”s and “that”s. That does not mean, however, that with clear light cognition, everything becomes an undifferentiated oneness. Objects retain their conventional identities. Moreover, clear light mental activity produces and cognizes appearances both of all phenomena and of itself, for instance as a Buddha-figure. Simultaneously, it also cognizes the voidness of them that is beyond words and concepts.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <span style="color: #0000ff;">
                  <p>This is emphasized because the dualistic mind will fabricate an 'undifferentiated oneness' when the para is phrased that way.  That is why the clarification is necessary.  However the actual experience is beyond speech.</p>
