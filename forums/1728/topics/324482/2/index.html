              <p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. I think concepts isn't the problem... for practical purposes in life and for communication we are always employing concepts to get things done.</p>
              <p>The problem is when we 'believe' in the concepts -- when we start to see things in terms of inherency and duality. Like what the article says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>The conceptual categories that conceptual cognition
                                                                                                        fabricates are cognitive representations</em> snang-ba, mental
                                                                                                        appearances) not only of what things are (words, meanings, wholes,
                                                                                                        continuums, objects, kinds of things, and so on), but also of
                                                                                                        things truly existing in that way. Truly existing (<em>bden-par
                                                                                                        grub-pa</em>), here, means really existing in that way,
                                                                                                        independently of imputation.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Otherwise, if we don't believe in the concept, if we don't believe in the inherency, practical usage of concepts continue to arise but is seen to be just illusory empty-luminous thoughts arising, empty of any objective self-existence, and thus not held on to. Just like for practical purposes I must say that "I am [insert name], [insert gender], [insert my history]" but they are really just concepts, names and forms, nothing to do with my true nature... thoughts arise and the words are spoken but not 'believed'. Not 'believed' means, I do not take my thoughts to refer to a true independent entity, or a real self. They are just transient clouds floating in the blue sky, always changing form, nothing graspable, and does not in anyway obscure or hinder the sky-like mind.</p>
              <p>Hence the goal here is not to get rid of all thoughts and all concepts (can't be done forcefully either -- they can only self-dissolve in its own accord through insight and non-clinging), the point is really to see that all concepts are just thoughts arising with no objective/external reality independent of imputation. This frees us from all grasping and prevents us from sinking into a 'spell-like state'.</p>
              <p>Like what Byron Katie said here with an interview with Bill Harris:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BK: Yes, it was impossible to see anything the same<br> way because I didn’t know what anything was and<br> you know, I had no reference for anything and when I<br> opened my eyes, it was amazing. It was like something<br> else looking out of these holes and this apparent being<br> and I would maybe look out the window and my mind<br> would say, “Sky,” but I couldn’t velcro to it. I couldn’t<br> believe it. I wasn’t able to hold it. It may as well... It is<br> like someone looking at the sky and calling it a tree. It<br> was chaos and none of it real and I began to laugh as I<br> saw that the mind, the moment that mind hit my head,<br> a world, absolutely, was produced, but then people<br> would say, for example, they would say, “Katie, how<br> are you?” And I’d have to look around to see who they<br> were talking to and they taught me my name was Katie,<br> you know, Byron Kathleen Mitchel, now, that’s my<br> birth certificate, Byron Kathleen Reed and actually, my<br> family came to get me and they told me my husband<br> and children were coming and I had no idea that I was<br> even married or had children. Nothing, but my mind<br> was such a yes! It was just so in love with everything<br> that a man and three grown people, you know, came<br> to get me and that’s how I knew I had a home. They<br> told me they were taking me home and it was just, it<br> was marvelous! You know? And learning the name<br> of everything and referencing, you know, learning<br> references and it is not as thought I had amnesia,<br> you know, I can like, talking to you right now, Bill...<br> If someone said, “What is your name?” I would say,<br> “Katie.” And I would say, you know, inside of my head,<br> “Just don’t ask me if I believe it or not.” So, nothing<br> has changed from that first instant of this amazing,<br> unlimited, infinite being.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>BK: So, if I believe something, I have to see it because<br> it’s impossible to see what we can’t believe. For<br> example, if I am a child and my parents continue to<br> tell me this is a tree, this is a tree, this is a tree,
                                                                                                        that’s<br> a tree, this is a tree. It doesn’t make it a tree to me.<br> I’m not separate, words don’t have meaning. It means<br> nothing except to them, but it doesn’t affect me until<br> there is that moment that I attached, you know, I<br> attach like that word to reality, a false reality, and in<br> that moment, I am separate. There is the tree and me.</p>
              <p><br> BH: Because, tree is just a noise that represents a tree,<br> but it isn’t the tree. It’s just a representation.</p>
              <p><br> BK: I can’t see a tree until I believe it. We cannot see<br> what we don’t believe.</p>
              <p><br> BH: Well, you know what is interesting, you know,<br> with a little tiny child, they will point at a bunch of<br> stuff on the wall, a bunch of just, a mess on the wall<br> and say, “What’s that mommy?” Or, “What’s that<br> daddy?” And it isn’t anything that an adult has a name<br> for. It is just a bunch of marks on the wall and it’s<br> a disconcerting moment for the adult because they<br> are looking at that and the child is trying to attach a<br> name to it and there is no name for it. I heard Alan<br> Watts talking about this once and I thought that was a<br> perceptive thing for him to have brought up that there<br> are many things in the world that have no name and a<br> child already at two-years-old or three-years-old has<br> bought into this idea that they have got to attach a<br> label to this and then start mistaking the labels for the<br> things themselves.</p>
              <p><br> BK: Yeah, or we buy in that we have to name<br> everything for the children and of course, it does have a<br> name. It’s a mark on the wall. So, we have two names<br> there. We have mark and then wall and, you know,<br> names for things. So that’s separating out of the whole<br> and it’s how the mind, it is how the mind... It mirrors a<br> reality that is false.</p>
              <p><br> BH: Right...</p>

              Indeed.  got or don't have also ok.  They are similar to the arising conditions of sound and scenary with the mind as the organ for the arising of mind-consciousness. 
              
              When sound-consciousness is produced by hitting a bell, being 'silent' is not to be free from the sound of a bell  but fully authenticated in the luminous presence in bare with whatever arising conditions.  It only becomes a lil more tricky when it comes to concepts because there are more stories. :)

                          intuit.  When the mind is still deeply rooted in seeing things
                          dualitically and inherently, it cannot know what is the true

                          seen by a dualistic mind, there appears to be a 'truly existing
                          pathless path' to be followed.  This is similar to the senario
                          when someone remark that  'everything changes' and we
                          asked 'what about change?'.  The dualistic and inherent mind
                          is quick to objectify and is unable to 'understand' beyond its own
                          dualistic/inherent framework.  When a mind is deeply rooted in
                          seeing things dualistically/inherently, whatever experiences is
                          distorted due to story telling. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever mental activity that is 'this' or 'that' is within
                          the dualistic/inherent framework.  Whatever arising phenomena
                          be it thought, emotion, forms and so on are already the Luminosity
                          itself when without the story telling.  Everything 'already
                          is' and is the One Reality but because of story there appears to be
                          a 'separation' and when 'Emptiness' becomes a story, it fails
                          to serve as the antedote for our dualistic/inherent views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus only for the purpose of communication the above quote is
                          written that way; there is only 'Emptiness' to be cognized by a
                          dualistic/inherent mind, no 'Emptiness' to be cognized in true
                          luminosity.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a sharing. :)</p>

              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">"Bhikkkhus, this view, so clean and pure, if you covet, fondle,
                          treasure and take pride in it do you know this Teaching comparable to a
                          raft, taught for the purpose of giving up and not for the purpose of
                          holding? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, this view of yours so clean and
                          pure, do not covet, fondle, treasure and take pride in it. Do you know
                          this Teaching comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up
                          and not for the purpose of holding? Yes, venerable sir."</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> "Moreover, these sentient beings must also have discarded all<br> arbitrary notions of a personal self, other personalities, living<br> beings, and a universal self. Otherwise their minds would<br> inevitably grasp after such relative conceptions. Furthermore,<br> these sentient beings must have already discarded all arbitrary<br> notions of the non-existence of a personal self, other<br> personalities, living beings, and a universal self. Otherwise,<br> their minds would still be grasping at such notions. Therefore<br> everyone who seeks total enlightenment should discard not only<br> conceptions of their own selfhood, other selves, living beings,<br> and a universal self, but they should also discard all notions of<br> the non-existence of such conceptions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> When the well-traveled one, in teaching, uses conceptions<br> and ideas, people should remember the unreality of all such<br> concepts and ideas. They should recall that the well-traveled<br> one, in teaching spiritual truths, always uses such notions in<br> the way that a raft is used to cross a river. The raft is of no<br> more use when the river has been crossed, and should be<br> discarded. So these arbitrary conceptions of and about spiritual<br> things should be given us as one attains enlightenment. How much<br> more should one give up conceptions of non-existent things?"</span></p>
              <p>~ Diamond Sutra</p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">-------------</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">"Suppose that a man, in the course of
                          traveling along a path, were to come to a great expanse of water, with
                          the near shore dubious &amp; risky, the further shore secure &amp; free
                          from risk, but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this
                          shore to the other. The thought would occur to him, 'Here is this great
                          expanse of water, with the near shore dubious &amp; risky, the further
                          shore secure &amp; free from risk, but with neither a ferryboat nor a
                          bridge going from this shore to the other. What if I were to gather
                          grass, twigs, branches, &amp; leaves and, having bound them together to
                          make a raft, were to cross over to safety on the other shore in
                          dependence on the raft, making an effort with my hands &amp; feet?'
                          Then the man, having gathered grass, twigs, branches, &amp; leaves,
                          having bound them together to make a raft, would cross over to safety
                          on the other shore in dependence on the raft, making an effort with his
                          hands &amp; feet. Having crossed over to the further shore, he might
                          think, "How useful this raft has been to me! For it was in dependence
                          on this raft that, making an effort with my hands &amp; feet, I have
                          crossed over to safety on the further shore. Why don't I, having
                          hoisted it on my head or carrying on my back, go wherever I like?" What
                          do you think, monks: would the man, in doing that, be doing what should
                          be done with the raft?"<br> <br> "No, lord."<br> <br> "And what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done
                          with the raft? There is the case where the man, having crossed over,
                          would think, 'How useful this raft has been to me! For it was in
                          dependence on this raft that, making an effort with my hands &amp;
                          feet, I have crossed over to safety on the further shore. Why don't I,
                          having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water, go wherever I
                          like?' In doing this, he would be doing what should be done with the
                          raft. Even so monks, I have taught you the Dhamma like a raft, for the
                          purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Knowing
                          the Dhamma to be like a raft, you should let go even of [skillful]
                          qualities, to say nothing of those that are not."<br> </span></p>
