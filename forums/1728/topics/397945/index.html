              <p>alot of people think that buddhists cant eat beef.</p>
              <p>Its actually a hindu taboo, as cows are considered sacred and hardworking as they toiled hard in the fields day and night, so its kind of inhumane to eat their meat.</p>
              <p>Moderators, pls help to clarify this misunderstanding among buddhists and others from other faiths, thanks.</p>

              <p>Actually I would not stop people from abstaining from beef, as that is also a virtue and is in accord with what the Buddha taught - it is not a Hindu taboo as the Buddha also taught the need to be grateful and compassionate to cows. I personally do not abstain from any meat currently.</p>
              <p>Many stories and reason given for abstaining from beef is however, stories, fairy tales, and probably have no basis in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>However if we study Buddhism, the Buddha did tell us the reason why we should care for cows and provides a basis for abstaining from beef from a Buddhist POV. In fact more than that, it is a strong case for vegetarianism, and this comes from the Pali suttas itself.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">This
                                       unique work by the late Venerable Ledi SayÄ�daw puts a strong case for 
                                      vegetarianism, though the SayÄ�daw points out that the Buddha did not 
                                      prohibit the eating of meat by monks. 
                                      Had the Buddha done this, as Devadatta demanded, it would have caused an
                                       obstruction to the propagation of Buddhism wherever meat-eating was 
                                      common. The overriding consideration for a monk is gratitude and 
                                      contentment — so if people offer meat or fish he should accept it 
                                      graciously. He need not eat it, if he does not wish to. If he eats it, 
                                      reflecting wisely, he will be free from blame.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">The
                                       
                                      SayÄ�daw stresses that ingratitude is the really harmful factor in eating
                                       meat. Beef-eating is especially blameworthy because cattle provide both
                                       labour and milk for mankind. Cattle are seldom used as draught animals 
                                      in the West, but the practice is still common in Asia. Nevertheless, we 
                                      do use a lot of dairy products, so the factor of gratitude is important 
                                      here too. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">During
                                       the time of the 
                                      Buddha, the large scale trade in meat would not have been feasible 
                                      without modern transport and refrigeration. Modern technology has given 
                                      man unprecedented power over nature, and the consequent growth of 
                                      ingratitude towards animals, trees, the environment, and material things
                                       is obvious. The recent BSE crisis was a stark reminder of the evil 
                                      nature of the modern beef-trade. There is no trace of humanity in a 
                                      system that can feed animal remains to cattle just to increase their 
                                      body weight for 
                                      slaughter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">If
                                       the Buddhadhamma is rightly understood and practised, people will 
                                      surely become much more sensitive to the effect that they have on other 
                                      living beings, and on their environment. The Buddha praised restraint 
                                      and moderation in all things. He taught his disciples to take proper 
                                      care of their bowl and robes, to eat almsfood respectfully, to clean and
                                       repair their dwellings, and 
                                      not to damage trees or plants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">A 
                                      Buddhist monastery or a Buddhist’s home should be a shrine to 
                                      simplicity, cleanliness, beauty, serenity, harmony, thrift, and 
                                      self-discipline. Though meat or fish may be taken in moderation, alcohol
                                       has no place in the home of a Buddhist. The Ä€magandha Sutta, also from 
                                      the SuttanipÄ�ta, makes it clear that unwholesome kamma is stench, and 
                                      not the eating of 
                                      meat. However, monks have not reflected properly on their almsfood if 
                                      they look down on vegetarian meals as inferior.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Our
                                       debt to cows is immeasurable, even in this modern age. Perhaps we 
                                      should outlaw the killing of cows as well as the hunting of foxes. It 
                                      might make for a more caring society.</span></p>

                                       gratitude, love, and compassion are little or none at all, men use

                                      compassion. They strike or whip them hard, torturing them in various 
                                      ways. Finally, they kill and eat them.<br><br>Due to that ingratitude

                                       and compassion. Individual guardian deities hate individuals. Village 
                                      deities hate villagers. Town deities hate town dwellers. National 
                                      deities hate nations. As a result they do not look after the welfare of 
                                      human beings, and fail to protect them. The opportunity is ripe for the

                                       Buddha taught in the NÄ�rada JÄ�taka that, while cows and buffalos may be

                                      when they are old and feeble they must be cared for properly. During

                                       Sarabhanga JÄ�taka. Everybody is expected to observe the five moral 
                                      precepts (not to kill sentient beings, not to steal, not to commit 
                                      adultery, not to lie, not to take 
                                      intoxicants and drugs). Every bhikkhu must observe 227 Vinaya rules 
                                      scrupulously. All Buddhists, by this observance of morality, become pure
                                       in body and speech, which is the main function of morality. One becomes
                                       a moral person by leading a moral life.<br><br>The characteristic of 
                                      wisdom is the ability to teach others in accordance with the Dhamma as 
                                      taught by the Buddha. The aim of teaching Dhamma is to develop civility,
                                       knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. He who obtains this qualification
                                       
                                      is called a wise man <em>(pandita)</em>. A wise man, who is learned in the
                                       texts and able to teach others, obtains wisdom — a necessary factor of a
                                       good man.<br><br>The characteristics of a good man <em>(sappurisa)</em> include the open acknowledgment of gratitude owed to others, and 
                                      revering the good qualities of others. This qualification makes one a 
                                      good person. Besides these two fundamental qualifications, a third one 
                                      is the need for a soft and gentle mind, or a good heart. These are the 
                                      basic qualities of a good man.
                                      <br><br>In the teaching of the Buddha, the Vinaya concerns morality, the
                                       Abhidhamma pertains to wisdom, and the Suttanta concerns the qualities 
                                      of a good person <em>(sappurisa)</em>. Thus we can classify three basic 
                                      aspects of life. However, they may not be coexistent as one would wish 
                                      them to be. Some individuals may possess morality, but they may lack 
                                      wisdom and goodness. So they may not be wise persons or good persons. 
                                      Some persons are wise, but because they lack morality, they are not 
                                      good. 
                                      Others are good, but they may lack morality and wisdom. Some possess 
                                      both morality and wisdom, but they are not good-natured. Some persons 
                                      are blessed with morality and goodness, but they lack wisdom. Others 
                                      possess wisdom and goodness, but they do not have morality. <br><br>Some
                                       people possess all three basic qualifications: morality, wisdom, and 
                                      goodness. A few individuals lack all three good qualities. Those who 
                                      possess all three good qualites are very rare.<br> </span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;"> The
                                       Temiya JÄ�taka mentions that those who take shelter and sleep under a 
                                      tree must not break its branches with bad intention. For the tree 
                                      becomes his best friend, a helper deserving gratitude. If one destroys 
                                      the branches of the tree, one violates the duty of friendship, harming 
                                      one’s benefactor. One lacks the basic requirement of a good man. This is
                                       the teaching of the Buddha in the 
                                      Temiya JÄ�taka.<br><br>Breaking branches and felling trees, even with an 
                                      evil, ungrateful mind, is not the evil deed of killing, because trees 
                                      are not sentient beings. However, the evil mental state of ingratitude 
                                      prevails. Hence the transgressor commits an evil deed. To maintain the 
                                      virtues of a good person, gratitude must be shown even to lifeless 
                                      things. One must show reverence and respect even to trees, which gives 
                                      rest, protection, etc. The maintenance of gratitude for all living 
                                      beings, 
                                      and even for lifeless things, is too important to ignore. A tree should 
                                      not be regarded as inferior, because ingratitude is always a serious 
                                      defect in the eyes of a good person. One must always maintain gratitude 
                                      because ingratitude means to adopt a wicked person’s attitude. As 
                                      regards living beings, even more regard must be given to the 
                                      acknowledgement of gratitude.<br> </span></div>

                                      This wrong view says that those who take shelter or sleep under a tree

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Appreciation
                                       of benefit obtained from others is called gratitude <em>(kataññutÄ�).</em> It means acknowledgment of benefits received, or sincere appreciation. 
                                      Benefits may be obtained from persons or things. There are two classes 
                                      of benefactors: well-known or high class persons; unknown or low class 
                                      persons, or beings of low dignity, power, and status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Most
                                       people exaggerate the benefit received from well-known or high class 
                                      persons. They will acknowledge a benefit of one hundred pounds for one 
                                      pound, one thousand for one hundred, because the status of their 
                                      benefactor is high. However, a low class person’s gift or service 
                                      usually remain undeclared. If the beneficiaries do acknowledge any 
                                      indebtedness, they seldom tell the whole truth. One thousand pounds 
                                      benefit is mentioned as 
                                      only one pound. This is the attitude of wicked or cunning people. They 
                                      are not good Buddhists. All sincere persons of good-will acknowledge 
                                      their gratitude in the following way: the benefit received from 
                                      well-known persons is a hundredfold whereas that of ordinary persons is a
                                       thousandfold. Since they emphasize gratitude, they speak in glowing 
                                      terms for services received from ordinary people. This is the nature of 
                                      bodhisattas and other good persons.</span></p>

                                       after a child is born, soft pressed rice is given with cow’s milk. So 
                                      cows give life twice daily. Since then a human being’s life is dependent
                                       on cows and buffaloes. As draught animals, they help to produce rice 
                                      and other food so that a man becomes wealthy. A wealthy man can donate 
                                      schools and monasteries, or build pagodas. These charitable deeds are 
                                      possible with the aid of draught animals. Cows give both life and wealth
                                       
                                      to human beings.</span></p>

                                       immense debt of gratitude must be seen in the labour and service of 
                                      cows. Their help resembles that of our parents. Since one readily 
                                      acknowledges the immeasurable debt of gratitude due to one’s father and 
                                      mother, one should be able to declare the same thing regarding cows. The
                                       debt one owes to them is obvious. So the Pali text states, “Cows and 
                                      buffaloes are like a 
                                      man’s father and mother.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">The
                                       Buddha also declares that “... draught animals resemble brothers, sons,
                                       daughters, and relatives.” No good man will kill or torture his own 
                                      relatives. Nor will he allow others to kill or torture them. He cannot 
                                      bear to see them killed, because he loves his relatives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Likewise
                                       a good person, knowing the power or debt of gratitude one owes to 
                                      others, will not torture his draught animals. If news of torture and 
                                      killing is known, he will feel sad. He may become angry. One would not 
                                      eat the flesh of one’s relatives if they are killed by others — one will
                                       not relish eating their meat at all. One will feel sorry for the dead 
                                      animals. The habit of gratitude and compassion suppresses any pleasure 
                                      of 
                                      eating beef. Compassion will also arise. One’s indebtedness is 
                                      acknowledged by thoughts, words, and deeds.</span></p>

                                      Protect Good People</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">As
                                       explained earlier, the qualities of a good person include gratitude. 
                                      Gratitude is revered by deities such as Sakka, the king of gods. They 
                                      always appreciate this noble quality. They know that cows resemble one’s
                                       own parents. Cows possess honourable features and human beings owe them
                                       a great debt 
                                      of gratitude. Those who kill them and eat their meat violate the 
                                      essential virtue of a good man. This transgression of virtue is subtle 
                                      and deep. It destroys the deepest ethical rule, which is hard to 
                                      understand by superficial thinking. The deities, being of higher nature,
                                       know the importance of gratitude. Killers of draught animals and eaters
                                       of their flesh attract the hatred of good deities. Man exhibits 
                                      callousness because of intense greed and delusion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Every
                                       country needs a government. A country that lacks a government suffers 
                                      from anarchic chaos. Robbers, murderers, and rebels gain supremacy and 
                                      wreak havoc in various parts of the country. When a stable, strong 
                                      government is duly established, disruptive elements have no chance to 
                                      make mischief. They therefore remain in peace. Whenever authority is 
                                      absent, miscreants rob and kill as they like. A strong government means 
                                      peace and security. Likewise, when a country is looked after by good 
                                      deities, demons and ghosts cannot do evil to the population. Bad deities
                                       have no chance to wreak havoc among the people. In times when people 
                                      show no gratitude, even good deities are displeased, and they neglect to
                                       look after the world. Then demons, ghosts, and bad deities take their 
                                      chance for evil-doing. They spread disease, epidemics, calamities, etc.,
                                       and when the victims die they suck their blood and eat their flesh.</span></p>

                                      Fail to Protect Ungrateful People</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">The
                                       fourth point indicates the neglect of good deities, such as personal 
                                      deities, home deities, village deities, city deities, etc., who neglect 
                                      their duty to protect the welfare of human beings. Then demons spread 
                                      old and new diseases among men 
                                      and animals. This is the detailed explanation for third point too. Man’s
                                       ingratitude makes the world a bleak place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Villagers
                                       and farmers usually earn their livelihood with the labour of cows and 
                                      buffaloes. So one can say that half of the wealth derived from the land 
                                      belongs to animals. If a single field produces one hundred baskets of 
                                      paddy, half of this is owed to animals. If a person 
                                      earns one pound by fast conveyance, half of this is the property of the 
                                      oxen. Therefore owners must feed their animals properly and treat them 
                                      kindly. They must use the labour of animals only after treating them 
                                      with due consideration. They must treat them as if they are their 
                                      friends, brothers, or sons. In short, in earning a livelihood, love and 
                                      kindness must prevail so that the half-share due to them can be used by 
                                      the owners themselves. Otherwise owners do not have the right to use 
                                      their 
                                      own half of the money earned. When old, animals must be left in peace 
                                      and rest so that their debts to man are repaid. They must be properly 
                                      fed in old age.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">We
                                       have shown the teaching of the Narada Jataka in the sense indicated 
                                      above. Without this good procedure, those who use all the money for 
                                      themselves incur debts due to animals. It means that the owners and 
                                      users must suffer in their 
                                      countless future lives, to repay their burden of debt. These debts can 
                                      multiply in countless ways through the long journey in samsara. Fools 
                                      who do not believe in future existences, brazenly torture and eat 
                                      draught animals. They mercilessly abuse the labour of cows and buffaloes
                                       so that the animals suffer as if in hell. Far-sighted persons should 
                                      take this warning with all due seriousness.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">A 
                                      tree, under which we shelter, becomes our benefactor, though it is an 
                                      insentient thing. Having enjoyed protection from a tree, one must not 
                                      destroy its branches or leaves. Wanton destruction means ingratitude 
                                      just like using our best friend. Moreover, one commits the fault of 
                                      breaking the 
                                      virtue of a good person. This teaching of the Buddha is as well-known as
                                       the sun and the moon. All persons should, therefore, treat draught 
                                      animals with kindness, remembering their virtues and services. One 
                                      should abstain from eating their meat, to fulfil the duty of gratitude. 
                                      This factor of a good person must be maintained at all costs. Wherever 
                                      human beings kill and eat their benefactors, they originate wars, 
                                      conflicts, and atrocities. The calamity of war is due to this serious 
                                      evil called 
                                      ingratitude.</span></p>

                                       term “Satthantara Kappa” means the calamity of war. A single 
                                      slaughter-house kills at least one thousand cows each day, and over 
                                      thirty thousand cows are butchered every month. In a year, more than 
                                      three hundred thousand cows are slaughtered — over three million in ten 
                                      years. In the whole country, the appalling slaughter of cows, each day, 
                                      month, and year should be 
                                      considered. For the animals, the greatest calamity befalls them without 
                                      respite, day and night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">The
                                       butcher’s money becomes capital for the meat-traders and 
                                      slaughter-houses. The consumer’s money also goes to them. With this huge
                                       income, meat-traders again buy animals for slaughter. They establish 
                                      more and more slaughter-houses. In a single country there may be more 
                                      than one thousand 
                                      slaughter-houses. With the financial-support of meat-traders and 
                                      consumers, the slaughter of animals is supported by meat-eaters 
                                      everywhere. So the calamity of a single cow’s death is caused by man. 
                                      Man seldom considers the fact of indebtedness.</span></p>

                                       the other hand, cows and buffaloes give rice, wheat, barley, etc., to 
                                      mankind. Farmers rely on them. With their labour, they sustain the life 
                                      of man every day. Yet callous human beings exploit them by creating 
                                      slaughter-houses, and devise all ways of killing them for their meat. So
                                       these animals suffer the calamity of death due to the ingratitude of 
                                      man. In the entire world, millions of cows are butchered for food every 
                                      day.</span></p>

                                       Wisdom, and Goodness</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">In
                                       the Vinaya Pitaka there is no prohibition to refrain from eating meat. 
                                      For the monks, if they have not seen, heard, or suspected that the meat 
                                      was killed for them, they can eat it. They are free from any offence. 
                                      However, mere freedom from offence does not make a good monk. The 
                                      essential factors of a good monk must be observed. The vinaya rules do 
                                      not forbid meat or beef as long as the above three factors are absent. 
                                      However, the 
                                      vinaya rules only govern impurities of the bodily and vocal spheres. 
                                      They concern only one of the four types of purification. A bhikkhu also 
                                      has to follow the remaining three PÄ�risuddhi SÄ«la. As these three — 
                                      controlling the senses, purity of livelihood, and reflection on the use 
                                      of requisites — belong to the Sutta Dhamma, a monk should conform to it 
                                      so that all four purities are attained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Here
                                       it is important to relate morality to goodness. A bhikkhu, when he 
                                      observes all four purities, attains only the qualification of a moral 
                                      person. He also needs to enrich his mind with a liberal spirit such as 
                                      appreciation and acknowledgement of gratitude. This enrichment of the 
                                      mind or mental sphere ensures that a good heart emerges along with good 
                                      conduct. Many individuals lack this mental factor although they possess 
                                      morality. 
                                      The qualities of a good person must be cultivated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">A 
                                      further explanation of this point may be helpful. If a monk is 
                                      well-versed in vinaya and observes the discipline, he is classified as a
                                       moral monk. Yet he may be of rough mind, full of pride, stubborn, 
                                      rebellious against his teachers, giving no support to the needy and no 
                                      help to his elderly parents. He is always scolding and complaining. 
                                      Jealousy and envy prevail in his heart. He exhibits egoism and conceit, 
                                      wallowing in fame and wealth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">From
                                       his practice of the PÄ�timokkha SÄ«la, he is a moral person in this 
                                      respect. However, he is very far from the basic characteristics of 
                                      goodness as mentioned in the Metta Sutta (the fifteen points of becoming
                                       a good person). So, though moral, he is not good. Those types of monks,
                                       learned 
                                      in the scriptures but proud and conceited, can only be called learned 
                                      bhikkhus. However, they are not good in the sense indicated above.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">This
                                       standard can also be applied to the laity. Those laymen who observe 
                                      five precepts can only be classified as moral persons. For example, they
                                       observe the ‘non-killing’ precept by refraining from killing sentient 
                                      beings, not having any intention to 
                                      kill. Although by his acts some insects, pests, and other animals may 
                                      suffer death, he escapes from the transgression of this precept as his 
                                      intention is based on ‘non-killing’. There is in this case, no evil deed
                                       even though death occurs to pests and animals. With other intentions he
                                       perpetrates a deed that involves death to others, such as clearing 
                                      fields, burning rubbish and groves. By so doing normal pests are killed, 
                                      but his aim is to clear the jungle or overgrowth, so he escapes evil 
                                      in this act. He burns the fields, causing death to some sentient beings,
                                       but having a different intention, he escapes the evil of killing. 
                                      Although thousands of insects may die, he has no responsibility for 
                                      their death as his aim is to clear the fields or rubbish. It is right. 
                                      He does not violate the first precept. He is still a moral person, 
                                      because he has no intention to kill. However, if he knows that burning 
                                      his fields or groves entails death to normal animals, if he does this, he
                                       lacks 
                                      love and compassion. So he is not a good person.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Some
                                       people carefully observe all five precepts, but they neglect to support
                                       their parents. They fail to pay respect to them. They scold learned 
                                      men. They decide cases in a partial way. They oppress their inferiors. 
                                      As they keep five precepts they are called “moral.” However, since they 
                                      lack gratitude, humility, dutiful conduct, etc., they 
                                      are not good persons at all. They lack the important factors of love and
                                       compassion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">If
                                       one knows that meat is served for one’s enjoyment, without seeing the 
                                      act of killing, without suspicion or without direct involvement, ethical
                                       conduct is not sullied. So meat-eaters, although they know that cows 
                                      are killed for food and that butchers prosper with the increasing 
                                      demand, do not break the 
                                      five precepts. It is just like the persons who, wishing to clear the 
                                      jungle, burn bushes, trees, and groves, killing insects and animals in 
                                      the process. Since they have no intention to kill, they are innocent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Meat-eaters
                                       do not possess the factors of gratitude and compassion, and they are 
                                      far from becoming good persons. The deed of eating is not a profound 
                                      act. What is significant though, 
                                      with grave consequences, is the financial help given to the 
                                      slaughter-houses and meat-suppliers. The suppliers can maintain their 
                                      businesses due to the purchasing power of the meat-eaters. Butchers kill
                                       more and more animals to meet the increasing demand, day and night. 
                                      This fact is known to all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">The
                                       above case resembles the case of a moral farmer, who supports five 
                                      people and who burns the 
                                      fields and groves, thereby killing thousands of pests and animals. One 
                                      is ethical, but at the same time one is not good. Even monks who try to 
                                      observe the vinaya rules gain purity of body and speech only. They must 
                                      observe the vinaya rules since the Buddha alone is competent to 
                                      promulgate them. The vinaya rules are issued from the Buddha’s 
                                      authority, that is the power of command. Monks breaking the vinaya rules
                                       incur the guilt known as rebellion against the Buddha’s command 
                                      (navitikkamma). This danger is always present. So when the Buddha allows
                                       meat with the three-fold purity to be taken by the monks, the monks 
                                      have to obey. Moreover, the monks have to beg for food, relying on the 
                                      help of the laity. They cannot refuse what has been offered on their 
                                      daily almsround.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Everywhere,
                                       vegetarians constitute a normal minority. If the Buddha prohibited meat 
                                      for the monks, the majority of monks would unavoidably violate this 
                                      vinaya rule. Then transgressions would increase in the course of earning
                                       a livelihood. Those monks who insist on vegetarian food would be 
                                      opposed by the populace, and their livelihood would become restricted. 
                                      People will find difficulty to meet their requirements. Its 
                                      impracticability 
                                      prevented the Buddha from promulgating vegetarianism in the Vinaya 
                                      Pitaka.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">In

                                      it purifies only bodily and vocal misconduct. It does yet reach the 
                                      sphere of purification of mental evils which encompass a wide range. In 
                                      the Sutta Pitaka, ethical precepts and practices reach the mental realm.
                                       It covers all mental evils. Only when mental evils are purified, 
                                      goodness arises. A person now becomes good, not merely moral or ethical.
                                       This attainment is possible because the factors of gratitude, 
                                      loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic-joy, and equanimity prevail in 
                                      the heart. 
                                      The heart must be cleansed of evil things to become good.</span></p>

                                       above explanations have been briefly made in the first point also. 
                                      Right understanding is necessary regarding the gratitude owed to cows 
                                      and buffalos. Morality alone is not enough — mental purity must be the 
                                      goal.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">To
                                       acknowledge indebtedness or gratitude is to follow the Mangala Dhamma 
                                      (the thirty-eight blessings). When these Mangala Dhammas are known and 
                                      understood, craving for meat, such as beef, etc., will diminish in due 
                                      course. Everyone should try to avoid eating the flesh of animals, 
                                      especially that of cows and buffalos. One should study the Sutta Nipata,
                                       Temiya Jataka, and Narada Jataka in which the 
                                      importance of gratitude is taught by the Buddha, even towards trees and 
                                      animals, so that this moral precept is not violated by wrong view. 
                                      Magnanimity must prevail in the world. Indebtedness must be seen

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Even
                                       animals have gratitude for their 
                                      mothers and feeders. They show love and gratitude when food is given to 
                                      them. Even wild animals become tame if people feed them with kindness. 
                                      They love their benefactors and show loyalty and devotion. It is strange
                                       that meat-eaters do not love cows— showing them no civility. It is 
                                      remarkable that meat-eaters do not show gratitude even though they eat 
                                      the flesh of animals. Yet animals show love and gratitude to 
                                      human-beings. They do not receive kindness and gratitude in return, even
                                       though 
                                      they serve the people. Human-beings do not show much humanity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Even
                                       the factors of gratitude, love, and compassion can arise in fierce 
                                      animals such as lions, tigers, snakes etc., who live in the wild. Those 
                                      who live in the villages become tame and show gratitude toward human 
                                      beings. Yet these three virtues are often absent among the people. 
                                      Buddhists should display these three factors of 
                                      goodness. Those who live by the labour of animals must cultivate the 
                                      three good factors habitually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Those
                                       who have little faith but plenty of delusion, differentiate between 
                                      high and low-class persons in the matter of gratitude for benefits 
                                      received. Their minds are not clear and steady. Thus they will often 
                                      acknowledge and speak in praise of gratitude received from high-class 
                                      persons, 
                                      though the amount is normal. They exaggerate the facts to honour people 
                                      in high positions in an ingratiating way. The high-ranking person is 
                                      praised out of all proportion. A dignified person is acknowledge with 
                                      thanks a thousand-fold, although the deed is normal, wild hyperboles are 
                                      made by fools to those of high-status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Fools
                                       do not show any appreciation when they receive help from low-class 
                                      persons and beings, even though the benefit is great. They belittle the 
                                      amount of benefit received. A thousand pounds worth of benefit is 
                                      reduced to only twenty-five. Sometimes they totally ignore the help 
                                      received from others. If their benefactors lack position, power, wealth,
                                       etc., they show even less gratitude. They dismiss the debt of gratitude
                                       that is due, concealing the benefit received. They do not help their 
                                      benefactors when they are in need. They now shun them. They are glad 
                                      when 
                                      their benefactor dies because they do not want to repay their debt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">So
                                       the gratitude owed to animals is often denied. One seldom reflects on 
                                      or acknowledges one’s debts to animals, not even to the normalest extent.
                                       As cows have no status, being dumb animals, people neglect to show any 
                                      gratitude. The virtue of gratitude therefore diminishes, promoting 
                                      vanity and folly among mankind, and 
                                      callousness spreads. People become partial towards the upper class and 
                                      biased against those of lower class. Dignified persons receive 
                                      undeserved praise and exaggerated gratitude, while low-class benefactors
                                       are belittled, or totally ignored. Because it imparts righteousness, 
                                      the importance of gratitude even towards trees was taught by the Buddha.
                                       The Pali text “Yassa rukkhassa sayara” teaches us to preserve gratitude
                                       even for non-sentient things like trees. People should not destroy 
                                      trees 
                                      as they enjoy shelter under them. People should not say unkind words. 
                                      This is the teachings of the bodhisattas and the Buddhas. They 
                                      habitually practise this virtue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Among
                                       the various good deeds deserving gratitude, the giving of sustenance 
                                      ranks in the highest class. So man owes gratitude to cows in the same 
                                      way as to parents. Cows are like our fathers and mothers. It is very 
                                      strange that 
                                      man, having enjoyed the services of animals at will, still delights in 
                                      eating their flesh. Old cows are killed or sent to slaughter-houses. The
                                       gratitude that is prevalent among animals is absent among mankind. 
                                      People lack genuine faith, and hold wrong views to the fullest extent. 
                                      It is hard to realise the truth of gratitude. Seeing meat-eaters, one 
                                      can know their lack of loving-kindness and compassion. Lacking 
                                      loving-kindness and compassion, they discard also a sense of gratitude, a
                                       
                                      fundamental characteristic to become a good person.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">When
                                       gratitude arises, love and compassion are sure to follow in its wake. 
                                      Seeing meat, one will see the flesh of ones’ own parents. Cows’ flesh is
                                       comparable to the flesh of one’s own brothers and 
                                      sisters, sons and daughters. Visions of one’s parents will appear in the
                                       mind. So instead of eating, one will certainly cry. One will not touch 
                                      beef. Since past thankfulness reappear now. This is the way of a good 
                                      person’s heart and conduct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">On
                                       the other hand, if owners use the labour of draught animals, and then 
                                      eat their flesh, the honour and dignity of animals is reduced to the 
                                      lowest 
                                      order. Although man owes limitless gratitude to cows, not the least 
                                      acknowledgement appears. Man’s lust for eating meat overwhelms all 
                                      gratitude. When one remembers how the Buddha honoured the Tree of 
                                      Enlightenment for seven days by showing his gratitude, such behaviour 
                                      towards cows becomes incomprehensible. The depth of folly is 
                                      unfathomable, if ingratitude reigns supreme.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Those
                                       who hold Khattavijja Ditthi think that the end justifies the means. 
                                      They have a selfish outlook, and only pragmatic considerations of 
                                      usefulness or benefit prevail. Meat-eaters also belong to this group. 
                                      The Buddha’s teaching is based on love and compassion, which are the 
                                      outcome of gratitude. It cannot discard the outlook and behaviour of 
                                      indebtedness. The right attitude must not be 
                                      lost. Everyone should consider the service rendered by cows. The next 
                                      consideration must be based on the following thought: “If cows were 
                                      high-status persons or honourable, how one’s gratitude would multiply! 
                                      Though they derive great service and milk from them, people do not rate 
                                      them highly, let alone speaking in praise of cows. If only cows had rank
                                       and position!”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">If
                                       cows were high 
                                      ranking persons, everyone would show the gratitude due to them. People 
                                      would show love and kindness to the fullest extent. Torture and killing 
                                      of cows would not be allowed. Even the sight of their flesh would arouse
                                       pity. Considering thus, much gratitude will be heaped on them with love
                                       and compassion. With this strong pure mind the teaching of “Yassa 
                                      rukkhassa sayara” will be implemented. Hence the factor of a good person
                                       is realised.</span></p>
              <h4><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif; color: #0000ff;">The Power of
                                       Lust</span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">Lust
                                       for food compels some to eat even dogs and crows. At first, no one 
                                      wishes to eat crows, since they are regarded as unclean. Dogs eat dirty 
                                      things. Yet one enjoys pork, chicken, etc., though pigs and chickens eat
                                       bad things too. Without familiarity, no one will eat human flesh, but 
                                      once people started, it 
                                      would become a daily dish. Soon after a child is born, parents feed it 
                                      beef, chicken, etc., so people enjoy meat, instead of loathing it. 
                                      Similarly, if there were such a custom, people would eat their own 
                                      father and mother with relish, or they would enjoy the flesh of their 
                                      own sons and daughters. Once any food becomes familiar, even the flesh 
                                      of dogs becomes tasty. The power of lust has no limits. Lust for food, 
                                      like lust for sensual pleasures, continually wants to try new dishes. 
                                      Man can 
                                      become as lustful as a dog. The unrestrained carnal lust for sex and 
                                      food is obvious in animals. The root cause is lust, with no special 
                                      distinction between men and animals. So by reflecting on gratitude, one 
                                      should avoid eating the flesh of cows and buffalos.</span></p>

                                       of Gratitude</span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">In
                                       the Sutta Nipata the Buddha teaches: “yatha mata pita bhata, aññe vapi 
                                      ca ñataka.” The meaning is that cows and buffalos, being providers of 
                                      rice and other food, are givers of life. They are comparable to one’s 
                                      mother and father. If people can eat their parents’ flesh, they will 
                                      also eat meat. If they will not eat their parents flesh, they should 
                                      refrain from eating meat. If one heard that a man had eaten his parents,
                                       
                                      he would be regarded as an inhuman monster, maniac, or cannibal. 
                                      Similarly, on hearing that people eat the flesh of cows and buffalos, 
                                      one can judge that they are monsters, maniacs, or barbarians. Why is 
                                      this? Because one’s parents are one’s life-givers and benefactors. So 
                                      too are cows and buffalos. The flesh of one’s benefactors must not be 
                                      eaten. People would rightly blame those who ate their parents, brothers,
                                       or sisters as barbaric cannibals. The same criticism should be levelled
                                       at 
                                      meat-eaters because cows give us life. We owe them a great debt of 
                                      gratitude, similar to that due to our parents. We should love these 
                                      animals, considering their services to mankind. They are worthy of our 
                                      noble love and pity, considering their enormous service for mankind.</span></p>

                                       kamma. Catastrophes have arisen just like that suffered by the Buddha’s
                                       relatives who were murdered by Vitatubha in revenge. Both the guilty 
                                      and 
                                      innocent, old and young, suffered brutal death. The whole Sakyan nation 
                                      disintegrated. The Buddha appealed three times to Prince Vitatubha to 
                                      let them live in peace, but the past evil kamma of the Sakyans was too 
                                      great to be offset even by the Buddha’s repeated intervention. They had 
                                      done serious kamma in the past, which now had to ripen. The Dhammapada 
                                      Commentary [to verse forty-seven] relates this story in detail. The 
                                      moral is that not even God can forgive evil kamma. Only good kamma of 
                                      the highest type purifies bad kamma.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif;">As
                                       for the vengeful prince, he too suffered bad consequences as he was 
                                      drowned in the river. He became food for fishes and turtles. His anger 
                                      ruined him at last. Thus to revenge a wrong means both parties have to 
                                      suffer for their evil deeds. The Buddha teaches that mankind experiences
                                       progress and prosperity when it acknowledges the factor of gratitude. 
                                      Man must develop the four BrahmavihÄ�ras — the Divine Abidings — for

              <p>anyway, I think there's no basis to the story but i didn't eat beef when i was young, so i still abstain from them and also i was born in the year of the ox too, so how can i eat my kind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
