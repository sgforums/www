              <p>Interesting topic.</p>
              <p>Longchen posted two very good articles at <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1728/topics/324482">Very good articles on mental activities</a> <a href="/forums/1728/topics/324482?page=2">last</a> , and one of them is dealing with that question you are asking. I highly recommend that you read through the article. The article related here is:<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/advanced/dzogchen/meditation/fundamentals_dzogchen_meditation/fund_dzogchen_meditation_01.html"> 1. Recognizing Different Levels of Mental Activity
                                                          and Appearance-Making</a></p>
              <p>To put it very shortly, we project on whatever appearances arises. And as the site explains, <em><br></em></p>
              <p><em><em>"The conceptual categories that conceptual cognition
                                                          fabricates are cognitive representations</em> snang-ba, mental
                                                          appearances) not only of what things are (words, meanings, wholes,
                                                          continuums, objects, kinds of things, and so on), but also of
                                                          things truly existing in that way. Truly existing (<em>bden-par
                                                          grub-pa</em>), here, means really existing in that way,
                                                          independently of imputation."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And because we think that they are truly existing in the 'really-out-there' kind of way, independent of imputation, instead of everything being merely manifestation of the Mind (and I mean our true nature -- luminous-emptiness), we perceive duality. And this projection is hypnotic, we believe that it is absolutely true, just as within a dream we believe the dream to be true and the objects involved in the dream to be absolutely true.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why duality actually create suffering ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is the split, the separation that causes suffering as well the
                                  arising of desire, as well as clinging.<br> <br> Without the insight that there is no-split, the mind continues to
                                  divide. Desire is an inner deficiency of the mind created to bridge the
                                  gap of separation. But it is precisely this attempt to bridge the gap
                                  that is perpetuating the gap, and so we suffer. Aversion is the inner
                                  deficiency of the mind created that negatively reacts with or seeks to
                                  escape/widen the gap/split from a perceived object due to falsely
                                  projecting reality on 'external objects' deemed as unpleasant, etc...
                                  but that will never work because the split doesn't exist, but the way
                                  we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful.
                                  There is only ever the present appearance of life, with no one at its
                                  core who could ever escape even if they wanted to. Indeed, all attempts
                                  to escape merely serve to reinforce suffering and separation.<br> <br> When Anatta and Anicca is fully seen, it is seen there is no phenomena
                                  graspable nor is there a separate subject/self that can pursue or
                                  reject something apparently 'external to himself', which he/she can
                                  have a relation with or be at the mercy of the pain... and hence,
                                  Dispassion arises. Hence freedom from suffering is achieved, illusion
                                  of separation and split ended. The three poisons of desire, aversion,
                                  and ignorance is ended.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>This is exactly the same as asking, where is my self? Non-duality tells you that there is no self/perceiver apart from the perceived. When watching movie, there is just the seeing of the movie, and that seeing is inseparable from colours, from the known. There is no seer that sees, the images sees. And that is Mind. Everything is Mind, but 'where' does not apply, because 'Mind' is not an entity that is located anywhere.</p>
              <p>Even to say 'everything' is also a conventional way to put it -- not to be mistaken that there is truly a 'something', cos there is really nothing graspable! All appearances are simply in a state of constant be-coming, evolving according to conditions, like rain falling, wind blowing, river flowing, 'everything' has no essence, no 'thingness'. Rain has no essence, there is only falling, wind has no essence, it is just blowing, river has no essence, there is just flowing. A constant state of evolving according to conditions. Merely a luminous-empty appearance. And that is all there is, all are the manifestation of Mind.</p>
              <p>As Thusness said in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/262408</a><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>The reason they
                                                          said Awareness (Mind), is because Awareness is not an entity. It is not a
                                                          thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. It is just clarity.
                                                          But because we are so accustomed to thinking things in terms of
                                                          object and subject, we always take Awareness as something. It must
                                                          be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if it is not residing
                                                          inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace. This is the
                                                          problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be aware. We always
                                                          think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                                          they always look for a place, they always look for a something.
                                                          This is how the mind react, this is what I call a momentum. They
                                                          always behave this way. They do not know how to say Â“Just do
                                                          nothing. Everything is expressing itself by clarity.Â” They always
                                                          want to react, you see what I mean?</em></p>

              <p>Anyway, the following is written by Ajahn Amaro on the teachings of Non-Duality
                                  by Buddha, as well as being a great description of Stages 5 &amp; 6 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Ancient Teachings on Nonabiding</span><br><br>This principle of nonabiding is also contained within the ancient<br>Theravada teachings. It wasn’t just Ajahn Chah’s personal insight<br>or the legacy of some stray Nyingmapa lama who wandered<br>over the mountains and fetched up in northeast Thailand 100<br>years ago. Right in the Pali Canon, the Buddha points directly<br>to this. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Udana</span> (the collection of “Inspired Utterances”<br>of the Buddha), he says:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There is that sphere of being where there is no earth,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">no water, no fire, nor wind; no experience of infinity</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">of space, of infinity of consciousness, of no-thingness,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">or even of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; here</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">there is neither this world nor another world, neither</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">moon nor sun; this sphere of being I call neither a coming</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor a going nor a staying still, neither a dying nor</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">a reappearance; it has no basis, no evolution, and no</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">support: it is the end of dukkha. (ud. 8.1)</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rigpa</span>, nondual awareness, is the direct knowing of this. It’s<br>the quality of mind that knows, while abiding nowhere.<br><br>Another teaching from the same collection recounts the story<br>of a wanderer named Bahiya. He stopped the Buddha on the<br>street in Savatthi and said, “Venerable Sir, you are the Samana<br>Gotama. Your Dharma is famous throughout the land. Please<br>teach me that I may understand the truth.”<br><br>The Buddha replied, “We’re on our almsround, Bahiya. This is<br>not the right time.”<br><br>“Life is uncertain, Venerable Sir. We never know when we are<br>going to die; please teach me the Dharma.”<br><br>This dialogue repeats itself three times. Three times over, the<br>Buddha says the same thing, and Bahiya responds in the same<br>way. Finally, the Buddha says, “When a<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tathagata</span> is pressed<br>three times, he has to answer. Listen carefully, Bahiya, and<br>attend to what I say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the seen, there is only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, there is only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, there is only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, there is only the cognized.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus you should see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing here;</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">this, Bahiya, is how you should train yourself.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Since, Bahiya, there is for you</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the seen, only the seen,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the heard, only the heard,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the sensed, only the sensed,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">in the cognized, only the cognized,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">and you see that there is no thing here,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will therefore see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">indeed there is no thing there.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As you see that there is no thing there,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you will see that</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">you are therefore located neither in the world of this,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in the world of that,</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">nor in any place</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">betwixt the two.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This alone is the end of suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</span><br><br>Upon hearing these words, Bahiya was immediately enlightened.<br>Moments later he was killed by a runaway cow. So he was<br>right: life is uncertain. Later Bahiya was awarded the title of<br>“The Disciple Who Understood the Teaching Most Quickly.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">“Where” Does Not Apply</span><br><br>What does it mean to say, “There is no thing <span style="font-style: italic;">there</span>”? It is talking<br>about the realm of the object; it implies that we recognize that<br>“the seen is merely the seen.” That’s it. There are forms, shapes,<br>colors, and so forth, but there is no <span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span> there. There is no real<br>substance, no solidity, and no self-existent reality. All there is,<br>is the quality of experience itself. No more, no less. There is just<br>seeing, hearing, feeling, sensing, cognizing. And the mind naming<br>it all is also just another experience: “the space of the<br>Dharma hall,” “Ajahn Amaro’s voice,” “here is the thought,<br>‘Am I understanding this?’ Now another thought, ‘Am I not<br>understanding this?’”<br><br>There is what is seen, heard, tasted, and so on, but there is no<br>thing-ness, no solid, independent entity that this experience<br>refers to.<br><br>As this insight matures, not only do we realize that there is<br>no thing “out there,” but we also realize there is no solid thing<br>“in here,” no independent and fixed entity that is the experiencer.<br>This is talking about the realm of the subject.<br><br>The practice of nonabiding is a process of emptying out the<br>objective and subjective domains, truly seeing that both the<br>object and subject are intrinsically empty. If we can see that both<br>the subjective and objective are empty, if there’s no real “in<br>here” or “out there,” where could the feeling of I-ness and meness<br>and my-ness locate itself? As the Buddha said to Bahiya,<br>“You will not be able to find your self either in the world of this<br>[subject] or in the world of that [object] or anywhere between<br>the two.”<br><br>There is a similar and much lengthier exchange between the<br>Buddha and Ânanda in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shurangama Sutra</span>, which is a text<br>much referred to in the Ch’an school of the Chinese tradition.<br>For pages and pages the Buddha asks Ânanda, in multifarious<br>ways, if he can define exactly where his mind is. No matter how<br>hard he tries, Ânanda cannot establish it precisely. Eventually<br>he is forced to the conclusion that “I cannot find my mind anywhere.”<br><br>But the Buddha says, “Your mind does exist, though,<br>doesn’t it?”<br><br>Ânanda is finally drawn to the conclusion that “where” does<br>not apply.<br><br>Aha!<br><br>This is the point that these teachings on nonabiding are trying<br>to draw us to. The whole concept and construct of where-ness,<br>the act of conceiving ourselves as this individual entity living<br>at this spot in space and time, is a presumption. And it’s only by<br>frustrating our habitual judgments in this way that we’re forced<br>into loosening our grip.<br><br>This view of things pulls the plug, takes the props away, and,<br>above all, shakes up our standard frames of reference. This is<br>exactly what Ajahn Chah did with people when he asked, “If you<br>can’t go forward and you can’t go back and you can’t stand still,<br>where can you go?” He was pointing to the place of nonabiding:<br>the timeless, selfless quality that is independent of location.<br><br>Interestingly enough, some current scientific research has<br>also reached a comparable conclusion about the fundamental<br>nature of matter. In the world of quantum physics, scientists<br>now use such terms as “the well of being” or “the sea of potential”<br>to refer to the primordial level of physical reality from<br>which all particles and energies crystallize and into which they<br>subsequently dissolve. The principle of non-locality in this realm<br>means that the “place where something happens” cannot truly<br>be defined, and that a single event can have exactly simultaneous<br>effects in (apparently) widely separated places. Particles can<br>accurately be described as being smeared out over the entirety of<br>time and space.<br><br>Terms like “single place” and “separate places” are seen to<br>apply only as convenient fictions at certain levels of scale; at the<br>level of the ultimate field, the sea of quantum foam, “place” has<br>no real meaning. When you get down into the fine, subatomic<br>realm, where-ness simply does not apply. There is no there there.<br>Whether this principle is called nonabiding or non-locality, it’s<br>both interesting and noteworthy that the same principle applies<br>in both the physical and mental realms. For the intellectuals and<br>rationalists among us, this parallel is probably very comforting.<br><br>I first started to investigate this type of contemplation when I<br>was on a long retreat in our monastery and doing a lot of solitary<br>practice. It suddenly occurred to me that even though I might<br>have let go of the feeling of self—the feeling of this and that<br>and so on—whatever the experience of reality was, it was still<br>“here.” There was still here-ness. For several weeks I contemplated<br>the question, “Where is here?” Not using the question to<br>get a verbal answer, more just to illuminate and aid the abandonment<br>of the clinging that was present.<br><br>Recognizing this kind of conditioning is half the job—<br>recognizing that, as soon as there is a here-ness, there is a subtle<br>presence of a there-ness. Similarly, establishing a “this,” brings<br>up a “that.” As soon as we define “inside,” up pops “outside.”<br>It’s crucial to acknowledge such subtle feelings of grasping; it<br>happens so fast and at so many different layers and levels.<br><br>This simple act of apprehending the experience is shining the<br>light of wisdom onto what the heart is grasping. Once the defilements<br>are in the spotlight, they get a little nervous and uncomfortable.<br>clinging is the focus of our awareness, it can’t function properly.<br>In short, clinging can’t cling if there is too much wisdom around.<br>Clinging operates best when we are not looking. When<br>clinging is the focus of our awareness, it can’t function properly.<br>In short, clinging can’t cling if there is too much wisdom around.</p>

              <p>Actually to say there is no mind but only mental activities is also equally valid. There is no fixed entity/mind/'it'/self, only momentary arising and ceasing.</p>

                                              i have experienced by duality ( or so i think, pls correct me if im
                                              wrong ). I have experienced both "pushing and pulling" sensation,
                                              where there seems to be presence of a force - I could assume that
                                              it is projected by the mind as it is nowhere to be physically
                                              found.</p>
              <p>Where is the source of this force?</p>

              <p>Duality is a completely mind created illusion. It never existed. And the belief in duality leads to the sense of separation, i.e. there is a 'me' who can get that 'beautiful car'. But as long as there is desire, there is separation, or rather a belief in separation -- a 'me' who can get something. Or get closer to something. And when there is an undesirable object, one tries to get rid of it, or distant oneself away, and projects a false sense of a 'me' who can get rid of the 'object'.</p>
              <p>But it can't be done, because all there is is our present experience, but the projection of duality (there is a 'me' experiencing pain and a 'me' who can 'get rid of pain') causes the attempt from a self-centered perspective to escape, to push away or avoid certain experiences (as if there is even a self who can do that! the pain can disappear, actions can be done to get rid of pain, but there is no experiencer or doer -- only arising and passing experiences) And so the sense of aversion arises, which is to 'push away' something.</p>
              <p>And all those dualistic relationship is inherently painful, reinforcing seeking, suffering and dissatisfaction. All these emotions can cause a physical reaction, which may possibly be what you have also experienced. All emotions have a physical correlation at a particular location -- some emotions show up on our abdomen, our shoulders, some on other parts of the body.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the nice sharing.</p>
              <p>Just want to share my personal experience. Not definitive.</p>
              <p>It may take a few years for the 'dropping away of pull/push' to become automatic.</p>
              <p>The 'let go/dropping' practice in the beginning is really a 'push' effort.</p>
              <p>True release is automatic without the 'willing' effort. It will come by itself... if the earlier practice is correct.</p>
              <p>When the real release/liberation occur, one will know... as it is a kind of rest and joy that is different from the 'normal desire/grasping state'.</p>
              <p>Don't get discouraged when results are not experienced at first. It will come. The 'result' cannot be speed up.... the subsconsious mind needs time (years) to 're-orientate' itself.</p>

              <p>Found something on dropping, from <a href="http://www.empty-universe.com/zen/hui_hai.htm">http://www.empty-universe.com/zen/hui_hai.htm</a></p>
              <p>Q: By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?<br><br>A: By means of the Dana paramita.<br><br>Q: According to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas. Why, then, have you mentioned only the one? Please explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter.<br><br>A: Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from the Dana paramita and that by its practice all the others are fulfilled.<br><br>Q: Why is it called the Dana paramita?<br><br>A: 'Dana' means 'relinquishment.'<br><br>Q: Relinquishment of what?<br><br>A: Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.<br><br>Q: Which means?<br><br>A: It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and nonbeing, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure. By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as void. The real practice of the Dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of 'now I see that opposites are void,' or' now I have relinquished all of them.' We may also call it 'the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of con-current causes;' for it is when these are cut off that the whole Dharma-nature becomes void; and this void-ness of the Dharma-nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever. Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned. Why? Because our self-nature is immaterial and does not contain a single thing (foreign to itself). That which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathágata-it is said in the Diamond Sutra: 'Those who relinquish all forms are called "Buddhas" (enlightened ones).'<br><br>Q: However, the Buddha did speak of six paramitas, so why do you now say they can all be fulfilled in that one? Please give your reason for this.<br><br>A: The Sutra of the Questions of Brahma says: 'Jala-vidya, the elder, spoke unto Brahma and said, Bodhisattvas by relinquishing all defilement's (klesha) may be said to have fulfilled the Dana paramita, also known as 'total relinquishment;' being beguiled by nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the síla paramita, also known as, observing the precepts;' being hurt by nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the kshanti paramita, also known as 'exercising forbearance;' clinging to nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the virya paramita, also known as 'exercising zeal;' dwelling on nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the Dhyana paramita, also known as 'practicing Dhyana and samádhi;' speaking lightly of nothing, they may be said to have fulfilled the prajña paramita, also known as 'exercising wisdom.' Together, they are named 'the six methods.'"' Now I am going to speak about those six methods in a way which means precisely the same - the first entails relinquishment; the second, no arising (of perception, sensation, etc); the third, no thinking; the fourth, remaining apart from forms; the fifth, non-abiding (of the mind); and the sixth, no indulgence in light speech. We give different names to these six methods only for convenience in dealing with passing needs; for, when we come to the marvelous principle involved in them all, we find no differences at all. So you have only to understand that, by a single act of relinquishment, everything is relinquished; and that no arising means no arising of anything whatsoever. Those who have lost their way have no intuitive understanding of this; that is why they speak of the methods as though they differed from one another. Fools bogged down in a multiplicity of methods revolve endlessly from life span to life span. I exhort you students to practice the way of relinquishment and nothing else, for it brings to perfection not only the other five paramitas, but also myriads of dharmas (methods).</p>

                      Shapes are nothing other than ideas. Not just visually but even felt
                      shapes like the shape of an arm or coffee cup are ideas. The shape is
                      not apart from the feeling of the shape, and the feeling is not apart
                      from awareness of the feeling. It's all awareness, all the time. This
                      is how there are no separate physical objects. So how can there be
                      separate experiencers?<br><br></div>

                      people think they're missing something. They'd like to have the same

                      It's across the board. As they would say in Zen, it's just as much in
                      the North as in the South. So it cannot be bottled up in one person,

              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>There is a mixture of feeling and thought that pass by every moment and now.</p>
              <p>How does one attempt to drop something that remain ungraspable at there every moment.</p>
              <p>But wait, i'm grasping at "something"</p>
              <p>Ironically, im grasping something that can't be grasped?!</p>
              <p>Yet there seems to be something and yet nothing.</p>
