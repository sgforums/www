              It is the aspiration to want to achieve Buddhahood in order to benefit sentient beings.
              
              How to develop? 
              The first is mindfulness of the Buddhas' deep kindness.
              The second is mindfulness of our parents' kindness.
              The third is mindfulness of our teachers' and elders' kindness.
              The fourth is mindfulness of donors' kindness.
              The fifth is mindfulness of living beings' kindness.
              The sixth is mindfulness of the suffering in birth and death.
              The seventh is reverence for our own spiritual nature.
              The eighth is repenting ofkarmic obstacles and reforming.
              The ninth is the wish for rebirth in the Pure Land.
              The tenth is the wish to cause the Proper Dharma to remain in the world for a long time.

              <p>Hi pure emptiness,</p>
              <p>This is a very very huge topic. Not something one can just comment on in a post. And it is the work of a lifetime... But i'd give some suggestions based on the teachings of my teachers...</p>
              <p>The first step that one has to go through is developing a mind of repentance.  Don't just start right into bodhichitta. First, we have to look at our own faults. Examine how we are.  Example...</p>
              <p>How are we behaving with our parents?</p>
              <p>Are we grateful to those people who have given us benefit, shown us much kindness? </p>
              <p>Are we loyal to friends even when they are of zero benefit to us, are down and out, and may even cause us a lot of trouble...</p>
              <p>Are we considerate for others, always sensitive to their needs and wishes? </p>
              <p>Do we hold grudges for long time, get angry over small trifles, hard to forgive, always mentally regurgitating over past ledgers of faults of others?</p>
              <p>Do we take more than we give, do we demand more than think about how we can contribute?</p>
              <p>Do we look at peoples' faults more than we look at our own faults? </p>
              <p>Do we consider others at least as important as ourselves?</p>
              <p>Do we treat the public/temple facilities with no care, but take very good care of our own home facilities?</p>
              <p>Do we look down or pay no care to particular types of people/ races/ ugly/animals etc.  and pay more attention to others?</p>
              <p>Are we grateful for our environment, for the government, for the people who clear the rubbish, the people who built our roads, homes, construction workers, nurses, doctors, teachers and so on... many many people who make our lives possible and comfortable?  Have we considered them at all?   Do we have a heart of gratitude to them?</p>
              <p>Are we proud people?  Can we accept suggestions from others, criticisms?  Can we accept poor treatment from people we deem to be below us? </p>
              <p>In many facets of our daily life, we should keep examining our motivation and attitudes towards others.  It is important to first look at all these points in our own life and see clearly our own level of self-centredness and lack of gratitude to others.  If we see it clearly and reflect on it well, then we will give rise to a sense of shame and repentance... also the grosser sense of pride will slowly be removed. </p>
              <p>Many people in this modern society are not really aware of their own sense of pride.  It seems the more educated and sophisticated we become, we actually become more proud instead of humble.  Humility is truly the sign of being really learned. Actually, we are really nothing if not for the kindness of others... we came into this world with nothing and whatever we achieved is really in dependence on others yet, we have so much self aggrandizement at the cost of others...</p>
              <p>Looking at our own faults and slowly slowly examining it one by one... we will see this for ourselves and really wish to change.</p>
              <p>Before this step is complete, it is really quite difficult to go deeper about loving-kindness and compassion, because the route to bodhichitta will be filled with all kinds of obstacles.  We need to first examine ourselves and know ourselves first.  Then we can talk about bodhichitta which includes having compassion for all beings without any discrimination and even placing the interests of all beings above ourselves.  That is a very high level of practice. </p>
              <p>Bodhichitta is quite different from ordinary worldly sense of love or being a good person... because even on its relative level, it is free from discrimination in its object, and does not seek any return.  The worldly sense of love is limited to our circle of loved-ones and friends and seeks a return.  Bodhichitta is extended even to enemies, even to beings in the unseen realms, to all sentient beings, with no preference.  Eg, a person with true bodhichitta will not only be running around to save stray dogs, he will be saving snakes, mice etc.  As long as he come across a being in distress, he will save it, regardless of how repulsive, venomous it is to ordinary view... he does not restrict his efforts to benefit others in a fixed way... and he will not be capable of hatred no matter how much his own interest or well-being is threatened. </p>
              <p>A very clear example of this is the Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara or Guan Yin.  You can read about her vows and stories and how she save people with so much courage and fearlessness.  Guan Yin was once human. And he / she practised to become such a courageous maha - bodhisattva now.  It is said that at one point, he was so discouraged with the task that he almost gave up bodhichitta but was enouraged by Amitabha his teacher to continue... so it is a very touching story and one that we can all relate to.  Many dharma practitioners even today can attest to having received the help and blessings of Guan Yin.</p>
              <p>i hope what i commented can help you to start off although it is quite inadequate.  You need to meet a teacher who possesses the rare bodhichitta to teach you about it. Such a teacher is extremely hard to meet and to learn from, and when you meet such a teacher, due to your lack of merits, you may not be receptive to his teachings... so accumulate merits diligently. </p>
              <p>bodhichitta is the most important in Mahayana Buddhism, it is not possible at all to attain buddhahood without it.  And many people who attempt high profound practices without a deep grounding on switching their motivation to bodhichitta will not have any big results... it is said in the teachings that doing any virtuous practice without the motivation of bodhichitta will only produce a worldly result  and does not become the cause of Buddhahood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>More teachings related to Bodhichitta by Lama Zopa Rinpoche</strong></p>
              <p>The heart of the Dharma is bodhicitta, so your attitude should become that. Dedicate whatever you are doing, put effort into whatever you are doing, for all sentient beings. That includes friends, enemies, and strangers. By studying the lam-rim you will understand how to do that. That is the most important thing. You can do some meditation on emptiness every day. Read the part of the lam-rim on guru devotion. Read, study, and meditate every day on those outlines until you have some stable realizations of seeing the Guru as Buddha.</p>
              <p>The very last piece of advice is: Don’t think "I’m going to live for many years," following the concept of permanence. This life is like last night’s dream, very short, or like lightning in the sky—it appears while it is leaving. Therefore, put all your effort into Dharma, as I mentioned before.</p>
              <p>You will encounter problems. At that time, use bodhicitta, emptiness and patience. When you encounter problems, apply Dharma to bring peace in your heart and the heart of the other person. Sometimes there is no peace, but your methods can bring ultimate peace to that person, and to your heart and mind.</p>
              <p>In “Universal Education, Essential Wisdom” (Essential Education, Foundation for Developing Compassion and Wisdom), I gave very very basic advice that the important practice to apply to bring peace to all sentient beings, even animals, is to practice kindness, not only to human beings, but to animals, day and night; all of the time, practice kindness. From this, your life, your heart, is always in peace, day and night, under any circumstances, during difficult times, or during easy times. The result from one positive action, one kindness to one sentient being, brings happiness in 100,000 lifetimes.</p>
              <p>At the study group, you are practicing kindness all of the time. You can imagine how you will have unbelievable peace and happiness all of the time, in this life and future lives, from your compassion and loving kindness. Right away, every day, you make so many people happy, as the days, weeks, and months pass, wherever you travel, wherever you live.</p>
              <p>Whenever you see good things happen to others, think how wonderful it is that they have this happiness, this success. If somebody has a beautiful house, car, family, or friend, you rejoice. When somebody makes a great profit in business, you rejoice. Basically, this person has great happiness, and you think how wonderful it is. If the person has a great education, more understanding of the Dharma, practices more, or has a beautiful body, you rejoice.</p>
              <p>This doesn't directly use karma, but by practicing kindness to others and rejoicing, you collect merit like limitless skies. Rejoicing is the easiest way to collect merit. You collect all the merits. You are always creating the cause of happiness. You are making your life meaningful all the time. You are making your life beneficial for yourself and all sentient beings. Whenever people see you or remember you, there is always happiness. When they see you their minds are always happy.</p>
              <p>When you rejoice for somebody whose level of mind is lower than yours, you collect double the merit. If they are the same level as you, you get the same merit. If they are at a higher level of mind, you get half the merit. For example, if one who doesn’t have the realization of bodhicitta rejoices in one day of a bodhisattva’s merit, that person collects half the merit of what that bodhisattva collects in one day. I am talking about how much merit you collect. Without rejoicing, it takes 23,000 years. When you rejoice, you collect that merit in one second, so you can see how rejoicing is the easiest way in life to collect extensive merit.</p>
              <p>Now you can rejoice in one bodhisattva’s merits. It is unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable. Bodhisattvas are not just one but numberless, so the amount of merit you collect could make you faint. There are numberless bodhisattvas and sentient beings, so you can just imagine how much merit you collect.</p>
              <p>As it says in the <em><a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=399"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Three Principal Aspects of the Path</span></span></a></em>, by renouncing attachment and desire, it becomes very pure Dharma. Each time you practice that, it becomes very pure Dharma. Any time you renounce delusion, it becomes pure Dharma. Any time you go against attachment and desire, it becomes pure Dharma, as attachment and desire only lead to suffering. There are so many people in the world, so much suffering in organizations, countries, etc. through following desire and not practicing contentment. There are so many people engaged in illegal things who end up in prison. They have to suffer a lot and make many people unhappy. They get killed and punished. Renouncing attachment and desire is one method to bring peace and happiness into your life, into your heart, to create inner peace.</p>
              <p>When somebody harms you, forgive him or her. Immediately the other person receives so much peace and happiness and you also receive much peace and happiness. Most people get angry and want to get back at the person, and they do the opposite and give harm back to the person. As a result, the person’s family members and friends will harm you. You will be harmed by that person 500 times, not necessarily when you are in a human body. From that negative karma, from harming that person, you experience getting harmed or killed by that person 500 times. It makes you suffer on and on without end. There is the one complete negative karma that has four aspects: <br><br>1) The base, 2) thought, 3) action, and 4) goal. <br><br>When all of these are complete, you can receive four suffering results: <br><br>1) The ripening aspect result— rebirth in the lower realms for many billions of years. <br><br>There are three suffering results in the human realm: <br><br>1) The result similar to the cause—being killed by others.</p>
              <p>2) The possessed result, concerned with the place. Whatever view you hold is bad, the appearances you see are bad, and you live in a very dusty place. Medicines and food become harmful to you and can cause harm, sickness, and death</p>
              <p>3) Creating the result similar to the cause—you kill again because of the past imprint of killing, and you engage again and again in that negative karma. <br><br>You can see how one negative karma today results in so much suffering. It can make you faint. If you think about it, you have created so much negative karma today with your body, speech, and mind, this week, month, and year. From birth and from beginningless rebirths, you have created karma which has not been purified, not finished by experiencing it. If you really think well, you can’t stand having one negative karma near you. You can see how forgiveness is incredible. It stops you from harming others and others from harming you with their body, speech, and mind. Also, so many people, friends, family, and so forth, who are all connected to you, don’t engage in negative karmas because of you.</p>
              <p>The next point is, if you do some harm, make some mistake, immediately apologize so it doesn’t make the person angry with you, make him or her angry or suffer. If you say sorry immediately, the person doesn’t become angry, and it brings a release. If you can practice like this, it’s unbelievable.</p>
              <p>Do not get angry. Have peace in your heart. If you practice like this, with patience, you give happiness to all sentient beings, not only your family, but people at work too, not only in this country or this world, but after this life, to all sentient beings.</p>

              <p>Hi Pure Emptiness,</p>
              <p>Slowly ok, if i come across more articles, i'd post up here on this forum... Buddhism must learn bit by bit, and apply straight away into your life then you can improve... know alot but never apply, can't improve.  Even one sentence can make a big difference in our life... if you really want to develop love and compassion, you can start with what i write above...  look at your own heart and mind, every day, every moment, try to see own faults, don't find faults with others.  When you talk or do anything, always check your motivation again and again, you will find that you are deceiving yourself very often, find the true motivation, if selfish, try to change.. try to put others first, or at least be considerate.  Slowly change perspective first. Looking at your mind all the time is very good way to maintain mindfulness... so u can see that checking motivation is very good mindfulness practice too...</p>
              <p>At same time, whatever meditation u doing or chanting will always help you.  Also dedicate merit time, remember to add, 'By this merits, may I and all beings be able to develop Bodhichitta, Love and Compassion."</p>

              <p>By Dalai Lama</p>
              <p>Cultivating an aspiration to help other sentient beings becomes a cause for wanting to achieve Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. These are the two levels of the awakening mind of bodhichitta.<br>Such a mind cannot be cultivated in a mere few months or years, but this does not mean it cannot be cultivated at all. If you continue your practice to cultivate bodhichitta, a time will come when you will be successful. For example, in the initial stage you may not even understand the meaning of the word bodhichitta. You might wonder how you could ever cultivate such a mind. But through repeated practice and familiarity, you will gradually come closer to such a mind. <br>It is the nature of conditioned things that they change depending on causes and conditions. So it is important to recall the advantages and benefits of such a mind and cultivate a strong determination to achieve it. Make ardent prayers. Whether you sleep, walk, or sit, you should think: "How good it would be if I could cultivate such a mind." Try to cultivate bodhichitta even on an aspirational level. If you spend your days in such repeated and persistent practice, you can definitely develop it. Make the determination to cultivate it even if it will take many aeons. As Shantideva prays in his Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life: <br>   As long as space endures<br>   And as long as sentient beings remain,<br>   May I too abide<br>   To dispel the sufferings of all sentient beings.<br>--from Stages of Meditation by the Dalai Lama, root text by Kamalashila, translated by Geshe Lobsang Jordhen, Losang Choephel Ganchenpa, and Jeremy Russell, published by Snow Lion Publications</p>

              <p>Hi Pure Emptiness,</p>
              <p>It is very good to make the Bodhichitta vow as you have stated... but the previous foundations is also very important..&gt;  you have to keep examining your mind in daily life as i stated in the first post above to give rise to a sense of repentance and secondly a mind of gratitude to all beings... then the Bodhichitta in you will gradually be more and more heart-felt. </p>
              <p>It is said that when one is truly practising with Bodhichitta then the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will rejoice and definitely help you to achieve your vows... in such a case, you don't need to worry your own problems will not be solved... your mind will naturally be contented and satisfied and all your acts will be for the sake of sentient beings... that is how we train the mind...</p>
              <p>If in our practice, we come across any negative suffering or situations, then we recognise it as a sign of past karma ripening and purifying and also feel that we bear this suffering on behalf of all beings... to reduce their sufferings... in this way, no matter what situation arise, good or bad, the mind can remain in a equal state...  but of course, this is easy to say, but tough to execute... that's why we need to keep training the mind now.</p>
              <p>For myself, i find myself slipping into selfish motivation very often during the day... it takes place very quickly and subtly... so it is very important to keep watching the mind.  Train yourself to watch your motivation and mind throughout the day, not only when you are praying or reciting Buddha names etc.</p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Just to add,</p>
              <p>We are not ordained people so we can't spend most of our time meditating or practising in a formal session.  The Bodhichitta practice of watching our motivation and transforming all our daily life into service to sentient beings is one of the most powerful methods to progress spiritually while still engaged in daily routines and work.  For a layperson, this is one of the best method to practice as all activities can be transformed with the attitude of bodhichitta. </p>
              <p>Not only that, the attitude of bodhichitta itself will aid one's daily worldly life too... someone who thinks more for others, will definitely do business in a way that makes his customers come back... if you are always concerned and helping your colleagues, there will be less back-biting, politics in the office, a spirit of harmony will prevail in the office, one person's mind is very powerful it can make a great difference in many other peoples' minds...</p>
              <p>If you don't discriminate, but are grateful and kind to all beings, you will never know when one day your fate turn and in turn your life is saved by someone insignificant who was ignored by everyone else... i remember vaguely a story of a group of high-level executives who were trapped in a lift in a very perilous situation  (i think maybe the cable was snapping), when the rescue technicians came to lift one of them out of the lift, everyone clambered to be lifted out first, but the man whom the technicians chose to save first was someone who had always been friendly and kind to them in normal times... so you can see, sometimes we ignore people we think have no benefit to us or who are below us in social stature or luck, but any day, the tables may turn.... so it is very good and also in accordance to Buddhism, to be kind and friendly to all without discrimination... this is just one eg of how useful Bodhichitta is... there are many such stories/happenings in the past...</p>
              <p>With bodhichitta, one can't help but hold the precepts purely because one will never harm sentient beings intentionally.  Also, one will be very careful with body, speech and mind never to give rise to any act with possible further repercussions that will harm others or make others create negative karma like getting angry... in this way, through the practice of bodhichitta in daily life, we are preventing ourselves from accumulating any more heavy negative karma and creating heavy debts with others.  Our minds will be more discerning, we will look more subtly at things to make sure we don't harm others... when we are so sublte and careful, often we will preempt many problems even before they happen... this makes life more smooth in general.</p>
              <p>Also, only if one has the mind of loving-kindness and compassion and bodhichitta, can one truly effectively purify past negative karma.</p>
              <p>So if one combines this with whatever practice one is doing, it can only enhance your practice. It will promote the stability of your mind, give your peacefulness, increase your merits, benefit others, bring all your daily life into spiritual practice, gain the support of Buddhas, Bodhisattva, gods, humans and all kinds of beings and bring one to Buddhahood swiftly. </p>
              <p>The benefits of practising bodhichitta is quite vast, i can't enumerate them enough here... but safe to say, it will definitely change one's life quite alot... many people who practised the dharma for long time but see no change have to start with bodhichitta practice because it is the real way to change our attitudes... then later comes the other aspects of insight and realisations and activity of actually benefitting beings... otherwise, without this foundation, one can practice for a long time without any significant change and waste alot of time</p>
