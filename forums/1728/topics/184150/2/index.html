            <div class='col-md body'>There is a lady in my dharma centre who have spiritual powers because of her past life as spirit. For example, my mother asked her to visit this place, she say don't need. I can travel there spiritually, and it is true. She thought she is very powerful. My dharma teacher knew and told her it is her previous life.<br><br>Here's an article about 'The Five Eyes'<br><br><a href="http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Have you ever seen a ghost or a god? Normally people can't see things that are too far, near, big, or small. But some people borrow the power of a ghost or other spiritual being, and gain spiritual vision. There are also cases of heavenly beings who are born into the human realm, who still retain some ability to see ghosts and spirits in the realms below. They can no longer see into the heavenly realm, nor can they see ghosts and spirits in the human realm.<br><br>I had a student who came here for a beginner's class. She claimed to have some psychic power. She said that when she was well-concentrated, she could see into people's past, but I had my doubts. I asked her if she could see into my past. I have heavy karmic obstructions, which have their root in past lives, but still she could see nothing of my past. Why? People are not always reborn into the human realm. They might be born into a distant world, and ordinary psychic power would be too limited to see that far. It would be similar to a person who commits a crime in Taiwan and moves to New York. The New York police would have no record of the crime.<br><br>The ghostly or deva eye stands at a level between the fleshy and heavenly eyes. This phenomenon occurs when a spiritual being uses the eye of a human being as a medium. People who have experienced this believe that they have been endowed with great spiritual powers, but it is really the power of the spiritual being at work. There is a book about a spirit called Seth who used a woman's body to talk to people in this world. He could only talk through her.<br><br>I have a Dharma brother who has such powers. He was once sitting on a train, and suddenly he saw all the people sitting around him as pigs and dogs and other animals. He could see the changes that these people went through in various past lives, but he could see no further. This is not really his power, but that of a spiritual being working through him. I asked him if he could see such things with his eyes closed, and he answered no, but there are people who have such powers....</span></div>
