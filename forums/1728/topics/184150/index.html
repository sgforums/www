However, little did he realise that supernatural power could not help one escape the law of cause and effect. Neither did he know that it could not defeat karma and free one from the cycle of life and death.<br><br>Once, the Buddha's homeland Kapilavastu was invaded by King Vidudabha of Kosala. Being a patriot, the Buddha had succeeded in blocking the enemy for three times. But King Vidudabha did not want to give up. Knowing that this was due to the karma of Sakya clan. The Buddha had no choice but to let it be.<br><br>Mogallana was deeply agitated when heard that Kapilavastu was surrounded by enemy troops. Though the Buddha told him this was the karma of Sakya clan, he insisted on saving the clan people with his miraculous power.<br><br>He flew into Kapilavastu which was already encircled by enemy troops ring upon ring. He selected the five hundred outstanding Sakyas and put them in a bowl. When he had safely flown out of the country, he opened the bowl and found that the five hundred people in it had already turned into a flood of blood!<br><br>Mogallana then realised one could not violate the law of cause and effect taught by the Buddha. Even supernatural power could not outmatch karmic effect.</blockquote>Have you also heard of Mogallana's attempt to save his mother using his supernatural powers? It too, never worked, because his powers cannot supercede his mother's karmic forces.<br><br>Only by practising dharma, attaining enlightenment, will you have ability to save your parents even from your previous lifetimes, through your 'gong de'.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Saving His Mother</strong><br><br>Mogallana was noted not only for his great supernatural powers but also for his filial piety!<br><br>One day, while looking at the realm of hungry ghosts with his divine vision, Mogallana saw his mother suffering there. He was very sad. So, with the help of his supernatural power, the filial Mogallana provided a bowl of rice for his mother. However, when the rice reached his mother's hands, it turned into burning charcoal and could not be eaten. Upon seeing that, Mogallana could not help but cried sadly. Though he could tell what caused the ghosts to receive their retribution, he could not explain his mother's suffering. So he immediately went to ask the Buddha.<br><br>Buddha said compassionately, "Mogallana, your mother had in her previous life, slandered the Buddha and the Sangha. Moreover, she did not believe in retribution and had been greedy and hot-tempered. That is why she is receiving such a retribution. The reason why you do not know your mother's karma is that your supernatural power has been hindered by the love between mother and son!"<br><br>"Lord Buddha, is there any way to help my mother get out of the realm of hungry ghosts?" Mogallana asked earnestly.<br><br>"Mogallana, you cannot save you mother on your own because her bad karma is very serious. The only way is to depend on the supernatural powers of the holy monks to help free her from the suffering in the realm of hungry ghosts."<br><br>"The fifteenth of the seventh lunar month every year is the last day of summer retreat for all monks and many of them will have attained enlightenment by then. If one makes offerings to all holy monks on this day, he can rely on their united efforts to release his parents and relatives from the realms of suffering. If his parents are alive, they will live a longer and happier life."<br><br>The delighted Mogallana carried out Buddha's instructions and made offerings to all monks on the last day of the summer retreat. True enough, his mother was immediately freed from the realm of hungry ghosts. He was very grateful to Buddha and praised the beneficence of the Triple Gem. He also urged people to make offerings to Buddha and Sangha on the fifteenth of the seventh lunar month to repay the kindness of their parents. This is the origin of the Ullambana Festival.</blockquote></div>
