              <p>Now whether you want to eat eggs, I think is up to you, though very strict vegetarians don't eat eggs. If your body needs the protein, I do not advice you to stop eating them. Personally I am in no position to advice because I am not even a vegetarian.</p>
              <p>However regarding the kids, I don't think it's feasible to force them to become like vegetarian with you. If they are willing to be vegetarian with you that's fine, but otherwise, I guess you'll just have to take care of their non vege meals while try to have your own vege meals at the same time.</p>

              <p>So in term of keeping the 5 precepts, whereby if I strictly follow the first precept of not killing, can anybody advice does eating egg consider acceptable or not ?</p>
              <p>Since monk also do not eat egg, why ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I searched through buddhist sutra and reading materials of life of buddha, I have never see anything regarding eating eggs. Mostly are milks, rice, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this modern society whereby eggs are just farming eggs without becoming embryo, will this concept of eating eggs be different from last time ? I remembered when I was young staying in kampung, I sometimes saw little chicken embryo in cooked eggs....yuck !</p>
              <p>But nowadays, this is no more the case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anybody has any Sangha/Dhamma teachers to ask to ?</p>

During Buddha's time, he took milk because during his time, cows were not kept in a torturing way.</p></div>

              <p>Dear felllow Dharma Bros and Sis,</p>
              <p>I would like to clarify that Buddha was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a vegetarian. He took <em>almost</em> any food that the devotees offered to Him as it would not be nice to reject people's offer (He did not take meat from animals which were specifically killed by the devotees to be cooked for Him) This is similar to what you see in the Thai monastic tradition. As such, to give examples of what the Buddha ate to substantiate vegetarinism is a bit of a mistake here :p</p>

              <p>Yeah agreed. Many of the Tibetan rinpoches and lamas aren't vegetarian as well.</p>
              <p>Vegetarianism is a largely Mahayana practice, it's origins comes from Mahayana scriptures on the Bodhisattva practices. (developing great compassion)</p>
              <p>Vegetarianism wasn't practiced in the earliest form of Buddhism. As for Buddha, though he is fully enlightened Buddha, he was manifesting in the likes of a Shravaka monk like the rest, so I don't think he adopted a Vegetarian lifestyle, a Shravaka monk simply receives what is donated. Though at heart the Buddha is Mahayana who has completed his Bodhisattva vows. The historical Buddha taught Shravaka teachings [those that primarily aim for the liberation of oneself rather than full Buddhahood and liberation of other sentient beings], Mahayana teachings are later development hundreds of years after Buddha's parinirvana received through visions from the Sambhogakaya.</p>
              <p>As for Tibetan Buddhism, it is also part of Mahayana with Mahayana ideals, that's why many Tibetan masters do encourage and practice vegetarian (not all however, as it is very hard for vegetation to grow in the highlands of Tibet).</p>

              <p>I am confused when one of you said Buddha actually eat meat and actually eating meat is OK lah.</p>
              <p>It sounds to me like, never mind, it's OK to eat meat, no choice lah.</p>
              <p>Tibetan is because they have to survive, then no choice lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I found the below sutra. It doesn't say otherwise.</p>
              <p>I believe practise is practise, whether you really want to be disciplined to reach the goal of liberation, or you really believe in karma retribution of killing, then we should be disciplined enough to say we have to be vegetarian. And we aim to be vegetarian to keep the first precept of non-killing. We are living in S'pore, there are plenty choices of food. We have the accumulation of merit to be born here, we should not waste this chance.</p>

              <hr>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 16: Do not eat meat</span></strong><br><br><br>(Not eating meat is very important for Bodhisattva practice)<br><br>   At that time, Arya(sage) Mahamati(Great Wisdom) Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said to the Buddha: <br><br>   "Bhagavan(World Honored One), I see that in all worlds, the wandering in births and deaths, the enlaced animosities, and the falling into evil paths, are all caused by meat eating and cyclical killing. Those behaviors increase greed and anger, and make living beings unable to escape from suffering. That is truly very painful."<br><br>   "Bhagavan, people who eat meat are destroying the great merciful seed of their own, thus the people who practice the holy Way should not eat meat. "<br><br>   "Bhagavan, the Exterior-paths practitioners preach the incorrect theories which may fall into the mundane views, nihilism, eternalism, existentialism, or non-existence-ism, however, all of their theories forbid meat eating, they do not eat meat and do not allow others to eat meat. So would it be possible that, for the cultivators who practice Brahma-behavior(Brahma-carya) according to the pure Dharma of Tathagata(Thus Come One), there is no rule to forbid meat eating? The Tathagata, the Bhagavan equally gives his mercy and compassion to all living beings, how could he allow meat eating? Virtuous Bhagavan, please tell us the offences of meat eating, and the meritorious virtues of not eating meat. Once we have heard it, all the Bodhisattvas and I will faithfully practice it, widely preach and spread it abroad, to make all living beings of the past, the present, and the future be aware of it."<br><br>   The Buddha told Arya Mahamati Bodhisattva: "Good, good, Mahamati, you are greatly compassionate, having pity on all living beings, you asked this question. Now listen attentively and I'll tell you."<br><br>   Mahamati Bodhisattva said to the Buddha: "How virtuous, Bhagavan! Yes I'll accept the teaching."<br><br>   The Buddha told Mahamati: "Meat eating has countless offences. All Bodhisattvas should cultivate their great mercy and compassion so that they should not eat meat. Now I am telling you in brief the merits of not eating meat, and the offences of meat eating, please listen attentively."<br><br>   "Mahamati, I see that from the beginningless time, because of the habit of meat eating and the greed for flavors of meats, living beings kill and hurt each others in never ending cycles, thus they are apart from sages and suffering from births and deaths."<br><br>   "Those who renounce the flavor of meat can taste the flavors of the true Dharmas, truthfully practice the Bhumi(stage)s of Bodhisattva, and attain Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi quickly. They can then make all living beings enter the resting-place of Sravaka(voice-hearer) and pratyeka-buddha(self-enlightened one), and after that make them enter the stage of Tathagata."<br><br>   "Mahamati, these benefits are based on the merciful heart. People who eat meat are destroying the great merciful seed of their own, then how could they get these great benefits?"<br><br>   "Mahamati, I see that living beings are in the transmigration of the six paths, being together in births and deaths, they give birth to and foster each others, and cyclically become fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters of each others; They may be men or women, may be the direct line of descent, may be cousins, affinities, uncles, aunts, sons, daughters, grandsons, and other various relatives of each others; They may also be born in other paths(of animal, ghost, god, and so on.), whether virtuous or evil, they frequently become the relatives of each others. Because of these relationships, I see that all meats eaten by living beings are of their own relatives. Due to the greed for flavors of meats, the living beings circularly eat each others, then they always have the thoughts of hurting each others. Their painful karmas are always increasing, so they are wandering in cycles of births and deaths and unable to escape."<br><br>  <em> (* The six paths: god, human, Asura, animal, hungry ghost, hell-being)</em><br><br>   After the Buddha had said that, all the Raksas who heard the Buddha's words gave up their ferocious minds and stopped meat eating from then on. They persuaded each others to arouse the merciful heart, to make protecting the lives of all living beings prior to protecting the lives of their own, to give up eating of all meat. Weeping and sobbing, they said to the Buddha:<br><br>   "Bhagavan, having heard the Buddha said that, in the six paths, all the meat we eat are of the relatives of our own, we now know that meat eating makes us the big enemies of living beings, destroys our great merciful seeds, increases evil karmas, and is the root of great suffering. Bhagavan, from now on we stop meat eating, and will never allow my relatives to eat meat. If any disciple of Tathagatas does not eat meat, we will guard and support him day and night. For anyone who eats meat, we will do great bad things to them."<br><br>   The Buddha said: "Mahamati, the Raksas are ferocious ghosts who constantly eat meat. Having heard my words, even they can arouse the merciful heart and give up meat eating, so how could my disciples who practice virtuous Dharmas be allowed to eat meat? If anyone eats meat, we should know that he is the big enemy of living beings and is destroying his holy seed."<br><br>   "Mahamati, having heard my words, if any of my disciples does not honestly consider that and still eats meat, we should know that he is of the candala(killer) 's lineage. He is not my disciple and I am not his teacher. Therefore, Mahamati, if anyone wish to be my relative, he should not eat any meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, Bodhisattvas should discern that all meats are from the filthy bodies, which are combined by pus, blood, dirtiness, red-bindu(Bright Drop)s, white-bindus of the parents. Thus, discerning the dirtiness of meat, Bodhisattvas should not eat meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, for anyone who eats meat, his smell frightens living beings and makes them run away. Therefore, Bodhisattvas practice according to the truth, in order to enlighten all living beings, they should not eat meat."<br><br>   "Mahamati, for example, wherever there are candala(killer)s, hunters, butchers, fishers, or birders, when the living beings see them remotely, they will think: 'We are dying. These approaching killers are very atrocious beings, they are not aware of sins or bliss. They kill living beings for their current earning. Now they come to look for us, and we have flesh on our body, so when they find us, we will surely die."<br><br>   "Mahamati, due to meat eating, one can make the living beings who see him so frightened. Mahamati, all living beings, whether they are celestial or terrestrial, when they see a meat eater, they will all be frightened and think: 'I don't know whether I am going to die now. This flagitious being does not cultivate his merciful heart, he is like a jackal and a wolf, who cruises in the world and seeks for meat. He is insatiable, like a cow eating grass, like a dung beetle pursuing dung. My body is make of flesh so I am his food, I should not encounter him'. Thinking of this, they turn aside and escape hastily, just like human being fears raksa."<br><br>   "Mahamati, a meat eater can make the living beings who see him so frightened, thus we know that meat eating makes one the big enemy of all living beings. Therefore, Bodhisattvas should cultivate mercy and compassion, in order to gather in and teach all living beings, they should not eat those living beings. Meat is not the food for sage and wise people. Meat eating is infamous and is criticized by sages. Therefore, Mahamati, in order to gather in and teach all living beings, Bodhisattvas should not eat meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, in order to protect the faith of living beings, Bodhisattvas should not eat meat. Why? Mahamati, all living beings know that, anyone who is called 'Bodhisattva' is the inheritor of the merciful heart of Buddhas/Tathagatas. He can be the refuge of all living beings; he makes the living beings who hear his name have no fear; he makes the living beings think that he is the relative, the friend, and the good knowing advisor of them; he makes the living beings say that: 'We now have the place of refuge and peace, and have the virtuous teacher.' Mahamati, not eating meat can make living beings have such faith. Anyone who eats meat makes all living beings have no faith in him, then the living beings would say: 'There is no trusty person in the world', so they would lost their root of faith. Therefore, Mahamati, in order to protect the faith of living beings, Bodhisattvas should not eat any meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, in order to prevent the mundane persons from slandering the Three-Treasures(tri-ratna), my disciples should not eat meat. Why? Because if someone in the earthliness finds that any of my disciples is eating meat, he would slander the Three-Treasures, saying: 'In Buddhism, would there be any true sramana(monk) or Brahmana(Indian religious practitioner) who practices Brahma-behavior? How come they abandon the sage's food and eat the flesh of living beings? They are like the raksas who fill their stomachs with meat and then sleep drowsily without moving. They rely on the richness and force of the mundane persons to find meat to eat. They frighten living beings as the Raksa-kings do.' Therefore, he would spread these words everywhere: 'Where are the true sramanas and Brahmanas who practice pure behaviors? There is no Dharma, no sramana, no vinaya(precept/discipline), and no pure practitioner at all.' If people have such immeasurable evil minds, my Dharma-Wheel would be broken and the seeds of sage would be strangled. These tragedies are all due to the offences of the meat eaters. Therefore, Mahamati, in order to prevent the villains from slandering the Three-Treasures, my disciples should not even think of meat, not to mention eating."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, in order to turn the worlds into pure Buddha-worlds, in which all living beings can be enlightened, Bodhisattvas should not eat meat. They should discern that all meats are like the dead bodies of human being, we cannot even bear looking at or smelling them, how could we put them into our mouths? Mahamati, the burned dead bodies are stinky and feculent, the cooked meats are as stinky and feculent as the burned dead bodies, so how could we eat such things? Therefore, Mahamati, in order to turn the worlds into pure Buddha-worlds, to enlighten all living beings, Bodhisattvas should not eat meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, in order to get out of births and deaths, Bodhisattvas should intently practice mercy and compassion. They should have few desires, be content with a little, dislike the suffering in the world, and seek for liberation urgently. They should renounce the blatancies of the world and stay in quiet places. They may stay in graveyard(sita-vana)s or monasteries(arinya), they may stay in the midst of tombs, or sit alone under trees to meditate. They should discern that there is no true happiness in the world, wives and relatives are like shackles; palaces, houses and courts are like prisons; all jewels and treasures are like masses of dung; all drinks and foods are like pus and blood; drinking and eating are like applying something on the tumours and sores, that is not for greediness, but for maintaining the life to practice the sage Way. All alcohols, meats, shallots, leeks, garlic, and scallions are feculent so that we should not eat them. Mahamati, if anyone practices in this wise, then he is a true cultivator who deserves offerings of all celestial and human beings. If one does not dislike the world and does not wish to get out of it, in the meantime he has the greed for alcohol, meat, and the five pungent plants, then he is not worthy of faiths and offerings of the world."<br><br><em>(* The five pungent plants: shallot, leek, garlic, scallion and hingu)</em><br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, some living beings had cultivated innumerable causes, conditions and affinities in the past, then they have a little virtuous roots now so that they are able to hear my Dharma. Having faith, they became Buddhist monks. However, some of them may had been relatives of raksas, or had been tigers, wolves, lions, cats, dogs, and so on. Although they are studying my Dharma, they may still have the residual habit of meat eating, so they may like to be close to meat eaters. They may drink alcohol and eat meat in cities, states, villages, towers or temples and think that this is happy, while people in the world find that they are like raksas contending for eating dead bodies. They don't know that they are no longer my disciples and have become the relatives of raksas. Even though they are in kasaya(monk's robe)s and had all their moustache and hair shaved, they make living beings who see them frightened like seeing raksas. Therefore Mahamati, if anyone regards me as his teacher, he should not eat any meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, for those wizards with wrong views, if they eat meat then their conjuring will not succeed. In order to make their conjuring successful, even they do not eat meat. For my disciples, in order to seek for the supreme sacrosanct Way of Tathagatas and the supra-mundane liberation, they diligently cultivate great mercy and compassion and practice austerities. In such a way, they still fear that they cannot achieve the goal, so how could the liberation be achieved by those ignorant persons who eat meat? Therefore, Mahamati, in order to seek for the joy of supra-mundane liberation, my disciples should not eat meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, meat eating can increase desires, meat eaters are greedy. We should discern that in the world, every being who has body and life cherishes his life and fears the pain of death. For the instinct of protecting and cherishing the life, there is no different between human and animal. They would rather live in their scabby fox bodies than give away the body to enjoy the heavenly happiness, why? because they fear the pain of death. Mahamati, observing in such a way, we know that death is a great suffering and is a fearful thing. For every living being, he himself is afraid of death, how could he eat the meat of others? Therefore, Mahamati, anyone who want to eat meat should first discern the pain of cutting his own body, and then discern the pains of all living beings, and then gives up meat eating."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, those meat eaters are abandoned by all celestial beings, not to mention sages. Therefore, in order to see sages, Bodhisattvas should cultivate mercy and compassion and should not eat meat. Mahamati, meat eaters are suffering both when they are sleeping and when they are awake. They often see various terrible things in their dreams, which frighten them and make their hair staring. They are always in a state of discomposure. Because they are not merciful, they lack the virtuous powers. If they are alone in void places, ghosts and spirits will often disturb them, tigers, wolves and lions will also wait for the chance to eat their flesh, so their hearts are often filled with fears and unable to rest."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, the greediness of those meat eater is hard to satisfy. They eat too much and are unable to digest, this aggravates burdens of their bodies and makes their mouth-smell foul. There are innumerable fierce worms living in their bodies, and there are a lot of tumours, ringworms, scabs, and other various skin diseases on their bodies. Even the mundane people would not like to smell and see them in their present lifetime, how could they acquire the healthy and clean human bodies in their next lifetime?"<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, I teach mundane people that they should eat pure food for purifying their lives, and should regard all meats as the meat of their own son, so how could I allow them to eat the foods that sages do not eat? Why all sages abandon meat? Because meat eating produce innumerable offences, and lose all supra-mundane merits and virtues, so how could I allow my disciples to eat meat, blood, and the feculent flavors? If anyone says that I allow meat eating, he is slandering me."<br><br>   "Mahamati, I allow my disciples to eat what sages should eat, and do not allow them to eat what sages abandon. The sages' foods can help us to produce innumerable merits and virtues, and help us to keep away from the offences. Mahamati, the foods for sages of past, present, and future are: rice, barley, wheat, bean, various vegetable oils, honey, sugarcane, sugarcane juice, and other vegetable foods. They are seasonal products, are allowed to be eaten and can be considered pure foods."<br><br>   "Mahamati, in the future, there will be some ignorant persons saying that many Buddhist precepts(vinaya) allow meat eating. They love the flavors of meats due to their past meat eating habit, they said those words simply according to their own views. But in fact Buddhas and sages have never said that meats are foods."<br><br>   "Mahamati, in the future, anyone who does not eat meat must have offered and sustained many Buddhas and have cultivated his virtuous roots, so he is able to believe the Buddhas' words, keep precepts firmly, and believe in cause and effect. He has self discipline of his body and mouth, not greedy for the various flavors in the world, and can arouse his merciful heart when he see meat eaters."<br><br>   "Mahamati, I remember that in the past, there was a king named lion-slaver. He eats many kinds of meat and loves the flavors of meat, so as to eats the flesh of human. Because he eats human flesh, his parents, brothers, wives and relatives all abandoned him, all his officials, people, states, villages then rebelled and killed him. Because meat eaters have such offences, we should not eat any meat."<br><br>   "Further more, Mahamati, in the past, the king of creation-enjoyment heaven(Nirmana-rataya) had been a pigeon. Then Sakra-Devanam-Indra, who is the lord of Trayastrimsha heaven, driven by his past meat eating habit, transformed himself into an eagle and pursued the pigeon. The pigeon came to me for shelter. At that time, I was the Sibi king, having pity on the cyclically killing and eating of living beings, I substituted myself for the pigeon, weighed the flesh of my body and give the flesh to the eagle. Since the flesh I cut down is not enough, I walked up onto the balance and suffered the great pain. Mahamati, because of this meat-eating habit of innumerable lifetimes, both oneself and others have such offences, how much more of those who often eat meat and have no shame!"<br><br>   "Mahamati, and there was another king who does not eat meat, once when he was riding on a horse and strolling, his horse was accidentally scared and carried him into the deep of the mountain, then he lost his retinue and lost the way out. But because he does not eat meat, lions and tigers did not want to harm him when saw him, the female lions walk together with him and wished to serve him. The animals even gave birth to their babies in front of him."<br><br>   "For another example, there was a king named fleck feet. Because of the meat eating habit of his past lifetimes, when he was a king he also eat meat frequently. He loves to eat meat and having eaten too much meat, so that he ate human flesh. Subsequently, all the children he borne, no matter sons or daughters, are raksas. Mahamati, due to the past meat eating habit, it is very likely that the meat-eating living beings would become raksas, lions, tigers, wolves, jackals, leopards, cats, palm civets, hawks, owls, vultures, eagles, owlets, chooks, and so on. All living beings protect their bodies severally to prevent those flesh-eaters from getting the chance of hurting them. The meat eaters often suffer from hunger, they often have the atrocious mind of eating flesh of others. Upon their death they will fall into the evil paths again, it is very hard for them to become human beings, even harder to get to the Way of Nirvana."<br><br>   "Mahamati, we should know that meat eaters have so many countless offences, thus vegetarians have masses of countless merits and virtues. But, Mahamati, the mundane persons do not know these offences of meat eating and the merits of not eating meat, so now I say in brief that I do not allow meat eating."<br><br>   "Mahamati, if no one eats meat, then no one kills living beings for food. Because there are people who wish to eat meat, if they have no meat to eat they will go everywhere to buy meat, then the others who wish to earn money will kill living beings and sell the flesh to the meat eaters. The killings are for the buyers, thus the buying is the same as the killing. Therefore, meat eating can obstruct the holy Way." <br><br>   "Mahamati, meat eaters love the flavor of meat, if they have no animal meat to eat, they would even eat human flesh, not to mention if they get other kinds of living beings, including roes, deer, pheasants, rabbits, swans, wild geese, pigs, sheep, chooks, dogs, camels, donkeys, elephants, horses, dragons, snakes, fishes, turtles, and so on, whether living in water or on the ground, it is very likely that they will eat those animals. Because they love the flavor of meat, they use many methods to kill living beings. They will setup various equipments, machineries, traps, holes, nets, bows, arrows, swords, poisons, etc throughout mountains, earth, rivers, weirs, seas, etc, innumerable living beings in sky, in water, or on the ground are being killed. All these are caused by meat eating."<br><br>   "Hunters, butchers, meat eaters and the like are atrocious and hardhearted, they can do what others cannot have the heart to do. When they see the living beings whose bodies are fresh, fat or fleshy, they would think of eating them. They would point to those animals and say to each other: 'Those animals are edible!' without even a little bit of mercy. Therefore, Mahamati, I say that meat eaters are destroying their great merciful seed."<br><br>   "Mahamati, I see that in the world, all meats are gotten from the bodies of living beings. If people do not kill, do not ask others to kill, and nobody kill for earning, then where are the meats come from? If there are meats that are not gotten from the bodies of living beings and are indeed delicious foods, how come I do not allow eating them? But there is no such meat all over the world, thus I say that meat eating is a sin, which destroys the seed of Tathagata. Therefore, I do not allow eating meat."<br><br>   "Mahamati, after my Nirvana, in the future when Dharmas are about to disappear, in my Dharmas, there will be some monks who have their moustache and hair shaved and call themselves 'sramana' and 'Son of Sakyamuni'. Although they are in my kasaya(monk's robe)s, they are as ignorant as babies. They call themselves 'teacher of precepts' but fall into the two-extremes(two wrong views), with various fallacious apprehensions and analysis, their mind are disordered and not composed, and they are greedy for the flavors of meat. They follow their own minds to say: 'Buddhist precept(vinaya)s allow meat eating', and slander me: 'The Buddha, the Tathagata allows eating meat', and even slander me: 'The Tathagata, the Bhagavan himself also eats meat.'"<br><br>   "Mahamati, in all sutras, including Elephant-Armpit Sutra, Angulimalika Sutra, Nirvana Sutra, Great-Cloud Sutra, etc, I have never allow meat eating, and have never said that any meat can be added to foods. Mahamati, if I allow Sravaka(voice-hearer)s or any disciples to eat meat, then I am not qualified to praise the practitioners who honestly cultivate great mercy and compassion, to praise the practitioners who do Dhuta-practice in graveyard(Sita-vana)s, to praise those who practice and persevere to Mahayana(Great vehicle), and to praise vegetarians."<br><br><em>(* Dhuta practice: twelve disciplines of restraint concerning food, clothing and shelter)</em><br><br>   "I do not eat meat and do not allow others to eat meat, thus I persuade people to practice Bodhisattva-behaviors, praise not eating meat, and persuade people to regard all living beings as their own sons. So how could someone say that I allow meat eating? For my disciples who practice any of the three vehicles to achieve their goals quickly, I forbid eating of any meat, how could someone say that my precept(vinaya)s allow meat eating?"<br><br>   "And some people will say: 'In other sutras, the Tathagata has allowed eating of three kinds of meat', they simply do not understand that the meaning of precepts is to stop meat eating gradually, so they will say that meat eating is allowed."<br><br>   "Mahamati, there are two kinds of meat, meat of the first kind are killed by others, and meat of the second kind are from the living beings that died of themselves. Mundane people say that some are edible, and some are inedible. They may say that meat of elephants, horses, dragons, humans, ghosts, macaques, monkeys, pigs, dogs, cows are inedible, and others are edible. But butchers do not care whether edible or not, they simply kill all and sell everywhere, thus innumerable innocent living beings have been killed. Therefore I constitute the precept: All meat, whether they are killed by others or died of themselves, are not allowed to be eaten. We call some meat are 'killed by others' if we see, hear or suspect so; we call other meat are 'died of self' if we did not see, hear or suspect that they had been killed. Therefore, Mahamati, my precept(vinaya)s say: All meats are impure for sramana(monk)s - the Sons of Sakyamuni. They pollute the pure lives and obstruct the holy Way, so there is no expedience that allows meat eating."<br><br>   "If someone say: 'The reason that the precepts mention three kinds of meat is to forbid meat eating, not to allow', we should know that he keeps precepts firmly, and does not slander me. Mahamati, now in this Lankavatara Sutra I say, at all times, all kinds of meats are inedible, unexceptionally. Mahamati, I forbid meat eating not only for one time, I mean that both in present and future, meat eating is forbidden."<br><br>   "Mahamati, if those ignorant persons who call themselves 'precept teacher' say that precepts allow meat eating, and slander me that the Tathagata himself also eats meat, then that become a great sin which obstructs them. They will fall into the places of no benefit, no sage and no Dharma for eons. They will not be able to see the sage disciples in present and future, not to mention seeing Buddhas and Tathagatas."<br><br>   "Mahamati, the everyday foods for voice-hearer(Sravaka)s are: rice, noodles, vegetable oils, honeys, various beans, and other vegetables. They can nourish the pure lives. As for any things that are stored, accepted, or gotten illegally, I say they are impure and do not allow to eat them, much less I would allow to eat the nasty things such as blood and meat."<br><br>   "Mahamati, for my disciples, including voice-hearers, pratyeka-buddha(self-enlightened one)s and Bodhisattvas, they eat Dharma and do not need any drinks and foods, not to mention the Tathagata. Mahamati, all Buddhas - Tathagatas eat Dharma and stay in Dharma, their bodies do not need any drinks and foods, and are not like any bodies which need drinks and foods. Mahamati, I regard every living being as a same son, how could I allow eating of their flesh? I do not compliantly rejoice eating of meat, much less I myself would eat."<br><br>   "Mahamati, all these feculent and nasty things: fleshes, shallots, leeks, garlic, scallions, etc can obstruct the holy Way, and prevent living beings from becoming human, heavenly or pure beings, not to mention the retribution of being reborn in the buddhas' pure lands. Alcohol also can obstruct the holy Way, can erode good karmas, can bring on offences. Therefore, Mahamati, for anyone who is coming to the holy Way, he should not drink alcohol, and should not eat meat, shallots, leeks, garlic, scallions, or other pungent things."<br><br>   At that time, to repeat the teaching, the Bhagavan said a verse(gatha): <br><br>"Mahamati Bodhisattva asked:<br>'The Buddha say that, alcohol, meat, shallots, leeks, garlic and scallions are all impure and not allowed to be eaten.<br>They are what raksas eat, are not the foods for sages.<br>Eating of them is criticized by sages, and is infamous.<br>Bhagavan, please analyze the offences of eating them, and the bliss of not eating them.'<br><br>Mahamati do listen carefully,<br>I am telling you the offences of eating them.<br>Alcohol, meat, shallots, leeks, garlic and scallions,<br>are obstructions to the holy Way.<br>I see that in the three-realms,<br>all living beings, including sages,<br>have cyclically become relatives of each others since beginningless time.<br>How could we eat any of them?<br><br>Discern where meats come from,<br>then we know that they are very feculent.<br>Meats are combinations of pus, blood, urine, dung, purulence, mucus, etc.<br>One who practice pure behaviors,<br>should discern that and should not eat meat.<br>He also should not drink alcohol,<br>should keep away from shallots, leeks, garlic, scallions, and sesame oil,<br>should not sleep on through-hole-beds.<br>And should not kill any lives, including those flying tiny insects.<br>Meat eating increases hindrances of the body, and produces evil minds;<br>Evil minds produce greed, thus I do not allow meat eating.<br>The greed produced by meat eating can lead one to insobriety,<br>and insobriety produces lustfulness,<br>then one cannot extricate himself from births and deaths.<br><br>Those who kill living beings for earning, or sell flesh for money,<br>will fall into the Screaming-Hell after their death.<br>The so-called three-pure-meat are: did not see the killing, did not hear the killing, and do not suspect that they were killed;<br>But in fact there is no such meat in the world.<br>If one fall into the type of meat eaters,<br>He is stinky, feculent, and disgusting, and probably would be mad.<br>He will most likely be born in the families of killers, hunters, butchers, raksas,<br>or other meat-eating places,<br>or will become cats, weasels, or the like.<br><br>In Elephant-Armpit Sutra, Great-Cloud Sutra, Nirvana Sutra, Srimala Sutra, and Lankavatara Sutra,<br>I forbid meat eating;<br>Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and voice-hearers also criticize meat eating.<br>The one who eats meat without feeling shame,<br>will always be mad in his every lifetime.<br>The conditions mentioned above: did not see the killing, did not hear the killing, and do not suspect that they were killed,<br>have already excluded all kinds of meat,<br>but those with mistaken thoughts do not understand that,<br>so they still think that some meat are edible.<br>Just like the offences produced by greed can obstruct the holy liberation,<br>alcohol, meat, shallots, leeks, garlic and scallions,<br>all are obstructions to the holy Way.<br>In future there will be ignorant people who say:<br>'Meats are pure, eating them is sinless, and is allowed by the Buddha.'<br>But in fact what I always say is,<br>Eating meat is like eating the flesh of ones' own son.<br><br>My disciples are content with very little, <br>they dislike the suffering in the world,<br>seek for liberation,<br>and practice mendicancy.<br>I always say that,<br>If anyone wish to keep his peaceful and merciful heart,<br>he should keep away from meat eating.<br>For example,<br>People do not dare to walk and live together with lions, jackals, tigers and wolves,<br>Because those are meat eaters, they make everyone who sees them frightened;<br>Likewise,<br>Meat eating frightens many living beings, how could we do that?<br>Thus, Practitioners should be merciful and should not eat meat.<br>Meat eating destroys the merciful heart,<br>obstructs Nirvana and liberation,<br>and violates the teachings of sages,<br>thus I do not allow eating meat.<br>Not eating meat cultivates the pure-heavenly(Brahma) seed and many practice-Ways;<br>Wisdom, richness and nobleness,<br>all come from not eating meat.<br><br><br><em>(* Note: The word "meat" in this translation means any fleshes and innards of any animals, including human, beast, fish, bird, mollusk, and so on, no matter they are cooked or uncooked, edible or inedible, killed by themselves or killed by others, or died of themselves.

              <p>It sounds to me like, never mind, it's OK to eat meat, no choice

                      in karma retribution of killing, then we should be disciplined

                      to keep the first precept of non-killing. We are living in S'pore,
                      there are plenty choices of food. We have the accumulation of merit

              <p>The Mahayana Lankavatara Sutra and the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra are the two major sutras teaching vegetarianism. These are developments hundreds of years after Buddha with the advent of Mahayana Buddhism. It is not found in the earliest form of Buddhism, as I said. It is part of the Bodhisattva practice. This is important in Mahayana but not stressed in Theravada.</p>
              <p>As for vegetarianism, it is not compulsory in Buddhism but is recommended especially if you aspire to practice Bodhisattva path.</p>
              <p>Otherwise the least we must do is eat only the five clean meat:</p>

                       they 
                            hesitate to take refuge in the Three Treasures because they do not

                              Buddha-dharma is infinite and there are in reality more than 
                      84,000 Dharma 
                              doors, or methods by which we can embark to learn and practise 
                      Buddhism. 
                              Vegetarianism is just one of the many methods. To refrain from 
                      killing 
                              is merely a means of assisting us to progress in our 
                      cultivation. As a 
                              medicine, meat is permitted in the Buddhist precepts if it is 
                      required 
                              to cure a particular sickness. Buddhism cherishes compassion. 
                      However, 
                              killing and causing harm to life have their retributions. The 
                      world has 
                              no peace as victims and villains engage in a vicious cycle of 
                      vengeance 
                              and revenge, culminating in calamities and disasters, and 
                      inflicting suffering 
                              and misery across the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha 
                      understands 
                              the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have 
                      accumulated from 
                              aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient 
                      beings with 
                              an expedient means of embracing <em><strong><span style="color: #003399;">Buddhism,
                       
                              those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long
                       term 
                              basis are permitted to consume meat provided:</span></strong></em> </span></p>

                      did not

                              refrain from killing is fundamental to Buddhism. Regardless of 
                      life forms, 
                              we must not kill, we must not instruct others to kill, and it 
                      must not 
                              be killed for our sake, for example, to celebrate our birthday 
                      or because 
                              we were coming to dinner. These are three sources of clean meat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In 
                      Confucianism, benevolence 
                              also means to refrain from killing. It is said that heaven has 
                      the virtue 
                              of loving life. It cannot bear to witness the loss of life, let 
                      alone 
                              eat the flesh of those whose cries in death we have heard. 
                      Buddhism advocates 
                              compassion and loving-kindness to all sentient beings, 
                      regardless of their 
                              relation to you. It is only appropriate that we do not kill for 
                      our livelihood 
                              or for the purpose of celebrating occasions, such as births, 
                      birthdays, 
                              funerals or weddings. Meats are no different from the other 
                      foodstuffs 
                              purchased from the market if people do not witness the killing 
                      or hear 
                              the cries of the animal that is being slaughtered. If a 
                      differentiation 
                              between the two kinds of purchases and the taste of the meat do 
                      not exist 
                              in the mind, then the guilt is lighter. Together with the three 
                      mentioned 
                              earlier, these constitute the five sources of clean meat. </span></p>

                      however 
                              is a pre-condition to killing. If people refrain from eating 
                      meat, there 
                              will be no killing of animals for meat. Sadly, the human race 
                      has committed 
                              killings for aeons and is engaged in an endless cycle of 
                      vengeance and 
                              revenge over their past lives. For one who is slaughtered for 
                      meat in 
                              this life, it is probably because he had done the same to others
                       in the 
                              past. The score is even, no more and no less. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">People who 
                      eat meat 
                              from the five clean sources are advised to learn to chant the 
                      Buddha's 
                              name and the Buddhist mantras, so as to transfer the merits to 
                      those whose 
                              meat they are eating. They should also wish them an early 
                      rebirth in the 
                              human realm, to eliminate any thoughts of vengeance, to nurture 
                      their 
                              virtuous roots to benefit all sentient beings and together build
                       a peaceful, 
                              caring and blissful pure land in this world. Only when this is 
                      promoted 
                              across the entire world, will we be able to eliminate hatred and
                       vengeance, 
                              and enhance a mind of compassion and loving kindness. In this

              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">There 
                                  are differences of opinion between Buddhists on this
               issue 
                                  so we will attempt to present the arguments of those
               who believe 
                                  that vegetarianism is necessary for Buddhists and 
              those who 
                                  do not. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Vegetarianism 
                                  was not a part of the early Buddhist tradition and 
              the Buddha 
                                  himself was not a vegetarian. The Buddha got his 
              food either 
                                  by going on alms rounds or by being invited to the 
              houses 
                                  of his supporters and in both cases he ate what he 
              was given. 
                                  Before his enlightenment he had experimented with 
              various 
                                  diets including a meatless diet, but he eventually 
              abandoned 
                                  them believing that they did not contribute to 
              spiritual development. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The 
                                  Nipata Sutta underlines this point when it says that
               it is 
                                  immorality that makes one impure (morally and 
              spiritually), 
                                  not the eating of meat. The Buddha is often 
              described as eating 
                                  meat, he recommended meat broth as a cure for 
              certain types 
                                  of illness and advised monks for practical reasons, 
              to avoid 
                                  certain types of meat, implying that other types 
              were quite 
                                  acceptable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">However, 
                                  Buddhists gradually came to feel uncomfortable about
               meat 
                                  eating. In 257 BC King Asoka said that in contrast 
              to before, 
                                  only two peacocks and a deer were killed to provide 
              food in 
                                  the royal kitchens and that in time even this would 
              be stopped. 
                                  By the beginning of the Christian era meat eating 
              had become 
                                  unacceptable, particularly amongst the followers of 
              the Mahayana 
                                  although the polemics against it in works like the 
              Lankavatara 
                                  Sutra indicates that it was still widespread or a 
              least a 
                                  point of controversy <em>(see footnote in the 
              previous section)</em>. 
                                  Tantric text dating from the 7th and 8th centuries 
              onward, 
                                  frequently recommend both drinking alcohol and 
              eating meat 
                                  and both are considered fit to offer to gods. This 
              was probably 
                                  as much an expression of the freedom from convention
               which 
                                  Tantra taught as it was a protest against 
              Mahayanists to whom 
                                  practices like abstaining from drink and meat had 
              become a

                                  it is often said that Mahayanists are vegetarian and
               Theravadins 
                                  are not. However the situation is a little more 
              complex than 
                                  that. Generally Theravadins have no dietary 
              restrictions although 
                                  it is not uncommon to find monks and lay people in 
              Sri Lanka 
                                  who are strict vegetarians. Others abstain from meat
               while 
                                  eating fish. Chinese and Vietnamese monks and nuns 
              are strictly 
                                  vegetarian and the lay community try to follow their
               example 
                                  although many do not. Amongst Tibetans and Japanese 
              Buddhists, 
                                  vegetarianism is rare. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Buddhists 
                                  who insist on vegetarianism have a simple and 
              compelling argument 
                                  to support their case. Eating meat encourages an 
              industry 
                                  that causes cruelty and death to millions of animals
               and a 
                                  truly compassionate person would wish to mitigate 
              all this 
                                  suffering. By refusing to eat meat one can do just 
              that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Those 
                                  who believe that vegetarianism is not necessary for 
              Buddhists 
                                  have equally compelling although more complex 
              arguments to 
                                  support their view: (1) If the Buddha had felt that a
               meatless 
                                  diet was in accordance with the Precepts he would 
              have said 
                                  so and in the Pali Tipitaka at least, he did not. 
              (2) Unless 
                                  one actually kills an animal oneself (which seldom 
              happens 
                                  today) by eating meat one is not directly 
              responsible for 
                                  the animal's death and in this sense the non- 
              vegetarian is 
                                  no different from the vegetarian. The latter can 
              only eat 
                                  his vegetables because the farmer has ploughed his 
              fields 
                                  (thus killing many creatures) and sprayed the crop 
              (again 
                                  killing many creatures). (3) While the vegetarian 
              will not 
                                  eat meat he does use numerous other products that 
              lead to 
                                  animals being killed (soap, leather, serum, silk 
              etc.) Why 
                                  abstain from one while using the others? (4) Good 
              qualities 
                                  like understanding, patience, generosity and honesty
               and bad 
                                  qualities like ignorance, pride, hypocrisy, jealousy
               and indifference 
                                  do not depend on what one eats and therefore diet is
               not a 
                                  significant factor in spiritual development. </span></p>

                                From John Kahila </strong>(talk.religion.buddhism 
              newsgroup): </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">No. 
                                  The First Precept admonishes us to refrain from 
              killing, but 
                                  meat eating is not regarded as an instance of 
              killing, and 
                                  it is not forbidden in the scriptures. (We are 
              speaking here 
                                  mainly of the Pali scriptures. Some of the Mahayana 
              scriptures, 
                                  notably the Lankavatara Sutra, take a strong 
              position in favor 
                                  of vegetarianism. <em>Also see Note below</em>) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">As 
                                  recorded in the Pali scriptures, the Buddha did not 
              prohibit 
                                  consumption of meat, even by monks. In fact, he 
              explicitly 
                                  rejected a suggestion from Devadatta to do so. In 
              modern Theravada 
                                  societies, a bhikkhu who adheres to vegetarianism to
               impress 
                                  others with his superior spirituality may be 
              committing an 
                                  infringement of the monastic rules. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">On 
                                  the other hand, the Buddha categorically prohibited 
              consumption 
                                  of the flesh of any animal that was "seen, heard or 
              suspected" 
                                  to have been killed specifically for the benefit of 
              monks 
                                  (Jivaka Sutta, Majjhima Nikaya 55). This rule 
              technically 
                                  applies only to monastics, but it can be used as a 
              reasonable 
                                  guide by devout lay people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">To 
                                  understand this "middle path" approach to 
              meat-eating, 
                                  we have to remember that there were no "Buddhists" 
                                  in Shakyamuni's time. There were only mendicants of 
              various 
                                  kinds (including the Buddha's disciples), plus lay 
              people 
                                  who gave them alms out of respect without 
              necessarily worrying 
                                  about the brand name of the teachings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">If 
                                  meat was what a householder chose to offer, it was 
              to be accepted 
                                  without discrimination or aversion. To reject such 
              an offering 
                                  would be an offense against hospitality and would 
              deprive 
                                  the householder of an opportunity to gain merit -- 
              and it 
                                  could not benefit the animal, because it was already
               dead. 
                                  Even the Jains may have had a similar outlook during
               the same 
                                  period of history, despite the strict doctrine of 
              ahimsa. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Vegetarianism 
                                  could not become a source of serious controversy in 
              the bhikkhu 
                                  sangha until the rise of fixed-abode monastic 
              communities 
                                  in which the monks did not practice daily 
              alms-round. Any 
                                  meat provided to such a community by lay people 
              would almost 
                                  certainly have been killed specifically for the 
              monks. That 
                                  may be one reason for the difference in Mahayana and
               Theravada 
                                  views on meat eating -- the development of monastic 
              communities 
                                  of this type occurred principally within Mahayana. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The 
                                  issue of meat eating raises difficult ethical 
              questions. Isn't 
                                  the meat in a supermarket or restaurant killed "for"
               
                                  us? Doesn't meat eating entail killing by proxy? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Few 
                                  of us are in a position to judge meat eaters or 
              anyone else 
                                  for "killing by proxy." Being part of the world 
                                  economy entails "killing by proxy" in every act 
                                  of consumption. The electricity that runs our 
              computers comes 
                                  from facilities that harm the environment. Books of 
              Buddhist 
                                  scriptures are printed on paper produced by an 
              industry that 
                                  destroys wildlife habitat. Worms, insects, rodents 
              and other 
                                  animals are routinely killed en masse in the course 
              of producing 
                                  the staples of a vegetarian diet. Welcome to 
              samsara. It is 
                                  impossible for most of us to free ourselves from 
              this web; 
                                  we can only strive to be mindful of entanglement in 
              it. One 
                                  way to do so is to reflect on how the suffering and 
              death 
                                  of sentient beings contributes to our comfort. This 
              may help 
                                  us to be less inclined to consume out of mere greed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">All 
                                  of that having been said, it cannot be denied that 
              the economic 
                                  machine which produces meat also creates fear and 
              suffering 
                                  for a large number of animals. It is useful to bear 
              this in 
                                  mind even if one consumes meat, to resist developing
               a habit 
                                  of callousness. Many Buddhists (especially 
              Mahayanists) practice 
                                  vegetarianism as a means of cultivating compassion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The 
                                  Jivaka Sutta hints that one could also make a good 
              case for 
                                  vegetarianism starting from any of the other 
              brahmaviharas 
                                  (loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, equanimity). 
              Interestingly, 
                                  it is loving-kindness rather than compassion that is
               mentioned 
                                  first in the Jivaka Sutta. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">If 
                                  you are considering trying out vegetarianism for the
               first 
                                  time, we suggest discussing it with someone who has 
              experience. 
                                  There are a few issues that ought to be considered 
              regarding

                                  (by Binh Anson):</em></strong><em> The Lankavatara Sutra,
               although 
                                  recorded the Buddha's teaching in Lanka (Sri Lanka),
               is essentially 
                                  a product of later Mahayana development. According 
              to H. Nakamura 
                                  (Indian Buddhism, 1987), there are several versions 
              of this 
                                  sutra, one fairly different in content from the 
              other. Most 
                                  scholars concluded that this sutra was likely 
              compiled in 
                                  350-400 CE. In addition, according the the popular 
              Zen master 
                                  D.T. Suzuki (The Lankavatara Sutra - A Mahayana 
              Text, 1931), 
                                  the chapter dealing with meat eating was indeed 
              added much 
                                  later in subsequent versions. He also agreed that 
              this sutra 
                                  was not the authentic words by the Buddha, but was 
              compiled 
                                  much later by unknown authors following Mahayana's 
              philosophy.</em></span></p>

              <p>Since monk also do not eat egg, why ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>it's written in their "rules".</p>
              <p>as an experience vegetarian, i think egg can be a 50-50 éš�ç¼˜thingy, like eating some cakes during some ocassions or meat side vege is fine. think no need so strict as AEN's dharma master showed. so strict can also lead people to shy away from Buddhism. moreover egg is one way, a vegetarian can supplement vitamin B12, unless they take supplement pills. hand and legs can feel numbness sometimes. precept can be open if it involve medical reason.</p>
              <p>thus i heard of this bodisattva monk who cure many people, told those who encounter some serious illness meat-eating people to take up vegetarian plus other stuff like practice the precepts and reciting sutra/Buddha/bodhisattva's name sincerely, etc to cure their illness. but He's also not so strict with eggs. He said, one will not eat egg when it's time. this to me is the idea of a real bodhisattva. the rest is history.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi riccia 1,  my suggestion is slowly change the diet, prepare the vege meals in a  manner attractive to them.Assuming your kids are young ones,  use slighlty stronger seasonings and fry them for aroma for vegetarian meals,  Kids needs lots of protein, substitute with fried bean curds, tempehs and  legumes  Season the food with crispy seedweed, vegetarian bacon salt or something similar. Create your own Mc Riccia set meals for them. And develop their compassion for animals, and when they are ready tell them how their fried chicken and beef burgers come about, and that Nemo is a fish!  </p></div>

              <p>Answer to ur question :<br>1) Egg can/cannot be consider base on the person. But a vegetarian should not eat eggs as it come from the Baby Chicks and no Hen would give birth to a egg that has no chick inside.</p>
              <p>2) Try to add some tasty stuffs like Soya Sauce etc. </p>

              <p><br>i believe for Mahayana, He did eventually. i can see why Buddha is displaying it as a gradual process rather than a "with immediate effect you must do so" thing. it'll take time, due to past habits.</p>

              <p>Many Buddhists are vegetarians, though the majority are not. It also depend on the tradition you are in. Virtually all Chinese Mahayana monks are vegetarians, though the lay practitioners are divided. Theravadins and Tibetans have less emphasis on vegetarianism.</p>
              <p>If you are going to be a vegetarian, my advice is definitely go for it and be better than the average Buddhists.</p>
