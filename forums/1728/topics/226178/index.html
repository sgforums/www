If done regularly can gradually lead to insight and awakening. Another good article on aimwell.org, I'll copy a particular part: <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Ledi/Anapanasati/anapanasati.html#Nibbana" rel="nofollow">Anapanasati</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>VI<br>MINDFULNESS OF RESPIRATION LEADS TO NIBBANA</strong><br><br>...<br>Â“Monks. If mindfulness of respiration is cultivated and made much of, the four foundations of mindfulness are fulfilled and perfected. If the four foundations of mindfulness are cultivated and made much of, the seven factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga) are fulfilled and perfected.  If the seven factors of enlightenment are cultivated and made much of, knowledge (vijja) and liberation (vimutti) are fulfilled and perfected.Â”<br><br>Here, knowledge means the four path knowledges, and liberation means the four fruition knowledges. The essential meaning is that if mindfulness of respiration is practiced diligently for days and months, the work of the four foundations of mindfulness, the seven factors of enlightenment, and of knowledge and liberation are automatically accomplished. The foundations of mindfulness, the factors of enlightenment, and knowledge and liberation comprise the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma) so the development<br>of the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment are automatically fulfilled.<br><br>This ends the exposition of the introduction to the Anapanasati Sutta.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Then as to respiration meditation (anapanasati), in the Visuddhimagga it is mentioned as samatha meditation, concentration meditation. In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta it is mentioned as vipassana meditation. Then how can we distinguish it between the vipassana aspect of respiration and the samatha aspect of respiration? <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we are mindful of the absolute reality of respiration, that will be vipassana meditation. If we are mindful of the concept regarding respiration, then it will be samatha meditation.</span></strong><br><br>So the Visuddhimagga mentions the method of concentrating on the touching sensation whenever you breathe in and breathe out. When you concentrate your mind on the coming in and going out of the breath, then it is samatha meditation because you have to concentrate on the coming in and going out, not on the wind or air. When it is coming in you note Â‘inÂ’; when it is going out you note, Â‘outÂ’. Â‘In, out, in, outÂ’. Your mind is not on the breathing air but on the Â‘coming-inÂ’ and the Â‘going-outÂ’. Â‘Coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-outÂ’ are not ultimate realities.<br><br>Say you come into the room through the door and go out of the room through the door. We may ask, Â“What is this coming in and going out?Â” it is neither you, nor a person. It is just Â‘coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-out.Â’ It is just concept. In the same way, when you concentrate on the coming in and going out of the breath, it is just a concept. Since concept is the object of meditation, it is samatha meditation. <strong>You cannot realise any specific characteristics or general characteristics of Â‘coming-inÂ’ and Â‘going-outÂ’ because they are not realities, just concepts, so thatÂ’s samatha meditation.</strong><br><br>However, if you focus your mind on the point where the breath touches whenever it comes in or goes out, it touches the nostrils. <strong>When you observe this touching sensation and are mindful of it, then it is (ultimate) reality.</strong> That touching point is composed of the four primary material elements: pathavī dhatu, hard or soft; apo dhatu, liquidity or cohesion; tejo dhatu, hot or cold; vayo dhatu, movement or vibration. These four elements are there whenever you focus your mind on the touching sensation. So the object is absolute reality. What can we call it Â— samatha or vipassana meditation? It is vipassana.<br><br>That is what the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw wrote about the distinction between the samatha and vipassana aspects of respiration meditation. I appreciate it very much. So then we can say respiration meditation is vipassana meditation in accordance with the Mahasatipatthana Sutta. We can also say that respiration meditation is samatha in accordance with the Visuddhimagga. It is very subtle and profound to differentiate between these two aspects of respiration meditation, but I think those who have practised meditation very well can differentiate between these two aspects.</blockquote>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> More can be found on the URL.</div>
