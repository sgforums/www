              thousands of years preached respect and compassion for all living things,
              writes Stephen Prins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>CRUELTY to animals – on the Subcontinent, of all places – was
              highlighted recently in this newspaper. Two stories with photographs
              demonstrated that Ahimsa, which calls for compassion and respect for all living
              things, is dead in the land of its origin. Dead, at least, with respect to the
              communities referred to in the two news accounts.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The reports made hard reading.<br> One was about the deliberate and calculated suffering inflicted on a goat by a
              crowd of religious zealots, who took turns savaging the animal until they had
              drowned it. A couple of hundred men inflamed with wild mob impulses pitting
              themselves against one animal – an animal that gives life-supporting milk and
              finally its flesh for consumption to the very men who made it suffer and who
              then killed it.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The other was about the mass ritual slaughter of thousands of
              buffalo.<br> Both atrocities conducted in the name of religion, in Nepal, birthplace of
              Gautama Buddha.<br> Cruelty of this kind boggles the imagination.<br> Animal blood spilled by the gallon and left to soak into the earth.<br> What makes the appalling cruelties still more unbelievable, unacceptable and
              barbarous is that they take place on the very ground that gave rise to great
              religions that condemn and abhor cruelty to living things.<br> Ahimsa the concept took root in India a couple of thousand years ago; it
              appears to have been uprooted and left by the wayside to wither and crumble to
              dust.<br> What is Ahimsa?<br> It is an ancient religious-ethical concept that advocates “non-violence.” The
              word is a Sanskrit-Pali term that means “non-injury” or “compassion”: Sanskrit
              “hims” means “to strike,” and “hims-a” means to cause injury. “A-himsa” is the
              opposite of “hims-a” – non-violence.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is compassion in deed, word and thought.<br> Barbarous thought, word and deed produced the appalling cruelties perpetrated
              in Nepal.<br> Ahimsa is about causing no harm or injury to living beings, animals included.
              It began with Jainism and was continued in Hinduism and Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>There is a fine and comprehensive online essay on AHIMSA, in
              Wikipedia, that covers the history and evolution of Ahimsa and its multiple
              implications and applications. “All living beings have the spark of divine
              spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself,” the
              writer says.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>In modern times, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the great advocates
              of Ahimsa. The concept was at the heart of his “satyagraha” philosophy of
              non-violence as a way to bring about change – change for the good.<br> Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician and medical missionary, received
              the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 for his philosophy of “reverence for life”, based
              on the Jain principle of Ahimsa. “The laying down of the commandment to not
              kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history
              of mankind,” Schweitzer wrote.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>The writer of this article grew up Christian but learnt his
              Ahimsa from the Buddhist and Hindu people he mixed with. The domestic helpers
              (“servants”, we used to call them) taught him to respect life in its minutest
              forms.<br> Don’t tread on ants. Don’t squish caterpillars and millipedes. Never strike a
              butterfly. You don’t have to kill centipedes, let them go. Likewise with
              spiders. Look at the amazing webs they weave. Avoid swatting flies. They have a
              purpose in life. Cockroaches? They too have their purpose. And so it went, and
              so we learnt to let living things live. We learnt to not inflict ourselves on
              the natural living world.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa practice, and a failure to observe Ahimsa, is
              demonstrated in the daily life of this country. Step into the street and look
              around you. You will see many acts of kindness, such as the feeding of street
              dogs, but you will also see lapses, which may be due to a lack of awareness, of
              education, of sensitivity to our surroundings.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is leaving a bowl of water out for street dogs that
              cannot say, “We are thirsty.”<br> Ahimsa is attending to a dog or a cat that cannot attend to itself. Street
              dogs, like any pampered indoors pooch, also need medical attention. They need
              anti-rabies shots and anti-mange treatment. Their body sores need to be healed.<br> Ahimsa is not tying a dog on a leash so short the animal has hardly room to
              turn to scratch its sides.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is ensuring that cattle marked for slaughter suffer
              minimum trauma and pain when being led to execution. Go look into the face of a
              cow or bull and gaze into the liquid depths of its beautiful big, soulful eyes.
              Then carry out the execution – if you really must. Ahimsa is allowing birds the
              freedom of the air to which they were born; ahimsa is opening the door of the
              birdcage and letting the bird or birds out.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is not confining our biggest and most majestic animal,
              the elephant. Ahimsa is allowing elephants the freedom to roam jungles among
              other elephants and wildlife and live and enjoy a natural life. Ahimsa is
              not taking a baby elephant from its mother and imprisoning it. Ahimsa is
              allowing the animal to remain with its mother until it is old enough to move
              on. Ahimsa is allowing young elephants the freedom to play with other baby
              jumbos its age, letting them have fun, just as our 10-year-old sons and daughters
              delight in cavorting together on the playing field.</span></p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is not chaining an elephant by one front leg and one back
              leg so as to completely immobilize it, cramping its ability to move six inches
              left or right, or one step forward, one step backward, to lean against a tree
              to scratch its back when a skin itch is driving the animal to madness.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>Ahimsa is also respect and love for the environment.<br> Ahimsa is not about polluting rivers and streams and cutting down trees that
              sustain the ecology.<br> Ahimsa is about saving this island from those who destroy its forests, its
              shoreline, its natural greenery, its beauty.<br> Ahimsa can be as abundant as we wish to make it.</span></p>
