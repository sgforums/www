              <p>if science can explained everything, then who would believed in the creator? looks like science is beginning to explain a lot of things...example; clonings, artificial insemination, genetic modified foods and plants etc...so scary sometimes...</p>

              <p>Why scary? Shld be good what..</p>
              <p>Anyway, Buddhism does *Not* believe in Creatorism. There is no creator. If you are interested, I can refer you to the story of Buddha and the Maha Brahma, who claimed to be God.</p>
              <p>Cloning is perfectly fine too, as long as there is a high level of morality involved. Of course there are other issues such as, who is going to take care of the cloned child -- does he have parents? But cloning by itself is fine.</p>
              <p>When you clone a person, it's just the same bodies that are cloned, the mindstream is different. I am not the same person as my clone if I ever get a clone. Just like twins may have same appearances but are each different mindstream and can have different personalities.</p>
              <p>Genetically modified foods and plants are also fine, though what side effects we do not know. But so far there has not been any cases as far as I know of negative effects from GM food.</p>
              <p>It seems only the Theistic, Judeo-Christian religions that believe in a personal Creator have problems with that. Buddhism as a non-theistic teaching has no problems, and would welcome such developments as long as they bring more benefits than harm.</p>

              <p>I posted this before regarding the notion of a Creator:</p>
              <p>First of all Buddhism does not accept the Judeo-Christian or other theistic religions' idea that there is a personal Creator, means the Old Testament kind of God that has a personality of its own.. and you can actually meet him up for coffee <img title="Mr. Green" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green">. If there is a personal Creator it brings a lot of questions into mind.

              <blockquote>
              <p>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><br>Slightly edited from the first topic in our forum regarding Creationism: <a rel="nofollow" href="/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185">How the Brahma believed He was God?</a><br><br>In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of All".<br><br>In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: " I am Brahmà, the Great Brahmà, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br>The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br><br>from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.</span></p>

              <p>Therefore in Buddhism, the question of God is irrelevant and not given importance. Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the Buddhist practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the Buddha said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get enlightened.

              <p>Hi to all,</p>
              <p>First of all, I'm a catholic..</p>
              <p>I can understand some of you going thru with all the awkardness discussing christianity or being"preached" by yr relatives or friends who in their newly found religion.or being christians for a very long time. . This is so when are very enthusiatic or zealously want to share with you. While it is ok to share with.anyone as we are called to "witness" our faith to others, we have to be sensitive to others..</p>
              <p>By being sensitive.. means witnessing at the right time and the right place.. It also means do it with gentleness, love and care.. in short a "holistic approach"</p>
              <p>Thru our actions i.e being caring, and displaying a "christian" attitude towards our neighbours, i.e our friends, relative, colleagues, etc.. they may come to know that our religion is a religion of love and compassion for the others.. No forcing.. or whatever, just some enouragement, or an "occasional" push. If one is not receptive to it.. we have to leave it there.. cause we know that time to convert him or her is not there as yet.. We will pray till he is ready.. to be converted. No point pushing or rushing as it may hurt the other person feelings..</p>
              <p>For eg.. a non catholic study in a catholic school.. may not convert till he starts working or later stage in life.. He may remember all the prayers taught in school and who knows start praying  to know Christ..</p>
              <p>There are some who convert to catholicism cause their prayers has been answered.. eg non christians who go to novena church to ask Mother Mary to pray for thier petitions and got answered and became curious abt the faith and got converted subsequently..</p>
              <p>As for me,, i would rather show by my examples to others and an "occasional" talk on christ.. if they are interested we will proceed form there..</p>
              <p>Catholics are known for its tolerance towards other people's faith. and many people r aware of it.. as a result many people have respect for us .. a true fact..</p>
              <p>Thanks for bring out all your grievances and we are better aware of it..</p>

              <p>Not really true since there are quite a number of catholics converting outside to other religions (Buddhism included) as well.</p>
              <p>By the way, all christians are also catholics, since in the Apostle creed (which is also used in most of the other traditional groups like the anglicans, lutherans, methodists etc) it states "I believe in the Holy Catholic church, the communion of saints etc", BUT it's whether they are ROMAN catholics or not.</p>

              <p>However, even up to now, non-catholic christians cannot take holy communion with roman catholics, and the roman catholic still has some issues in history it needs to address, such as forced conversions of native americans, persection of jews, the inquisitions and the crusades.</p>

              <p>I think at the end of the day, no monotheistic religions can ever claim that they are tolerant of other faiths. All such religions have their share of participation in religious wars, persecution and forced conversion.</p>
              <p>Having said that, and on a matter of degree, monotheistic religions are much more tolerant than they were in the past. However, that is only because of the secularisation of governments in countries in which these religions are practised widely. The ironic part is that we (the nonbelievers) are spared the intolerance of the prevailing religions (preaching love and peace) by secular intervention.</p>
