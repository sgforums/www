              <p>All the great religious masters always promote religious harmony. See speech of Dalai Lama at http://www.dalailama.com/page.122.htm</p>
              <p>I read from Tzu Chi's magazine that there are many cases where Christians and Muslims participate in Tzu Chi relief activities (e.g. in Jordan, Indonesia, South Africa) but remain faithful to their own religions. Recently, Master Chin Kung also led the effort to visit Muslims and Christians to promote religious harmony in Singapore. Therefore, shouldn't we, as buddhists, do our part too?</p>
              <p>When talking to Christians, I always  try to avoid conflict by highlighting the common things rather than focusing on the differences. When I speak to my Christian colleagues, I would praise what Mother Theresa has done (to me, she is a bodhisattva). I would also highlight that five precepts in Buddhism is similar to the ten commandments and if everybody can truly follow these, it would be a different world.</p>
              <p>Part of ten commandments in Christians:</p>
              <p>12 Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the 
              land that the Lord your God is giving you</p>
              <p>13 You shall not kill.</p>
              <p>14 You shall not commit adultery.</p>
              <p>15 You shall not steal.</p>
              <p>16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.</p>
              <p>17 You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your 
              neighbour’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that 
              belongs to your neighbour.</p>
              <p>And it is obvious that it matches the 1st å‡€ä¸šä¸‰ç¦� in è§‚æ— é‡�å¯¿ä½›ç»�:</p>
              <p>å‡€ä¸šä¸‰ç¦�æ˜¯ä¿®æŒ�å‡€ä¸šçš„åŸºç¡€ï¼Œæ˜¯è¿‡åŽ»ã€�çŽ°åœ¨ã€�æœªæ�¥ä¸‰ä¸–ä¸€åˆ‡è¯¸ä½›ä¿®æŒ�å‡€ä¸šçš„æ­£å› ã€‚ä¸‰ç¦�çš„å†…å®¹æ˜¯ï¼š1.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">å­�å…»çˆ¶æ¯�ï¼Œå¥‰äº‹å¸ˆé•¿ï¼Œæ…ˆå¿ƒä¸�æ�€ï¼Œä¿®å��å–„ä¸š</span>ã€‚<span style="text-decoration: underline;">æ­¤å±žäººå¤©ç¦�</span>ï¼Œäº¦ç§°ä¸–å–„ï¼›</p>
              <p>And I was joking with my Christian friends that actually God never said you can kill/eat animals so all Christians should be vegetarians ...</p>

Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill new-born girls.</span></span></h2>

              <p>Extract from an article in Internet <a href="http://onthemargins.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/lenten-season-ethical-implications/">http://onthemargins.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/lenten-season-ethical-implications/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We read in Genesis 1:29-30:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move on the ground–everything that has the breath of life in it–I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As it would seem, God’s intention for all of us, including the animal world, at the dawn of creation, was that we would be herbivores. There would be no cannibalization of flesh–neither human or animal–by the other. We would all share in the abundance God had provided through the plants in the garden. Yet, we must note this is not what eventually happens. In fact, after the flood where God destroyed all who were wicked, it seems that an exception has been made, as God states to Noah and his family:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I know give you everything.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Why the change of heart? Why the exception to what was previously established? Is this God giving agreement to something which had already been occurring, or is this the first instance of humanity eating the flesh of the animal world? I am not sure we will ever know. What I do know is that this is still an ethical issue, even to this day. For me, if God’s original intent was that the plants God had provided would be food enough for all of us, then should we continue, even with the “God-given” permission, to eat of the flesh of other living creatures?</p>

                                          They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and
                                          all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move on the
                                          ground–everything that has the breath of life in it–I give every
                                          green plant for food.” And it was so.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As it would seem, God’s intention for all of us, including the
                                          animal world, at the dawn of creation, was that we would be
                                          herbivores. There would be no cannibalization of flesh–neither
                                          human or animal–by the other. We would all share in the abundance
                                          God had provided through the plants in the garden. Yet, we must
                                          note this is not what eventually happens. In fact, after the flood
                                          where God destroyed all who were wicked, it seems that an exception
                                          has been made, as God states to Noah and his family:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. The fear
                                          and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth and all
                                          the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the
                                          ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your
                                          hands. Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just
                                          as I gave you the green plants, I know give you everything.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Why the change of heart? Why the exception to what was
                                          previously established? Is this God giving agreement to something
                                          which had already been occurring, or is this the first instance of
                                          humanity eating the flesh of the animal world? I am not sure we
                                          will ever know. What I do know is that this is still an ethical
                                          issue, even to this day. For me, if God’s original intent was that
                                          the plants God had provided would be food enough for all of us,
                                          then should we continue, even with the “God-given” permission, to
                                          eat of the flesh of other living creatures?</p>

              <p>I have same doubt as you, Jitkiat. Did the Biblical God allow its people to eat meat? And why the difference prior and after the Noah's Ark incident?Why the change in God's original intent?</p>
              <p>Thanks for pointing out to me. Will go and ask my Christian friends if I meet them.</p>
              <p>I have always wanted to ask Christians on the subject of meat-eating but didn't know which bible verses to quote and compare.</p>

              <p>Wah, u so good fu qi, beyond religion. Your Christian relatives don't preach to you. My Christian relatives start to ask me to go to church with them liao. I think eventually I will also attend less and less of these family gatherings. And one of my reason is similar to yours: nothing to "click". There are only two or three real Buddhists (not those who practise folk customs but call themselves Buddhists) on my mother's side. My father's side, I do not know any who are real Buddhists yet.</p>
              <p>Yup, thanks for the caution. I usually avoid discussing religion with Christians in a church or christian talk setting, as I would usually be the only Buddhist around.</p>

              <p>Since the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-7">[13]</a></sup> Adventists are known for presenting a "health message" that recommends <a title="Christian vegetarianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a> and expects abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other foods proscribed as "<a title="Unclean animals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclean_animals">unclean</a>" in <a class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Leviticus&amp;verse=11&amp;src=NIV" rel="nofollow" href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/%7Ejnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Leviticus&amp;verse=11&amp;src=NIV">Leviticus 11</a>. However according to some studies, the majority of Adventists do eat meat.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-8">[14]</a></sup> The church discourages its members from the use of <a title="Alcoholic beverage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage">alcohol</a>, <a title="Tobacco" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco">tobacco</a> or illegal drugs (compare <a title="Christianity and alcohol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_alcohol">Christianity and alcohol</a>).

              <p>The pioneers of the Adventist church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet. <a title="John Harvey Kellogg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a> was one of the early founders of the Adventist health work. His
              development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding
              of <a title="Kellogg Company" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg_Company">Kellogg's</a> by his brother <a class="mw-redirect" title="William K.

              drinking, and their healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet rich in nuts and
              beans.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-9">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-10">[16]</a></sup> The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation of their extended lifespan.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-11">[17]</a></sup></p>

              <p>The official Adventist position on <a title="Abortion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion">abortion</a> is that "abortions for reasons of <a title="Birth control" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control">birth control</a>, <a title="Sex-selective abortion and infanticide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion_and_infanticide">gender selection</a>,
              or convenience are not condoned by the Church." At times, however,
              women may face exceptional circumstances that present serious moral or
              medical dilemmas, such as significant threats to the pregnant woman's
              life or health, severe congenital defects in the fetus, and pregnancy

              <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span class="mw-headline">Dress and entertainment</span></h3>
              <p>In Western countries, Adventists have traditionally held socially
              conservative attitudes regarding dress and entertainment. These
              attitudes are reflected in one of the church's <a class="mw-redirect" title="28 fundamentals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_fundamentals">fundamental beliefs</a>:</p>
              <dl><dd>"For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we
              involve ourselves only in those things which will produce Christlike
              purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and
              entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and
              beauty. While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be
              simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not
              consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a
              gentle and quiet spirit."<sup id="_ref-webfundamentals_1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-webfundamentals">[8]</a></sup></dd></dl>
              <p>Accordingly, many Western Adventists are opposed to practices such as <a title="Body piercing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing">body piercing</a> and <a title="Tattoo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo">tattoos</a>.
              More conservative Adventists refrain from the wearing of jewelry
              altogether, including such items as earrings and wedding bands.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-18">[24]</a></sup> Traditionally Adventists dress formally when attending church.</p>
              <p>Conservative Adventists also avoid certain recreational activities
              which are considered to be a negative spiritual influence, including
              dancing, rock music and secular theatre.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-19">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SteveCase_0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-SteveCase">[26]</a></sup> However, these sentiments are far less common among the more recent generations of Adventists.<sup id="_ref-SteveCase_1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-SteveCase">[26]</a></sup> The Adventist church officially opposes the practice of gambling.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church#_note-20">[27]</a></sup></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>We read in Genesis 1:29-30:</p>
              <p>As it would seem, God’s intention for all of us, including the
              animal world, at the dawn of creation, was that we would be
              herbivores. There would be no cannibalization of flesh–neither
              human or animal–by the other. We would all share in the abundance
              God had provided through the plants in the garden. Yet, we must
              note this is not what eventually happens. In fact, after the flood
              where God destroyed all who were wicked, it seems that an exception
              has been made, as God states to Noah and his family:</p>
              <p>Why the change of heart? Why the exception to what was
              previously established? Is this God giving agreement to something
              which had already been occurring, or is this the first instance of
              humanity eating the flesh of the animal world? I am not sure we
              will ever know. What I do know is that this is still an ethical
              issue, even to this day. For me, if God’s original intent was that
              the plants God had provided would be food enough for all of us,
              then should we continue, even with the “God-given” permission, to
              eat of the flesh of other living creatures?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God's original intent was for people to go around naked. Will you now take off your clothes and wander around in public bare assed?</p>
              <p>We have a choice between eating meat of vegetables because we are omnivores. What about carnivores? Do you mean after the flood, God created carnivores? Or did he convert some of the herbivores into carnivores?</p>

              <p>Hi,<br>well some of you probably have it easier than me. I'm the only Buddhist in my whole clan, both father's and mother's, of which my dad's side has been christian for more than 4-5 generations, since my great-grandfather was a missionary.</p>
              <p>The gist is, to avoid conflict, don't talk about religion at all. I just smiled and declined when my relatives or mum's friends tried to convert me back. After a while, they give up.

              <p>That's right..</p>
              <p>http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no3c.htm</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><em><strong><em><strong>Mutual 
                    respect begets harmony</strong><br> <br> </em></strong></em><strong>How 
                    may a family whose members have different religions live together harmoniously?<br> <br> </strong>One common principle that mankind all over the world abides 
                    by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A country may have different 
                    religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity 
                    or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from 
                    love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a 
                    good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family members 
                    bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, 
                    refrain from slandering or debating over each other’s faith, but mutually 
                    respecting each other’s faith and character, then the family will naturally 
                    be harmonious.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Further, the younger 
                    generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is 
                    their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing 
                    with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them 
                    proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, 
                    and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, 
                    it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise 
                    Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions 
                    and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family 
                    will be harmonious.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br></p>

                    in choice of religion<br> <br> </em><strong>If 
                    the children of a Buddhist family choose to marry a person of a different 
                    faith, will the marriage work out well?</strong><br> <br> </strong>Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary that 
                    his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote and encourage 
                    our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot force it upon them. 
                    Moreover, we should not object to their marriage just because their partners 
                    are from a different faith.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">In this present 
                    age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his or her own lifetime 
                    partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of choice of religion and faith. 
                    No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to only believe 
                    in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that particular 
                    faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their children’s marriages, 
                    the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how 
                    to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion and 
                    faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the marriage that 
                    matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel their children 
                    about the code of family ethics, such as the role and responsibilities of 
                    a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they do not 
                    know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband 
                    and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism, 
                    the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the choice partner 
                    believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the teachings 
                    of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of course, be 
                    good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile 
                    that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of loving-kindness, 
                    compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the son-in-law 
                    or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the same faith 
                    and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating together 
                    and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they 
                    were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>Hi,<br>well some of you probably have it easier than me. I'm the only Buddhist in my whole clan, both father's and mother's, of which my dad's side has been christian for more than 4-5 generations, since my great-grandfather was a missionary.</p>
              <p>The gist is, to avoid conflict, don't talk about religion at all. I just smiled and declined when my relatives or mum's friends tried to convert me back. After a while, they give up. It will take a while, but once they know you're not going to convert, they'll stop pestering you.</p>

              <p>Hi, just want to say your story is quite encouraging. You have been handling religious matters within the family in a consistently respectful manner and I hope to be able to follow your example.</p>
              <p>All the best for your cultivation, sanath. Amituofo! ^_^</p>
