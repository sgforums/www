              <p>yes, i figure that if the GM experiments goes on, then they will experiment on humans...change/modify the male's genes to female and vice versa, then human becomes bisexual and no need partners to have children...then our normal human procreation is no longer to the natural existence.

              <p><br>In vitro fertilisation is also going against nature, but it has brought hope and joy for many couples.</p>
              <p>You have to know that going against nature <em>per se</em> is not something that is bad. If going against nature can result in benefits to the human kind, then it is good. The immediate benefits of GM experiments will be elimination of diseases. You cannot overlook that.</p>

              <p>Agree. But not GM food. There are cases where GM food meant for the cattle ending up consuming by humans (in the US)<br>Our AVA do not see the need to label GM food products with the normal products, the consumers do not have a choice to choose...</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><em><strong> <em><strong>Mutual respect begets harmony</strong><br> <br></em></strong></em> <strong>How may a family whose members
                                      have different religions live together harmoniously?<br> <br></strong> One common principle that mankind all over the
                                      world abides by is the freedom of choice of religion and faith. A
                                      country may have different religions co-existing at the same time,
                                      such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity or Islam. But, we have
                                      to understand that it is the condition arising from love that
                                      causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good
                                      thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family
                                      members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his
                                      faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each
                                      other’s faith, but mutually respecting each other’s faith and
                                      character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.<br> <br></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Further,
                                      the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their
                                      elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover,
                                      there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise
                                      filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will
                                      feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may
                                      willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal.
                                      Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we
                                      learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With
                                      regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we
                                      maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be
                                      harmonious.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong> <em>Freedom in choice of religion<br> <br></em></strong> If the children of a Buddhist family choose to
                                      marry a person of a different faith, will the marriage work out
                                      well?</span><br> <br> Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary
                                      that his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote
                                      and encourage our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot
                                      force it upon them. Moreover, we should not object to their
                                      marriage just because their partners are from a different
                                      faith.<br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">In
                                      this present age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his
                                      or her own lifetime partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of
                                      choice of religion and faith. No religion can compel its followers
                                      (and their dependants) to only believe in that particular faith,
                                      and object to marriages outside that particular faith. I believe,
                                      as parents, with regards to their children’s marriages, the primary
                                      concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how to
                                      guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion
                                      and faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the
                                      marriage that matters most of all. It would be useful for parents
                                      to counsel their children about the code of family ethics, such as
                                      the role and responsibilities of a husband and wife, and how to be
                                      good parents themselves. If they do not know how to live
                                      harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband and wife,
                                      or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism,
                                      the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the
                                      choice partner believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may
                                      promote the teachings of Buddhism so that he or she finds it
                                      acceptable. It will, of course, be good to establish a household
                                      based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile that cannot be
                                      achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of
                                      loving-kindness, compassion and equality towards all beings, in
                                      relation to the son-in-law or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing
                                      for a couple to bear the same faith and share the same principles
                                      and values, with both cultivating together and becoming partners on
                                      the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they were eventually
                                      reborn in the Buddha-land.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span></p>

But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each other’s faith, but mutually respecting each other’s faith and character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Further, the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be harmonious.</span> <span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em>Freedom in choice of religion<br><br></em></strong>If the children of a Buddhist family choose to marry a person of a different faith, will the marriage work out well?</span><br><br>Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary that his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote and encourage our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot force it upon them. Moreover, we should not object to their marriage just because their partners are from a different faith.<br><br><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In this present age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his or her own lifetime partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of choice of religion and faith. No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to only believe in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that particular faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their children’s marriages, the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion and faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the marriage that matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel their children about the code of family ethics, such as the role and responsibilities of a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they do not know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism, the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the choice partner believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the teachings of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of course, be good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of loving-kindness, compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the son-in-law or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the same faith and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating together and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land.</span> <span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"></span></p>
