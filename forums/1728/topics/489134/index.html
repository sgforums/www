              Asia in the early 1970s were Jack Engler, now a prominent psychotherapist and
              supervising psychologist at Harvard University, and Joseph Goldstein, cofounder
              of the Insight Meditation Society, in Barre, Massachusetts. Both men were
              deeply influenced by Indian meditation master Nani Barua (1911-1989),
              affectionately known as “Dipa Ma,” and her teacher, Anagarika Munindra
              (1914-2003). Perhaps what most characterized these young Americans and their
              approach to the dharma was their boundless enthusiasm—and the plucky belief
              that enlightenment could be attained in this lifetime. While many Asians had
              come to believe that such high aspirations were best deferred to a future life,
              Munindraji and Dipa Ma insisted that such goals were not only to be encouraged
              but that they were also entirely realizable.<br> <br> Returning from their travels, Engler and Goldstein were both instrumental in
              establishing the Vipassana tradition in North America. To this day, both remain
              deeply indebted to the teachings of Munindraji and Dipa Ma.<br> <br> In the following section, Jack Engler shares for the first time his
              conversations with Dipa Ma, which formed the foundation of his doctoral work,
              and in a candid interview, he speaks with Tricycle about his own journey.
              Joseph Goldstein, in the wake of Munindraji’s recent death, remembers a teacher
              for whom he was the first Western student, and ponders a world beyond the life
              of two of his most treasured mentors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Nani Barua was her given name, but in accordance with
              Indian custom, she was known and addressed as Dipa Ma—“Dipa’s Mother”—or even
              more simply as “Ma.” She was in her late fifties when I met her, in 1975. She
              was a venerated teacher by then in the small Buddhist community that had
              migrated from East Bengal, India, to Burma during the British Raj, and then
              resettled in Calcutta after Burmese independence. She taught out of the one
              room she shared with Dipa, her daughter and only surviving child.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Dipa Ma (1911–1989) was without any of the outward
              trappings or symbols of recognized Buddhist teachers—no ashram or center, no
              titles or ordinations, and no degrees, monastic vows, or attendants. Just a
              tiny woman in a tiny room in an impoverished neighborhood of old Calcutta,
              unknown outside her circle of friends and students, teaching in the traditional
              Indian way, at home all day, every day, for anyone who wanted to come by and
              talk about dharma. At the same time, she was a great yogi who not only had
              experienced the depths of liberating insight but had also mastered the deepest
              levels of samadhi, or singleness of mind, and most of the siddhis, or psychic
              powers [see final page]—a rare achievement in contemporary Buddhism, especially
              in Theravada. She was a gifted teacher who had helped many of her students to
              realize their essential Buddha-nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>I met Ma in India while doing doctoral research for
              the University of Chicago on the impact of enlightenment on the structure of
              consciousness and mental life. There are actually four enlightenment
              experiences, or “path moments,” in the way Theravada practice is said to
              unfold. According to the tradition, and the testimony of ancient and
              contemporary practitioners, it is in these moments that the specific mental
              factors that produce suffering are progressively eradicated. This is when
              fundamental and irreversible changes are said to take place in the mind. For
              purposes of the study, I needed individuals who had experienced this kind of
              change. With the intercession of her teacher, Anagarika Munindraji, Dipa Ma and
              some of her most experienced students agreed to be “subjects” in the study. All
              had experienced at least “First Path” in the Theravada system of practice, or
              what we call “enlightenment.” All happened to be women. The men who had
              experienced “path,” Dipa Ma said, were working during the day and not
              available. So began a series of meetings with remarkable women in that same
              little room throughout the spring and summer of 1977.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Dipa Ma herself was by far the most remarkable. She
              was a woman in a setting where teachers were traditionally men. She was a
              layperson teaching in a monastic tradition. She was a widow and single mother
              active in the world, without the protection of family, in an environment where
              women, especially widows, remained at home. Above all, in a Buddhist tradition
              that historically said the full dharma was only possible if you abandoned
              family life and “went forth” into homelessness and the monastic life, she had
              probably gone as far or farther in the practice than anyone I knew or had heard
              of. That is still true now, thirty years later. She was diminutive in stature,
              but no one I have ever met had a stronger mind, or a bigger heart.</span></p>

              a more detailed account of Dipa Ma’s life and teaching, especially the impact
              she had on others. In the following interview, Dipa Ma describes in her own
              words some of the journey she took to becoming the person we knew.</span></p>

              reflections on her life and the outcomes of her practice were translated by a
              trilingual Bengali woman translator, Srimati V. Her descriptions of her
              experiences in practice were translated by her meditation teacher, Anagarika
              Munindraji, at Dipa Ma’s request.<br> —Jack Engler</span></p>

              “When I try to imagine the enlightened state, it seems kind of gray and dull to
              me. Once you’ve extinguished all the desire, anger, and passion, where’s the
              juice? Where’s the pizzaz? Where’s the chutzpah?” As soon as Dipa translated my
              question, her mother broke out laughing. “Oh, you don’t understand! Life was
              dull and boring before. Always the same routine, nothing new. Once you get rid
              of all that stale stuff you’ve been carrying around, every moment is fresh and
              new, interesting and alive. Now everything has zest and taste. No two moments
              are ever the same.” The truth was not in her words; it was in her spontaneous
              laughter and delight.</span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '></span></p>

              of Dipa Ma’s older female students about rebirth. Ma had not been feeling well
              and seemed to be dozing against the wall in the heat. Munindraji happened to
              mention the tradition that one must take birth in a male body to become a
              Buddha. At that she suddenly bolted upright from the wall and exclaimed, “I can
              do anything a man can do!” We all laughed because we knew it was absolutely
              true. </span></em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '></span></p>

              childhood?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> I grew up in an extremely close family in Chittagong
              [in East Bengal]. We are all still close. Chittagong was a special place in those
              days. This was the main area where Buddhism survived in India into the
              twentieth century. It was a very open and tolerant place. Buddhist, Hindu, and
              Muslim communities lived together in the same village. I was very happy as a
              child, though I kept to myself growing up; I didn’t play much with other
              children. I was particularly close to my mother. I remember her as quiet and
              affectionate. She died unexpectedly when I was eighteen. I was married at
              twelve, and only saw her twice after I joined my husband in Rangoon two years
              later. Her death came as a great shock; I contracted typhoid immediately
              afterward. I didn’t get over her death until my first child was born. My
              father, on the other hand, was strict, though he was affectionate toward me. He
              was a man of strong principles. He never bowed his head to anything he didn’t
              think was right. I inherited that trait from him.</span></p>

              learning. Yet you didn’t go very far in school, did you?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '> I
              attended the local village school up to Sixth Standard [sixth grade] before I
              was married. That isn’t very far. But I enjoyed school a lot. Even if I was
              feeling ill and my parents gave me permission to stay home, I would slip off
              and turn up in school anyway. I loved to learn. My father was very supportive
              and used to go over my schoolwork with me at home. After marriage, there wasn’t
              any opportunity to continue formal schooling. Bengali wasn’t taught in Burma,
              and it was unthinkable anyway that a married lady of the house in the Bengali
              community would go to school and study. So I studied at home on my own, mostly
              books on Buddhism.</span></p>

              twelve. My husband was twenty-five. It was an arranged marriage. Because I was
              so young, I was allowed to stay with my parents until I was fourteen. When I
              stayed with my in-laws from time to time, I cried a lot. I couldn’t settle down
              with them. I can still feel the fear in my heart just thinking of my in-laws’
              house. When I finally joined my husband, it was a very difficult adjustment in
              the beginning, even more difficult because we were living in Burma. I was
              extremely lonely and homesick. I never feel alone now. Meditation is my
              constant companion. But I felt terribly alone those first years of marriage.</span></p>

              in my family instructed me about my duties toward my husband and about running
              a household, but my husband was the first one to tell me about sex. I was very
              shocked, very nervous, and terribly ashamed. I was afraid of him at first. It
              took me almost a year to get over the shock and the shame. But my husband was
              very gentle and kind, not the kind of man who insisted on asserting his rights.
              He was extremely patient, affectionate, and generous. He could get close to
              people in a very short time. He was a rare human being. I’ve never come across
              anyone like him. I’ve always considered him my first teacher.</span></p>

              conceive. Year after year went by, and still I hadn’t borne a child. But in all
              that time my husband remained unfailingly kind and sweet to me, unlike many
              husbands. He never criticized, never pushed, was never angry, was always loving
              and patient. He had a good position and a more than adequate income. We had

              meditation practice wasn’t that common. One or two of the older generation
              practiced meditation, but that was absolutely in private, not the way it is
              now. They didn’t talk about what they were doing. It was only after I was married
              that the idea of meditation became popular. I became very interested and wanted
              to learn, but my husband said, “We’re such a young couple. Why don’t we take it
              up later when we’re a little bit older?” At that time the feeling was that
              spiritual practice was not for the young but for the elders, after they had
              raised their family and finished working. So I took my husband’s suggestion.</span></p>

              never saw him. I mourned the deaths of my two children for several years. Just
              as I felt I was making some peace with the situation, I was diagnosed with high
              blood pressure, which was seriously affecting my heart. My condition worsened
              to the point that my life was in danger. It finally reached the stage where my
              doctors expected me to die at any time. At just that time, my husband, who had
              always been healthy, came home from work one afternoon feeling ill and
              feverish. Despite a doctor’s efforts, he died suddenly later that day. It was a
              terrible shock, completely unexpected. I’d been suffering so much, then this
              blow. Only Dipa was left. She was five, I was forty-one.</span></p>

              practice. I asked myself, “What can I take with me when I die?” I looked around
              at all the things I had and knew I couldn’t take them. I looked at my daughter
              and knew that as much as I loved her, I couldn’t take her, either. So I
              thought, “Let me go to the meditation center. Maybe I can find something there
              I can take with me when I die.” I decided to leave and live in the meditation
              center—I could die there as well as in the house. I told my friends of my
              decision, despite knowing almost nothing about practice. They were very
              supportive. I’ve always had one trait from an early age: When I make a promise,
              I keep it. Before going, I gave all my property and money to a neighbor and
              asked her to care for Dipa, expecting I would never return. “Please take
              whatever I have and care for Dipa,” I said. I was heartbroken and desperate.</span></p>

              went with me. We were taken in by the monks, given basic instruction in
              mindfulness, and told to report the next day at four in the afternoon. I was
              walking over from the guesthouse the next afternoon to report on my practice
              when I felt myself suddenly stop. I couldn’t move my feet. I didn’t know why. I
              stood there puzzled for five or ten minutes or more. Finally I looked down and
              saw that a very large dog had clamped his teeth around my leg. My samadhi was
              already so deep that the sense doors had shut down, so I never felt it. Seeing
              the dog jolted me out of my samadhi and back to ordinary consciousness. The
              fear for myself and for Dipa came rushing back: “If I die, what is going to
              happen to my daughter?” They told me the dog wasn’t rabid, but I couldn’t get
              over my fear. I hurried to the hospital, and then instead of going back to the
              center, I returned home and resumed my life with Dipa. Gradually my fear of
              dying receded, and my health slowly improved. I started practicing at home a
              little each day. Munindraji used to come to the house and ask me about my
              practice. Eventually he started encouraging me to come to Thathana Yeiktha [a
              meditation center in Rangoon founded by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw], where he
              had started teaching. So I made arrangements for Dipa to stay with a trusted
              friend, and I went.</span></p>

              completed the first course of practice [i.e., experienced enlightenment or
              “First Path” in Theravada practice]. It took about six days. After three
              months, I returned to the center at Munindraji’s urging to practice for Second
              Path. This time it took about five days. [J.E.: In accordance with Theravada
              custom, Munindraji stopped me from asking Dipa Ma about her practice for Third
              Path. She later told me it isn’t talked about because very few people reach
              it.] [For more on the “paths,” or stages of enlightenment, see the </span><a href="http://www.tricycle.com/interview/just-as-it-is"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: black; '>interview with

              to play at moving back and forth as we wished between the eight jhanas. You can
              stay in them for predetermined lengths of time and emerge at precisely the time
              you’ve resolved. Once, with Munindraji’s guidance, I made the resolution to
              enter and remain in the eighth jhana for three days, eight hours, three
              minutes, and twenty seconds. That’s just what happened. But jhana practice
              doesn’t end suffering.</span></p>

              with all of them. Once, for instance, I was able to walk into the room of a
              professor at Magadh University and have a conversation with him while one of
              his students was watching me meditate in Munindraji’s room. But siddhis aren’t
              important. Enlightenment brings purity and liberation and understanding.
              Siddhis often become a hindrance because they tend to inflate ego. I don’t have
              siddhi powers now. I could practice for them again, but it would take a long
              time . . . maybe three days, if I really practiced. But it is so much more
              important to be practicing for liberation.</span></p>

              breath, trouble climbing stairs, coldness in my extremities, insomnia. All of
              these got better. Mentally, I used to worry a lot about the future: how I would
              live, what would happen to me, how I would take care of my daughter. I felt so
              much grief over the loss of my husband, and that was a terrible source of
              suffering. I was burning day and night with it. That burning grief cooled down
              and left, though I continued to feel sad over losing him. I could accept that
              where there is birth, there is death. I still think about him. Any question of
              a permanent self became meaningless. For those who go to the depths of
              practice, the idea of a permanent “self” disappears.</span></p>

              sense-pleasure and sense-desire. There is nothing wrong with sense-pleasure.
              Pleasure and pain are part of our human experience. Sense-desire, on the other
              hand, is the grasping at pleasure or the avoidance of pain. This is what
              creates suffering—grasping and avoidance. Sense-desire comes up for everyone.
              It came up for me, too. When it arose, I knew it—and that’s the way to overcome
              it. I don’t feel sense-desire anymore. Sense-desire and anger don’t go away
              after First Path. They are weakened after Second Path and completely go away
              after Third Path.</span></p>

              sense-desires weren’t as strong. Sense-desire is also an instinct which remains
              in you through cycles of rebirth. It is already very weak in those who were
              born from the Brahma-loka [heaven realms], for instance. . . . You can stay in
              the world of sense-desires and still be a good Buddhist, though, because you
              can be out of the world at the same time, in the sense of not being drawn in or
              attached. All who are householders can proceed in this way. Buddha has said you
              can even indulge in sense-desire and be a good follower of dharma, and for most
              people this is part of an average, normal life.</span></p>
