              Loving-Friendliness Meditation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Bhante Henepola Gunaratana
              MAR 14, 2017 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Theravadan
              Buddhist monk Bhante Gunaratana outlines the ways meditation can benefit our
              mind and our body—and even our complexion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              don’t need an ideal society or a perfect world to practice loving-friendliness.
              We aren’t practicing to save the world or make it perfect. We practice for
              ourselves, for our own peace and well-being. Any effects beyond that are
              byproducts. If the focus is outside ourselves, we will never succeed. But
              fortunately, our own well-being is intimately bound up with the well-being of
              others; so truly practicing metta 
              (loving-friendliness) for our own benefit does benefit others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Discourse on the Benefits of Loving-Friendliness (Metta Nisamsa Sutta), the
              Buddha lists 11 benefits derived from practicing metta—and I might add that
              many of these benefits are being confirmed by contemporary scientific research!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Here
              is the Buddha’s list:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1. You sleep well.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you go to bed feeling loving-friendliness toward yourself and others, you will
              be relaxed and will sleep peacefully.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">2. You wake up feeling well.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you get a good night’s sleep, you wake up feeling rested and relaxed. With a
              relaxed mind and body, you are able to connect with family, friends, relatives,
              neighbors, and even strangers in a genuine and centered way. You feel fresh,
              uplifted, and joyful all day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">3. You’re not likely to have nightmares.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you practice metta, you become solid enough to face whatever arises. And in
              fact, the Buddha said it’s unlikely you’ll have nightmares when you practice
              metta.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">4. Your body relaxes and your face is
              joyful.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Your
              body reflects your mind. When you feel love for all beings, it shows on your
              face. Seeing your honest, relaxed face, others will gravitate toward you and
              enjoy being around you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">5. Even animals and celestial beings
              feel drawn to you.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you practice metta, your mind generates a peaceful field around you. Children
              especially are tuned in to this energy—and non-humans feel it too!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              day I was walking my dog, Brown, and a couple came toward us. The woman kneeled
              down to Brown’s level and talked to him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              wagged his tail and became affectionate with her. The man was frightened, and
              Brown growled at him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">6. Spirits protect you.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are times we feel guided and protected by beings beyond our sight. Recognizing
              this as a kind of grace is a source of serenity. Whether it’s literally true or
              there is some other energy that gives us this sense of guidance and protection,
              the Buddha included this among the benefits of practicing metta.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">7. Fire, poisons, and weapons will not
              harm you.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              we read stories of old, many of the elements are symbolic or mythic. The Buddha
              shared tales of adepts who practiced metta and were protected from fire,
              poisons, and weapons. He explained that greed, hatred, and delusion are the
              fires, the poisons, and the weapons against which metta protects us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Fire Sermon (Aditta Pariyaya Sutta), the Buddha said that poison is of
              three kinds—greed, hatred, and delusion. These weapons, like daggers, he said,
              can cut your peace into pieces. In the Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, the
              Buddha described bodily, verbal, and mental weapons. In the Udana, he said,
              “They quarrel, squabble, and argue with each other, stabbing each other with
              verbal daggers: ‘This is dharma. That is not.’” In the Dhammapada, the Buddha
              said, “There is no fire like greed, no misfortune like hatred, no suffering
              like delusion, and no greater happiness than peace.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a well-known story about the power of metta, Uttara, a devoted follower of the
              Buddha, was bereft. She had been given in marriage to a man who did not have
              high regard for the Buddha, and so she hadn’t seen the Buddha or his disciples
              for two and a half months. She was feeling forlorn, and her father suggested
              she hire a courtesan to serve her husband while she joined the Buddha and his
              community for the final two weeks of their rainy-season retreat. Uttara agreed
              and was able to serve the Buddha and his disciples as a cook and attend his
              teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              day as he was looking out the window of his mansion, Uttara’s husband saw her
              working in the retreat kitchen wearing a stained apron and thought it pathetic
              she was attending the retreat rather than indulging in the luxuries of life
              with him. Noticing his disdain for his wife, Sirima, the courtesan, began
              plotting to harm Uttara so she herself could become the man’s wife. Sirima boiled
              some ghee and left the house to splash it on Uttara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              Uttara saw the courtesan coming to harm her, she meditated on
              loving-friendliness and remained completely at peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the same time, Uttara’s maidservants also saw this foul deed unfolding and ran
              to stop Sirima. The maids tackled Sirima and began to pummel her but Uttara
              intervened to save her attacker.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              that, Uttara bathed Sirima in warm water and massaged her body with herbs and
              oil to soothe her wounds. Sirima fell to the ground and begged Uttara’s
              forgiveness. Uttara said she would forgive Sirima if the Buddha advised it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              next day, Sirima asked the Buddha to forgive what she had tried to do. The
              Buddha asked Uttara how she felt as Sirima was pouring boiling ghee on her, and
              Uttara responded, “I was grateful to Sirima for serving my husband so I could
              spend two weeks with the noble community. I had no ill will toward her, only
              loving-friendliness.” The Buddha commended her, “Well done, Uttara. By not
              bearing ill will, you were able to conquer the one who abuses you. By being
              generous, you conquered the one who is stingy. By speaking the truth, you
              conquered one who lies.” Upon the advice of the Buddha, Uttara forgave Sirima,
              and Sirima took refuge in the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              another story, the Buddha told of Culasiva Thera, who was not at all affected
              by poison because of his profound practice of metta. A Dhammapada commentary
              tells of four novice monks whose practice of loving-friendliness was so
              profound they were unaffected by a weapon. Not only were disciples of the
              Buddha protected by metta, but in one story a cow was spared being shot with an
              arrow because of her love and affection nursing her calf.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha taught that the six senses—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching,
              and cognizing—are on fire. Any one of them is sufficient to consume us. The
              antidote, he taught, is to know reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Be
              mindful and see how sensations and states affect you. Think of your own
              experience; see how much you burn with the fire of greed, hatred, and delusion,
              and how much you poison your mind with greed, hatred, and delusion. When you
              practice metta, your breathing becomes calm and you feel so much love and
              compassion that your mind naturally wishes all beings to live in peace and
              harmony.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">8. Your mind immediately becomes calm.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Metta
              stimulates a friendly feeling that makes us calm and happy. It truly is a
              wonderful way of life!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">9. Your complexion brightens.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Metta
              shows in your face. As you practice metta, joy arises. At first it is barely
              noticeable, but as the joy increases, it begins to pervade your whole mind and
              body. Metta does not rely on any particular time, place, or condition. Once
              aroused, it can remain present in you the rest of your life. Your face cannot
              hide what is going on in your mind. When you are angry, it shows on your face.
              When you are peaceful, everyone notices. The energy of metta spreads through
              your bloodstream and nourishes your whole being. You look bright and clear,
              calm and peaceful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">10. You’ll die with a clear mind.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              thought of dying peacefully can be comforting. When we have unresolved
              conflicts, death can be difficult. Loving-friendliness can make dying easier
              for the one passing away and for those around her.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is a difference between true peace and the appearance of peace. You may seem
              cheerful; you might even make people laugh. But when you are approaching death,
              if greed, hatred, and delusion are still lurking deep down in your psyche, that
              joviality will vanish. Practicing loving-friendliness sinks into the depths of
              your consciousness and makes your mind genuinely calm. With metta, you will die
              peacefully, without confusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Anguttara Nikaya, Samavati, the wife of the king the Buddha had declared
              chief among those who practiced metta, was burned alive while leading a
              loving-friendliness retreat for women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Magandiya
              was the culprit. So proud of her rare beauty, Magandiya rejected suitor after
              suitor. One day her father saw the Buddha sitting under a tree and asked him to
              marry his daughter. The Buddha explained his vow of celibacy and declined in a
              way that Magandiya found offensive, and she was determined to seek revenge.
              Magandiya knew that Samavati was one of the Buddha’s favorite laywomen, so she
              set fire to the house where Samavati was leading a metta retreat for 500 women.
              They all died in the fire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              she lay dying, Samavati declared, “Over many lifetimes our bodies have been
              burned over and over again. As you pass from birth to death and back to birth,
              be heedful!” Her words were so powerful that the 500 women dying alongside her
              were inspired to practice metta meditation in their final moments. Although
              their bodies were burned by fire, their minds were free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">11. You’ll die in peace.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              at the time of death you do not yet comprehend the highest truth, you will
              still go to a realm of great peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you have not completed the path of awakening before you die, the peaceful
              mental state generated by metta will still allow you to be reborn in a heavenly
              realm.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Regardless
              of whether we consider heaven a real or figurative place, this portends well
              and encourages us to practice loving-friendliness while we can.</span></p>
