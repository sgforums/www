Infinite Causes(Buddhist), on the other hand, is so named because of the belief that there are an infinite number of causes and conditions that made the world the way it is. There is no Â‘first causeÂ’ or Â‘one causeÂ’ because all things are intertwined in an endless web of causality with no beginning and no end.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my humble views.<br><br>Both evolution and intelligent designs cannot fully explain how things are going. Evolution suggests that we are all ever improving and evolving, if that is the case then how come every other animal in the world does not evolve to have the kind of intelligence that mankind possess. And since there is 'evolution' there might also be 'de-evolution'. It's like you cannot have Yin without Yang. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> In Buddhism humanity will go through both stages in cycles and in different ages. And intelligent design cannot really explain our universe in a sense because it usually means a personal God who designs and creates the universe in his own will - and that will bring a lot of problems and contradictions and a lot of questions will be raised.<br><br>However, we can also say, both evolution and intelligent design can <span style="font-style: italic;">in a sense</span> explain how things are going about. Evolution posits that humanity and the world of consciousness - including animals, is ever changing and adapting to different situations. That is also known as Impermency. On a deeper level our evolutionary path is determined by our mind, as Ajahn Brahmavamso spoke of how it is observed that cats 'evolved' when they are thrown in a place of total darkness for generations (of the cats), the cats grew much longer and bigger ears because they <strong>desired so</strong> to be able to strengthen their listening powers to survive in substitution of their visual senses.<br><br>Then how about intelligent design? As seen in my current signature, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/indigo_interview.mp3" rel="nofollow"><br>The whole universe is Intelligence in its essence.</a></span> The underlying intelligence is the Source of the universe, from longchen's website (although he's not a Buddhist but I'm posting here): <span style="font-style: italic;">What we thought of as this spacious void of pure Awareness may not be a void but, in fact, is filled with information, intelligence and knowledge. This is depicted as the light source in the diagram below. It is the Source which holds within itself all the  experiences and wisdom. It can be liken to a light source. The ray depicts informations emanating from the Source.</span> - <a href="http://www.closing-gaps.org/eternal-watcher.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.closing-gaps.org/eternal-watcher.htm</a><br><br>----<br><br>A.H Almaas (taken from the interview):<br><br>44:55 onwards:<br><br>"...It's the intelligence of true nature or the brilliance and the luminosity of true nature. And true nature is really the nature of everything. Nature of our consciousness, of soul, of who we are, is also its nature. The Earth, the universe, all the animals, thats the meaning. The moment we recognise the '??' of true nature. The moment we see that, we see it's beyond time and space. The fact that it is beyond time and space, it means it pervades all time and space ; time-space not restricted. So anything that is in space is pervaded by it and really it is the underlying Truth. That's why really, I usually think of the universe as intelligent. In a sense it has the potential for intelligence. The moment we recognise that the universe has an underlying spiritual nature -  Consciousness, or Awareness; Luminosity. The moment we recognise that, it makes sense, the universe would have intelligence. Because intelligence unveil that characteristic of that spiritual nature; ground luminosity. So because of that it's very clear that the universe is developing in some kind of intelligent way; has intelligence in its development. And now the scientific community has come up with this concept of intelligent design, seeing that there is intelligence in the universe, meaning that the theory of evolution, the things have changed, the universe - the way they change, and transforms, doesn't really fit with the belief that all are results by accident or chance. So there is some kind of pattern '??' as well, they call it intelligent design and different people have different explanations for it. But for somebody who is aware of the spiritual ground.. already known.. how it is there and manifesting but its manifesting in human beings most intensely because there is an intelligence underlying thing that manifests everything and it is also moving in an intelligent way. If we look at the evolution, we see that it is moving towards greater revelation with that inherent intelligence. And human beings at the present time as far as we know are the ones who can reveal it most '..?'..."<br><br>---<br>Taken from a post from <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=189927&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">Recycled Universe: Theory Could Solve Cosmic Mystery</a><br><br>Exerpt from Article:<br><strong>The Eternal Buddha Nature</strong><br>by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....Where do all of those four kinds of beings come from? What is their origin? Their origin is the Buddhanature. If there was no Buddhanature, everything would be annihilated. The Buddhanature is the only thing that passes through ten thousand generations and all time without being destroyed. From the Buddhanature comes Bodhisattvas, Sound Hearers, Those Enlightened to Conditions, gods, asuras, people, animals, ghosts, and hell beings. Those are the beings of the Ten Dharma Realms, and the Ten Dharma Realms are not apart from a single thought of the mind. This single thought of the mind is just the seed of the Buddhanature. It's just another name for the BuddhanatureÂ—the one true thought.....</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Well, ultimately, everything comes from the Buddhanature. Everything comes into being naturally: from nothing something manifests and that something transforms once more into nothing. This happens without end, over and over again; an infinite on-going series of production and transformation...</span></div>

Whether or not Mother Nature plays hopscotch or information can escape from black holes may be interesting but are not likely to have any bearing on whether we can live our lives so that we and all beings will be happy.<br><br>There is no conflict between the Buddha's teachings and the scientific view of how the world has evolved. On the other hand, there is a blatant conflict between the doctrine of ``creationism'' that is espoused by some Christian sects that fear to be exposed to scientific truth, on the one hand, and the teachings of the Buddha, on the other. A basic teaching of the Buddha is that one should not rely on any teaching as a matter of faith but rather only because one truly recognizes for oneself that it is true.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the <strong>Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light</strong>, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of<strong> clear light </strong>has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.<br><br>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, <strong>clear light</strong>, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.<br><br>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences take shape.<br><br>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations emanating from <strong>clear light </strong>are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.<br><br>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the Pramanavartika, the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an "interpretable" sutra.</span><br><br><a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html" rel="nofollow">http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Intelligent Design: There is only one universe, and since it was designed by Jehovah, a great and powerful god, the universe we are in must be the BEST UNIVERSE POSSIBLE for physical human life. A divinely Designed universe by definition cannot fall apart or decay for any reason. (This means that entropy, not evolution, is the real threat to the Creationist ideology. )<br><br>Infinite Causes: There are many universes, of many possible types. We happen to be in one. There may be both natural and supernatural causes that set the physical conditions of our universe the way they are and allowed life of our type to come into being. However, there is no need to believe that this is the best possible universe, since the Buddha does not design or build worlds. (In Buddhism the Savior is not the Creator.)<br><br>Evaluation: Although there is no way to travel between universes or prove they exist, we can prove that the universe we are in now is not the BEST UNIVERSE POSSIBLE for our form of life. Even creationists admit this, and all say the universe WAS Â‘perfectÂ’ and then fell apart due to the imperfections of beings within it (who were also Perfectly Designed).<br></div>
