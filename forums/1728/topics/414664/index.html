              <p>This is a good topic... thanks for sharing the link, it's informative.</p>
              <p>When I think of Sotapanna, or stream enterer, I think of two things:</p>
              <p>1) Entering the stream as in entering the irreversible conveyer belt towards Nirvana. And why? Once the insight into the nature of reality is seen, it can never be unseen again. Remaining obscuration still occur and one may even 'forget' the truth for a while in subsequent lifetimes (maximum 7 more rebirths for sotapanna before final Nirvana), yet the insight is already planted deep into his consciousness.</p>
              <p>2) Entering the stream as seeing the nature of dharmas which are impermanent and non self. Seeing the absence of an agent, In seeing there is just scenery, in thinking there is just thoughts, there is no seer and thinker. If there is only dharmas, phenomena, then you have entered the stream, why? It is the realisation that only the flow of experience IS, the 'self' is not!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next...</p>
              <p>Sotapanna is known to have opened the Dhamma Eye. Arhant is known to have opened the Wisdom Eye.</p>
              <p>What is the Dhamma Eye? It's not the third eye, or a physical eye, or heavenly eye, or the Eternal Witness, etc. I'd say it's the 'eye of perception'... the non-dual, non-conceptual, direct, immediate mode of perceiving Dharma... it's seeing that in that dharma, say, the experience of seeing, the experience of hearing, thinking, there is in fact no hearer, seer, thinker - there is Only Dharma. It is seeing the nature of experience... arising and subsiding momentarily is it's nature.</p>
              <p>What is Wisdom Eye? This one is quite beyond my understanding, but I speculate it is insight that goes so deep into consciousness that the wisdom destroys all remaining traces of ignorance... along with all other traces of clinging and defilements. Ended is the cycle of rebirth.</p>

              <p>What does the Dhamma eye see when it arises?</p>
              <div class="excerpt">
              <p>Then Ven. Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the wanderer:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">Whatever phenomena arise from a cause:
                  	Their cause
                  	   &amp; their cessation.
                  Such is the teaching of the Tathagata,
                  		   the Great Contemplative.</div>
              <p>Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this exposition of Dhamma, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: <em>Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.</em></p>

              <p>This standard formula — it is repeated throughout the Canon — may not
                   seem that remarkable an insight. However, the texts make clear that 
                  this insight is not a matter of belief or contemplation, but of direct 
                  seeing. As the following passages show, belief and contemplation may be 
                  conducive to the seeing — and an undefined level of belief and 
                  discernment may actually guarantee that someday in this lifetime the 
                  seeing will occur — but only with the actual seeing does there come a 
                  dramatic shift in the course of one's life and one's relationship to the
                   Dhamma.</p>

              <div class="excerpt">
              <p>To Upali the householder, as he was sitting right there, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: <em>Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.</em> Then — having seen the Dhamma, having reached the Dhamma, known the 
                  Dhamma, gained a footing in the Dhamma, having crossed over &amp; beyond
                   doubt, having had no more questioning — Upali the householder gained 
                  fearlessness and was independent of others with regard to the Teacher's 
                  message.</p>
              <p class="cite">— MN 56</p>
              </div>
              <p>Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful 
                  experience is that the realization that "Whatever is subject to 
                  origination is all subject to cessation" must follow on a glimpse of 
                  what stands in opposition to "all that is subject to origination," i.e.,
                   a glimpse of the Unconditioned — deathlessness.</p>
              <div class="excerpt">
              <p>[Immediately after attaining the stream] Sariputta the wanderer went 
                  to Moggallana the wanderer. Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from 
                  afar and, on seeing him, said, "Your faculties are bright, my friend; 
                  your complexion pure &amp; clear. Could it be that you have attained the
                   Deathless?"</p>

              </div>
              <p>The connection between Ven. Assaji's verse above, discussing 
                  causation, and the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta suggests that 
                  realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is not just an insight into the 
                  fleeting, impermanent nature of ordinary experience. Instead, it extends
                   also to a realization of the conditioned, dependent nature of that 
                  experience. Other passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a 
                  stream-winner — one who has entered the stream — show that this is in 
                  fact the case. The Dhamma eye sees that things arise and pass away in 
                  line with a particular type of causality, in which the effects of causes
                   are felt immediately or over the course of time.</p>
              <div class="excerpt">
              <p>"And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out through discernment?</p>
              <p>"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:</p>

                  From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</div>
              <p>"In other words:</p>
              <div class="verse">"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.<br> From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.<br> From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form.<br> From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.<br> From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.<br> From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.<br> From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.<br> From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.<br> From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.<br> From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.<br> From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, 
                  lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the 
                  origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</div>
              <p>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very

                  fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of
                   consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the 
                  cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.
                   From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of 
                  contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. 
                  From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the 
                  cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From 
                  the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. 
                  From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the 
                  cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,

              <p>The insight of a stream-winner into the truths of causality on the 
                  one hand, and of the Deathless on the other, is accurate as far as it 
                  goes, but it does not equal the intensity of the insight of the arahant —
                   one who has reached the final level of awakening. The differences 
                  between the two are suggested in the following simile.</p>
              <div class="excerpt">
              <p>"My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as 
                  it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' 
                  still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended. It's as if 
                  there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water 
                  bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, 
                  exhausted, dehydrated, &amp; thirsty. He would look into the well and 
                  would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with
                   his body. In the same way, although I have seen properly with right 
                  discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming 
                  is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended."</p>

              <p>This is a good topic... thanks for sharing the link, it's
                  informative.</p>
              <p>When I think of Sotapanna, or stream enterer, I think of two
                  things:</p>
              <p>1) Entering the stream as in entering the irreversible conveyer
                  belt towards Nirvana. And why? Once the insight into the nature of
                  reality is seen, it can never be unseen again. Remaining
                  obscuration still occur and one may even 'forget' the truth for a
                  while in subsequent lifetimes (maximum 7 more rebirths for
                  sotapanna before final Nirvana), yet the insight is already planted
                  deep into his consciousness.</p>
              <p>2) Entering the stream as seeing the nature of dharmas which are
                  impermanent and non self. Seeing the absence of an agent, In seeing
                  there is just scenery, in thinking there is just thoughts, there is
                  no seer and thinker. If there is only dharmas, phenomena, then you
                  have entered the stream, why? It is the realisation that only the
                  flow of experience IS, the 'self' is not!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next...</p>
              <p>Sotapanna is known to have opened the Dhamma Eye. Arhant is
                  known to have opened the Wisdom Eye.</p>
              <p>What is the Dhamma Eye? It's not the third eye, or a physical
                  eye, or heavenly eye, or the Eternal Witness, etc. I'd say it's the
                  'eye of perception'... the non-dual, non-conceptual, direct,
                  immediate mode of perceiving Dharma... it's seeing that in that
                  dharma, say, the experience of seeing, the experience of hearing,
                  thinking, there is in fact no hearer, seer, thinker - there is Only
                  Dharma. It is seeing the nature of experience... arising and
                  subsiding momentarily is it's nature.</p>
              <p>What is Wisdom Eye? This one is quite beyond my understanding,
                  but I speculate it is insight that goes so deep into consciousness
                  that the wisdom destroys all remaining traces of ignorance... along
                  with all other traces of clinging and defilements. Ended is the
                  cycle of rebirth.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>I will like to add some opinion here.</p>
              <p>IMO, there is a difference between non-duality and no-self insight. Both experiences are quite similar, but the insight/understanding is different.</p>
              <p>In non-duality, the realisation is that there is no subject-object division. In no-self, well... the realisation is that there is no medium agent of a self.</p>
              <p>IMO, the arising and passing away experience stems from the insight of no-self. It do not result from the non-dual realisation.</p>
              <p>This is just my understanding... certainly open to further discussion :)</p>

              <p>Yah...</p>
              <p>Non-duality is more obvious when it is experienced.</p>
              <p>No-self is a more subtle insight. There is a subtle 'switch'. It is this subtle switch that allows for the arising and passing away as the 'self' is not blocking the arising from passing away.</p>

              <p>IMO, the greatest barrier for you (atm) is to overcome the fears. Along the path, there are a lot of situations to face fears.</p>

              <p>Daniel Ingram calls it 'pseudo Nirvana'... it may appear to mimic
               certain aspects of Nirvana, but it is not. There is some insights, but 
              not yet the real Sotapanna stage.</p>

              <p><br><br>Yes Simpo,</p>
              <p>That is what I understand too.  There are subtle differences between Advaita non-duality and buddhist's anatta both in terms of realization and experience.</p>
              <p>When contemplating on the subject of 'no-self', the mind of the practitioner is directed towards the transient phenomena and upon the ripening of conditions, the mind suddenly sees the illusionary division of subject-object duality; with the maturing of this realization, experience becomes seamlessly whole. There is no hearer in hearing or perceiver in perceiving, just simply a sense of perception.   In terms of this experience, they are similar.</p>
              <p>However although the blinding bond of 'duality' is dissolved, the tendency to see things 'inherently' isn't. The practitioners continue to resort back to a Self despite after the clear seeing of this truth and rest their understanding of 'no-self based on Self'.  This is substantialist non-duality.  There is an ultimate essence and abiding in Self is still the way towards liberation and there is also the temptation to treat this experience as a sort of pseudo finality.</p>
              <p>Buddhism on the other hand sees this experience and realization as the first step in the 8 fold path -- right view.  It means right view of anatta is fully authenticated with this non-dual experience but Buddhist’s non-dual is non-abiding, groundless and essence-less.  There is no resorting back to an ultimate essence and the entire idea of liberation is based on seeing clearly the anatta, non-substantiality, essence-less empty nature of whatever arises, including Awareness or Self.  Experience is luminously non-dual yet empty.</p>
              <p>Therefore in Buddhism, besides the experience, right view is very important.  Upon the clearing seeing of ‘no division’, it is advisable to penetrate further into the impermanent nature of phenomena both at the micro and macro level of experience.   In terms of practice, there is no letting go to an ultimate ground or great void  but the letting go is due to the thorough insight of the ‘empty nature’ of all arising -- Reality is perpetually ‘letting go’. </p>
              <p>So in addition to the non-dual seamless experience, there must also be the clear experience of perpetual letting go of non-holding to whatever arises.  Therefore when AEN told me non-dual presence, the NDNCDIMOP or being lock up permanently in PCEs of the AF as the key solution to eliminate emotion, pride and anger…the 10 fetters, I told him not yet, not because I am stubbornly attached to Buddha's teaching but because that is my realization and experience. :-)</p>
              <p>The journey towards 'no-self' is analogous to peeling an onion.  Practitioner goes through the process of peeling from dissolving of personality and identity to non-conceptuality to non-duality to realization of the lack of ownership to clear seeing of 'no agent behind transient phenomena to the empty nature of whatever arises.  As we peel, the 'willingness' to let go certain aspects of 'self'/Self' grow and with more 'willingness' to let go, we come closer to seeing the true face of freedom.</p>
              <p>Deeper clinging to a Self is not washed away with the non-dual insight.  There must be further integration of the ‘non-dual’ experience into this arising and passing away, this impermanent nature, to dissolve the illusionary sense of self, anger, emotion, pride even the non-dual presence that we treasure so much; let whatever arises goes, be it during the waking, dreaming or deep sleep state.  There will then come a time where a practitioner realizes the same ‘taste’ of the 3 states as there is no holding of the non-dual presence and all experiences turn natural, effortless and self-liberating.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents. :)</p>

              <p>Hi Beautiful,</p>
              <p>You asked "Does
                      that mean having to understand that there is no birth and
                      death? "</p>
              <p>It is not a matter of understanding conceptually. There is an actual experience of deathlessness. .. and this experience is unlike anything that you have experienced before.</p>
              <p>I do not want to say too much as it will confuse you further.</p>
              <p>As i said before, it is much advisable to train under the guidance of a qualified teacher... The spiritual path is full of experiences that you have not experienced before... and these experience are 'more than meets the eye'. They are easily misunderstood.</p>
              <p>As a general understanding, there are 2 main types of Buddhist meditation: Concentration and Insight.</p>
              <p>Without guidance, many people will mix up concentration with insight as both can produce 'interesting/transcendental' experiences.</p>
              <p>IMO, concentration meditation puts the attention on an object of meditation which can be the breath at the tip of the nose. Concentration meditation leads one into a 'absorption'. There is no insight and defilements are momentarily suspended due to the single-pointed focus.</p>
              <p>As for insight meditation, it is designed to investigate and facilitate understanding of the nature of reality.</p>
