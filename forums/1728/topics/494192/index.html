              Chinese villagers take collector to court over "man in the Buddha"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">John Hooper and Ted Plafker
              Jun 2 2017 AFRWEEKEND</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Around
              the time that William of Normandy was conquering England, the Buddhist master
              Zhang Qisan decided it was time to die. Or rather, he felt it was time to begin
              the next stage of his existence by transforming himself into a living mummy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Qisan
              was born in the tiny hill village of Xukeng where even today most of the
              inhabitants have the surname Zhang. His family had the unusual tradition of
              giving their children numbers as forenames. "Qisan" means 73 – his
              grand­father's age when he was born.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              he was a boy, he wandered far and wide before deciding to enter a monastery.
              The profound knowledge of herbal remedies he acquired there won him fame and
              affection. He was so pious that he earned the honorific title of
              "Gong" (Lord) and became known as Zhang Gong. He was – and is –
              considered a bodhisattva: one capable of attaining nirvana, but who chooses to
              remain in the physical world out of compassion for humanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              around the late third century ad, some masters, including Zhang Gong, succeeded
              in controlling the manner and timing of their deaths by means of
              self-mummification. They ordered their disciples to store their bodies after
              their deaths and told them that when they recovered the body after a year or
              so, they would find it intact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              masters then ingested herbs that had poisonous properties to speed their
              demise; and preservative ones to begin the process of mummification from the
              inside out. Zhang Gong, with his botanical education, would have been
              particularly expert at this. The final stage was to adopt the lotus position
              and enter a deep meditative trance. The faithful believe these masters did not
              truly die, but entered a state of enlightenment in which they became living
              Buddhas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              his final meditation, Zhang Gong chose a particularly auspicious spot near the
              village of Yangchun in Fujian province, in the uplands of south-eastern China.
              There, he moved into his final stage of existence, and was worshipped by
              villagers – until, 1000 years later, he disappeared.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1997, Carel Kools, a restorer of Asian art and antiquities in Amsterdam, was
              sent a shabby, life-sized statue of a Buddha in the lotus position. "The
              statue came to me in a really bad state," he says. "There was lots of
              damage from insects." Attached to the base of the statue were two planks
              that were also in poor condition. "So we removed the planks he was sitting
              on and discovered these linen rolls."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kools
              took out the rolls – one of which is more of a cushion – peered inside the
              statue and found himself staring at the remains of a human being: "I was
              looking straight at the underside of his legs."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              rang the collector who had commissioned him, an architect by the name of Oscar
              van Overeem. "I was abroad," Van Overeem recalls. "[Kools] said:
              'Oscar, believe it or not, the statue is no statue. It's a mummy.' I said:
              'Carel. You should drink better wine. Don't tease me.' I couldn't believe
              it."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              July 14, a judge in Amsterdam will embark on the unenviable task of deciding
              whether these two mummies are one and the same. Lawyers representing the
              inhabitants of Yangchun contend that the mummy that ended up in Kools's
              workshop is the one stolen from their village temple two decades earlier and
              that it contains the remains of Zhang Gong. They are also expected to argue
              that Van Overeem cannot legally own a corpse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Counsel
              for the Dutch collector will counter that numerous museums and private
              collectors own mummies and Van Overeem's is in any case not the one stolen from
              Yangchun; that this is a case of mistaken identity, one that has become a
              nightmare for their client.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              stake in this bizarre affair is possession of an object said to be worth tens
              of millions of dollars. The dispute over its ownership has already had an
              impact on relations between China and the Netherlands at the highest level, and
              has also highlighted an important change in Beijing's official policy towards
              the recovery of millions of cultural artefacts that have been removed from
              China, by sale or by theft, down the centuries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hoping and praying</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              sunset drew near on a cool March evening, the scent of burning firewood hung in
              the air over Yangchun, mingling with that of family suppers being cooked.
              Traffic along the village's main road consisted mostly of waddling ducks,
              scurrying chickens and small children with backpacks making their way home from
              school in a township several kilometres away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              village is set amid high, thickly forested hills. Ever since a motorway reached
              the area in around 2010, the village has been a two-hour drive from the
              prosperous coastal city of Quanzhou. Yangchun is only four kilometres from the
              motorway exit. According to the local Communist Party secretary, Lin Kaiwang,
              about 1800 people live in the village and most, like him, are called Lin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yangchun
              has the mish-mash of architectural styles that China's precipitous economic
              development has produced. Some of the villagers live in grand, well-kept
              courtyard houses built of grey brick with elegant roofs of high-quality slate
              tiles. But there are also more modest houses of red brick or wood, and crude
              three- and five-storey blocks made of bare cement. Some of the houses are clad
              in garish yellow or pink tiles. One is adorned with Corinthian columns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fir
              trees, which supply highly prized timber for construction, are the commonest
              vegetation in the area. But the key to Yangchun's recent – and still relative –
              prosperity is tea. The bushes in the terraced fields around the village yield
              three crops a year of a variety known as Tieguanyin, a renowned Oolong tea
              midway between black and green that is ubiquitous in village homes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              standard tea-making kit includes a kettle, a pot for brewing tea and a bowl
              into which the cups are dipped in and out of water using purpose-made tongs to
              rinse and warm them. The tea is served in small cups which are constantly
              refilled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              centre of village life – both physical and spiritual – is the Puzhao Temple.
              During the day, people gather in the square in front of the temple, or on its
              steps, sitting and chatting. At night, loudspeakers often blare out music for
              the group dancing that is popular in villages and cities all over China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              fir-wood pillars and walls of the temple are hung with vertical red scrolls
              bearing ink-brush calligraphy on Buddhist themes. Strung across the front of
              the building is the kind of horizontal red banner with yellow characters on
              which political slogans often appear. On this one, however, the message reads:
              "Hoping and praying that the Zhang Gong bodhisattva mummy returns soon to
              its native home!"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Theft of a relic</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mummy's survival through centuries of Chinese political turmoil is testament to
              the villagers' love for it. It survived even Mao Zedong's exhortation during
              the Cultural Revolution to "Smash the Four Olds" – customs, culture,
              habits and ideas. Mao's young cadres destroyed artworks all around the country,
              but Yangchun's inhabitants took great risks to protect the mummy, moving it
              from house to house.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              night-watchman at the temple was supposed to keep it safe, but on the crucial
              night in December 1995 he seems, to no one's great surprise, to have been
              asleep. According to Lin Wenyu, a local, the only people who noticed anything
              odd were some workers at a brick factory near the entrance to the village. They
              saw a van make its way very slowly over the bumpy road that ran through the
              village. Since motor vehicles of any kind were still a rarity in rural China,
              the workers were curious enough to peer into the back of the van as it crawled
              along.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"In
              the rear seat, they saw a seated figure covered with a blanket," says Lin.
              "They assumed it was someone who was seriously ill and who was being taken
              away for medical treatment."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              theft was a terrible blow to the community. According to Lin Lemiao, a retired
              teacher who has lived all of his 72 years in Yangchun, "You can't imagine
              how distraught we all were. People were crying bitterly. Everyone was just
              miserable."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Two
              decades later, the loss was still sharp enough that, when the villagers heard
              tell of a statue in an exhibition in Budapest that seemed to resemble their
              relic, they swung into action. They enlisted the help of the diaspora: one of
              the villagers, working as a cook in Hungary, was sent to see if the mummy was
              that of Zhang Gong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              he reported back that it was, the villagers contacted Liu Yang, a lawyer in
              Beijing known for his work in recovering Chinese cultural property from abroad.
              He got hold of HIL, a firm of Dutch lawyers, which is bringing the case against
              Oscar van Overeem to court.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">'Hi. I'm Oscar'</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              ebullient, remarkably youthful-looking 54-year-old, Van Overeem – "Hi. I'm
              Oscar" – arrived for what he said was his first in-depth interview since
              the start of the dispute wearing jeans, trainers and a sweatshirt. Round,
              wire-frame spectacles were perched at the end of his nose and his hair looked
              as if it had not enjoyed the attentions of a comb in weeks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              world in which Van Overeem moves is a long way from that of the villagers of
              Yangchun. An architect-cum-interior designer, he works at the top end of the
              market. He says he often takes on commissions from other collectors to create
              private galleries. A specialist in Japanese architecture, he has developed a
              style he describes as "very detailed, minimalist – and extremely
              luxurious".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Warming
              to his subject, he produces a few of his designs: cool grey interiors intended
              to encourage visitors to focus on his clients' possessions. Sculptures and
              other pricey artefacts are displayed to maximum advantage in softly – yet
              intensely – lit niches. Later, Van Overeem pulls out the plans of what he says
              is a penthouse he designed for a Gulf potentate. It looks about the size of a
              soccer pitch.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"…
              And this is his bedroom … and this is his bathroom … and, right next to it, the
              pool because he likes to swim just after he gets up. That bit's for the sharks.
              So you see, he can …"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Sharks?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Yes.
              The sheikh likes to swim alongside sharks. There's a transparent barrier
              between the two halves of the pool, of course."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Architecture
              is Van Overeem's second career. He originally worked in graphic design and
              claims to have been among the first in the field to employ digital technology.
              By his mid-20s, he had earned enough to start collecting. His Chinese
              collection focuses on works produced before the end of the Tang dynasty at the
              start of the tenth century.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Van
              Overeem's principal agent was a dealer and collector he names as Benny
              Rustenburg, now retired and living in the Philippines: "a hippy
              type", but "a very good businessman". Rustenburg had a storage
              facility in Amsterdam, and it was there, in late 1995, Van Overeem says, that
              he first saw the seated Buddha that was going to change his life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              says that Rustenburg had bought it in Hong Kong at the end of 1994 or the
              beginning of 1995, and that it had been shipped to Amsterdam in mid-1995 –
              several months before Zhang Gong's mummy disappeared from Yangchun.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Van
              Overeem was initially not interested in buying the statue. It was gold.
              "And I don't like golden statues," he says in a voice infused with
              distaste. It was damaged and adorned with dragon motifs that seemed to date it
              to the Ming dynasty, which was founded almost five centuries after the latest
              period in which Van Overeem had until then shown an interest. "I said,
              'It's not my cup of tea.'"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              keep stock moving, retailers will sometimes bundle objects they know their
              customers want with others they want less – or not at all. According to Van
              Overeem, that is what Rustenburg – "the smartass", as he ruefully
              calls the dealer – did with the sitting Buddha. He added it to "a few
              beautiful terracotta objects" that he knew his young client would love to own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Van
              Overeem says he sent the statue, as he believed it to be, to his restorer,
              Carel Kools, who did not get around to tackling it until early 1997. After
              discovering that it was in fact a mummy, Kools suggested it be X-rayed. He had
              a second job at the time working in a hospital and could arrange for access to
              the radiography department out of normal hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">'We felt like Indiana Jones'</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"So
              what I did was, during the night – this is a movie, eh? – I put the mummy in my
              car, in the front seat, put a cloth over him and put a seat belt on him,"
              says Van Overeem. "We drove to the hospital. There, he was put in a
              wheelchair and we pushed him, covered up, to the X-ray department. We felt like
              Indiana Jones."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              X-rays showed there was a more or less complete skeleton inside (it was later
              discovered that the internal organs had all been removed, along with some
              finger bones which Van Overeem thinks were taken as relics). Kools then took a
              sample from the linen cushion and had it carbon-tested. The results dated the
              cushion to the 13th century – 300 years before the decorations on the casing of
              the mummy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Then
              we tested the mummy itself – and then we were really confused," says Van
              Overeem. The body was at least 100 years older than the cushion. It was from
              the Song dynasty. But, as an expert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
              York subsequently explained, it was not uncommon for mummies to have things
              added to them in later centuries. In this case, a cushion had been thoughtfully
              placed under the master's behind and the casing had been gilded and
              redecorated. But the casing itself and the body inside were about 1000 years
              old. It was the stuff of collectors' dreams.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"A
              Ming statue can [fetch] nowadays, let's say, between €20,000 ($30,400) and
              €100,000," says Van Overeem. "But a Song-dynasty statue? Even in
              those days, millions." The least appreciated item in a job lot had turned
              out to be worth a fortune: his gaudy Ming statue was actually "the rarest
              of the rarest".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              18 years, the dream remained intact. Van Overeem says he turned away an offer
              of $US20 million. But, after he lent the mummy to the exhibition in Budapest,
              his association with it became increasingly problematic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">International claims</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Faced
              with the villagers' claim that the mummy had been stolen, the exhibition organisers
              asked him to withdraw it. Overnight, Van Overeem went from being a respected
              collector to an alleged recipient of stolen goods (though, as he points out, if
              he had suspected the mummy was stolen, he would hardly have allowed it to be
              exhibited for all the world to see). Suddenly, he was "that rich bastard
              in Holland" who was depriving the poor inhabitants of Yangchun of their
              beloved holy man and, he says, his architectural practice suffered as a result.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dutch
              police came to interview him, apparently at the request of their Chinese
              counterparts. And while abroad on business, he received a call from the Dutch
              foreign ministry asking him to come to The Hague the moment he landed back in
              Holland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I
              thought I might be arrested at the airport," says Van Overeem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              wasn't, but was asked to explain the affair to an annoyed Dutch government. The
              prime minister, it turned out, had been on a visit to Beijing and had been
              embarrassingly wrong-footed when his opposite number started quizzing him about
              the return of a mummy of which he knew nothing. The mummy had become a smaller,
              slightly gruesome, Chinese version of the Elgin marbles: an emblem of the
              despoliation of Chinese culture by rapacious foreigners.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage, there are around 10 million
              Chinese objects in foreign museums and collections. Some were produced
              specifically for export; some were valuable cultural objects that were sold;
              some were looted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              most notorious episode was the sacking by the British and French in 1860 of
              Beijing's magnificent Old Summer Palace. According to the Chinese, 23,000 items
              plundered during that orgy of destruction and pillage at the end of the second
              opium war are in the British Museum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Not
              that the Chinese themselves are free of responsibility. After the collapse of
              the Qing dynasty in 1911, officials helped themselves to treasures from the
              Imperial Palace that were then sold abroad.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Cultural Revolution was a disaster – even more for Tibet's heritage than for
              China's. "The Red Guards were heavily involved in programmatic looting and
              export," says Sam Hardy, an expert on the illegal trade in art and
              antiquities at Univer­sity College London. "China trafficked so much
              cultural property from Tibet that it flooded the markets of Hong Kong and
              Tokyo."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              clearance of areas for major infrastructure projects like the Three Gorges Dam
              also saw the wholesale looting of cultural artefacts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              China's opening to the world has gone hand-in-hand with what Hardy calls
              "huge interest in the recovery of looted antiquities, which is tied up
              with identity, pride and power".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">'State operation'</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              several years, it was fashionable for rich individuals to acquire Chinese
              objects from abroad so that they could enhance their standing by donating them
              to museums. One of the most intriguing questions concerns responsibility for a
              string of apparent "thefts to order" of items seized from the Old
              Summer Palace. Beginning in 2010, museums in Sweden, Norway, Britain and France
              were targeted. Hardy says that the robberies may have been commissioned by
              private collectors who either intended to keep the artefacts for themselves or
              to donate them to the state at some point in the future – but he does not rule
              out the possibility that they are part of a "state operation".</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Chinese government has certainly expressed a growing interest in the country's
              cultural heritage. In 2014, President Xi Jinping signalled a radical change in
              the Communist Party's view of China's past when he welcomed traditional culture
              as a "foundation for China to compete in the world". Since then, the
              authorities, in particular the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, have
              become increasingly involved in the recovery of historical artefacts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That
              the government raised the case of the mummy during a state visit shows how
              concerned it is about this case. Who is financing it is not clear. Liu Yang
              says he is working pro bono: "I haven't taken any money from the people in
              Yangchun …They are peasants of very modest means – mountain villagers. Maybe,
              if we succeed in getting [the mummy] back, they'll think about giving me
              something. But it's not important." Jan Holthuis of HIL, the Dutch
              lawyers' firm, will not say who is paying them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              government has also changed its line on accepting cultural objects as gifts.
              According to Liu, the authorities "no longer encourage rich Chinese to buy
              things back and donate them, because they're afraid it creates a market, and as
              the prices go up it will be harder and harder to find buyers like that. It's
              not seen as a good way to handle things" – as Van Overeem was to discover.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              villagers are unanimous in their certainty that the mummy is theirs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"When
              I was small and went to worship Zhang Gong, that base was at eye-level for me
              and the photos look exactly the same," says Lin Wenyu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Just
              from the pictures we saw from the exhibition in Hungary, we knew
              instantly," says Lin Lemiao, the retired teacher. "There can be no
              doubt that [the mummy] is ours."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Lin
              Qizhou, a local official, says: "It is simply laughable to think that this
              is not our mummy. All the people here have been visiting the temple for their
              entire lives, and we all just know. It is not even open to debate." It
              will, however, be open to debate in the Dutch court, which will be looking for
              hard evidence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">No receipt</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Van
              Overeem's biggest handicap is that he has no receipt from Benny Rustenburg to
              back his version of how he acquired the mummy. "Everybody says, like, 'Can
              you give me proof?' From 20 years ago?" he protests. "Come on! I
              always paid the man cash or I paid him [by bank transfer] to Hong Kong."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nor,
              crucially, can Van Overeem expect corroboration from the dealer. "He's not
              willing to say anything." A Benny Rustenburg living in the Philippines has
              a profile on LinkedIn in which he describes himself as retired from "Benny
              Art"; but neither online inquiries nor shoe-leather in Manila succeeded in
              raising him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              villagers are also short of hard evidence. Local officials say old photos of
              the mummy from before the theft are "no longer here"; Yangchun's
              genealogical records, which are said to prove the link with Zhang Gong, are
              "in storage", though presumably they can be extracted if they are
              helpful to the case.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              strongest evidence in the villagers' favour is the round, flat cushion found
              underneath the mummy, of which they have photographs. On the rim there is
              writing in ancient Chinese characters. Some are illegible, but the key passages
              read as follows: "Since patriarch Zhang Gong Liuquan [a term denoting the
              entire body] from the Puzhao Temple manifested himself, years passed by which
              were not recorded. Since [missing characters] this hall…hardly any people
              visited, no incense rose and disasters occurred. The leaders of the village,
              Lin Zhangxin and Lin Shixing, touched the hearts of the villagers to raise
              money…to remodel and redecorate the valuable statue of the patriarch."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Puzhao
              – "universal illumination" – is a popular name for Buddhist temples
              in China, so is little help in identifying the statue's origins; but two things
              link the cushion to Yangchun. First, the village leaders who organised the
              whip-round to refurbish the mummy were both called Lin; second, and more
              convincing (since Lin is one of the most common surnames in China), Zhang Gong
              is referred to by name.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              James Robson, a Harvard professor and expert on Chinese Buddhism, this
              represents "a pretty tight connection", though Van Overeem argues
              that monasteries often "sneakily attributed the identity of a renowned
              Buddhist master to a different preserved corpse" to enhance their standing
              and their revenues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              sophisticated iconography on the casing, which includes elements from the
              Tantric tradition of Buddhism and "a secret character rendered in an
              unusual variant of the sacred Siddham script from India" makes a case, he
              says, for the mummy being from an important monastery rather than an obscure
              upland village. This might seem like special pleading but for two pieces of
              evidence in Van Overeem's favour.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Distinguishing characteristics</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Back
              in early 2015, the villagers told reporters, both Chinese and foreign, that
              Zhang Gong's mummy had two distinguishing characteristics. The first was a hole
              between the thumb and index finger of the Buddha's left hand, said to have been
              made in the 1950s by an official who was sceptical of the villagers' claim that
              the statue contained a mummy and wanted to feel inside. A news agency report
              quoted and named a man who said he had filled in the hole in the 1980s.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mummy's other unique feature was a wobbly neck: the villagers took it out of
              the temple on special occasions to process around Yangchun and on one occasion
              it had hit a staircase. Van Overeem says, however, that a magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI) scan in January found no evidence of a repaired hole in either
              hand while the X-rays had already shown that the corpse inside his statue was
              fitted with a steel rod running from the forehead over the back of the head and
              down the spine. "If there is one thing stable about this mummy, then it's
              his neck," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              holding to his view that "my mummy is not their mummy," Van Overeem
              says he has always sought a compromise. After he was summoned to the foreign
              ministry, Dutch officials arranged for him to meet Chinese diplomats in the
              Netherlands who in turn involved the sach. Van Overeem says he worked for
              months on a solution, even travelling to China to meet a rich benefactor who
              was ready to buy the mummy in order to gift it to the state. But a sach
              official scotched the deal, telling Van Overeem flatly the Chinese authorities did
              not accept donations. "I was furious," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              November 2015, Van Overeem announced that talks had broken down and that he
              would look seriously at offers he had received for the mummy. He then came into
              contact with a "big collector specialising in Buddhist sculptures: very
              powerful, very rich", who proposed that, instead of selling the mummy, Van
              Overeem should swap it for sculptures in his collection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Within
              one hour, we were done." The new owner of the mummy, he says, intends to
              remain anonymous and keep the mummy's location secret, so "I cannot
              deliver that statue, no matter what."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Quite
              how the judge – and the Chinese authorities – will react to that remains to be
              seen. But as James Robson says, the affair "seems to have a life that
              keeps going … like the mummy itself."</span></p>
