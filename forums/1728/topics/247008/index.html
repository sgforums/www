            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crescent:</div><div class="quote_body">Have you ever doubt faith?</div></blockquote>Only ordinary sentient beings like us have skeptical doubts.. or doubts in the triple gems. For me, I have faith in that the triple gems will lead me to Enlightenment, that if I follow the triple gems, I will certainly gain Enlightenment, Liberation, Bliss. This faith is required especially for a beginner who has just begun his inward journey to self-realisation, enlightenment. But this faith is not blind faith... not blind belief in just about everything just because "the Buddha said it"... but a kind of confidence just like you have confidence that many, uncountable people have gone through this before, this scientific method actually works, and that by doing this experiment you will see for yourself what is true and what is false.. just like a scientist. This 'scientific attitude' is important. (Do read the great article from a dharma talk by Ajahn Brahmavamso: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467" rel="nofollow">Buddhism and Science article</a> on 'Buddhism and Science')<br><br>When we have a taste of what Dharma is like, we gain confidence. The more the Dharma works for us through practise, the more confidence we gain and the more insights we gain, the more we know that Buddha's teachings are true. And of course when one has an awakening into the ultimate reality and enters the stream, also known as a stream enterer, he cuts off the first three fetters one of which is "skeptical doubt". Why? Because he has already awakened to the ultimate truth and is absolutely certain of the teachings by his own personal, intuitive, experience.<br><br>Anyway here's a good article for you and everyone to read:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body"><a href="http://www.dhammabooks.org/food_for_heart/samma_samadhi_detachment_with2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dhammabooks.org/food_for_heart/samma_samadhi_detachment_with2.htm</a><br>SAMMA SAMADHI - DETACHMENT WITHIN ACTIVITY<br><br>Take a look at the example of the Buddha. Both in his own practice and in his methods for teaching the disciples he was exemplary. The Buddha taught the standards of practice as skilful means for getting rid of conceit, he couldn't do the practice for us. Having heard that teaching we must further teach ourselves, practice for ourselves. The results will arise here, not at the teaching.<br><br>The Buddha's teaching can only enable us to get an initial understanding of the Dhamma, but that Dhamma is not yet within our hearts. Why not? Because we haven't yet practiced, we haven't yet taught ourselves. The Dhamma arises at the practice. If you know it, you know it through the practice. If you doubt it, you doubt it at the practice. Teachings from the Masters may be true, but simply listening to Dhamma is not yet enough to enable us to realize it. The teaching simply points out the way to realize. To realize the Dhamma we must take that teaching and bring it into our hearts. That part which is for the body we apply to the body, that part which is for the speech we apply to the speech, and that part which is for the mind we apply to the mind. This means that after hearing the teaching we must further teach ourselves to know that Dhamma, to be that Dhamma.<br><br>The Buddha said that those who simply believe others are not truly wise. A wise person practices until he is one with the Dhamma, until he can have confidence in himself, independent of others.<br><br>On one occasion, while Venerable Sariputta was sitting, listening respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, the Buddha turned to him and asked:<br><br>"Sariputta, do you believe this teaching?" Venerable Sariputta replied, "No, I don't yet believe it". Now this is a good illustration. Venerable Sariputta listened, and he took note. When he said he didn't yet believe he wasn't being careless, he was speaking the truth. He simply took note of that teaching, because he had not yet developed his own understanding of it, so he told the Buddha that he didn't yet believe, because he really didn't believe. These words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude, but actually he wasn't. He spoke the truth, and the Buddha praised him for it.<br><br>"Good, good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn't readily believe, he should consider first before believing."<br><br>Conviction in a belief can take various forms. One form reasons according to Dhamma, while another form is contrary to the Dhamma. This second way is heedless, it is a foolhardy understanding, micchaditthi, wrong view. One doesn't listen to anybody else.<br><br>Take the example of Dighanakha the Brahmin. This Brahmin only believed himself, he wouldn't believe others. At one time when the Buddha was resting at Rajagaha, Dighanakha went to listen to his teaching. Or you might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha, because he was intent on expounding his own views ...<br><br>"I am of the view that nothing suits me."<br>This was his view. The Buddha listened to DighanakhaÂ’s view and then answered,<br><br>"Brahmin, this view of yours doesn't suit you either." When the Buddha had answered in this way, Dighanakha was stumped. He didn't know what to say. The Buddha explained in many ways, till the Brahmin understood. He stopped to reflect and saw...<br><br>"Hmm, this view of mine isn't right."<br>On hearing the Buddha's answer the Brahmin abandoned his conceited views and immediately saw the truth. He changed right then and there, turning right around, just as one would invert one's hand. He praised the teaching of the Buddha thus:<br><br>"Listening to the Blessed One's teaching, my mind was illumined, just as one living in darkness might perceive light. My mind is like an overturned basin which has been up righted, like a man who has been lost and finds the way."<br><br>Now at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind, within that mind which had been up righted. Wrong view vanished and right view took its place. Darkness disappeared and light arose.<br><br>The Buddha declared that the Brahmin Dighanakha was one who had opened the Dhamma Eye. Previously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no intention of changing them. But when he heard the Buddha's teaching his mind saw the truth, he saw that his clinging to those views was wrong. When the<br>right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous understanding as mistaken, so he compared his experience with a person living in darkness who had found light. This is how it is. At that time the Brahmin Dighanakha transcended his wrong view.<br><br>Now we must change in this way. Before we can give up defilements we must change our perspective. We must begin to practice rightly and practice well Previously we didn't practice rightly or well, and yet we thought we were right and good just the same. When we really look into the matter we upright ourselves, just like turning over one's hand.</div></blockquote>This is from the Kalama Sutra:<br><br><blockquote>Kalama Sutra<br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha<br><br>Do read the full sutra here: <a href="http://www.alc.enta.net/kalama.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alc.enta.net/kalama.htm</a></blockquote>More replies to follow (I always split up replies into several posts because of sgForums limit)</div>

(hmm.. you may think I'm prejudiced or what <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> this is not to belittle other religions.. I have great respect for them but certain parts may be distorted by their followers) But when the Buddha awakened, he was awed by the fact that every single sentient being in the world has Buddha Nature, potential Buddha Wisdom... and this Buddha Nature is already wholly complete, just that they have yet to realise it. This is to say that every single sentient being will eventually attain enlightenment, Buddhahood! What he said isn't just something said out to sound nice so that people would be interested in his teachings... but is a FACT that can be 'tested'. In Buddha's era alone, after his enlightenment at the age of 35, thousands of others attained enlightenment, liberation, Arhatship, while Buddha was still teaching.<br><br>There continue to be many enlightened people today... not just dharma masters and teachers, but also ordinary Buddhist practitioners.. in fact a number of forummers in this forum are enlightened as well. I am not kidding here, but I will not mention their names publicly in sgforums as I guess they do not wish to be under the spotlight... but those who frequent this forum may guess who are the more 'enlightened'. Enlightenment or awakening is totally possible, and the aim of every Buddhist is of course to attain Enlightenment. That is why we practise Buddhism. If Enlightenment is an impossibility and Shakyamuni Buddha was the only one having attained enlightenment, what's the point of practising and learning Buddhism... in Buddhism, every single person will eventually attain Buddhahood and our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete, only that we have yet to realise it. It is like a clear bright mirror which is obscured due to a layer of dust - of mental defilements. Practising Buddhism is like using a cloth and wipe the mirror of the dust to reveal the clear shining mirror beneath... our Buddha Nature.<br><br><blockquote>Since everything in the world is an indirect result of human desires, how do we know that the bible is not written by some phony holy? How do we know that the Buddha scripts is not fabricated by some rabble rouser? How do we know that the teachings in sacrament relics are not just an audicious attempt to take possession of people's minds?</blockquote>Again I am not in a position to comment on other religions.. but in Buddhism, our teachings are compiled at the witness of 500 Enlightened Disciples 3 weeks after the passing of the Buddha - any errors would be immediately known and corrected by the others. Plus the Buddha have like tens of thousands of disciples at that time, or even more, so if someone made up some teachings everyone else would have known. Under such conditions it ensures the authenticity of Buddha's teachings.<br><br>Secondly the Buddhist teachings does not encourage any blind faith whatsoever, so there is no reason why people in Buddhism should try to change the scripture to gain more blind faith. This is contradictory to Buddhism and is completely unnecessary. What in Buddhism is important is that the dharma is pure and can lead people to liberation, enlightenment.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No fanaticism</span><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"</strong><br><br><blockquote>Politically, economically, socially, the presense of a religion in guiding the unsettle minds of human beings is so essential that the lack of one among people would seems unimaginable...

Are we lost souls or are we a result of a santimonious evildoer?<br><br>Is faith something that we can forever not grasp? Is it forever that hazy? i guess not to the devoted...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crescent:</div><div class="quote_body">How do one knows whether ghosts or spirits or hell are not just some tale conjured to discourage others from commiting harm?<br></div></blockquote>I'm sure you've at least heard of people who can see ghost and have so called "third eye" right? That is not really third eye in Buddhism... more like spiritual eyes... they are not even deva eye and much less the eye of an enlightened being. (See: <a href="http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html" rel="nofollow">The Five Eyes</a>) Many people can see ghosts... but seeing them doesnt prove someone's spirituality or enlightenment. Second thing is people with certain levels of samadhi can develope deva eyes (devas mean celestial beings) can penetrate into the various different realms in Buddhism.. in Buddhism we generally speak of six realms.. when you gain deva powers you will have no doubt that there are other places apart from where we are, that can be called hell and heaven. You may even remember your past lives being in those realms before.<br><br>There are six supernatural powers that a practitioner can have... but Buddhists generally do not go after mundane powers though they may develope as a side effect of one's cultivation. The first five supernatural powers can be developed by non-Buddhist yogis, who practise concentration meditation and enters into samadhi. Only the sixth power is related to Wisdom and Enlightenment.<br><br>About spiritual powers... what if I tell you my dharma teachers and many others have these six powers... such as hearing without boundaries, seeing without boundaries, reading your thoughts, knowing their past life and your past lives or even seeing into the future, and even perform other superhuman feats such as walking on water, levitating, healing, even travelling to faraway places just by mind power, walking through walls etc are possible.. (<a href="http://www.amazingabilities.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingabilities.com/</a> has some very interesting real accounts of such people.. but they aren't Buddhist, more like Hindu yogis) even in this forum for example there are some forummers who can recall their past lives and shared their experiences... some of them are very enlightened as well. But so what if I tell you all these... that's not enough. Practise yourself, eventually you'll know what is true by yourself. But not practise to gain spiritual power, practise to gain wisdom that really helps you, other things will come gradually as mere side-effects.. if you crave for spiritual powers, that is a fault that can hinder true spiritual development. What is the ultimate purpose of Buddhism? Get enlightened, liberated, attain the highest bliss of nirvana, and help all other sentient beings to enlightenment. Powers gained before enlightenment is not of Prajna-wisdom and my teachers are against cultivating such things, while enlightened people's powers are of Prajna-wisdom. My friend Thusness says spiritual power should not be discussed other than to help us understand more about the true nature of reality (emptiness), but that is beyond the scope of this topic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for posting five posts in a row (and I often do that)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But here's a topic recently posted in my forum... and it has rather related questions to yours, also about faith. You may want to check it out: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=244351" rel="nofollow">My sincere apology if any offence taken</a><br><br>And here's a good reply by _wanderer_:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by _wanderer_:</div><div class="quote_body">Sudden loss of faith may be a scary experience for some....but at the same time it's also a turning point, where one starts to relook at our old beliefs from a fresh perspective &amp; gain new insights into our lives. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I'll attempt to answer your qns, but my answers may not be satisfactory. Hoping it can lend you some perspectives.<br><br>How do you know Buddha &amp; Christ exist?<br><br>Historically, it is undeniable that the two figures existed. Historical Shakyamuni Buddha, previously Prince Siddhartha. &amp; Jesus Christ. Both are historical figures, well recorded &amp; undisputed.<br><br>So does knowing that increase your faith in the religions?<br><br>Probably not, because your faith wouldn't simply be based on whether their founders ever existed. What would matter more to you, is probably are teachings/doctrines true? Are the teachings useful for you?<br><br>That's when you need to study the teachings from the various religions to understand what are they trying to teach and point to. And then verify their teachings and apply to see if they are useful.<br><br>Since this is Buddhism Forum, I'll discuss about Buddhism.<br><br>A good question you might want to ask yourself - Are you happy? Are you satisfied? Yes, there are times when you are happy, but are you able to ensure that you're always happy? If you are super duper rich, will you be always happy? When you strike 4D first prize, will you be forever happy? Are you able to ensure that your loved ones are always happy? Even if you give the best things, buy the biggest house for your parents and stay by their side always, will they be always happy? Even with the best medicine and technology, can you ensure your loved ones will never fall ill, never die?<br><br>Because if the answer is 'no', then that's where Buddhism comes in. Prince Siddhartha left the palace because he saw the fundamental "dissatisfactoriness" in life, he saw that there was no way to bring about true happiness to himself and his loved ones. He wanted to find the way out of such "dissatisfactoriness".<br><br>So Prince Siddhartha went in search of the answer - and he found it! We call that Enlightenment. And he left a whole legacy of teachings that help people achieve that too.<br><br>My suggestion to you would be....it's okay to feel doubtful. Clarifying doubt is the first step towards developing understanding and insight.<br><br>There are plenty of resources if you're interested to find out more about the Buddhist teachings and how it can help you and your loved ones.<br><br>You could download this PDF file on "What Buddhists Believe" It is written in a very simple and clear manner, addressing common questions people have about Buddhism.

But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it"<br><br>Walk the path, discover and discern the truth yourself is the most feasible and realistic way... Buddhism does not encourage blind faith as blind faith isn't a reliable and true faith. In buddhism, there is this concept, namely the middle path which disencourage extremeness; a quality that is evidenced in many violent religious groups. There is much wisdom in buddhism teachings that promote peace and even inner clarity.<br><br>Different people have different level of wisdom, affinity and cultivation and they could interpreted the words of sutra or bible differently!<br><br>In my opinion ( no offence ), in christianity, the pastor has to be highly-spiritual and has a good understanding ( to his own interpretation ) in the bible so as to teach the believers. The pastor could be wise too. In buddhism, we have the monks and nuns. Buddhism emphasis more on realisation of the Dharma i.e Buddha teachings. In buddhism, there are many ( thousands, sorry forgot the exact number <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) dharma doors that cater to the individual's needs.<br><br>It has been proven by science that meditation promotes more peace and stability in the mind. Why did i raise this:just an example, when one mind is agitated, one could lack the judgement to see/interpreted things wrongly. Majority of the people need to develop a calm/clear mind to discern the truth and understand the dharma. Btw dharma is about the truth of our life; the ultimate reality. It can be seen if you look harder; beyond the surface of things .It can also be seen in insight meditation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi crescent &amp; all,<br><br>Unlike book-based religions <strong>for example </strong>Christianity (<strong>please no offense</strong>)which is based upon certain supposed historical events (the virgin birth, the resurrection, etc), the only record of which is an allegedly reliable document called the Bible. If these events can be shown to have never occurred, and if the documents recording these events can be shown to he unreliable, then Christianity will collapse.<br><br>When we examine the teachings of the Buddha we find an entirely different situation. Even if we were able to prove that the Buddha never existed or that there were mistakes in the Buddhist scriptures this would in no way undermine Buddhism. And why? Because Buddhism is not primarily about the historical Buddha or about events which happened in the past; rather, it is about human suffering, what causes that suffering, and how it can be overcome so that humans can be free, happy and radiant. If we wish to verify or understand Buddhism we don't pick through scriptures squabbling about the meaning of words or phrases; rather, we become sensitive to our own experience<br><br>When you study Buddhism, you are studying yourself, the nature of your own mind. Instead of focusing on some supreme being, Buddhism focuses on more practical matters, such as how to lead your life, how to integrate your mind and how to keep your everyday mind peaceful and healthy. In other words, Buddhism always emphasizes experiential knowledge-wisdom rather than some dogmatic view.<br><br>hope that answer your doubts<br>World Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
