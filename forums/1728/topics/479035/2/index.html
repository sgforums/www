              <p>I think he miss out on two important areas. The four foundations of mindfulness and dependant originations. His style is not Theravada although he uses some Theravada techniques. IMO I still trust Bikkhu Bodhi and W Rahula books more.</p>
              <p>But thanks for showing him to me. Before that I dun even know this book exists. I will see if my teacher is interested in his part on improving the eightfold path haha.</p>

              <p>There is no need for everyone to focus on the teachings of 'four foundations of mindfulness'. You can focus on anapanasati and it will naturally lead to development of the four foundations. You can focus on a number of other methods too.<br><br>As I wrote 2 weeks ago:<br><br>"<br> For people who aspired to attain once-returners, they should focus more 
                  on practising loving-kindness and contemplation of foulness of body...?<br> "<br> <br> There are many ways, that is certainly one of the effective ways Which 
                  way works best depends on the person. It is said that those who have 
                  stronger sexual lust may benefit more from the method of contemplating 
                  foulness of body. Some who already by nature is without much lust could 
                  be asked to focus on another method like anapanasati, which is 
                  beneficial to those who are by nature having more discursive thoughts 
                  etc. The Buddha gave advise accordingly to the person's inclinations, he
                   taught many many methods not only one, but each practitioner is only 
                  asked to focus on one or two at a given time (however he/she may switch 
                  later depending on circumstances). Each of these methods when practiced 
                  all the way will lead to full liberation<br> <br>Even in Buddha's days, even before all the 
                  Zen/Theravada/Tibetan distinctions came up hundreds/thousands of years 
                  later, each practitioner in the Buddha's sangha also had a particular 
                  path of practice that may not be exactly the same with the others. 
                  Diversity is natural, it is not something that is bad.<br> <br> In the Buddha's words and observations: "<br> <br> "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the 
                  development of the four frames of reference... the four right 
                  exertions... the four bases of power... the five faculties... the five 
                  strengths... the seven factors for awakening... the noble eightfold 
                  path: such are the monks in this community of monks.<br> <br> "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the 
                  development of good will... compassion... appreciation... equanimity... 
                  [the perception of the] foulness [of the body]... the perception of 
                  inconstancy: such are the monks in this community of monks.<br> <br> "In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to 
                  mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing." -- 
                  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html<br> <br> Many will argue that certain practices are more powerful than another. 
                  Or that certain traditions are more advanced than another. Many are very
                   sectarian about it. I disagree - whether one's 
                  method/tradition/practice/etc is the 'best' always depend on the causes 
                  and conditions of each individual, their personality make-up, 
                  inclinations, capacity, etc. Your best way may not be the best way for 
                  another person. His best way may not be the best way for you. You will 
                  have to find out what is the best way for yourself with your own 
                  discernment.<br> <br> For example, the contemplation on the foulness of the body was a very 
                  effective method that led to many people attaining liberation. But 
                  practicing it also led to the suicide of a lot of monks. You may have 
                  heard of this story: "<br> <br> Once while staying at Vesaali[27] the Buddha gave a teaching on the 
                  foulness of the body, and on the contemplation of the stages of 
                  decomposition of a corpse. These are traditional meditation subjects 
                  which help to subdue craving for sensual pleasure. Afterwards he goes 
                  into seclusion for two weeks. On returning from his retreat he notices 
                  that there are far fewer bhikkhus present than before, musing that 
                  formerly the park seemed âablaze with bhikkhusâ. When he asks AAnanda 
                  about it. AAnanda replies that after the Buddhaâs teaching the bhikkhus 
                  became ârepelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this bodyâ and they had
                   committed suicide. The sutta says that as many as thirty bhikkhus took 
                  their lives each day. AAnanda, somewhat mildly perhaps, requests that 
                  the Buddha give another teaching. The Buddha calls an assembly of all 
                  the bhikkhus in the area and teaches them the mindfulness of breathing 
                  meditation. " - http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html<br> <br> Conclusion? A great teaching meeting the wrong audience will cause much 
                  harm. Someone's medicine can become another's poison. There is no "one 
                  for all" prescription as if one medicine cures the illness of all 
                  patients. Prescriptions are always made depending on circumstance and 
                  diagnosis. Even if that medicine cures all illness, not all bodies may 
                  react to it the same way. If one does a type of practice which does not 
                  suit oneself, better find another. That is why Buddha taught many 
                  methods not just one. It is not that the teaching is not powerful, it is
                   that another path/practice may be more suited to you.<br> <br> And ultimately YOU know yourself best, it appears that even the Buddha 
                  did not foresee (or maybe he did?) these negative effects or stop the 
                  monks from committing suicide after practicing his method. A Master can 
                  give advice, but You know yourself, discern yourself.<br> <br> Ultimately the best teaching/practice/etc is the one that suits you and one that you will practice.<br> <br> Anapanasati Sutta: Mindfulness of Breathing <br> www.accesstoinsight.org<br> Now on that occasion ? the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of...See More<br><br>Another related story, this time between Sariputta (the Buddha's disciple foremost in wisdom), Buddha and a young monk:<br> <br> http://what-buddha-said.net/library/Wheels/wh_059.html<br> <br> 7. The Red Lotus<br> <br> Once the Blessed One lived near Savatthi at the Jeta Grove in 
                  Anathapindikaâs monastery. At that time the venerable SÃï¿½riputta had as 
                  his personal attendant a young monk who had been ordained under him and 
                  was a goldsmithâs son. The venerable SÃï¿½riputta thought: âFor young 
                  people, the contemplation of the bodyâs impurity is a suitable subject 
                  of meditation,â and for conquering lust, he instructed him in that 
                  meditation.<br> <br> But the young monkâs mind could not get even to the stage of becoming 
                  familiar with the subject, and he said so to the venerable SÃï¿½riputta: 
                  âThis is of no help to me.â<br> <br> But the thera [6] thought: âFor young people this is surely suitable,â 
                  and he gave him again the very same subject of meditation. But even 
                  after four months of effort the monk did not obtain even the smallest 
                  result. Thereupon the thera took him to the Blessed One, and the Master 
                  said:<br> <br> âTo know what is suitable for him, is not within the range of your 
                  capacities, SÃï¿½riputta. He is one who has to be guided by a Buddha.â<br> <br> The monk had been born in a goldsmithâs family throughout five hundred 
                  lives. Hence the Blessed One knew: âA red object will be suitable to 
                  him.â<br> <br> And the Blessed One, by his supernormal power, created a red lotus of 
                  radiant colour, and placed it into the hands of the monk, saying: âWell,
                   O monk, plant this lotus in sandy soil at a shady spot of the 
                  monastery. Then, facing it, sit down with legs crossed, and think, âRed,
                   red.â<br> <br> The monk did as he was told, and almost immediately he attained, in 
                  succession, to all four jhanas, those sublime states of full meditative 
                  absorption, and he even was able to enter into them in their reverse as 
                  well as their normal order.<br> <br> Now the Master resolved in his mind: âMay the lotus whither!â<br> <br> When the monk emerged from his meditation, he saw the red lotus withered
                   and discoloured, and he thought: âThis radiant form has now been 
                  crushed by decay!â Obtaining from that a vivid perception of 
                  impermanence, he then applied it to himself, and, continuing his 
                  contemplation, he understood: âWhat is impermanent is suffering. What is
                   suffering is not self,â and he saw the three planes of existence as if 
                  enveloped in flames.<br> <br> Not far from him there was a lotus pond. Boys had gone into it gathering
                   lotus flowers and had put them on a heap at the shore. When the monk 
                  looked at the scene, the red lotus blossoms which were still in the 
                  water, appeared to him like tongues of flames in a burning reed thicket;
                   and the falling petals seemed to plunge into a chasm. And among the 
                  flowers that were lying on the land, those on top that were withered 
                  appeared to him as if seared by fire.<br> <br> Stirred by that sight he contemplated on lifeâs processes, and still 
                  more the three planes of existence appeared to him like a house 
                  enveloped in flames that does not give any refuge and safety.<br> <br> Then the Blessed One, sitting in his room, emitted his bodily aura that 
                  rose above the monk and spread over his face. The monk looked up and 
                  thought: âWhat is that?â<br> <br> Then it appeared to him as if the Blessed One had come and stood close 
                  by. Seeing this, the monk rose from his seat and paid homage with 
                  clasped hands. Then the Master, knowing his fitness, taught Dhamma by 
                  speaking this illuminating verse:<br> <br> âWho severs lust entire,<br> Like into the pond descending<br> One uproots lotus plants,<br> Such a monk discards âhereâ and âbeyondâ<br> As snakes slough outworn skinâ [Top]<br> Wh059 â Stories of Old â Plain text <br> what-buddha-said.net<br> For free distribution.

              are dead or in past. Its an imbalance, bring attention in

              <p>from what i heard from MCK, who knowÂ a few, ghosts can have their own wall/doorÂ too, while we have ours, thenÂ from one perspective, they can be walking through our wall/door while on the other hand, we are also walking through theirs. sort of in different dimensions/dream world. what appear is in the mind of the individual. and some time they can come together due to karma/affinities.</p>

              <p>"<a id="cosmos">And what</a> is the cosmos as a governing principle? 
              There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot
               of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this: 'It is not for 
              the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into 
              homelessness; it is not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of 
              lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of [future] becoming 
              that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness. Simply that
               I am beset by birth, aging, &amp; death; by sorrows, lamentations, 
              pains, distresses, &amp; despairs; beset by stress, overcome with 
              stress, [and I hope,] "Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering 
              &amp; stress might be known!" Now if I, having gone forth, were to think
               thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of 
              harmfulness: great is the community of this cosmos. And in the great 
              community of this cosmos there are brahmans &amp; contemplatives endowed
               with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled [in reading] the minds of 
              others. They can see even from afar. Even up close, they are invisible. 
              With their awareness they know the minds of others. They would know this
               of me: "Look, my friends, at this clansman who â though he has in good 
              faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness â remains overcome
               with evil, unskillful mental qualities." There are also devas endowed 
              with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled [in reading] the minds of 
              others. They can see even from afar. Even up close, they are invisible. 
              With their awareness they know the minds of others. They would know this
               of me: "Look, my friends, at this clansman who â though he has in good 
              faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness â remains overcome
               with evil, unskillful mental qualities."' So he reflects on this: 'My 
              persistence will be aroused &amp; not lax; my mindfulness established 
              &amp; not confused; my body calm &amp; not aroused; my mind centered 
              &amp; unified.' Having made the cosmos his governing principle, he 
              abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is
               blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in
               a pure way. This is called the cosmos as a governing principle.<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.040.than.html">Adhipateyya Sutta: Governing Principles </a></p>
