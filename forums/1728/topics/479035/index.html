              I think the person also have to perfect in precepts. 
              
              The Blessed One also amplified thus: "If a monk should frame a wish as follows :- "Let me with a divinely clear vision, surpassing that of men, behold beings as they pass from one existence and spring up in another existence, let me discern the base and the noble, the handsome and the ugly, those in a higher state of existence and those in the lower state of existence undergoing the result of their deeds, so that I can know as follows:- 'Alas! these beings, having been wicked of body, wicked of voice, wicked of mind, slanderers of noble people, wrong in their views, acquirers of false merit under wrong views, have arrived after the dissolution of the body, after death, at a place of punishment, a place of suffering, perdition, hell; or again, these other beings, having been righteous of body, righteous of voice, righteous of mind, not slanderers of noble people, right in their views, acquirers of merit under right views, have arrived, after the dissolution of the body, after death, at a place of happiness, a heavenly world." Thus let me with a divinely clear vision, surpassing that of men, discern beings as they pass from one existence and spring up in another existence; let me discern the base and the noble, the handsome and the ugly, those in a higher state of existence and those in a lower state of existence undergoing the result of their deeds," then he must be perfect in the precepts etc. This refers to the power of knowing the Truth of Karma.

              <p>Bro, this is can see karma already. What about those who can see spirits?</p>
              <p>My office got two pple who are born with third eyes. But the same ghost in office one see is just white with long hair, another see with decomposed features. </p>
              <p>To me, the differences is due to the difference in their perception aggregate. Maybe something in our perception blocks our natural ability too see.</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>see karma is <span style="font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">PUBBENIVASA, see spirit is </span><span style="font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">DIBBA-CAKKHU - CELESTIAL VISION. </span></p>
              <p>you ask with jhana can or not, didn't ask if got people without jhana can or not mah.  :) so i based on one who do not have, and by practicing certain technique can achieve that form of spiritual power, though it's not necessary a buddhist thingy. those from cult also can cultivate it. </p>
              <p>i think as for <span style="line-height: 1.231;">people without jhana can</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> see spirits could be due to previous life cultivation.</span></p>
              <p>it's true that all people have the abilities, just haven't cultivated it. </p>
              <p>yes, to what i know, they should appear the way when they are dead, and the appearance remain there. if die from car accident, then the body also look like from car accident. those die from illness one are more normal looking, just pale. </p>

              <p><a name="N30"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kasina:</strong> (related to Sanskrit krtsna, 'all, complete, whole'), is the name for a purely external device to produce and develop concentration of mind and attain the Four Absorptions </span></a><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/janas.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Jhána States)</span></span></strong></a>. It consists in concentrating one's full and undivided attention on one visible object as preparatory image (parikamma-nimitta), e.g. a colored spot or disc, or a piece of earth, or a pond at some distance, etc., until at last one perceives, even with the eyes closed, a mental reflex, the acquired image (uggaha-nimitta). Now, while continuing to direct one's attention to this image, there may arise the spotless and immovable counter-image (patibhága-nimitta), and together with it the neighbourhood-concentration (upacára-samádhi) will have been reached. While still persevering in the concentration on the object, one finally will reach a state of mind where all sense-activity is suspended, where there is no more seeing and hearing, no more perception of bodily impression and feeling, i.e. the state of the first mental absorption (First Jhána).</p>
              <p>Ten Kasinas are mentioned in the Sutras: earth-kasina, water, fire, wind, blue, yellow, red, white, space, and consciousness. There are ten kasina-spheres: someone sees the earth kasina, above, below, on all sides, undivided, unbounded .... someone see the water-kasina, above, below, etc. (M. 77; D. 33) Cf. abhibháyatan, bhávaná; further s. Fund. IV.</p>
              <p>For space and consciousness-kasina we find in Vis.M. V the names limited space-kasina (paricchinnákása-kasina; . . . s. App. ) and light-kasina (áloka-kasina).</p>

              <p>Isn't jhanas part of the concentration component of eightfold path? Therefore, it is concentration where high level yogis will be able to attain, but they still lack wisdom to final deliverance. I remember Buddha ever give an example of attachment to feeling in the case of jhana. In order to escape rebirth, one of the common way is to rest in equanimity at the fourth jhana to practice mindfulness in order to develop insights to wisdom.</p>
              <p>Imo. Just for discussion only.</p>
              <p>By the way, has Buddha ever talk about the use of kasinas?</p>

              <p>Hi Libido,</p>
              <p>From my understanding..Jhanas are progressive states of releases (which results in the experience of joy and bliss along the way). For example, when there is disenchantment with thoughts... thoughts will fade away and cease. When there are disenchantment with physical sensations, physical sensations will fade away and cease.</p>

              <p>I agree that in jhanas thoughts has ceased.</p>
              <p>I was looking at vishudamagga. When it talks about developing certain powers, it seems to describe one needs to go in and out of jhanas.</p>

              <p>tis why need along with precepts.</p>
              <p>with precept, it's different, unlike a police commiting offense become double the offense kind of idea, it's on the contrary, a person driving a car is about to hit a wall, the more brakes u apply the lesser the impact. as it's difficult for habits to just stop immediately.</p>

              <p>You must have a certain amount of concentration for the first Jhana to arise. This is called Access Concentration. Access concentration has <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/anna_jones1/sila.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sila</span></span></strong></a> (morality) as a prerequisite. The description of the First Jhana starts "Secluded from sense desires, secluded from unwholesome states of mind...". If you are not leading a morally upright life, you cannot expect to sit down on a little pillow and find yourself "secluded from sense desires, secluded from unwholesome states of mind."  If there is not sufficient Sila, there is too much to desire, too much to hate or fear, too much to worry about, etc.</p>

              <p>Just my opinion only...</p>
              <p>As mentioned, there are quite a bit of confusion about Jhanas. </p>
              <p>IMO, only the lower jhana is 'concentrated'. The deeper Jhanas are deeper and more profound levels of 'release'. Bliss is the result of the 'movement' from grasping to release. Bliss is like smoke coming out of a explosion... and will fade away. At cessation, there is no bliss.</p>
              <p>Again these are just my opinion. Read with discernment. </p>
              <p>In any case, only fully enlightened persons can give us the right answer.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Haha, I understand. The reason why I posted here is to discuss with pple who know buddhism and hope to clear my doubts.</p>
              <p>I am a Theravada practicer. Before that, I did yoga meditation for almost ten years. I used to focus on chakras that are of specific colours, and that was before I first read about kasina. Now I mainly use breathing as the sign and counter sign. Still practicing to develop wisdom.</p>
              <p>Theravada meditation dun encourage going over fourth jhana. Beyond that, it is impossible to dwell on equanimity to observe phenomena to gain insights. If go into the formless adsorption, it is said to develop foundation for rebirth into formless realm.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think it is meaningless to ask how many people will attain jhanas. If you work hard on it, you definitely will. It is a skill that can be attained with practice just like any other: like mastering piano, etc. But not many people are that dedicated. If you look into some beginner classes on Buddhism, you may find that the people there do not have any experience with jhanas, instead they are simply trying to understand some basic Buddhism concepts and attempt to apply them in life, they are not going into hardcore or essential practices. If you look into communities like Dharma Overground, most of the people there are Hardcore practitioners and have experiences with jhanas.<br><br>My advise: go for it, be hardcore and find some hardcore meditation/dharma teachers.</p></div>
