              beginning of the Dudjom New Treasure Dharma lineage can be traced back
              to the Dharmakaya Buddha- Samantabhadra. Flowing from Samantabhadra
              (the Dharmakaya realm), Vajrasattva (the Sambhogakaya realm) and Garab
              Dorje (the Nirmanakaya realm), it then continued in uninterrupted
              succession through Manjushrimitra, Sri Simha, Guru Padmasambhava, and
              Lady Yeshe Tsogyal to Dudjom Lingpa (the First Dudjom). Dudjom Lingpa’s
              heart disciple Gyurme Ngedon Wangpo transmitted it to Dudjom Rinpoche
              (the Second), who then in turn passed it on to his son Dungse Thinley
              Norbu Rinpoche. Having received them from his father, it is Dungse
              Garab Rinpoche who now holds the two lineages: blood lineage and Dharma
              lineage.</p>

              lineage; it is in fact the heart essence of Dakinis.” It is very close
              and direct and its blessings are extremely powerful, therefore called a
              “warm” lineage. The contents of its sadhanas are concise and complete
              and provide systematic level-to-level essential oral instructions. All
              these are reasons why Dudjom New Treasure is valued as a gem of
              contemporary Vajrayana and the golden key to rapid enlightenment.</span></p>

              New Treasure is the heart essence of Dakinis, and because the
              transmission is very short, the breath of Dakini lingers on, containing
              enormous pure blessing power. The Dharma activities will spread wide
              and those who practice it will enjoy abundant success in worldly
              activities and wealth. If they keep their samaya vows, eventually all

              <p><span>Dungse Garab Dorje Rinpoche is regarded as the lineage holder of the Dudjom New Treasure. The
              Dudjom New Treasure is considered as one of the Nyingmapa's sect and
              was founded by H.H Dudjom Rinpoche. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche was
              recognized as the incarnation of Dudjom Lingpa (A.D.1835-1904) , a
              famous terton of many concealed teachings or treasures (terma), whose
              termas are now widely taught and practiced, particularly those related
              to the practice of Dorje Phurba. <br> <br> The
              teachings of the Nyingmapa School are transmitted through two main
              categories which is the karma and the terma lineages. Karma refers to
              all the teachings and transmissions passes down through the centuries
              by the long lineage of teachers and disciples. Terma refers to the
              previously hidden, rediscovered teachings of the short and direct
              lineage from Guru Rinpoche and other enlightened ones. These masters
              transmit their teachings directly through their deathless wisdom body
              in visionary experience to the terton who discovers and reveals these
              teachings. It is a very short, direct, extremely powerful and profound
              transmission. Dudjom New Treasure is considered as one of the terma
              lineages. <br> <br> Guru Padmasambhava had consecrated few secluded locations to be sacred
              places for sadhana. He personally visited everywhere in the land of
              Tibet and concealed innumerable terma treasure for the sake of worthy
              people in future generations. He also buried separate location lists,
              guide texts and key texts. For the sake of each destined discoverer, he
              Guru Padmasambhava made these aspirations: "May this meet with a person
              possessing the karmic destiny! May it be practiced by destined people!"
              Guru Padmasambhava also gave these three gradual seals, "Seal of
              treasure, seal of entrustment, seal of concealment." As well, he gave
              these decrees, "Entrusted, fully entrusted! Concealed, concealed as
              treasure! Profound, hold it sacred!" There are few purposes for the
              discovery of terma, so that : the dharma won't disappear, the essential
              instructions won't become adulterated over long periods of time when
              mistakes and breaches of commitments and misunderstanding might take
              place, the blessings do not fade and the direct lineage of transmission
              is maintained. <br> <br> At the appropriate moment those disciples appear in the world as
              Tertons, or revealors of these teachings which are known as Terma, or
              Treasures of Dharma. These teachings were to be discovered at certain
              time periods, when the beings were in need of a particular teaching to
              remove obstacles, sickness and various other catastrophies. Terma are
              dharma treasure. H.H Dudjom Rinpoche, a great Terton, received numerous
              direct transmissions from Guru Padmasambhava. His Holiness Dudjom
              Rinpoche was one of these treasure discoverers and he revealed many
              teachings that would benefit beings at the time of war, famine and
              world disharmony that we are facing at the present moment. So the
              Dudjom Tersar is fresh, vivid, and direct with no loss of meaning,
              words or blessing. These teachings from Guru Rinpoche to Dudjom
              Rinpoche, from Dudjom Rinpoche to Garab Rinpoche to us is a direct
              short lineage. Therefore this lineage is uncontaminated and knows no
              degeneration by broken samayas. The blessing and attainments are
              immediate.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dungse
              Garab Dorje Rinpoche, born in Brekha, Bhutan is a Yogi Rinpoche of the

              of Kuenkhen Longchen Rabjam as well as the reincarnation of Terton
              Drimed Odser. Rinpoche's mother, Jamyang Chhodon comes from the equally

              lineage. Rinpoche's eminent ancestry ensured him to be genuinely
              immersed in dharmic activities since his childhood.<br> <br> Rinpoche's root gurus are H.H Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigdrel Yeshe Dorje and 
              H.H Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche. Rinpoche studied under many renowned
              and accomplished masters and pursued higher studies at H.H Penor
