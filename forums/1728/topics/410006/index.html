              <p>"An untaught worldling, O monks, experiences pleasant feelings, he 
              experiences painful feelings and he experiences neutral feelings. A 
              well-taught noble disciple likewise experiences pleasant, painful and 
              neutral feelings. Now what is the distinction, the diversity, the 
              difference that exists herein between a well-taught noble disciple and 
              an untaught worldling?</p>
              <p>"When an untaught worldling is touched by a painful (bodily) feeling,
               he worries and grieves, he laments, beats his breast, weeps and is 
              distraught. He thus experiences two kinds of feelings, a bodily and a 
              mental feeling. It is as if a man were pierced by a dart and, following 
              the first piercing, he is hit by a second dart. So that person will 
              experience feelings caused by two darts. It is similar with an untaught 
              worldling: when touched by a painful (bodily) feeling, he worries and 
              grieves, he laments, beats his breast, weeps and is distraught. So he 
              experiences two kinds of feeling: a bodily and a mental feeling.</p>
              <p>"Having been touched by that painful feeling, he resists (and 
              resents) it. Then in him who so resists (and resents) that painful 
              feeling, an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful 
              feeling comes to underlie (his mind). Under the impact of that painful 
              feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happiness. And why does he do 
              so? An untaught worldling, O monks, does not know of any other escape 
              from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happiness. Then in
               him who enjoys sensual happiness, an underlying tendency to lust for 
              pleasant feelings comes to underlie (his mind). He does not know, 
              according to facts, the arising and ending of these feelings, nor the 
              gratification, the danger and the escape, connected with these feelings.
               In him who lacks that knowledge, an underlying tendency to ignorance as
               to neutral feelings comes to underlie (his mind). When he experiences a
               pleasant feeling, a painful feeling or a neutral feeling, he feels it 
              as one fettered by it. Such a one, O monks, is called an untaught 
              worldling who is fettered by birth, by old age, by death, by sorrow, 
              lamentation, pain, grief and despair. He is fettered by suffering, this I
               declare.</p>
              <p>"But in the case of a well-taught noble disciple, O monks, when he is
               touched by a painful feeling, he will not worry nor grieve and lament, 
              he will not beat his breast and weep, nor will he be distraught. It is <em>one</em> kind of feeling he experiences, a bodily one, but not a mental feeling.
               It is as if a man were pierced by a dart, but was not hit by a second 
              dart following the first one. So this person experiences feelings caused
               by a single dart only. It is similar with a well-taught noble disciple:
               when touched by a painful feeling, he will no worry nor grieve and 
              lament, he will not beat his breast and weep, nor will he be distraught.
               He experiences one single feeling, a bodily one.</p>
              <p>"Having been touched by that painful feeling, he does not resist (and
               resent) it. Hence, in him no underlying tendency of resistance against 
              that painful feeling comes to underlie (his mind). Under the impact of 
              that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness. And
               why not? As a well-taught noble disciple he knows of an escape from 
              painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happiness. Then in him 
              who does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness, no underlying tendency 
              to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlie (his mind). He knows, 
              according to facts, the arising and ending of those feelings, and the 
              gratification, the danger and the escape connected with these feelings. 
              In him who knows thus, no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral
               feelings comes to underlie (his mind). When he experiences a pleasant 
              feeling, a painful feeling or a neutral feeling, he feels it as one who 
              is not fettered by it. Such a one, O monks, is called a well-taught 
              noble disciple who is not fettered by birth, by old age, by death, by 
              sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. He is not fettered to 
              suffering, this I declare.</p>
              <p>"This, O monks, is the distinction, the diversity, the difference 
              that exists between a well-taught noble disciple and an untaught 
              worldling."</p>
