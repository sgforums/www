              <h4><span style="font-family: tahoma;">Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Northern Song Dynasty<br> by<br> The Dharma Master <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/translators.html#fatian"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatian</span></a> from India </span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"> Thus I have heard:<br>     At one time the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#bhagavat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World-Honored One</span></a> was dwelling in the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#anatha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AnÄ�thapiá¹‡á¸�ika Garden</span></a> of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#jeta"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jetavana Park</span></a> in the city kingdom of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#sravasti"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ÅšrÄ�vastÄ«</span></a>, together with 1,250 great <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#bhik"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bhiká¹£us</span></a>.  As recognized by the multitudes, all of them were great <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#arhat"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arhats</span></a>, who had ended their  <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#affliction"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">afflictions</span></a> and the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#discharge"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">discharges</span></a> thereof, acquired benefits for themselves, and completely liberated their minds.   Honored <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#maha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bodhisattva-MahÄ�sattvas</span></a> with vast wisdom and merit, complete in their majestic deportment, also came to the assembly to hear the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#dharma"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dharma</span></a>. At the head of the assembly was Great Wisdom MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva-MahÄ�sattva.<br>     At that time ÅšÄ�kyamuni <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#buddha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddha</span></a> sympathetically considered all sentient beings that would live a short life in future times. In order to let them acquire the great benefit of lengthened lifespan, He decided to expound the inconceivable, secret, profound, wondrous, victorious Dharma.<br>     The World-Honored One told Great Wisdom MañjuÅ›rÄ« <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#sattva"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bodhisattva</span></a>, “All of you, hearken!  West of  <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#jambu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JambudvÄ«pa</span></a>, this southern continent, beyond countless Buddha Lands, there is a land called Immeasurable Merit Store. That land is magnificent, adorned with multitudinous treasures, pure and superb, peaceful and joyous, foremost in exquisiteness, surpassing all worlds in the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#direction"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ten directions</span></a>. In that land of Immeasurable Merit Store resides a Buddha called Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata, who has realized <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#anu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">anuttara-samyak-saá¹�bodhi</span></a>. He is now staying in that land. Exuding great lovingkindness and compassion, He expounds the true Dharma for the sake of sentient beings, enabling them to acquire excellent benefits, peace, and joy.”<br>    The Buddha next told MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva, “Now in this world of JambudvÄ«pa, human lifespan is one hundred years, but many do evil <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#karma"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">karma</span></a> and die prematurely.  MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva, if there are sentient beings that have seen this <em>SÅ«tra of the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#dharani"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«</span></a> of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em> and heard this <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#tathagata"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TathÄ�gata’s</span></a> name, their merit will be excellent.  After they copy or have others copy this sÅ«tra, they will enshrine the copies in their homes, in high towers, or in the halls of ashrams. They will accept and uphold this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em> as they read and recite it, make obeisance to it, and offer various kinds of flowers, incense for burning, powdered incense, solid perfumes, necklaces, and so forth. If those who expect to live a short life earnestly copy and uphold this sÅ«tra, read and recite it, and make offerings and obeisance, they will have their lifespans lengthened to one hundred years.<br>     MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva, if sentient beings that have heard the name of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata earnestly say His name 108 times, their short lifespans will be lengthened. If those who have only heard His name earnestly believe, accept, and honor it, they too will have their lifespans lengthened.<br><a name="note1"></a>     “Moreover, MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva, suppose there are those who, without momentary wavering, constantly and earnestly think of and seek the true Dharma. Good men and good women, all of you should hearken. For your sake, I now pronounce the 108-syllable dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata: </span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: xx-small;"> namo bhagavate aparimitÄ�yur-jñÄ�na-suviniÅ›cita-tejorÄ�jÄ�ya | tathÄ�gatÄ�yÄ�rhate samyak-saá¹�buddhÄ�ya | tad-yathÄ� [oá¹� puá¹‡ya mahÄ�-puá¹‡ya | aparimita-puá¹‡ya | aparimitÄ�yuá¸¥-puá¹‡ya-jñÄ�na-saá¹�bhÄ�ropacite |]* oá¹� sarva saá¹�skÄ�ra pariÅ›uddha dharmate gagana samudgate | svabhÄ�va viÅ›uddhe mahÄ�-naya parivÄ�re svÄ�hÄ� || </span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;">“MañjuÅ›rÄ« Bodhisattva, for those who expect to live a short life, if they copy or have others copy this 108-syllable dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata, enshrine the copies on the tops of high towers or in clean places in the halls [of ashrams], adorn them in accordance with the Dharma, and make various kinds of offerings, they will gain longevity, living one hundred years. After their lives end here, they will be reborn in Immeasurable Merit Store, the land of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata.”<br>    While ÅšÄ�kyamuni Buddha was pronouncing this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, 99 <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#koti"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">koá¹­i</span></a> Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 84 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 77 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 66 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 55 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 44 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 36 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, 25 koá¹­i Buddhas, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.  Meanwhile, koá¹­is of Buddhas, as numerous as the sands of ten Ganges Rivers, with one mind and one voice, also pronounced this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>.<br>     [The Buddha continued] “If there are those who copy or have others copy this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« sÅ«tra, they will never be reborn in hell, the ghost world, the animal kingdom, or the dominion of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#yama"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yama</span></a>, king of the underworld. They will never again take those evil <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#journey"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">life-paths</span></a> in acceptance of evil requitals. Because of their merit acquired from copying this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, they will have past-life knowledge, rebirth after rebirth, life after life, wherever they are reborn. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, their merit will be the same as that from copying texts in 84,000 Dharma <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#store"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stores</span></a>. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, their merit will be the same as that from  constructing 84,000 treasure pagodas.<br>     “If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, because of this merit, their [evil] karmas, which would drive them into the hell of uninterrupted suffering, will all be obliterated. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, they will neither fall under the rule of the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#mara"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">mÄ�ra-king</span></a> and his retinue nor take the life-paths of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#yaksa"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">yaká¹£as</span></a> or <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#raksa"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">raká¹£asas</span></a> They will not die an accidental death and will never receive those evil requitals mentioned before. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, at the end of their lives, 99 koá¹­i Buddhas will appear before them to receive them to be reborn in that Buddha’s land. You all should not doubt what I say. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, they will never assume female form in their future lives. If there are those who copy or have others copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, they will always be secretly followed and protected by the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#god4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">four god-kings</span></a>. In the east is the god-king Upholding the Kingdom, lord of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#gandharva"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">gandharvas</span></a>; in the south is the god-king Increase and Growth, lord of <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#kum"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">kumbhÄ�á¹‡á¸�as</span></a>; in the west is the god-king Broad Eye, lord of great <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#naga"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dragons</span></a>; and in the north is the god-king Hearing Much, lord of yaká¹£as.<br>     “If there are those who, for this sÅ«tra, give away a small portion of their wealth as alms, they in effect give others all of the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#treasure"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">seven treasures</span></a>—gold, silver, aquamarine, conch shell, emerald, coral, and amber—filling up this <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#thousand"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three-Thousand Large Thousandfold World</span></a>. Furthermore, if there are those who make offerings to this sÅ«tra, they in effect make offerings to the entire store of the true Dharma. If there are those who present the superb seven treasures as an offering to the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#buddha7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">past seven Buddha-TathÄ�gatas</span></a>, also called Arhats, Samyak-Saá¹�buddhas—VipaÅ›yin, Åšikhin, ViÅ›vabhÅ«, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, KÄ�Å›yapa, and ÅšÄ�kyamuni—the quantity of merit they acquire can never be known by measurement. Similarly, if there are those who make offerings to this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, the limit of their merit can never be known by measurement.<br>     “As the number of drops of water in the four great oceans can never be known, likewise, if there are those who copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, uphold it, read and recite it, and make offerings, the limit of their merit cannot be known by measurement. If there are those who copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, their place has the status of a treasure pagoda containing the holy relics of Buddhas. Their place is worthy of paying respects and making obeisance. If there are sentient beings that have heard this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«, they will never again assume unfortunate life forms, such as birds, four-legged creatures, or multi-legged creatures. They will quickly attain anuttara-samyak-saá¹�bodhi, from which they will never regress.<br>     “If those who have accumulated the seven treasures—gold, silver, aquamarine, conch shell, emerald, coral, and amber—piled high like a wonderful mountain, give them all away as alms, the quantity of merit they acquire cannot be known by measurement. Similarly, if there are those who, for this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, give alms, the limit of their merit cannot be known by measurement. Moreover, if there are those who copy this <em>SÅ«tra of the DhÄ�raá¹‡Ä« of Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King TathÄ�gata</em>, and make obeisance and offerings to it, they in effect make obeisance and offerings to all TathÄ�gatas in Buddha Lands in the ten directions. There is no difference.”<br>    Then ÅšÄ�kyamuni the World-Honored One spoke in verse: </span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: tahoma;"> Through training acquire the power of almsgiving.<br> By virtue of the power of almsgiving, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#chamber"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">chamber of great compassion</span></a><br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although almsgiving is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br> Through training acquire the power of observing the <a href="http://www.sutrasmantras.info/glossary.html#precept5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">precepts</span></a>.<br> By virtue of the power of observing the precepts, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine chamber of great compassion<br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although observing the precepts is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br> Through training acquire the power of endurance.<br> By virtue of the power of endurance, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine chamber of great compassion<br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although endurance is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br> Through training acquire the power of energetic progress.<br> By virtue of the power of energetic progress, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine chamber of great compassion<br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although energetic progress is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br> Through training acquire the power of meditation.<br> By virtue of the power of meditation, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine chamber of great compassion<br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although meditation is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br> Through training acquire the power of wisdom.<br> By virtue of the power of wisdom, one attains Buddhahood.<br> If one enters the fine chamber of great compassion,<br> And one’s ear briefly hears this dhÄ�raá¹‡Ä«,<br>Although wisdom is not yet fully achieved,<br> One will soon become the teacher to gods and humans.<br><br></span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: tahoma;"> After the Buddha pronounced this sÅ«tra, the great bhiká¹£us, Bodhisattvas, gods, humans, asuras, gandharvas, and others in the assembly, having heard the Buddha’s words, greatly rejoiced.  They all believed in, accepted, and reverently carried out the teachings. </span></p>
