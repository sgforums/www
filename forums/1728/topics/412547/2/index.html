              <p>I wrote this months ago in my blog:</p>
              <p>...Hi,<br><br>The rules first, since it is an easy one.<br><br>The 
              rules are not fixed - Buddha did not set rules in the beginning, but as 
              time goes by, his community/sangha did foolish things, so the Buddha had
               no choice but to set some rules to prevent folly from being repeated. 
              Buddha's rules were 'subject to revision'.<br><br>Now.. I understand 
              that AF does not have precepts and rules and prefer people to exercise 
              their common sense. This is also the case in certain schools of Buddhism
               - Dzogchen, for example, teaches not blind adherence to rules but to 
              exercise our awareness.<br><br>Even non-buddhist teachings like Eckhart 
              Tolle also claim that rules are not necessary if one acts with awareness
               and wisdom. (not suggesting that Eckhart Tolle is teaching the same 
              things as AF, just pointing out that the 'no rules' thing is not 
              perculiar to AF at all)<br><br>Of course... that is IF that person has 'awareness' and 'wisdom' to begin with.<br><br>Some people just don't! So how do you, for practical purposes, prevent criminals from killing, from stealing things?<br><br>You
               set up laws. Well, yes, understandably as AF so clearly said, the rules
               and laws have not solved the problems of humanity from its roots - the 
              attachment to the self/Self that leads to the affective system of 
              craving, anger, harmfulness, etc, the source of all the sufferings of 
              the world. This is in line with Buddhist understanding.<br><br>Yet, 
              having laws are still necessary because at least it helps maintain some 
              level of orderliness in society (even though not to the level of 
              perfection). You can't deny that the vast majority of society are still 
              un-free, and therefore, quite capable of being harmful.<br><br>You can't
               expect everyone to attain Actual Freedom immediately - I do not believe
               it can be achieved even in ten thousand years time. Certainly not in 
              our lifetime, I can assure you. So in the meanwhile, while we wait for a
               utopian society (in an unreachable future) where everyone becomes 
              actually free, do we just let society run lawless and let the murders 
              and rapes go uncontrolled? Do you see my point?<br><br>So why do away 
              with laws and rules? It is necessary, for the time being. It is not the 
              ultimate solution, I agree, but a practical interim (and imperfect) 
              solution to some of society's problems. After all who would want to live
               in a lawless land? Everyone prefers to live in a lawful, safe, 
              low-crime society. Tell me honestly: would you even dare let alone want 
              to live in a lawless society where murders, rape, robbery go unchecked?<br><br>Similar
               for Buddha - his Arhants were no longer capable of transgressing the 
              rules (like killing, stealing, etc) even if the rules were non-existent.
               Why? They have removed the delusion of a self/Self and the affective 
              system of craving, anger, harmfulness, fear, etc etc. They can no longer
               do harm to themselves and others.<br><br>But the rules are necessary for beginners/non-Arhants.<br><br>It
               is for practical, pragmatic purposes. To safeguard the happiness of 
              mankind and prevent the world from becoming a living hell, precepts and 
              rules are still a 'transitory necessity'.<br><br>Buddhism has a higher 
              goal - freedom from all sufferings. Precepts and rules are not going to 
              achieve that, it only ensures that you do not make your deluded life 
              even worse - but it does not remove your delusions (of being a 
              self/Self). Nevertheless, precepts are still helpful for practical 
              purposes.<br><br>Also, precepts help ensure that if we do not become an 
              Arhant/liberated yet, at least we do not make so much bad karma for 
              ourselves.... (excerpt cut)</p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>Well said. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Hi Fugazzi,</p>
              <p>I wish a path can be as simple as having no-rules and no precepts. However, reality is more complex than that.</p>
              <p>IMO, much to the misconception about it, Enlightenment will not take away any sensation, even that of pain. The only thing that it took away is the aversion and suffering caused by not facing the sensation/situation directly/squarely as it IS. If you do not believe me, you can pinch yourself hard now and see if you can have yourself not feel the sensation :)</p>
              <p>Precepts works at the level of sensation, eventually. It minimise the occurences of painful sensation, to oneself and to others. The sensation of being cut is painful whether one is enlightened or not. All harm are painful at the level of sensation. It is this, that precepts can minimise.</p>

              <p>One measure of intelligence is the ability to see things in context and relate.  The ability to see smoke as it is, and the fundamental response of "I" to "Others". What does  "no self" means to me? The stillness of  mind, acknowledging the phenomenon without reifying.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">1)Waking state thoughts are sound-like, only conceptual. Sleeping thoughts or dreamstates are visual like, also conceptual in content,  for example,you will not see colour if colours are not relevant. </span></p>
              <div>The mind mainly process the known and predict the uncertain.</div>
              <div>2)The registering of phenomena is primary property of mind, as a functioning aspect of being human, mind always operates with me or self in perspective, meaning self interest is always primary objective of the mind. Everything is between "I" and phenomena with mind as conduit.</div>
              <div>3)Intelligence is the processing of information registered and stored within one's memory. Intelligence is a measure of adaptability and is a valued asset . </div>
              <div>4) I , Me is an aggregate or the skandas, it does not exist independently.</div>
              <div>5) The wise or otherwise both alike experiences being, the difference being the wise ,experiences the present without undue projection of the past and the future.   </div>
              <div>6) One is not free or independent of the world, unless there duality, one separate one and the "rest".</div>
              <div>7)The experience of "No self" leaves just the experience of itself, of being relieved of tenuous grip of being. </div>
              <div>8)Uncertainty is the unease of the unknown, lack of predictability. Reconciliation comes with letting go of known dogmas, and ability to relate to the experience.</div>
              <div>9)Totality of experience is the total sum of present experience here and now, the past culminating to the present. Totality of future experience, the culmination past up the point of the future"present".</div>
              <div>10)Mind in service of "I', utilise concepts of duality, to cling to existence. If measure to one's mind, one would measure rate of consciousness or resolving power against chronological time.  To brand a person slow is actually to subconsciously  rate the person's of consciousness, the ability to process information.</div>
              <div>11)All would be well if the main intention is to share, alas, but no, I see it as more of proclamation, out of context and out of topic.  There avenues to proclaim aplenty, self domain, or personal topic; locked, when comments are not invited.

              <li>We are the anger </li>
              <li>Do not judge or repress the anger </li>
              <li>Focus on the self, not on the other </li>
              <li>as an older sister cares for a younger sister, </li>
              <li>as a gardener sees with insight and non-dual vision the potential beauty of compost, </li>

              <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <li>Breathing in, I know that anger is here. </li>
              <li>Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. </li>
              <li>Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant </li>

              <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <li>When we are calm enough to look directly at the anger, we can begin to see its root causes: misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning.</li>
              <li>Taking time, perhaps half an hour, to be mindful of the anger, transforms it.</li>
              <li>"Seeing and understanding are the elements of liberation that bring about love and compassion."</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The roots of anger</h3>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The primary roots are in ourselves:</p>
              <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              <li>our lack of understanding of these causes of anger </li>
              <li>our desire, pride, agitation, and suspicion </li>
              </ul>
