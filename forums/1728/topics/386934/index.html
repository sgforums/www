              There  are three types of enlightenment:-
              Samyaksam Buddha
              Pratyeka Buddha 
              Shravaka Buddha

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I believe the more realised the person becomes, the more likely he will give rise to a deep reverence for the Buddha because of his profound and subtle wisdom which cannot be found anywhere else in other religions (even though non-Buddhists do reach their own level of realisations but it is still not the same as the enlightenment in Buddhism), the more likely he will be a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>A reverent mind will naturally arise when one realises emptiness. For example Nagarjuna said: <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <em>“I pay respect to the best among speakers
               who, having attained Enlightenment, has taught relative origination 
              (PratityasamutpÄ�da) which is no-cessation, no-origination, 
              no-annihilation, no-abiding, no-one-thing, no-many-thing, no-coming-in, 
              no-going-out; being the termination of linguistic description 
              (PrapañcopaÅ›amam), it is the good (Åšivam) [RÄ�m Candra PÄ�ndey &amp; 
              Mañju, 1999, pp.1]"</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. to be a Buddhist you just have to take refuge in the triple gems, no other vows necessary.</p>

              <p>The only appearing Samyaksam Buddha of this age is Shakyamuni, the era of Pratyeka Buddha has past/has not come (depending on perspective) because Shakyamuni's sassana is still available, and hence only Shravakas and Bodhisattvas who attained enlightenment by learning from the available dharma teachings are currently present.</p>

              </table>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Many people 
              share 
                      a common opinion that it suffices for a person to have a good 
              heart and 
                      therefore there is no need to take refuge in the Three Treasures
               (Buddha, 
                      Dharma and Sangha). However, do they know the true extent of 
              their goodness?<br> <br> Even if a person’s heart (mind) and his actions 
                      are so virtuous that they are reborn in the realm of heavens, 
              and for 
                      that matter in the highest levels of the heavens which is the 
              heaven of 
                      “non-thinking and non-non-thinking” (Naivasamjnanasamjnayatana),
               
                      although there is no form (body), there is still 
              mind-consciousness. If 
                      in this mind-consciousness there is a seed of killing which was 
              previously 
                      planted in the mind-consciousness, that seed may still emerge 
              and cause 
                      the person to descend to hell. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Therefore, 
              people 
                      have to form an affinity with the Three Treasures: the Buddha, 
              the Dharma 
                      and the Sangha, and be illumined by the brightness of the Buddha
               so that 
                      they can be liberated. Such an affinity is formed by taking 
              refuge in 
                      the Three Treasures and thereafter cultivate diligently.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Buddha, 
              Dharma and Sangha 
                      are the rarest and most invaluable treasures in the world. They 
              are different 
                      from the worldly treasures, for they could not be bought nor can
               they 
                      be exchanged with whatever worldly materials. However, people 
              can resonate 
                      with the Three Treasures through their faith and sincerity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Three 
              Treasures 
                      of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha in Buddhism are further broken down
               into 
                      different perspectives. The “Sustained Three Treasures” refer 
                      to the Three Treasures that live on and sustain the Buddhism 
              that exists 
                      in this world so as to spread and pass on to the later 
              generations. These 
                      include the images of the Buddha which may be made of stone, 
              clay, wood, 
                      metal, or drawings, referred to as the Buddha Treasure; the 
              Tripitaka, 
                      the records of the teachings of the Buddha, are referred to as 
              the Dharma 
                      Treasure. Ordained monks and nuns (bhiksu and bhiksuni) who 
              renounced 
                      the world to cultivate and create conditions for others to 
              practise the 
                      Buddhist path, promote the teachings of the Buddha and benefit 
              sentient 
                      beings, and thereby continuing the wisdom-life of Buddha, are 
              referred 
                      to as the Sangha Treasure. These are the Sustained Three 
              Treasures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The 
              “Own-nature Three Treasures” refer to 
                      three attributes that everybody has. Every human being has the 
              same pure 
                      awareness-nature as the Buddha. This is called the Treasure of 
              Own-nature 
                      Buddha. When unorthodox or wrong thinking does not arise in our 
              mind, 
                      and we hold right understanding and right views, then that is 
              Treasure 
                      of Own-nature Dharma. When we learn the teachings of the Buddha 
              and put 
                      them into practise thereby illumining our own pure brightness, 
              that is 
                      the Treasure of Own-nature Sangha. These are the Three Treasures
               of Own-nature 
                      and are inspired only through the sincerity in taking refuge in 
              the Three 
                      Treasures and cultivating according to the teachings. People 
              should not 
                      set unrealistic goals and make casual remarks that they possess 
              the Own-nature 
                      Three Treasures, and thus there is no need to take refuge in the
               Three 
                      Treasures. Such talk is sowing the seeds for hell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The 
              objective of taking refuge in the Three Treasures 
                      is to learn from them. Therefore, people who aspire to learn 
              from the 
                      Buddha have to take refuge in the Three Treasures. As an 
              illustration, 
                      a person who is studying in a certain university cannot simply 
              say that 
                      he merely wants to pursue his studies and there is no need to 
              bother with 
                      the enrolment. But, to obtain a recognized university 
              qualification requires 
                      enrolment in the university, registration for examinations, 
              diligence 
                      in the studies before one can graduate with a degree from the 
              university. 
                      However, if a person is not enrolled in the university but he 
              completed 
                      the course books through self-study at home, he is not 
              recognized as having 
                      graduated from the university. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Hence, a 
              Buddhist has to take refuge in the Three Treasures, 
                      learn the teachings of the Buddha and put them into practice. 
              Only then 
                      may he be called an authentic practitioner of Buddhism. On the 
              other hand, 
                      there are many people who believe in the teachings of Buddhism 
              but they 
                      have not yet taken refuge in the Three Treasures. We cannot say 
              that they 
                      are not Buddhists. Instead, they are better described as 
              would-be Buddhists 
                      because they will take refuge in the Three Treasures in the 
              future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">As 
              Buddhists, after 
                      we have taken refuge in the Three Treasures, we still need to 
              constantly 
                      take refuge in the “”Own-nature Three Treasures” too. 
                      When our mind resonates with the Three Treasures, we will 
              illumine our 
                      wisdom and brightness. We will constantly be with Buddha. This 
              is the 
                      significance of taking refuge in the Three Treasures.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>I believe the more realised the person becomes, the more likely
                  he will give rise to a deep reverence for the Buddha because of his
                  profound and subtle wisdom which cannot be found anywhere else in
                  other religions (even though non-Buddhists do reach their own level
                  of realisations but it is still not the same as the enlightenment
                  in Buddhism), the more likely he will be a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>A reverent mind will naturally arise when one realises
                  emptiness. For example Nagarjuna said: <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><em>“I pay respect to
                  the best among speakers who, having attained Enlightenment, has
                  taught relative origination (PratityasamutpÄ�da) which is
                  no-cessation, no-origination, no-annihilation, no-abiding,
                  no-one-thing, no-many-thing, no-coming-in, no-going-out; being the
                  termination of linguistic description (PrapañcopaÅ›amam), it is the
                  good (Åšivam) [RÄ�m Candra PÄ�ndey &amp; Mañju, 1999,
                  pp.1]"</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. to be a Buddhist you just have to take refuge in the triple
                  gems, no other vows necessary.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br> I agree! My belief, is if one practices and study Buddhist teachings,eventually faith in Buddhism grows, one will eventually seek refuge.</p>
