              <p><br> In my Facebook group "Dharma Connection" there happens to be many 
                  Dzogchen practitioners around so I posted this as it may interest them 
                  as I think it may also interest you as a reader. I've also posted some 
                  comments by Thusness below. (note: Thusness is not a Dzogchen 
                  practitioner so whatever he said need not be indicative of Dzogchen, 
                  just the practice and experience between us)</p>

He told me this 
                  personally. Not only me, but others. He did realize rainbow body. 
                  Rainbow body, in Dzogchen, does not mean that your body disappears. This
                   is a huge misconception....it is stupidly simple -- once you reach the 
                  end of the fourth vision, everything is a display of the five lights, as
                   it is put in the classical text earth, rocks, mountains and cliffs 
                  vanish and instead one sees only the five pure lights.....In other 
                  words, rainbow body in essence is actually a realization...."</span><br> <span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show"> <br> ...<br> <br> "No, but I have heard (from ChNN among others) that the disappearance 
                  of the body is not necessarily a sign of the body of light.<br> <br> Hindus also gain control over the four elements, also Arhats can gain 
                  control over the four elements. Gaining control over the four elements 
                  is mundane siddhi, it is not excellent siddhi, nor is it reserved for 
                  Vajrayana and Dzogchen people. However, if someone has not studied in 
                  detail, they might think that many mundaneÂ  siddhis are 
                  profound. So yes, what I am telling you is that I do not consider the so
                   called rainbow body to much more than a display of mundane siddhi to 
                  create faith.<br> <br> I am glad you have faith in the teachings, but as
                   I said, I do not derive my faith in the teachings through illusions and
                   phantasmagoria.<br> <br> N"<br> <br> ....<br> <br> p.s. with regards to
                   KDL, who is also Malcolm's teacher (he passed away in 2006) and Malcolm
                   has said before that KDL is a fully awakened Buddha,<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow nofollow" href="http://tibetanaltar.blogspot.com.au/2009/10/terton-kunzang-dechen-lingpa-moving.html">http://tibetanaltar.blogspot.com.au/2009/10/terton-kunzang-dechen-lingpa-moving.html</a><br> <br> "Later when Rinpoche was relaxing in a lawn chair, he said to a few 
                  students gathered around him: "You don't realize this, but I am actually
                   Guru Rinpoche and you are his twenty-five disciples. I have reached the
                   stage of exhaustion of phenomena (cho nyi zepa). In truth there is for 
                  me no form, no sensation, no perception, no karmic formation, no 
                  consciousness, no form, no smell, no sense consciousness or object of 
                  sense consciousness and so forth; there is no self or other and no 
                  distinction of 'Buddhas' and 'sentient beings'; everything remains in 
                  the naturally perfect state of pure equality. From the depths of my 
                  heart I wish there were some way you could all be made to understand the
                   truth in this, but you do not see it."<br> <br> Then Rinpoche went silent and tears fell from his eyes."<br> <br> Also, maybe not many of you here knows this - Malcolm (Loppon Namdrol) was asked to teach Dzogchen by KDL but he refused.</span></span></div>

              <p><br> Thusness said to me:</p>
              <blockquote> "As I suspected (thumbs up) I mean the rainbow body. That can only be
                   done after realization of twofold emptiness and intensity of luminosity
                   into the three states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep)... you are doing 
                  pretty well. The integration has
                   been progressing well of the non-dual bliss into your deep sleep state,
                   in view of the short period after your realization of anatta. The inner
                   
                  core must completely disappear and the intensity of luminosity must 
                  heighten... Sensations will become transparent and crystal sharp clear.<br> <br> At
                   present the core center is gone... You write too much and have too 
                  little rest. Your mind must have enough time to rest in 
                  non-conceptuality of the 6 entries and exits. Otherwise it will not be 
                  easy for you to penetrate further. After realizing the twofold emptying 
                  there is no more boundaries between mind, appearances and apparent 
                  objects and experience becomes seamless... All is mind or this 
                  integrated activity. Then we should actualize and integrate this 
                  realization.<br> <br> In touching, both subject and object are both emptied
                   and deconstructed into a single activity of touch and the intensity of 
                  luminous clarity must be strong... is it strong now? Or just like 
                  passing thoughts with no intensity.</blockquote> <blockquote> Now penetration of the 3 
                  states is only supported by the strength of your view and realization, 
                  not by the intensity of your non-conceptual experience.<br> <br> "In essence rainbow body is a realization..." Maybe actualization of 
                  realization (would be better), in essence it is an actualized state."<br> <br> <br> my comment: Dzogchen practitioners use the term 'Realization' 
                  differently than I and Thusness, 'Realization' could mean something like
                   full actualization or Buddhahood for them and not just an initial 
                  insight/recognition/experience.</blockquote>
