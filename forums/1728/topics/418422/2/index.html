              <p>Its wrong to embrace wai dao teachings from Buddhism point of view. Because those wai dao teachings are incomplete, are flawed. If wai dao books are complete, perfect, are in line with Buddhism view, they will not be wai dao, they will be Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Take for example . This part from Di Zi Gui. çˆ¶æ¯�æ•™ï¼Œé¡»æ•¬å�¬ã€‚Parents teaches, must listen. Really? Parents ask the children to go squash roaches and ants in the apartment. Must the children obey? Its earthly, worldly education! There are something higher than this. Buddhism dun need to embrace Confucius teachings as part of greater understanding.

              <p>To say that wanna practice, study Buddhism must start from study Confucius teachings, using Confucius or Daoism teachings as foundation, as entry to Buddhism, thats just wrong view. Buddhism has got entry level material. No need to resort to wai dao books as entry to Buddhism.</p>

There are plenty of entry level Buddhism books for people to read. He dun have to advocate using Di Zi Gui as foundation, entry for Buddhism. Buddhism is up to standard in covering the basic, entry level Buddhism. Dun have to resort to using wai dao books.</p>
              <p>By advocating wai dao books to cover the basic, serving as entry and foundation to Buddhism, that action is implying that Buddhism is not up to standard in covering the basic of Buddhism, not up to standard to serve as entry and foundation of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>it mean Guanshi yin can manifest into other religion's founder
                      to teach dharma to the follower. moreover Confucius å„’å®¶ not
                      religion, as there's no Godhead. it's a family teaching.</p>
              <p>if really wrong, i'm sure the Dharma protectors will not allow
                      it.</p>

              <p>Confucius thinking, wats the gist of it? Crudely put, it emphasize in blindly obeying the authority. The emphasis is respect the authority, obey the authority with all our heart. That kind of view, teaching, attitude is flawed. There are times authority need to be challenged. Some inhuman cruel regime, such as Nazi regime, Fascist regime gotta be challenge and topple. Not blindly obey them. It might bring stability to society in foresight, but in hindsight, there's great hidden danger in the teaching of Confucius thinking.</p>
              <p>Jing Kong Dharma Master, a Dharma Master supposedly should uphold Buddhadharma, spread the Dharma, teach the Dharma, set good example to the people, etc. Not teaching flawed teaching such as Confucius thinking, a flawed philosophy. Thats not wat a Dharma Master should do.</p>
              <p>And also, to stress and advocate those Confucius books and Daoism books as entry to Buddhism and foundation to Buddhism, he's insulting Buddhism. 'cause he see Buddhism no up in doing the job as entry to Buddhism, foundation to Buddhism. Its bias of him to do that. Buddhism has got plenty of entry level reading material, books and all that, he dun have to resort to use wai dao books.</p>
