              modern world.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism
              generously provides us with an embarrassment of ethical riches—the precepts,
              the paramitas and brahmaviharas, the Vinaya and Jatakas, the Abhidharma, and
              the path elements of right speech, action, and livelihood. These diverse
              resources offer various forms of ethical guidance, including rules for ethical
              behavior along with accompanying commentary, a catalog of wholesome and
              unwholesome states of mind, lists of virtues along with methods for their
              cultivation, and narrative illustrations of moral conduct. The underlying
              conceptual scheme tying these resources together is simple and clear: our
              thoughts and actions can be deemed either “skillful” or “unskillful” depending
              on whether they assist or hinder better conditions for the future, especially
              for future rebirth or, ideally, an awakening that brings release from the wheel
              of rebirth entirely. This conceptual scheme—whether expressed in terms of the
              arhat ideal of attaining nirvana or the bodhisattva ideal of achieving
              buddhahood for the benefit of all—functions as an effective motivation for
              ethical behavior when rebirth is of genuine existential concern. For many
              contemporary Buddhists, however, rebirth is not a compelling basis for their
              spiritual and moral lives. In the West, even those who accept the possibility
              of rebirth rarely feel that the idea of ending future lives holds deep personal
              meaning for them in the conduct of their daily living.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s
              not so much that the idea of rebirth has been disproved; no strong empirical
              evidence can be mustered either for or against it. It’s that the idea of
              rebirth is swimming against the tide of contemporary materialism and
              naturalism—metaphysical propositions that play an important role as core
              assumptions in science and thus significantly shape our modern cultural
              worldview. These propositions assert that our best knowledge of the world is
              achieved by analyzing phenomena as the outcome of processes of physical
              causation and posit that there’s no world behind or beyond the material world
              of physics, chemistry, and biology. It follows from this that because
              consciousness can be fully accounted for by reducing it to material processes,
              it ceases to exist at death. It’s hard to reconcile rebirth with this outlook,
              which—regardless of whether one consciously accepts or rejects it—is absorbed
              by cultural osmosis into one’s modern sense of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Many
              spiritual seekers—especially in the West, where rebirth has never been widely
              believed—don’t become Buddhists because they want to end the cycle of rebirth;
              they’re motivated by some other inner disquiet. As an experiment, take a moment
              now to check out your own motivation. When was the last time you caught
              yourself thinking, “I’d really like to end rebirth?” More likely what you’ve
              been thinking is “I wish I were happier” or “I wish I were a better person” or
              “What’s the best and most meaningful use I can make of my life?” In other
              words, you’ve been motivated by concerns about this life here and now. While
              “rebirth” can still play a useful role as a metaphor for how one moment
              conditions the next, for many contemporary Buddhists it has lost whatever
              motivational potency it might once have possessed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              a consequence, many modern Buddhists—especially those shaped by the assumptions
              of Western culture—find traditional Buddhist ethics in need of some kind of
              glue to hold it together. Most recent reinterpreters of Buddhism find that glue
              in some version of the Aristotelian notion of eudaimonia, or human
              flourishing—an idea so pervasive in Western culture that Westerners are often
              unaware of its source. Aristotle thought that the telos, or ultimate purpose of
              human life, was to live well and flourish, and his conception of human
              flourishing emphasized developing one’s virtues, behaving ethically toward
              others, and contemplating truth. When transplanted into Buddhism, this Aristotelian
              ideal shifts the end point of Buddhist practice from ending rebirth to living
              the best kind of life one possibly can—a best kind of life that combines
              wisdom, ethics, and contemplation to engender a profound sense of well-being.
              This is a reinterpretation of the Buddhist enlightenment ideal stripped of any
              connection to the framework of rebirth. We might label it eudaimonic
              enlightenment to distinguish it from its more traditional cousins.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              be clear, it isn’t the whole of Aristotelian eudaimonia that gets imported into
              Buddhism but just its general outlines. The fit between eudaimonia in all its
              specificity and Buddhist philosophy isn’t sufficiently harmonious to allow
              wholesale importation of the former. There are notable differences between
              Aristotle’s list of virtues (for example, wittiness and magnanimity) and the
              Buddhist list (compassion and lovingkindness). Aristotle’s wisdom (sophia) is a
              combination of scientific knowledge and critical reason, while Buddhist wisdom
              (prajna) is insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and the absence of
              self-nature. Aristotelian happiness is partly contingent on good fortune,
              whereas Buddhist well-being is largely construed as nonattachment to life’s
              vicissitudes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Furthermore,
              Aristotle saw civic engagement as essential to flourishing, while the Buddha,
              having left his father’s palace never to return, encouraged withdrawal from the
              agora (the marketplace) and the polis (the “city,” the hub of political life).
              As a consequence, Buddhism has remarkably little to say about fairness and
              justice. The Buddha preached a gospel of personal virtue rather than one of
              collective political participation and social action, and although he treated
              persons from all castes equably and abjured violence, he never advocated the
              abolition of the caste system or the disbanding of armies. Early Buddhism took
              a dim view of quotidian existence, urging us to find surcease in a transcendent
              nirvana. The world was inevitably a realm of suffering, and our contemporary
              notion of civic progress, which takes as given that the world is something to
              be improved upon, is one the Buddha never would have recognized.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              modern project of constructing a more socially oriented Buddhism requires our
              importing Western ideas of fairness, liberty, and justice—ideas forged in the
              American and French revolutions, the Paris Commune, and the abolitionist and
              suffragette movements—into a religious tradition that, more often than not,
              historically supported and was supported by the ruling elites of the countries
              in which it flourished. Our modern idea of justice is part of a lengthy
              conversation rooted in Greek philosophy and Hebraic law. This conversation is
              one aspect of the thoroughgoing transformation wrought by modernity, which was
              initiated in the West but which has profoundly impacted Asia over the past two
              centuries. It is a conversation that has inspired Gandhi and Nehru, Mao Zedong
              and Ho Chi Minh, Cory Aquino and Aung San Suu Kyi, Sulak Sivaraksa, and Thich
              Nhat Hanh. The idea of justice is now so deeply a part of our consciousnesses,
              East and West, that we’re hardly aware we’re importing something new into
              Buddhism and in the process subtly changing what it means to be a
              bodhisattva—to work toward the liberation of all beings—in the process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Despite
              the specific differences between Aristotelian and Buddhist conceptions of
              virtue, wisdom, and well-being, the more general Aristotelian notion that a
              life dedicated to the cultivation of virtue and the contemplation of wisdom is
              the best and happiest kind of human life is one that has been readily
              transplanted into Buddhism in a way that resonates deeply with modernity. When
              I attended a public college in the 1960s, its motto was “Let each become all he
              is capable of being,” an Aristotelian sentiment if ever there was one. Modified
              versions of Aristotelian eudaimonia are so deeply embedded in modern humanistic
              and positive psychology that they’ve become part of what passes broadly for
              common sense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              different as they are, Aristotelian and traditional Buddhist ethics are in
              agreement on one thing: the unity of the virtues. Both view each virtue as
              compatible with all the others. For Buddhists, there is no conflict between
              wisdom and compassion. All the paramitas reinforce one another, and each virtue
              requires its companions for complete practice. Similarly, each step of the
              noble eightfold path reinforces every other step, with ethics, wisdom, and
              meditation integrating seamlessly together. That’s why the Buddhist approach is
              sometimes described as holographic, with each practice contained in every
              other. The dharmachakra iconography symbolizes this unity—the eight spokes each
              representing the eight steps of the path, but joined in the middle and
              radiating outward to form a wheel, or circle of wholeness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              ancient Greek tragedians, however, did not hold to this unitary vision. In
              Sophocles’s Antigone, the eponymous heroine is torn between conflicting moral
              obligations to her brother and her king. The king orders her brother’s body to
              remain unburied, but Antigone defies him, placing duty to family above duty to
              king. The tragedians understood that moral dilemmas seldom if ever have perfect
              solutions. Whichever choice Antigone makes is right in one respect and wrong in
              another. As polytheists, the Greek tragedians knew that pleasing Zeus risked
              offending Hera; tragedy was intrinsic to human existence. Zeus implies just
              that in the Iliad when he says, “there is nothing alive more agonized than man
              of all that breathe and crawl across the earth.” Human nobility lay in choosing
              between conflicting ethical imperatives and facing one’s fate with courage and
              equanimity. While sharing a superficial similarity with the Buddha’s first
              noble truth of suffering, this tragic view differs from it in one fundamental
              way: Buddhism is, at its core, an optimistic philosophy that posits the fourth
              noble truth, a path out of suffering. Buddhism claims that it’s possible to
              achieve a state of ultimate well-being and peace. The Greek tragedians
              envisioned no such off-ramp; life could be noble, but it was never unreservedly
              happy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There
              are ways in which our modern outlook is closer to that of the Greek tragedians
              than to that of either Aristotle or the Buddha. For one thing, we live in an
              age when the unity of the good and the virtues seems irretrievably shattered.
              The long-term Western philosophical project of seeking a logical basis for
              ethics—the one best exemplified by the philosophies of Spinoza, Kant, and
              Mill—came to an unsuccessful conclusion, unable to withstand the scrutiny and
              objections of Hume, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard. At the same time, modernity has
              put us cheek by jowl with the wisdom traditions of countless cultures past and
              present, so that we’re acutely aware of the historically conditioned nature of
              our own conception of the good as just one of many possible competing visions.
              Lastly, since the publication of Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents,
              we’ve become increasingly familiar with the conflicts and disjunctions inherent
              in our triune nature as mammalian predators, social animals, and rational
              beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              should come as no surprise, then, that the signature ethical dilemmas of our
              time reflect a conflict and disjunction between differing moral intuitions,
              often a conflict between opposing “rights” or “goods”: a woman’s right to
              control her body versus an embryo’s right to life; a gay person’s right to
              marry versus a fundamentalist’s right to withhold recognition; a rich person’s
              right to property versus a poor person’s right to escape the ills of poverty; a
              pacifist’s conviction that war is never justified versus an interventionist’s
              fear that pacifism abets the triumph of evil.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Each
              party in these intractable disputes believes that his or her own view trumps
              the other’s; no logical arguments can convince the other that any errors exist.
              Each party operates from a separate set of fundamental premises and assumptions
              about the nature of the good and of human flourishing, premises that are
              nonrational at their core and grounded in some mix of sentiment, preference,
              tribal belongings, ideology, and religious revelation. We don’t choose our side
              on strictly logical grounds, just as we don’t fall in love by making lists of
              pros and cons about potential suitors. We owe our allegiances to one camp or
              another based on a set of historical contingencies: what part of the country we
              were born in, what religion we were raised in, which social class we belong to,
              and our unique personal journeys and encounters. When people “convert” from one
              side to another, the conversion, gradual or sudden, is never solely logical in
              nature. Like Paul on the road to Damascus, we have a revelation. Or, often
              enough, it’s not so much that our former beliefs are proved erroneous as that
              we simply move on, jettisoning older beliefs for newer, more useful ones. The
              key point is that ethical disputes—the ones that really trouble us—aren’t
              usually disputes between good and evil; more commonly they are disjunctions
              between rival “goods,” and ultimately there’s no logical basis for their resolution.
              Often enough they reflect cultural dialogues that need to run their historical
              course.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">How
              do these two themes just outlined—the modernist substitution of eudaimonia for
              rebirth, and the acknowledgment of the tension between incompatible and often incommensurable
              goods—affect Buddhist ethics?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Let’s
              consider the first Buddhist precept—the precept against taking life—as a
              paradigmatic case. You and I, no doubt, agree that we’re against killing, at
              least for the most part and as a general principle. We may disagree, however,
              over particulars and specifics. Are we categorically opposed to all killing, or
              do we admit to certain exceptions? Can we use antibiotics to kill
              disease-causing bacteria? Can we use pesticides to kill malaria-carrying
              Anopheles mosquitoes? Can we use lethal force, if necessary, to protect family
              members from rape or murder? Can we defend our country from invaders? Can we
              forcefully intervene to prevent genocide in a foreign land? All of these
              questions pit one good—not acting cruelly—against another—preserving the
              well-being of ourselves and others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              let’s set these potential exceptions aside and focus on why we’re against
              killing, at least in general and for the most part. Are we genuinely fearful of
              rebirth in an animal, hungry ghost, or hell realm? For most modern Westerners,
              the answer is “Probably not,” despite the fact that this has been the
              traditional Buddhist rationale. Are we afraid of the wrath of a monotheistic
              God? For those raised in the Abrahamic faiths, perhaps. Is it because we
              believe in some version of the Golden Rule—Don’t do unto others what you would
              not have them do unto you? Maybe. It’s one of our culture’s more enduring
              ideas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              suspect, however, that our moral and ethical judgments are actually based on a
              multiplicity of contingencies. We’re members of the animal kingdom, and as such
              we have biologically rooted capacities for attachment, befriending, caring,
              shame, social group formation, protectiveness, revulsion, and disgust that are
              the raw materials out of which our moral judgments are formed. Our cultures and
              traditions then mold these proclivities into more or less widely shared notions
              of compassion, fairness, loyalty, purity, respect, and autonomy. Our final
              moral judgments reflect the complex interplay of these biological and social
              factors with our personal faculties of judgment and reason.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Returning
              to the first precept, our moral opposition to killing probably reflects a
              multiplicity of factors: a natural revulsion against the spilling of blood, an
              empathy for others’ pain, rational calculations about fairness and advantage,
              hopes that others will not kill us or our loved ones, fears of shame,
              retribution, and punishment, and decades of familiarity with the teachings of
              our culture and its ethical traditions. If we also happen to be given to moral
              reflection, we’ve cobbled these together as best we can into our own personal
              system, all the while realizing that the result is, at best, a curious mixture
              of reason, practical judgment, intuition, feeling, and instinct. That’s why
              we’re against killing, in general and for the most part, and why we give this
              moral opposition serious weight when considering the circumstances under which
              we might resort to it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Does
              the Buddhist ethical tradition have something important and unique to add to
              this mélange? This is an especially meaningful question for convert Buddhists
              who, having been raised in another tradition, come to Buddhism with their moral
              intuitions already fully formed. Critics like the writer and blogger David
              Chapman suggest that most convert Buddhists simply bypass traditional Buddhist
              ethics altogether, pouring their preexisting liberal secular humanist ethics
              into newer bottles bearing, somewhat disingenuously, a “Buddhist” label. The
              question one might ask is, why bother with Buddhist ethics at all?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              answer to “why bother?” is that Buddhism contains a number of significant
              ethical ideas that still retain their usefulness even after severance from the
              framework of rebirth. The first is the idea of karma, or moral cause and
              effect. According to the rule of karma, we are the authors of our future
              selves, including our future selves in this lifetime: Our thoughts and actions
              mold the person we’re about to become. Our repeated actions and thoughts become
              our habits, and our habits become our character. They shape our perceptions,
              dispositions, and future possibilities. The effects of our actions extend
              through space and time like ripples on a pond, influencing not only our future
              selves but also the others we interact with and our surroundings. If we wish to
              be a certain kind of person and live in a certain kind of world, we need to be
              heedful about the seeds we cultivate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Karma
              and dependent origination constitute Buddhism’s earliest formulations of
              causality. Later Buddhist thinkers elaborated on these concepts to develop the
              Mahayana idea of the mutual interdependence of all dharmas, or phenomena, and
              the Huayan idea of their interpenetration. These elaborations enabled East
              Asian Buddhists to place a more positive spin on interconnectivity. Initially,
              the idea that dharmas lacked self-nature was offered as one more reason not to
              cling to them. Later, the idea that things were mutually interdependent gave
              phenomena a positive value as indispensable jewels in Indra’s web. This
              positive version of interconnectivity resonates with both 19th-century Western
              Romanticism and 20th century ecological science, and as a consequence is widely
              endorsed by Buddhist modernists of all stripes. Its view that “we’re all in the
              stew together,” partners in the seamless fabric of existence, has profound
              ethical implications. Many of our most intractable ethical dilemmas are the
              result of our cultural denial of or obliviousness to the reality of
              interconnectivity, including the terrible damage we’re inflicting on our
              biosphere and the schisms that tragically divide ethnicities, social classes,
              religions, and regions. The Buddhist view of interdependence affects ethical
              considerations, as we replace considerations of how our actions affect “the
              other” with a more radical awareness that there is no other. While some
              moralities distinguish between in-groups to whom we owe duties and out-groups
              to whom we do not, Buddhist interconnectivity denies the existence of out-groups.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If
              the law of karma tells us that we must act a certain way if we wish to become a
              certain kind of person, the Buddhist enlightenment ideal defines that kind of
              person we wish to become. As Buddhists, we intend to “develop” or “uncover” a
              more enlightened way of being. Even though differing strands of traditionalist
              and modernist Buddhism disagree on enlightenment’s precise characterization,
              there is an unforced consensus concerning some of its key elements:
              non-clinging, non-harming, non-hatred, non-greed, compassion, lovingkindness,
              equanimity, sympathetic joy, insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, the
              absence of self-nature, and a less self-preoccupied, more fluid and
              interconnected sense of ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If
              we combine moral cause and effect with the end goal of eudaimonic enlightened
              being, we have a motivation for ethical behavior that both is compatible with
              modernity and adds something to ethics above and beyond the Golden Rule.
              Returning to our discussion of the first precept, killing moves us away from
              the kind of person we wish to be. Killing reinforces our greed and hatred and
              diminishes our compassion. Killing feeds the delusion that we are separate from
              others. It hardens and coarsens us. Killing triggers recursive spirals of
              retribution and unintended consequences that diminish the odds of experiencing
              well-being for ourselves and others. The basic Buddhist injunctions against
              killing, stealing, lying, sexual misbehavior, and heedless intoxication are all
              aids to move us further along the path toward enlightenment. They’re vehicles
              for developing character and planting the seeds of future wellbeing. The flip
              side to this understanding is that breaking the precepts is not so much a
              matter of breaking deontological “rules” as it is a matter of breaking our
              deepest commitments to being the kind of person we intend to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              Buddhists, we also bring to the table a traditional distrust of fixed views,
              along with an attitude of open inquiry that aims at preventing our thoughts
              from becoming stuck in stale and rigid categories. We’re always attempting to
              listen freshly to our own experience and to other voices as well, always
              willing to learn and change, always interested in discovering what being moral
              means in this particular moment and situation. While we affirm the values of
              enlightenment, we’ve learned to distrust the conceptions we construct
              surrounding it. We understand that every specific ethical dilemma, if properly
              attended to, reveals a greater degree of intricate complexity than any rule can
              possibly allow for.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              also realize that in setting up any ideal, we introduce certain dangers: the
              danger that we’ll delude ourselves, pretending that we’re further along the
              path than we are; the danger that we’ll deny, repress, minimize, project, or
              otherwise underestimate our persistent natures as predatory, competitive,
              territorial, dominance-seeking, and sexual animals; the danger that we’ll
              develop an aversion to those parts of ourselves that fall short of the ideal or
              disparage or punish others who seem to us to fall short. Every ideal also
              creates tensions between being and becoming, between moving toward the ideal
              and realizing that the ideal has been, in some way, manifest all along. It also
              creates tensions between aspirations to a kind of purity and aspirations toward
              wholeness and integration. The dangers are real, but ethics always involves
              establishing some ideal, whether it’s one of enlightenment, holiness, or simply
              civility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To
              what degree does this modernist Buddhist ethics with its moral cause and
              effect, interconnectivity, eudaimonic enlightenment, acknowledgment of rival
              incommensurate goods, and suspicion of rigid, inflexible rules help
              us—especially convert Buddhists—in resolving our everyday ethical dilemmas? The
              answer is that it only helps a little. We still have all the biological,
              cultural, and rational considerations that shaped our everyday moral intuitions
              before we became Buddhists. Added to those considerations, however, we now also
              have an ideal we’ve established with the ultimate goal of helping ourselves and
              others achieve a Buddhist kind of well-being—a virtuous life consistent with
              Buddhist principles that speak to our modern lived experience—along with the
              knowledge that if we are ever to approach that goal, our actions need to be
              concordant with it. It’s one more consideration, a thumb on the scale that
              informs our decisions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Let’s
              return once more to our paradigmatic first precept against killing. Despite our
              moral objection to killing, it’s still an issue that arises for us again and
              again, requiring us to make real choices. Should we be vegetarians? Should
              abortion or assisted suicide be legalized? Should we pay taxes that support the
              military? Should we put ailing, suffering pets to sleep? Should we slap at the
              fly that’s annoying us as we sit trying to meditate?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              fixed rule-based approach to the first precept would tell us that killing is
              categorically wrong in each and every circumstance. On the other hand, a
              morality based on our desire to move toward a more enlightened way of being
              would, it seems to me, be more nuanced. An enlightened being’s prime concern
              would be the reduction of another’s suffering as best as one could determine
              how to accomplish it, using all of one’s experience, empathy, respect, reason,
              and judgment, along with an awareness of possible shadow motivations and
              unintended consequences—in other words, a melding of Aristotelian practical
              judgment with Buddhist mindfulness and discernment. It requires that when we
              decide to cause a certain degree of harm in the pursuit of what we discern to
              be the wisest good, that we do so with full awareness—without minimization or
              disengagement—of the extent of the suffering we’re about to become the cause
              of. It requires that we listen fully and openly to each moment as it speaks to
              us in all of its intricate complexity. Like the famed Zen monk who carries the
              young woman across the stream in violation of the Vinaya rules, it sometimes
              involves breaking one precept to honor another. It recognizes precepts as koans
              rather than inviolate rules, and that we must struggle with them as Jacob
              wrestled with his angel, discerning what each moment calls for as we continue
              our endless journey toward an enlightenment we only dimly understand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some
              traditionalists might contend that this modernist ethics fails the test of
              being authentically Buddhist. That is an argument that closes the door on those
              unable to believe in rebirth, leaving them out of the fold. I would argue,
              instead, that the coexistence of a plurality of Buddhisms—both traditionalist
              and modern—is evidence of Buddhism’s vibrant health, offering different dharma
              doors for people with diverse needs. Just as genetic diversity is healthy for
              breeding populations, ideological diversity helps Buddhism thrive through the
              cross-fertilization of ideas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Let’s
              not forget that many of today’s traditional Buddhisms are themselves the
              product of ongoing dialogues with neighboring traditions: East Asian Buddhism
              with Confucianism and Daoism; Tibetan Buddhism with Bon; Japanese Buddhism with
              kami worship; and Indian Mahayana with emerging forms of Hindu and Tantric
              practice. History teaches us that religions are ever-developing traditions
              rather than the final, complete, unalterable word of their originators—traditions
              that endure or wither according to their ability to address the vital concerns
              of particular times and places. As religions adapt to conditions, some
              practitioners argue for the continued relevance of venerable ideas, while
              others reformulate them to meet the exigencies of the moment. Religions that
              endure successfully manage the tension between these extremes. The foremost
              principle of Buddhism is that everything changes. It is a law that governs
              Buddhism, too.</span></p>
