              perhaps the longest-lived institution in world history. It has diffused across
              time and space over a period of more than 2,500 years. It has traversed the
              globe through diverse, culturally adaptable communities that betray a clear (if
              not always successful) attempt to maintain continuity with traditions
              transmitted millennia ago. More Vinaya lineages and doctrinal schools have died
              out than those that are extant, but the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana have
              all survived in some form or another. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>Like so many religious
              traditions, the greatest threat to one of these vehicles, the Theravada, comes
              from within. Theravada Buddhism as a whole is facing nothing less than a
              crisis, and it is critical to study how solutions can be mobilized. Already in
              South and Southeast Asia, serious questions about the Theravada sangha’s moral
              and social authority are being debated.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>This dramatic
              assertion comes from none other than the British Theravada monk Ajahn Brahm and
              Indologist Richard Gombrich, who came to The University of Hong Kong to share a
              dialogue about this issue on 11 March. They come from fundamentally different
              positions—a non-Buddhist who is still pro-Buddhist, Gombrich believes that
              there is no longer any significant difference between monks and laypeople in
              their potential to be ethical and liberated. Ajahn Brahm still believes that
              monasticism provides a vehicle for inspiration and moral restraint, and offers
              more potential for meditators to achieve the <em>dhyanas</em> (with which
              Gombrich disagrees). However, both agree that there are three major problems
              plaguing the sangha: nationalism, sexism, and a lack of education in critical
              thinking. These problems all contribute to a long-term malaise in
              Theravada-dominated countries: self-inflicted irrelevance.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>Nationalism arose
              across Asia as one of the strongest ideological weapons against European
              imperialism in the previous three centuries. But this was a poisoned chalice,
              for defining a national identity against European colonizers required the exclusion
              of others that didn’t fit this identity. As a result, there are few sanghas in
              countries dominated by Theravada Buddhists that aren’t somehow involved in
              legitimizing nationalism and racism. The most prominent victims of these
              campaigns have been the Tamils of Sri Lanka and the Muslim minorities of
              Thailand and Myanmar. Gombrich observes drily that many monks in Myanmar and
              Thailand distrust even each other, and do not accept the other’s lineage as
              being legitimate. Where the sangha is involved in violence, there will be a
              slow but sure decline in trust invested by laypeople, especially now that these
              local incidents are broadcast around the world via satellite and the Internet. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>Gender discrimination
              is taken for granted in conservative sangha circles, particularly in Thailand,
              which has been the epicenter of several high-profile scandals and fissures
              between higher authorities and liberal-minded monks. Ajahn Brahm has been a
              prominent player in this debate: “Theravada needs more women to literally save
              its life. Some say that the Buddha warned his dispensation would be shortened
              to 500 years with women’s involvement [<em>Cullavagga</em> X]. I say that without
              women, Buddhism might not last more than 50,” he declares. But at least in
              Thailand, the problem is even more deeply rooted. The “institutionalized phobia
              of women” is extreme, Gombrich observes, as monks are forbidden to touch even
              female infants or animals, and cannot accept gifts from the hands of women. As
              more women demand participation and say in the Buddhist religion, these customs
              seem ever more outdated and in urgent need of a rethink.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>The third factor, a
              lack of critical thinking, is fatal because it cripples the capacity to ask
              questions about the casual indulgence of nationalism and sexism, and the
              breaking of Vinaya rules. Traditionally the sangha has been the sole preserver
              of Buddhist knowledge, and therefore the source of authority and guidance. But
              it has lost this exclusive role of preservation thanks to the democratizing
              powers of the Internet, universities, and private organizations digitizing the
              Buddhist texts for posterity. The sangha, as a whole, needs to reconfigure its
              relationship to wider society so that it can continue to be a relevant example
              and respected custodian of the Buddha’s teachings. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>Thinking of solutions
              is not easy, but the spirit behind them is simple: the sangha needs to embrace
              opportunities to be more educated. It needs to come to terms with what
              contemporary people expect monks and nuns to be. “It is not bad karma to
              criticize monks, which for some reason is a common excuse to silence
              complaints,” says Ajahn Brahm. Criticism from laypeople has always kept the
              monks in check because if the monks continued to behave badly, the lay donors
              of the day—merchants, caravan traders, kings, housewives—simply withdrew their
              support. The Vinaya was created <em>because</em> of laypeople that complained
              about badly behaved monks.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>To address the problem
              of sexism and institutional gynophobia, Ajahn Brahm suggests that monks start
              studying why Buddhist societies with a high ratio of female monastic
              participation are flourishing: Taiwan, for example. Furthermore, Thai monks
              should look to the nuns in northern Thailand for exemplary models of practice.
              Although excluded and discriminated against by the official Buddhist hierarchy,
              their communities revere them because of their simplicity and austere
              lifestyle. Their pure ideals, true to the Buddha’s original vision of the
              mendicant life, will eventually embarrass their critics into meeting their
              standards.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>In terms of education,
              monastic institutions should isolate and identify virtues that teachers think
              novices should cultivate: open-mindedness, intellectual honesty, restraint,
              meditative calm—and structure the curriculum around the pursuit of those
              virtues. Gombrich suggests travel as a solution, although it is difficult to
              implement for all monks: “All monks should spend a year in a culturally
              different country with an institutionally different monastery,” he declares.
              These foreign exchanges mean radical exposure to different cultures and would
              open the worlds of young Theravada monks. Again, this is only a start, but more
              contact with people of other religions and life choices in safe, controlled
              environments might also give them a more international, cosmopolitan
              understanding of monastic identity. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 18pt;">The Theravada sangha is in crisis around the world, but
              from crisis comes opportunity. Regeneration and reformation are a continuous
              process: the sangha will never be completely pure, and problems will never be
              fully resolved. But this is not an excuse for not trying something. For the
              sake of public trust in the relevance of the most enduring institution in
              history, we must try </span><em style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 18pt;">something</em><span style="color: #4b4b4b; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.5pt; letter-spacing: 0.65pt; line-height: 18pt;">.</span></p>
