            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>WHAT IS ***NOT*** THE EMPTINESS?</strong><br>Most of us have two kinds of misunderstandings about emptiness, First kind: we acknowledge that emptiness is Â“Voidness of absenceÂ”, Second kind: we acknowledge that emptiness is Â“Voidness of annihilationÂ”.<br><br><strong>WHAT is Â“Voidness of absenceÂ”?</strong><br>For example, somebody says Â“Hi, look! That house is emptyÂ”, or Â“That is a empty houseÂ”, the meaning of his words, is that nothing is in the house or nobody is living in the house, does not mean the house is not existent. When we say Â“That bookshelf is emptyÂ”, it dose not mean the bookshelf itself is not existent, the only meaning of those words is that nothing is on the bookshelf. This is called Â“Voidness of absenceÂ”. This is not the emptiness of MahayanaÂ’s doctrine.<br><br>Â“Voidness of absenceÂ”, is a erroneous and false emptiness, does not mean the emptiness of the thing itself. The religious world and the philosophical history are holding the positive way of looking at the Â“Voidness of absenceÂ” very popularly. In India, the Sankara of Advaita-Vedanta is a good sample of Â“Vodiness of absenceÂ”.</blockquote>When we speak of emptiness, we are talking about emptiness of inherent existence, not Nihilism. Why are there so many things in the world? Because your mind seperates things, creates identities, creates a notion of Self, and varying concepts and perceptions. Everything originates from Interdependance, so where is the "self"? Attachment to the world causes illusions, because you mistake your own conceptual thinking as the ultimate reality.<br><br>I feel there is really nothing to discuss about emptiness...<br><br><blockquote>To Vimalakirti and the Mahayanists, emptiness is absolute. Even though it cannot be discussed absolutely, it exists as such. Vimalakirti uses enigmatic phrases to show, not only that the words of Manjushri are empty, but that his own are, as well.</blockquote>Start practicing and you will naturally realise the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not going to speak about the arhat eye or the bodhisattva eye. I will speak directly about the Buddha eye. It is really quite simple. The Buddha sees everything as emptiness. This does not mean that he sees nothing when he looks at something or someone. It means that he sees the empty nature of the things he sees. Levels below the Buddha can see emptiness also, but emptiness is experienced like air in a box. It takes the shape of the container. There is still separateness. For the Buddha, according to this analogy, air is everywhere, and it is not segmented. Even the bodhisattva, who has the dharma eye, does not see in this way. Only when you reach Buddhahood, do you see with unobstructed limitlessness.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Have you ever seen a ghost or a god? Normally people can't see things that are too far, near, big, or small. But some people borrow the power of a ghost or other spiritual being, and gain spiritual vision. There are also cases of heavenly beings who are born into the human realm, who still retain some ability to see ghosts and spirits in the realms below. They can no longer see into the heavenly realm, nor can they see ghosts and spirits in the human realm.<br><br>I had a student who came here for a beginner's class. She claimed to have some psychic power. She said that when she was well-concentrated, she could see into people's past, but I had my doubts. I asked her if she could see into my past. I have heavy karmic obstructions, which have their root in past lives, but still she could see nothing of my past. Why? People are not always reborn into the human realm. They might be born into a distant world, and ordinary psychic power would be too limited to see that far. It would be similar to a person who commits a crime in Taiwan and moves to New York. The New York police would have no record of the crime.<br><br>The ghostly or deva eye stands at a level between the fleshy and heavenly eyes. This phenomenon occurs when a spiritual being uses the eye of a human being as a medium. People who have experienced this believe that they have been endowed with great spiritual powers, but it is really the power of the spiritual being at work. There is a book about a spirit called Seth who used a woman's body to talk to people in this world. He could only talk through her.<br><br>I have a Dharma brother who has such powers. He was once sitting on a train, and suddenly he saw all the people sitting around him as pigs and dogs and other animals. He could see the changes that these people went through in various past lives, but he could see no further. This is not really his power, but that of a spiritual being working through him. I asked him if he could see such things with his eyes closed, and he answered no, but there are people who have such powers.<br><br>In the sutra Buddha talks about a disciple, Anirudha. He is a good example of someone who developed the heavenly eye. He practiced very hard. He sat for days with his eyes open, and he never slept. Eventually, he went blind from keeping his eyes open. The Buddha went to visit him and told him not to worry. He said that the fleshy eye is of little use anyway, and there are better eyes to acquire. The Buddha explained to Anirudha how to practice, and in a short time he had the heavenly eye. As he penetrated deeper into dhyana, his vision became truly vast.<br><br>Those who are born in the realm of desire with the heavenly eye, because of their previous good karma, are always born in heavenly realms. Those born as humans in the realm of form, must obtain the heavenly eye through meditation. Normally, human beings cannot see ghosts, and the ghosts that are here cannot see us. The more powerful beings in the heavenly realms can see us, but spiritual beings here cannot. They can sense our existence, but they can't tell exactly where we are. Only by borrowing an earthly eye can they see more accurately. An English psychologist who was able to leave his body reported seeing just this sort of thing; he saw ghosts and humans, but they could not see each other.<br><br>The heavenly eye can observe all manner of beings in the realm of form: animals, humans, ghosts, spirits, heavenly beings. This eye can see into the past and future for 500 to 1000 lives. But looking into the past and looking into the future are two distinct psychic powers. In the six heavenly realms, the lower realms cannot see into the realms above them. Why? Because the body becomes more and more subtle as you ascend into these realms. A being in the highest heavenly realm can see throughout his realm and all the realms below. Such a being can see us and know us as if we were specks in the palm of his hand.<br><br>Common people cannot really understand this heavenly eye. It has to be experienced. Sometimes someone in Canada might be able to see what's going on in the United States, or someone in United States can see things in Hong Kong. This is not the heavenly eye at all. It is still the ghost, or spiritual eye. The heavenly eye, within its realm, knows what is going on in all places at all times.</blockquote></div>
