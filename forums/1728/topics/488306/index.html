                  marketing of consumer goods from vitamin supplements to cars and iPhones. But,
                  until now, happiness itself was elusive by definition. “To be happy, a man must
                  first know what happiness is,” said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of the
                  philosophers who, 250 years ago, started a debate on the nature and use of
                  happiness that has not ceased.</span></p>

                  color:#333333'>Happiness has been key to considerations of capitalism ever
                  since, in the 19th century, it was first shown that happy workers were more
                  productive. But the promise of the work done by peering into Matthieu Ricard’s
                  brain is that Rousseau’s stipulation is becoming irrelevant. Happiness is no
                  longer an unknown continent. Soon neuroscience and psychology, in alliance with
                  social economics, will have located happiness, defined and measured it. And
                  then, happiness can be sold.</span></p>

                  political scientist Will Davies explains in a forceful new book,<span> </span><em>The Happiness Industry</em><span> </span>– has been money. The value of an
                  object is determined by how much people are prepared to pay for it. The
                  unpleasantness of a job – grave-digging or rubbish collection – can be measured
                  in how much people need to be paid per hour to do it. Governments use these
                  “happiness-measuring” principles.</span></p>

                  used to help calculate Exxon’s ultimate fine. The neo-liberal economists who
                  have driven conservative political philosophy for 50 years like the simplicity
                  of reducing human feeling to monetary considerations. But the method was clumsy
                  when used to measure abstractions such as emotion. However, with the rise of
                  the science of behavioural psychology, another tool came forward. Economists,
                  anthropologists and psychologists joined forces in the 1990s, spurred on by the
                  interest of business and politics.</span></p>

                  Kahneman’s research had him at one point measuring the fluctuating emotions of
                  patients having cameras inserted through their anuses into their colons. But
                  his findings appeared to say elemental things about the human condition – not
                  least that people are more motivated by fear of financial loss than by the
                  possibility of financial gain, to the extent that they will behave highly
                  illogically. Most of us, for example, would rather forgo a pay rise if our
                  colleagues are going to get more than us.</span></p>

                  color:#333333'>This sort of insight made politicians and business people sit up
                  and take notice – and make friends with the new “psycho- economists”. Richard
                  Layard, a British social economist and associate of Kahneman, found himself at
                  the top table of Britain’s New Labour government when it took power in 1997.
                  The press gave him the title Happiness Tsar, and his 2005 book,<span> </span><em>Happiness – Lessons from a New
                  Science</em>, remains a hugely influential international bestseller. Lord
                  Layard can claim, more than most social scientists, to have actually changed
                  government policy. His work on the economics of mental health led him to
                  contend that modern depressive illnesses were more of a burden to the state
                  than unemployment. Layard’s “business case” for a new approach was the engine
                  behind the Labour government’s decision in 2008 to devote huge resources to
                  tackling depression through new “positive psychology”, such as<span> </span><a style="cursor:pointer;

                  color:#333333'>Since the early 1970s social economists have discussed the
                  curious relationship between wealth and happiness. The<span> </span><a style="cursor:pointer;

                  while the rich are happier than the poor within a country, there’s no evidence
                  that the overall happiness of rich countries is greater than that of poor ones.
                  Layard and his colleagues’ analysis took this further – in fact, there seemed
                  to be a wealth ceiling: he put it at around US$25,000, 10 years ago. Above it
                  increasing wealth showed diminishing returns – getting richer does not make
                  people significantly happier. According to more recent research, above
                  US$75,000 (£48,000) per annum, there’s almost no happiness benefit at all. The
                  policy implications of that insight were huge, especially in a world that was
                  beginning to worry about the social divisiveness of widening inequality.</span></p>

                  Layard and Ricard on the social benefits of “mindfulness” – self- regulated
                  happiness – and measurements of subjective happiness have not leapt to address
                  superfluous wealth and its proven failure to make even the wealthy happy.
                  Certainly, in the unhappiest rich countries, like the US and the UK, taxes on
                  the rich have tended to go down, not up.</span></p>

                  color:#333333'>It’s a failure of which Lord Layard is conscious. “Getting public
                  policy to focus on making people happy is an ongoing task. We do have quite
                  powerful evidence that people vote on how satisfied they are with their lives,
                  rather than on the growth in their income. So we may begin to see some shift.”
                  His greatest disappointment, though, is that there has been no shift yet in the
                  way we judge success. “There’s a very interesting contest going in our society
                  between the macho culture that puts more and more pressure on people to compete
                  to get the better of each other, versus the ‘wellbeing’ movement where people
                  get satisfaction from what they contribute to other people. To change that
                  assumption that that is how life has to be, and state instead that life is
                  about happiness: that is a core problem.” Would he welcome a future where
                  science has succeeded in wholly measuring and defining happiness? “I think that
                  would be wonderful, so long as it doesn’t stop people living spontaneously. You
                  don’t want to be checking your happiness watch all the time.”</span></p>

                  watches, and the like, are not so far off. Last year’s headline-grabbing tech
                  gadgetry was wearable fitness and health monitors, delivering data direct to
                  smartphones. This year gadgets are probing the borders of happiness itself with
                  technology looking at the brain. The Muse – $299 in the US, £238 in the UK – is
                  already on the market: a sensor-laden headband that syncs data to a phone app.
                  It promises to monitor your brain’s neuron activity and so “improve emotional
                  state” by training your brain in empathy and composure. This year’s big launch

                  a device that promises to “use neurosignalling to shift your state of mind in a
                  matter of minutes”. Although no one yet knows what the technology is (all the
                  company will say is that it intends to “couple energy waveforms to neural
                  structures”) or even on what body part you’ll wear it, the Thync has already
                  won a “cool gadget of the year” award. It will be sold under the slogan
                  “Conquer life!” “Our anxiety is their revenue opportunity,” says Davies.</span></p>

                  promises about our health and happiness. But there is a new element to this
                  modern snake oil: it comes with a very exciting secondary revenue stream. Now
                  your smart bike or your wrist-worn health monitor is set by default to collect
                  your data and sell it. The mining, processing and selling of mass data is the
                  trade of the 21st century. Already it is possible for advertisers to access
                  data that pertains to mood – Google, notoriously, can offer to target ads to
                  women who are currently ovulating, a time when significant numbers of them are
                  more likely to buy clothes, make-up or perfume. The information is gathered by
                  tracking the monthly rhythms of their past purchases. Facebook has already
                  conducted experiments in manipulating the emotions of its users en masse.</span></p>

                  color:#333333'>As neurology comes closer to identifying what’s already called
                  the “buy button” in our brains, mass-data harvesting finds out who to target at
                  a time when they are most likely to be in a shopping mood. Meanwhile, marketers
                  use happiness economics and psychology to find the best way to pitch the item
                  to maximise our desires to increase our wellbeing. Is it paranoid to see these
                  developments as a threat to personal privacy – and even to our status as free
                  and individual humans? Has happiness economics created a monster? Have
                  corporates used these new sciences to “capture the misery of working people,”
                  as Davies puts it, to turn more profit?</span></p>

                  drive to monetise happiness, a trade made possible not least by his own work.
                  He bristled. “I cannot see a risk. If companies understood better how to help
                  people be happy that would be a very good thing,” he said. But he did concede
                  that there was a problem if corporates exploited the flaw in our
                  pleasure-seeking instincts that makes us grab instant satisfaction.</span></p>

                  thinks that the likes of Lord Layard have already lost control of the monster
                  they have unleashed. What he calls the “neuroeconomic prejudice” will ensure
                  that the mathematical, mechanised view of the mind will triumph, simply because
                  of the financial rewards of an objectively defined happiness. “Positive
                  psychologists and happiness economists,” he writes, “make a great play of the
                  fact that money and material possessions don’t lead to an increase in our
                  mental wellbeing. But these experts are in a minority, compared with the vast
                  assemblage of consumer psychologists, consumer neuroscientists and market
                  researchers all dedicated to ensuring that we do achieve some degree of
                  emotional satisfaction by spending money.”</span></p>

                  wave activity in the left prefrontal cortex, or a moral decision spurred by an
                  oxytocin surge, is when something elementally mysterious in humans becomes a
                  mere mechanism, like the workings of the heart or bladder. Already many
                  emotions have been “medicalised” – not, some who work in the field say, in
                  order to help patients, but to sell drugs. Many writers in the field see the
                  mystery of happiness as something that must be preserved, like the Green Belt
                  or the pristine Antarctic.</span></p>

                  unhappiness in urban Britain. He fears that techniques espoused by the
                  happiness economists risk reducing human experience and the mind to the
                  mechanical, all for reasons of political expediency. “By definition, each
                  person’s experience – and the meaning they derive from it – is unique.
                  Psychology, mindfulness and pharmaceuticals can all potentially be helpful, if
                  this is kept in mind. But if you use these things to deny or suppress the ups
                  and downs of normal life experience – which includes things like anxiety and
                  depression – you store up all sorts of trouble.” The result, he warns, could be
                  a “covert cultural brainwashing”. “We may conjure up a much deeper anxiety
                  about what inevitably becomes seen as ‘the irrational and alien’, both within
                  us, and between ourselves and others. History makes us painfully aware that
                  this is where totalitarianism gets a foothold.”</span></p>

                  understand how humans flourish has become, he writes, “a route to sell people
                  stuff they don’t need, work harder for managers who don’t respect them and
                  conform to policy objectives over which they have no say.”</span></p>

                  The forces that want to box it and sell it are the most powerful humanity has
                  ever known. But there is one protest left to us. It comes from one of the 20th
                  century’s greatest pleasure-seekers, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire: “Now and
                  then,” he advised, “it’s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be
                  happy.” That’s worth a T-shirt.</span></p>
