            <div class='col-md body'>All there is are actually the all-pervading Presence. Our sense of self (ego) is actually attentions focused (very rapidly) on many layers of  thoughts and sensations. This is the matrix.<br><br>The layers are as follows:<br><br>Physical layer- attention/belief put to physical sensations(thought)<br><br>Mental layer- attention to mental thoughts<br><br>Emotional layer- cause by judging the mental thoughts<br><br>In addition, there is a storehouse where all images/belief of oneself is stored.<br><br>For example: we may have this image:<br><br>'I am smart.'<br><br>If the external world validates that this is true, the person feels happy.<br>If the external world appears to show that he is not, then he will not be happy and thus suffer.<br><br>Actually in the 'external world' nothing real happens, the response is totally within the person's mind.<br><br>Beyond the encasement of all these layers of thoughts and sensation is just Pure consciousness/Presence. Actually everything is the Pure consciousness. It is just that many rapid attentions to thoughts and sensation create the sense of self.</div>

The ecstasy and joy of lower jhanas which you have experienced in your younger days and described to me, will eventually fade as one enters a higher level of absorption.<br><br>8 Levels of Jhanas:<br><br>1st - investigation (vitarka), analysis (vicara), joy, bliss, one-pointedness<br>2nd - joy, bliss, one-pointedness, (inner purity, or internal clarity)<br>3rd - bliss, one-pointedness,(equanimity, mindfulness, insight)<br>4th - one-pointedness; (completely pure equanimity, mindfulness,<br>neither pleasure nor pain.)<br><strong>5. Fifth Jhana: jhana of boundless space (anantakasa).<br>6. Sixth Jhana: jhana of pure expansive consciousness (vinnana).<br>7. Seventh Jhana: jhana of pure emptiness (akinci, lit. "nothingness" )<br>8. Eighth Jhana: jhana beyond perception and nonperception (nevasannanasanna)</strong><br><br>Nevertheless no levels of absorption whether form or formless are ultimate. All these mystic states are created and conditioned by the mind. They are impermanent and still within the sphere of mundane realities. Buddha had abandoned 2 of his teachers who taught him how to attain the 7th and 8th Jhana, because it did not lead him to enlightenment.<br><br>At best such a practitioner of formless jhana, at the point of death, abiding in absorption becomes reborned in the jhanic realms of formlessness, and exist for uncountable kalpas of years. However he has not ended his cycle of rebirth, and subtle defilements of the mind may one day arise and cause him to fall even possibly into the 3 lower realms (hell, ghosts, animals).<br></div>

Complete clarity and Presence without a 'Self' is more crucial. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The 'Self' that is created over countless lives of attachment cannot be underestimated.<br>We are in almost helpless bondage that our perceptions are shaped and held in a sort<br>of hypnosis that we feel, think, experience and deduced our understandings from the<br>perspective of an 'I'.  Thus analytical understanding derived from the glimpse of<br>the Pure Presence Reality will very quickly get distorted.<br><br>When Presence is experienced with the six sense doors shut,<br>Presence is experienced as a form of "I AMness".<br><br>When Presence is experience with six sense doors widely open,<br>Presence is experienced as a form of "I AM All".<br><br>However neither experience tells us the TRUE NATURE of Pure Presence.<br>Even the very sense of Realness, of Existence, of Life and Vividness is so strong,<br>due to the sense of 'I' there will be a sense of location somewhere,<br>and the true face of Pure Presence remains hidden.<br><br>The mind is just not used to knowing the absolutely nothing, non-local,<br>nowhere to be found yet pure, brillance bright and ever luminious.<br>It will locate, it will find, it will grasp.<br>There must come a time for the mind to let go of itself completely.<br>If we are bold enough to let go and enter into the world that is wordless,<br>labelless and thoughtless, and if this is substained, wisdom and insight will arise.<br>This wisdom is the extraordinary Clarity, Vividness and Realness, wholeness whole.<br>It is crystal clear filling all spaces and places.<br>Both in silence and in noise, in blankness and somethingness.<br>Those that experience the Pure Presence will appreciate this crystal clear reality.<br>This re-visting of Pure Presence will be thorough and entire.<br>There will be no doubt.<br><br>Buddhism Emptiness is deep and profound.  Do go into it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Happy Journey<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Thusness,<br><br>Your message feels of truth. Thanks for it. I will do as you advice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway it's good to take Thusness's advise as it contains wisdom. That is more trustworthy than my words.<br><br>I am wisdomless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But here's my [conceptual] understanding:<br><br>Buddha Nature = Rigpa = Luminosity + Emptiness.<br><br>You have realised your "Luminosity" aspect of the Rigpa, but Luminosity and Emptiness is inseperable. To realise the True Nature one must also realise Emptiness.</div>
