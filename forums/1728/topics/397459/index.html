              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Have you ever looked
               at a statue of a buddha and wondered what is going on in his mind? I 
              know I have. If you are like me you might think that he is sitting there
               in a state of unimaginable ecstasy and that his mind is completely 
              blank, with no thoughts appearing at all.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Well, it struck me 
              one day that that is not what is happening at all. What that statue 
              represents is freedom. The buddha sitting in that position knows without
               doubt that he is free. He couldn't care less what is arising in his 
              body, mind or external environment. There may be a maelstrom going on in
               there but he knows his essential nature of aware freedom and he is at 
              rest. That is what meditation is.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">I used to be a 
              meditator. I sat for an average of six hours a day, and up to eight or 
              ten, for several months at a time on and off for several years. My 
              meditation was to try to just let everything be as it is. But at the 
              time I did not really have a proper understanding of what that actually 
              means. There was always a subtle belief that by letting everything be as
               it is I would get into a nice state, be it bliss, peace, no thoughts, 
              silence, I did not fully realize what the true purpose of letting 
              everything be as it is in meditation was.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">All of those states 
              can and will happen. They may be nice but, big deal. It is not helpful 
              for coming to know freedom. In fact, desiring a state or using any kind 
              of control, like watching the breath, is counterproductive for that 
              purpose. Why? Because freedom is not a state and is not dependent on 
              states, any stateâ€”not silence, no thinking or bliss. If it was dependent
               on anything, it wouldn't be freedom. Freedom means free in the midst of
               anything at all.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">So then, what is the
               proper and most advantageous use of meditation? Well, if you are after 
              an experience of bliss or peace, which will inevitably pass, then 
              meditating for that reason is fine and will work. Focusing on the 
              breath, or visualizing or doing a mantra are very good ways to achieve 
              bliss or a peaceful mind. But very shortly after you get off the cushion
               those states will be gone, especially when something unwanted happens. 
              Of course they will, they are states and all states pass, without 
              exception. But if you are interested in coming to know freedom then a 
              different approach is called for.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">I would say that the
               best purpose of meditation is to come to know your essential freedom. 
              The way that can happen is by coming to know the presence of awareness 
              no matter what is appearing. To do that you just let everything be 
              exactly as it is and don't try to manipulate your experience at all. It 
              is best to just sit there, let your mind do whatever it does, and 
              recognize that you are aware as often as you do naturally. Get lost a 
              million times, no problem. At first it may seem that there is either the
               presence of awareness or you are lost in thought. So it seems like you 
              are going back and forth between them, mostly lost in thought. You may 
              be "aware" for a few seconds and then lost in thought for ten minutes, 
              or an hour, and back and forth.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">What will start to 
              happen, more and more, is that while a thought is appearing, at the same
               time, you will experience the presence of awareness, or you notice that
               awareness is present, that you are aware. So, awareness is present in 
              and through the thought, and not either or. It is fine if you experience
               it at first as either one or the other, awareness or thought. This 
              takes some time to get acquainted with, for sure. But with repeated 
              practice you will, first, start to recognize awareness more and more 
              often, and then you will begin to recognize awareness and thoughts 
              simultaneously. And this has enormous value. This is when you start to 
              recognize your inherent freedom.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Normally in life, 
              when strong thoughts or emotions arise we, seemingly, lose our awareness
               and react blindly based on the appearanceâ€”we react out of ignorance of 
              our essential  aware nature. But what begins to happen more and more is 
              that, because you recognize your essential  aware nature while strong 
              thoughts and emotions occur in meditation, you will also recognize the 
              same in normal life. When we come to know freedom during the arising of 
              thoughts and emotions we can respond out of the wisdom of our essential,
               aware, </span></span><em><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">free</span></span></em><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"> nature. We have a 
              choice in the moment to not react blindly. Do you see the freedom in 
              this? It doesn't mean that there are never thoughts and emotions. It 
              means that you are free in the midst of the arising of thought and 
              emotion.</span></span></div>
              </div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></span></div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"></span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">This is why it is 
              not necessary or even desirable to try to stop your thinking while 
              meditating. If it does that is fine, but thought will always come back 
              sooner or later, usually sooner. And as you practice like this on the 
              cushion this will begin to happen when you are not meditating also. More
               and more you will start to recognize the presence of your aware free 
              nature in the midst of whatever is appearingâ€”thoughts, emotions, 
              sensations and experiences, and you will come to see that you are always
               free.</span></span></div>

              note here. What I described above points to freedom. But ultimate 
              freedom is not even dependent on being aware during the arising of 
              thoughts. You are always free, regardless of whether you know you are 
              aware or not. True freedom just means that you are doubtless that you 
              are free. You don't need anything at all to confirm it. This type of 
              meditation will introduce you to your essential, free nature. It is a 
              practice, which serves the very beneficial purpose of becoming doubtless
               that you are free. More about this later.)</span></span></em></div>

              <p>Thank you for putting this clearly.<br>For a while I tried to stop 
                  thoughts from arising  and realized that it only made it worse.<br>From 
                  my experience the battle was with the thoughts that felt bad or 
                  annoying.When anger would arise and i felt compelled to act calm and 
                  collected only to feel worse about it later on.The movement was always 
                  with what was arising in my mind.<br>Nothing has changed with regard to 
                  experience but i notice the thoughts and the anger as it arises but then
                   again i don't know this that that notices except that sometimes there 
                  is awareness of thoughts and feelings arising and sometimes there is 
                  not.<br>What is most interesting is that the mind cannot explain this.In
                   a more a suble way there is a feeling of wanting to grasp this 
                  awareness and call it mine.Define it and have an interlectual 
                  understanding of it.</p>

              <p>Sounds so simple, Sal.  But remembering to notice that awareness is 
                  fleeting.  It seems very powerful, though.  It's an amazing "place" once
                   you catch a glimpse, if only for a second.  I've never thought about it

              <p>Hi Triza, I know what you meanâ€”"sometimes there is awareness of 
                  thoughts". But you can just be aware that you are aware, regardless of 
                  what appears. There is a subtle difference. In awareness of thoughts you
                   create a divisionâ€”you-aware of-thoughts. That is the seer, the seeing 
                  and the seen, duality. When you notice simply that you are aware, and 
                  let everything be as it is, there is no separation. Awareness shines in 
                  and through the thoughts. The thought becomes the flavor of awareness in
                   that moment.<br><br>I think what you mean is that there is a feeling of
                   wanting to grasp  this awareness and make it last. It is your 
                  awareness, because it is you. When you notice that you are aware you are
                   resting as your true nature. But it doesn't have to be held on to 
                  either, you don't have to keep being aware that you are aware. When you 
                  begin to notice awareness and thoughts arising inseparably you will come
                   to know freedom. And then it doesn't matter if you seem to be lost in 
                  thoughts or not.</p>

              <p>Hi Mike, It is fleeting for sure, but once you commit yourself to doing 
                  that, it will begin to happen more and more. But I would just like to 
                  reiterate that what I speak of is very simple and obvious. You are just 
                  aware, and you know that you are aware. That is all. It's just like a 
                  little click, "Ah, I'm aware." Just for a few seconds. Everyone knows 
                  this. But as you do this more and more you begin to realize that this is
                   your home. <br><br>It's important to not expect something grand. Of 
                  course, if you do that's fine, let that be as it is. We are very 
                  convinced, even from our Christian upbringing that Heaven is some 
                  amazing place far off and very difficult to reach. And then we switch 
                  that belief over to Nirvana or Enlightenment, two more place we feel 
                  completely unworthy of. <br><br>Your essential nature of awareness is 
                  simple. It has been with you since you were born, and before. And you 
                  notice it every time you notice, "Ah, I'm aware." By training yourself 
                  to notice this more and more, just like Nisargadatta said to do and just
                   like Ramana said to do you will become doubtless and free.</p>

               spiritual seekingâ€”has been pointing to this very spot, where we are 
              right now, never lost or distant, always 100% available to notice 
              whenever we choose to. We have just chosen to travel many unnecessary 
              and meandering miles. And this is nowhere more apparent than in

              <p>I read this post yesterday and I read it again today and the words bring
               me home to myself, to this very spot. Your words for me are a guided 
              meditation that heighten the quality of awareness in this moment.  When 
              you say, "Don't focus on anything for a few seconds,"... there is a 
              sense of relief and relaxation and opening.  I start to realize that 
              much of the time I am focusing on thought without being conscious that 
              I'm doing this.  I'm narrowing attention by habit, and this habit of 
              constricting awareness is exhausting, and blocks out so much of the 
              presence of life, blocks out awareness of my own presence, blocks out 
              awareness of the one presence in which we are all united.<br><br> It 
              is clear that your words are written when your consciousness is in the 
              space of awake awareness, and therefore your words carry the charge and 
              power of this consciousness. I am genuinely grateful for the spiritual 
              nourishment you offer through this blog!</p>

              <p>Thank you Colleen. I am very happy to read of your experience. This is 
              helpful or me since my only interest is to find ways to offer ways fro 
              people to recognize their own true nature. I know for you this is 
              already the case and that is great. I like how you say a "guided 
              meditation" Yes, this is the truest meditation, just recognizing your 
              already present aware essence. <br>Yes, when we stop focussing on 
              appearances, which is mostly self-concern, our already present essential
               aware nature blazes forth openly. It is like a light switch from off to
               on. <br>As all the sages have said, to just continue to recognize this 
              in every moment is all that is needed to be done. More and more we just 
              come to know this as our home, our true freedom as we continue on in 
              this way.<br>Thank you very much for you contributions!</p>

              <p>Why does the seeking begin in the first place? In my case, I suppose it 
              was because of suffering, then I read something about enlightement, 
              nirvana, moksha etc, and then the trip started. I interpretated I had to
               do all those practises to get enlightened then, I would be eternally 
              happy. <br>Do you think if someone had told me what you explain here 
              then I would have been able to appreciate it? I dont think so... So, 
              maybe its not that we have been told wrong paths, maybe that was what we
               were able to understand... Honestly, I wish I would have met you 
              earlier... but who knows... I bet I wouldnt have take advantage<br>much

              <p>Hi Paula,<br><br>Actually, you have been seeking since you first came to
               have the concept that you were separate. When you were born you were 
              not seeking, then they gave you your name and you finally, after much 
              convincing, began to believe that you were a separate individual. From 
              them on you were seeking, unconsciously, in the world of appearances for
               fulfillment and satisfaction, feeling alone and isolated. Suffering. 
              When you finally realized that doesn't work you began to look elsewhere.
               <br><br>You heard about the ultimate fulfillment, one that would 
              reunite you with yourself, and it was called enlightenment. Now you 
              began to seek consciously, you knew you were seeking. But of course, 
              enlightenment is just another object to seek outside of yourself. So, 
              just like in worldly seeking, you come to find out that that doesn't 
              work either. Then the suffering may be even worse. Good.<br><br>Most of 
              us seem to have to exhaust all external possibilities, all of the lofty 
              or incredible ideas we have heard, before we are ready to recognize that
               ultimate fulfillment is simple. Incredibly simple. It is as simple as 
              noticing that you are aware right here and now, and abiding as that in 
              the face of anything. But we have to be ready for that. This slowly cuts
               through the belief that we are separate and that fulfillment is to be 
              found in appearances. More and more the light of our essential aware 
              nature blazes and that becomes our natural habitat.<br><br>It doesn't 
              matter whether or not you might have been ready in the past. We are 
              ready when we are ready.<br><br>Now, you don't have to wait for 
              something called enlightenment. Every time you recognize the open 
              spaciousness of your essential aware nature, seeking is over, in that 
              moment. Notice that. See it for yourself. Why is that? Because your 
              essential aware nature is the same now as it was when you were born, 
              before you were trained to seek. You haven't lost that or changed at 
              all. You can always notice what has always been present and free from 
              seeking, whenever you choose to. Abide there. <br><br>I do believe that 
              more and more people are coming to know their true nature far more 
              easily than in the past. Maybe in the future it will be even more 
              prevalent. <br><br>Thank you for sharing!</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000080; font-size: normal;">Meditation is a 
                      deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher 
                      				states of consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of 
                      				meditation is the art of shifting the focus of attention to ever 
                      				subtler levels without losing one's grip on the levels left 
                      				behind. The final stage of meditation is reached when the sense 
                      				of identity goes beyond "I-am-so-and-so," beyond all ideas into 
                      				the impersonally personal pure being. But you must be energetic 
                      				when you take to meditation. Save all your energies and time for

                      regular meditation is that it takes you away from

                      				what you believe yourself to be. Awareness is unattached and 
                      				unshaken. It is lucid, silent, peaceful, alert and unafraid, 
                      				without desire and fear. Meditate on it as your true being, and 
                      				try to be it in your daily life, and you shall realize it in its
