              <p>Understanding the functioning of our mind forms the basis of Buddhist philosophy and practice; as the first verse of the <em>Dhammapada</em> (quotations from the Buddha) states:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"All things are preceded by the mind, led by the mind, created by the mind."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Similarly, in the Abidharma (the earliest attempt at a systematic representation of Buddhist philosophy and psychology), the world is regarded as a phenomena originating in the mind.</p>
              <p><strong>Mind is defined in Buddhism as a non-physical phenomenon which perceives, thinks, recognises, experiences and reacts to the environment. </strong><br>The mind is described as having two main aspects: clarity and knowing; meaning that the mind is clear, formless and allows for objects to arise in it, and that the mind is knowing, an awareness, a consciousness which can engage with objects.</p>

              <p>The two main types of mind are explained as the conceptual and the non-conceptual. The conceptual is the "normal" mind aspect we use to survive in daily life, but is ultimately mistaken about the way in which reality exists. The non-conceptual type of mind is also called the <em>Buddha nature, rigpa</em> (Tib.), fundamental pure nature of mind which realises <em>emptiness </em>(see the page on <a style="color: #660000;" href="http://viewonbuddhism.org/wisdom_emptiness.html">Wisdom</a>). <br>Study and training the mind in wisdom uses the conceptual mind, like preparing the mind before the underlying non-conceptual Buddha-nature of the mind can appear.</p>
              <p>In Buddhist psychology, much emphasis is given to the so-called <a style="color: #660000;" href="http://viewonbuddhism.org/delusion_introduction.html">delusions</a>, which we need to diminish and ultimately even eliminate for spiritual progress.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>A 'person' can be described as a number of phenomena into a single working unit. In Western philosophy, one usually refers to Body, Mind and (sometimes) Soul or Spirit. In Buddhism, the Five Aggregates (Skandhas in Skt.) are used to analyse a person. Please note that the terminology can be confusing, as e.g. the term 'Feeling' refers to something very specific here: :</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>1. <strong>Form</strong> - the body (rupa Skt.)<br>2. <strong>Primary Consciousness or Perception</strong>- the five sense consciousnesses (smell, touch, taste, seeing and hearing) and mental consciousness, in other words, direct perception (samjna Skt.)<br>3. <strong>Feeling </strong>- this refers only to the mental separation of perceptions into pleasant, unpleasant and neutral (nothing more). (vedana in Skt.)<br>4. <strong>Recognition, Consciousness, Discrimination or Distinguishing Awareness</strong> - in many ways similar to the discriminating intellect which makes us realise the difference between a chair and a flower. (vijnana in Skt.)<br>5. <strong>Compositional Factors, Volition</strong> - these are all other remaining mental processes, in general "thoughts". (samskara Skt.)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To begin with, it is interesting to see that four out of five aggregates are concerning the mind, and they do not directly correspond to the divisions made in Western psychology at all. Furthermore, the distinctions in Buddhist psychology are made from the point of view of how to obtain liberation and buddhahood; certainly not to figure out how 'the brain works'. <br>Simply said, in Buddhism, the brain is regarded as a part of the body where many of the instructions of the mind are led to the other parts of the body, it is not regarded as the 'factory of thoughts'; thoughts are purely a function of the (non-physical) mind.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"From contact comes feeling. <br>From feeling comes reaction. <br>This is what keeps us in the cycle of birth and death. <br>Our reactions to our feelings are our passport to rebirth." <br><em>Ayya Khema</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To use a simple example of how this works, let's say:<strong> something touches our hand:</strong> <br>- This is physical contact, and (as we know from Western science) our nerve cells pick up the movement of the skin, and translate it into energy (more subtle part of the Body). <br>- This energy is then picked up by Primary Consciousness/Perception, which is an aspect of the mind, in Buddhism, this is actually called the Contact (see below as the 5th. Omnipresent Mental Factor); the contact between the physical and the mental aspects. <br>- Next, the mental process of Feeling evaluates the Perception and decides it to be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. <br>- Simultaneously, Recognition/Discrimination gets to work in finding out what the thing is touching my hand, is it pressure or heat, etc. and is it related to other information; maybe I see a table near my hand and consider it likely that my hand must be touching the table.<br>- Based on the Feeling and Discrimination, the mind creates the Compositional Factors/Volition, which are for example, the reaction to the hand to withdraw if it is unpleasant, an instruction to the eyes to check what is touching the hand, possibly projections/thoughts like 'it must be this bothersome fly again' or 'I am touching the table I am walking past' etc.</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"><strong><a name="2"></a>THE MIND AS OUR SOFTWARE</strong></h4>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To illustrate the Buddhist approach to the mind, let us compare our body and mind to a computer. In this simile, the body is the hardware and the mind is the software.<br>As mentioned above, the mind is defined as a non-physical phenomena which perceives, thinks, recognises, experiences and reacts to the environment, not unlike computer software. <br>Although software needs to be imprinted or registered in something like the hard-drive before it can do anything, in itself, a program represents a lot of thinking by the software manufacturer. Without software (mind), the hardware (body) is just a 'dead thing'. The hardware (body) is of course important in what the computer can do; how fast it is, which programs can be run, and how the computer can interact with the world. However good the hardware is, it can ultimately only perform what the program 'knows'. The hardware can get damaged, or even 'die', and the software can be moved onto another set of hardware; not unlike rebirth!<br>The software needs to use the 'senses' of the hardware, like the keyboard, the mousea, a video camera, a modem etc. to receive 'input'; just like the mind needs the senses the receive the 'input' of the outside world.</p>
              <p>This leads to an important observation: it is easy to recognise that a computer is not 'objective' about the world; depending on what kind of video camera, microphone or modem we connect it to, the input will be different. Similarly, our bodily senses cannot really be objective: people's ears are different, the eyes are different etc., so how can someone ever claim to be an 'objective observer'? Above and beyond that lies the software; the more advanced this is, the more 'intelligent' it will be able to read the world and determine what is the best thing to do. Similarly, the more advanced our mind is, the more intelligent and wise we will be, providing we are not hampered by serious physical problems. As the software actually determines what the hardware does, so is the mind the master of the body - within the physical limitations of the body. But the Buddha made it clear that a human body is the best type of available hardware!</p>
              <p>There are limits to the development of the hardware; for example, the amount of electrical circuits on chips is getting larger and larger, but there are physical limits which the developers encounter. With the software, the limit appears to be much less clear; the first types of computers behaved with the intelligence of an on/off switch, but already they can beat a grandmaster at chess and nobody can say where it will end. Similarly, Buddhism teaches that there is no real limit to the development of our mind, and in fact omniscience is possible. At that stage, all our normal values and concepts dissolve as limited and non-objective. Buddhism encourages us to develop the software of our mind to enter into a different state which is beyond limitations, suffering and problems.</p>
              <p>The method to develop our mind is summarised as study and meditation. Initially, we need to understand how the programs of our mind work and how they can be improved, and then do the reprogramming in meditation. This is why psychology and meditation are so important.</p>
              <p>Below listing of aspects of the mind may appear very dry and boring, but remember, so are computer manuals...</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"><a name="2a"></a><strong>CLEAR-LIGHT MIND</strong></h4>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In Tibetan Buddhism, often the so-called 'clear-light mind' is mentioned. This is the most subtle level of mind (see also <a style="color: #660000;" href="http://viewonbuddhism.org/rebirth_reincarnation.html">death &amp; rebirth</a>), which we are normally not even aware of. It appears to the very advanced meditator and during the death process, but in this case, also only advanced meditators will be able to notice it. It is a non-conceptual, 'primordial' state of mind.</p>
              <p><em>From a talk given by HH Dalai Lama. Oct. 11-14, 1991 New York City. Path of Compassion teaching preliminary to Kalachakra: </em><br><strong>Question</strong>: When people hear of luminosity of clear light that dawns at the moment of death they ask why it is called clear light. What has this got to do with light as we know it? <br><strong>Dalai Lama</strong>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"I don't think that in the term clear light, light should be taken literally. It is sort of metaphoric. This could have its roots in our terminology of mental will. According to Buddhism, all consciousness or all cognitive mental events are said to be in the nature of clarity and luminosity. So it is from that point of view that the choice of the term light is used. Clear light is the most subtle level of mind, which can be seen as the basis or the source from which eventual experience or realisation of Buddhahood, Buddha's wisdom might come about, therefore it is called clear light. Clear light is a state of mind which becomes fully manifest only as a consequence of certain sequences or stages of dissolution, where the mind becomes devoid of certain types of obscurations, which are again metaphorically described in terms of sun-like, moonlike and darkness. These refer to the earlier three stages of dissolution which are technically called, including the clear light stage, the four empties. At the final stage of dissolution the mind is totally free of all these factors of obscuration. Therefore it is called clear light. Sort of a light. It is also possible to understand the usage of the term clear light in terms of the nature of mind itself. Mind or consciousness is a phenomena which lacks any obstructive quality. It is non-obstructed."</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>"About this mind... In truth there is nothing really wrong with it. It is intrinsically pure. Within itself it's already peaceful. That the mind is not peaceful these days is because it follows moods. The real mind doesn't have anything to it, it is simply (an aspect of) Nature. It becomes peaceful or agitated because moods deceive it. The untrained mind is stupid. Sense impressions come and trick it into happiness, suffering, gladness and sorrow, but the mind's true nature is none of those things. That gladness or sadness is not the mind, but only a mood coming to deceive us. The untrained mind gets lost and follows these things, it forgets itself. Then we think that it is we who are upset or at ease or whatever. <br>But really this mind of ours is already unmoving and peaceful... really peaceful! Just like a leaf which is still as long as no wind blows. If a wind comes up the leaf flutters. The fluttering is due to the wind -- the 'fluttering' is due to those sense impressions; the mind follows them. If it doesn't follow them, it doesn't 'flutter.' If we know fully the true nature of sense impressions we will be unmoved. <br>Our practice is simply to see the Original Mind. So we must train the mind to know those sense impressions, and not get lost in them. To make it peaceful. Just this is the aim of all this difficult practice we put ourselves through."</p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"><strong><a name="3"></a>51 MENTAL FACTORS</strong></h4>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the <em>Abhidharmakosha</em> of Vasubandu, 51 types of mind states or mental factors are distinguished. They are mainly categorised by the way they are related to the main delusions of attachment, anger and ignorance, (see below) and their relevance to mind training. Note that the English terms used often have different connotations than the actual definitions in Buddhism. Although below list may appear a dull list of definitions, a careful study of it can explain much of the Buddhist attitude towards the mind. <br>The list does not have the intention to be complete in describing all possible mental states, but describes merely the most important ones in relation to spiritual practice.</p>
              <h4 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"><strong><a name="4"></a>THE 5 OMNIPRESENT (EVER-RECURRING) MENTAL FACTORS</strong></h4>

              <p>11. <strong>Sleep</strong> - makes mind unclear, sense consciousness turns inwards <br>12. <strong>Regret</strong> - makes mind unhappy when regarding a previously done action as bad, prevents the mind from being at ease. <br>13. <strong>General examination</strong> / coarse discernment - depending on intelligence or intention, searches for rough idea about the object. <br>14. <strong>Precise analysis</strong> / subtle discernment - depending on intelligence or intention, examines the object in detail.</p>
