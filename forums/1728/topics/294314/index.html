That is only if there is no way around it, and therefore you take an 'incomplete precepts' which means 4 precepts, the 5th one you have not accomplished. Then gradually when you can, to abide by the 5th precepts as well.<br><br>However, we must be mindful of our actions. Even if you have to drink with them, you can drink slowly. But if you are drinking very fast, and finish up the alcoholic drink even faster than your client, and even ordering MORE, then that is not the right actions of a Buddhist. So we should be mindful of our actions, even if we have to drink, we have to try our best NOT to get drunk, to drink as little as possible.<br><br>Also, after getting to know our clients well enough, if they ask you out you can tell them you prefer to drink something non alcoholic instead.</div>

If you are a buddhist and understand what is karma and what is the signficiant of 5 precepts, you come to understand why we shouldn't lie, kill or drink.<br><br>Of course, in buddhism, we are encourage by the Buddha to question the teachings and not to take teachings blindly.<br><br>I think Sinweiy once mention that there are exception cases: one break the precepts when one should break it at the right time. If not, it is considered breaking the precepts. But i'm not <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> sure what it means ?<br><br>One of the four gratitudes that buddhist have to repay is to protect our nation, and not supportive of war that cause terror and destruction for other nations.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>correct 5 Precepts is a guide to abstain from Wanton misconduct in this four area.<br><br>the basis of next human life depends on this life in observing the 5 Precepts<br><br></div>

What should you do? Such incident took place in China thrice. Look at the history, did any Buddhists be it Ordain and Lay, rebelled. Nope! Why? Buddhists abide by the Vinaya. Forever no hatred to the country. This is truly protecting the Dharma. Why/how? Let the World's people see that Buddhist is good residents. Will the next governor want Buddhism to recover. YES! But if the Buddhists rebel and take revenge in the first place. And other countries see this. It will leave a bad impression. And criticize Buddhism and forever reject Buddhism. For that you truely eliminate Buddhism. So how Buddhism flourish depend on how Buddhists uphold the Vinaya. If Vinaya ends, Buddhism ends. This idea is very profound according to cause and effect.<br><br>/\<br></div>

On board ship, on the way back, the marchant learned that another passenger on the boat intended to kill all the hundreds of people on board, in order to be able to steal the cargo of jewels.<br><br>The merchant knew the man, and knew that he was indeed capable of killing all those people, and he wondered what to do about it. In the end, despite the fact that he had taken a vow with the Buddha never to take the life of another being, he had no alternative but to kill the would-be robber.<br><br>He was very ashamed of what he had done, and as soon as he returned home he went to the Buddha to confess his bad action. But the Buddha told him he had not done wrong, because his intention had not been to take life, but to save life. Furthermore, since he had in fact saved the lives of hundreds of people, and had saved the robber from the very negative karma of killing hundreds of people and the inevitable consequneces of such a bad action, the Buddha explained that the merchant had in fact done a good action.<br><br>~ Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br><br></div>
