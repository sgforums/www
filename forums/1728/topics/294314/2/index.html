The process of achieveing is through the journey not by the end of it. I belief not in self, but also in others, in the things I do and in my religion of course. So you see? My belief could be different from you, what I strongly hold may not be the same as you do?<br><br>Nope I will say one does not need to prove the doctrine at all. how do you know it failed you? How will you know if it has also failed others? We can never tell, but it is by our decsion how we view it as. Im not certainly some smart aleck or some holy person and is alike anybody, everybody even like you sometimes I do question the teaching and I do think at times how true/fasle can it be when it has been pass down for ages. How would we know if it has been altered by anyone? That we can never know but it is in our 'belief' that make us make our decision to.<br><br>Sometimes what we think/belief/feel the other person may not feel the same way as us. That's why people are just people and if they do not have a principle of their own they will tend to follow things blindy and easily. I know what I say will certainly upset alot but I admit I do not entirely 'follow 'His' teaching, but does that make me a faithless one? Who can really define you as a faithless one Herzog_Zwei? The point is I must have a reason of my own to feel this way, you must have a reason of your's and they must have a reason of theirs to feel this way. So if you follow your principles how can it fail you?<br><br>As for if it really fails you and when is the time to denounce it? Anytime, anyplace. You see the 'scripture' and 'His' teaching is dead but what is alive is in your heart.<br><br>Most importantly is to live happily through even the toughest moment. Be a good person without bringing harm to others and to help those in need when possible and lastly to appreciate the goodness your parents has brought to you. If everyone can follow as such simple as this, things won't fail you.<br><br>Just my 2 cents here.<br><br>I know you have good intention in saying that and meant no harm. What Ive just typed out is just a 'rough idea' of it. of course I do ecpect you to reciprocate all of it because you must understand it is in your decision the answer you want to bring to yourself rather then what others may bring to you.<br></div>

But it does not necessarily mean blind faith -- because it can be tested. Same goes to Buddhism (which is also itself a science).<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=273281" rel="nofollow">Faith in Belief Systems</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Thusness:<br>Interesting topic and I think I will skew a little to talk about science and faith since AEN was discussing a related thread yesterday.<br><br>Faith is necessary because there is no certainty in knowledge.  Even in exact science, no certainty is to be found.  Of course certainty versus probable knowledge is a topic relating to Epistemology (the theory on Knowledge) but still, it is pivotal towards understanding why the need for faith at all.  How science has led to the common misunderstanding that faith is not necessary is amazing but it is mostly due to the predictive nature of these scientific theories derived from thorough experimentation.  This is, however, mainly due to the fact that the pool of data made available for the derivation of these theories does not go beyond our man-size world.  As we know, Newtonian physics or classical science works well for a man-size world but not quite well in the macro and micro universe.  Our ordinary experiences do not permit us to experience something having the mass of a star or traveling at half-speed of light, we presume that the entire universe must obey the laws of the man-size world.  But when we are exposed to things not so ordinary, like traveling at a speed much faster then our ordinary experience of Â‘speedÂ’, we are lost because phenomena just donÂ’t behave the way we expected it to be.  The idea that time travel slower when they are approaching the speed of light and halt at speed of light is mind boggling.  Similarly when scientists begin to deal with the universe of the outer space Â– the macro universe, they are dealing with much more massive objects than the man-size world, a billion times more.  The idea that space curves and time halt at the speed of light came as a shocked to the classical scientists.  This applies true when we deal with the micro universe of the quantum world.  The world of the electrons does not comply with Newtonian nor Einstein theory.  This includes the spooky non-local behavior of particles that AEN brought up in another thread.  <strong>When Heisenberg introduced the Â‘uncertaintyÂ’ principle, it is so weird that even Einstein rejected it and thus, Einstein famous remark -- Â“God does not play diceÂ”.  But Â“God does not play diceÂ” is a belief system!  </strong> I canÂ’t remember where I read it but I could clearly recalled that even Stephen Hawking used phrases like Â“official dogmaÂ”, Â“deep emotional attachment to determinismÂ” to describe scientists like Einstein.  Stephen Hawking even went further to say that Einstein was doubly wrong when he said Â“God does not play diceÂ”.<br><br>I will not dwell too deeply into it but the purpose is simply to illustrate that our knowledge is nothing certain nor absolute.  Science is itself a belief system for us to better understand the phenomenon existence.  It is its certainty in predictability within a prescribed environment that convinces us that faith is not necessary.  It creates the impression of certainty and made a probable knowledge appears absolute but in actual case, science itself is a belief system and a great deal of faith (maybe good and rational faith in this case) is vested in science unknowingly.<br><br>My 2 cents.</blockquote></div>

That maybe explains why many chose to take 'un-buddhist' actions to continue protecting themselves. I think most of the time the truth is that we also want to gain benefits in such a way too, rather than for protection? There r loads of extreme cases n scenarios in the world, n thus all our actions must be based on wisdom, not excuses or fancy arguments which lead to no where, benifits no one, confuse many n satisfy a few egos here n there. I think we should just be mindful n pay attention to what we ourselves r doing, start from ourselves first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>]</span></strong></div>
