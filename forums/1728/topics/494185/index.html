              to put things in perspective</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Gregg Krech WINTER 2015

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Naikan is a Japanese word that means
              “looking inside,”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> though a more
              poetic translation might be “seeing oneself with the mind’s eye.” It is a
              structured method of self-reflection that helps us to understand ourselves, our
              relationships, and the fundamental nature of human existence. Naikan was
              developed in Japan in the 1940s by Ishin Yoshimoto, a devout Buddhist of the
              Pure Land sect (Jodo Shinshu). His strong religious spirit led him to practice
              mishirabe, an arduous method of meditation and self-reflection. Wishing to make
              such introspection available to others, he developed Naikan as a method that
              could be more widely practiced.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Naikan’s
              profound impact resulted in its use in other areas of Japanese society. Today,
              there are about 30 Naikan centers in Japan, and Naikan is used in mental health
              counseling, addiction treatment, rehabilitation of prisoners, schools, and
              business. It has also taken root in Europe, with a dozen Naikan centers now
              established in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. However, Naikan is still
              relatively unknown in North America. David K. Reynolds, Ph.D., introduced Naikan
              to North America in the 1970s and later incorporated its framework into
              Constructive Living, an approach that also includes elements of Morita Therapy.
              Reynolds was the first to write extensively about Naikan in English. Naikan
              programs and retreats have been offered regularly in the United States since
              1989 by the ToDo Institute in Vermont. But with the exception of a small number
              of adventurous Westerners who have studied Naikan in Japan, or who have
              attended programs in North America and Europe, few Westerners have experienced
              and explored this Japanese practice of self-reflection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Naikan
              broadens our view of reality. It’s as if, standing on top of a mountain, we
              shift from a zoom lens to a wide-angle lens. Now we can appreciate the broader
              panorama; our former perspective is still included, but it is now accompanied
              by much that had been hidden. And what was hidden makes the view extraordinary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">THE THREE QUESTIONS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Naikan
              reflection is based on three questions: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              have I received from ____?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              have I given to ____?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              troubles and difficulties have I caused ____?</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              questions provide a foundation for reflecting on all relationships, including
              those with parents, friends, teachers, siblings, work associates, children, and
              partners. You can reflect on yourself in relation to pets, or even objects such
              as cars and pianos. You can reflect on a specific period of time, one day or a
              holiday visit to your family. In each case, you acquire a more realistic view
              of your conduct and the give-and-take that has occurred in the relationship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              questions themselves seem rather simple. They are. The depth of experience,
              insight, and realization that can come from the practice of self-reflection is
              not a result of intellectual analysis or complex theories. Our challenge is to
              just see reality as it is. These questions are simple inquiries for our
              investigation of life’s mysteries and miracles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Let’s
              begin our inquiry with the first question: What have I received from ____?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              examine your relationship with another, begin by looking at what you have
              received from that person. My wife made me fresh-squeezed orange juice this
              morning. She washed my breakfast dishes. She gave me the watch I’m wearing.
              These are all simple, clear descriptions of reality. Her attitude or motivation
              does not change the fact that I benefited from her effort. Often we take such
              things for granted. We hurry through our day giving little attention to all the
              “little” things we are receiving. But are these things really little? They only
              seem so because, while we are being supported, our attention is else- where.
              But when there is no hot water for a shower or we lose our glasses, these
              little things grab our attention. Suddenly we are conscious of the true value
              of hot water and clear vision.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              often live our life as if the world owes us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              you list what you have received from another person, you become grounded in the
              simple reality of how you have been supported and cared for. In many cases you
              may be surprised at the length or importance of the items on your list, and a
              deeper sense of gratitude and appreciation may be naturally stimulated. Your
              heart and mind begin to open to the grace that underlies all life. Without a
              conscious shift of attention to the myriad ways in which the world supports us,
              we risk our attention being trapped by problems and obstacles, leaving us to
              linger in suffering and self-pity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              please take a few minutes now and begin making a list of what you have received
              during the past 24 hours in detail. This type of daily reflection is called
              daily Naikan (nichijo naikan). You are not limited to examining your
              relationship to one person, but can include anyone who supported you during the
              past day. Be specific and write down as many items as you can remember. What kind
              of food did you eat? Where did you go this past day? How did others support
              you? Did someone open a door? Did someone wash your dishes, or was there hot
              water and soap available to you for washing dishes? What made it possible for
              you to brush your teeth or drive a car? Take ten minutes and make as thorough a
              list as possible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you are done, please continue to the second question: What have I given to
              ____? Ishin Yoshimoto was a businessman. Each month he would send statements to
              his customers and receive similar statements from suppliers. These statements
              specified the products that were sent and the amount of money received. We
              receive a similar statement from the bank regarding our checking account. This
              tells us to the penny the balance in our account. Yoshimoto believed it was
              useful for human beings to conduct a similar examination or “life
              reconciliation.” When you have examined, in detail, what you have given and
              received, you can determine the balance. You can compare your giving (credits)
              and taking (debits) in relation to a single person or between you and the rest
              of the world. You can examine a period of time ranging from a day to a decade.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              process is both a practical and spiritual reconciliation of our relationships
              with others. Does the world owe me, or do I owe the world? Am I in debt to my
              mother, or is she in debt to me? We often live our life as if the world owes
              us. “Why didn’t I get that raise?” “Why is the pizza so late?” “How come I
              don’t get more appreciation from my boss?” We resent it when people do not
              fulfill our expectations, and live as if we deserve whatever we desire. When
              people do support us, we often take their efforts for granted, living as if we
              were entitled to their support. As we reflect on our life we begin to see the
              reality of our life. What is more appropriate: to go through life with the
              mission of collecting what is owed us, or to go through life trying to repay
              our debt to others? Suppose I discover that I am the one who is in debt to the
              world. Such a realization kindles a natural desire to give and serve others and
              instills in me a greater sense of gratitude and realistic humility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              please take another ten minutes and make a list of what you have given to
              others during the past 24 hours. Perhaps you gave someone a ride or prepared
              their dinner. Perhaps you sent a birthday card to a friend or picked up some
              litter on the street. Once again, be concrete and specific. Try to avoid
              generalizations like “I was helpful” or “I was very supportive.” What did you
              actually do for others?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              you have a preliminary picture of your life for the past 24 hours. You have
              done some important research. Let’s look at your lists. Have you been
              consistent? If you indicated that you gave a smile or thank-you to someone, have
              you also listed all the smiles and thank-yous you received from others? Have
              you been as accurate as possible? If you cooked someone a meal, have you also
              noted what you had to receive (for example, groceries, utensils, an oven, a
              recipe book) in order to do that? Take a few minutes and modify your lists, if
              necessary, so they more accurately reflect the reality of this past day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              third and final question is the most difficult of all: What troubles or
              difficulties have I caused ___? Mostly we are aware of how other people cause
              us inconvenience or difficulty. Perhaps somebody cuts us off in traffic, or
              maybe the person in front of us at the post office has a lot of packages and we
              are kept waiting. We notice such incidents with great proficiency. But when we
              are the source of the trouble or inconvenience, we often don’t notice it at
              all. Or if we do, we think, “it was an accident” or “I didn’t mean it.” Perhaps
              we simply dismiss it as “not such a big deal.” But this question is truly
              important. Yoshimoto suggested that when we reflect on our- selves, we should
              spend at least 60 percent of the time considering how we have caused others
              trouble. His words are echoed by the lives of Franklin, Schweitzer, and St.
              Augustine. If we are not willing to see and accept those events in which we
              have been the source of others’ suffering, then we cannot truly know ourselves
              or the grace by which we live.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              please take another ten minutes and make a list of the troubles and
              difficulties you have caused others in the past 24 hours. Did you criticize
              someone? Did you leave dishes in the sink for someone else to wash? Did you
              keep someone waiting for a response to an email or telephone call? Were you
              late for an appointment? Once again, please be specific.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">REFLECTING ON REFLECTIONS</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              have now completed your first research project; you have examined a small slice
              of your life (one day) in an attempt to see reality as clearly as possible.
              What can you learn from your research? Review your lists carefully. What are
              you aware of that you weren’t aware of before? What have you taken for granted?
              What do you need to do and what do you need to do differently? This type of
              daily reflection, or daily Naikan, can be done before bedtime in 20 to 30
              minutes. It is the simplest method of Naikan reflection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              think we know our own life, but what we know is only an edited version, colored
              by our emotions and narrow vision. How close can we come to the original draft?
              By staring at truth, the soil is warmed, and we begin digging toward the sky.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
