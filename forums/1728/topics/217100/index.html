But I believe these are politics stuff.. looks to be very violent methods.. I don't think the high lamas have anything to do with this and certainly wouldn't have agreed on such atrocities. If certain lamas are involved, because the lamas themselves used to be involved with politics, then Buddhists have the right and should reject them and their acts and atrocities.. not all lamas are true incarnations of predecessors (although most are), I think it was mentioned in the discovery channel by one of the Rinpoches. Some are simply chosen to take over the job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But anyway I have to agree with Kaister on the point about culture... Tibet used to be a violent and barbaric tribal place with tribal culture... Buddha prophecised that there will be 'dharma for the Barbarians' for Tibetans in the future (refering to Tibetan Buddhism), if memory serves. Master Padmasambhava introduced Buddhism to Tibet and sort 'tamed' the barbarians. But I guess maybe some continue to be.<br><br>Anyway, longchen was a Tibetan monk 2 lifetimes ago. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I just dismiss it in my mind until one day when I read the Reader's Digest magazine article on chernobyl disaster when a survivor descripe the feeling of being bombarded by leaking radiation waves which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> the same as what I had felt! It is since this coincidence I start to take notice of this.<br><br>The chernobyl accident happen in april 26 1986, I was born on 10 sept 1986, I start to suspect whether my "feelings" have anything to do with the chernobyl accident, whether was I "reincarnated" from a dead person from tat accident... But even till now I refuse to believe or "try" to believe ENTIRELY in it..cos it just sounds too incredible to be true<br><br>Anyway beside this feeling, I have no prior knowledge of other event or place....</div></blockquote>Hi TexcocoII,<br><br>Thanks for the sharing.<br><br>I think it is very likely that you died of radiation exposure. Do you have some phobias or allergy. It is advisable to cleanse ourselve of the strong karmic imprints.<br><br>BTW, an Austrian friend that i recently got to know, told me that all people that helped to clean up the Chernobyl accidents died after several years. The radiation killed them slowly. Also, there were strange mutations of people born after the incident...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When we meditate sometimes the impressions comes in. Also, during our early childhood (before 7), we have stronger remembrance. But usually only the dramatic memories comes in.<br><br>Also, we can intuitively get a feel of who we are in the past. For example, when I visited Brussels in Europe many years ago, I got a feeling I knew this place before...it was nostalgic. Later on, i discovered that I have stay for sometime there most probably as a mystic, because Brussels was the headquarter for Western mystics during WW1.</strong><br><br>Deep meditation can actually foresee one's past life? This is unbelievable. Well, then again there are many things that can't be explained in simple science by layman terms.<br><br>I'm pretty much a novice in this chanting and meditation fields, infact i have never meditate before. In the few ocassions that i do chant, when i'm focus, i can feel a wave of hot air up my feet, at my back and such, why is this so?<br><br>In fact i do feel and get the vibes of the works of buddha and bodhisattva's help in those time that my father was sick. There were a few quite prominent cases.<br><br>At my father's wake, when the monks were chanting for him, i was chanting "nan mo a mi tou fo" together with them, and i can feel my body shaking or rather moving uncontrolably and my soul is trying to raise up from my body though it was rooted to the ground. Why is this so?<br><br>I have seeked the monk's advice, he mentioned that it maybe because i have the affinity.

If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind.</div>
