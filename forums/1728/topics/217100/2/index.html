Refering to whoever wrote that article. More likely refering to the guy who spoke about his bad experience with lama. But we never know whether he is slandering or telling the truth, so we should not condemn him in this way. Nevertheless i feel that the author should consider eyewitnesses as proof before coming to the conclusion. And that guy who supposedly ordered torture may not be, is unlikely to be, a lama.

Also, during our early childhood (before 7), we have stronger remembrance. But usually only the dramatic memories comes in.<br><br>Also, we can intuitively get a feel of who we are in the past. For example, when I visited Brussels in Europe many years ago, I got a feeling I knew this place before...it was nostalgic. Later on, i discovered that I have stay for sometime there most probably as a mystic, because Brussels was the headquarter for Western mystics during WW1.</strong><br><br>Deep meditation can actually foresee one's past life? This is unbelievable. Well, then again there are many things that can't be explained in simple science by layman terms.<br><br>I'm pretty much a novice in this chanting and meditation fields, infact i have never meditate before. In the few ocassions that i do chant, when i'm focus, i can feel a wave of hot air up my feet, at my back and such, why is this so?<br><br>In fact i do feel and get the vibes of the works of buddha and bodhisattva's help in those time that my father was sick. There were a few quite prominent cases.<br><br>At my father's wake, when the monks were chanting for him, i was chanting "nan mo a mi tou fo" together with them, and i can feel my body shaking or rather moving uncontrolably and my soul is trying to raise up from my body though it was rooted to the ground. Why is this so?<br><br>I have seeked the monk's advice, he mentioned that it maybe because i have the affinity. And it would be good for me to meditate?<br><br>Please advice and share your knowledge.<br><br>depth09[/b]</blockquote>From my understanding only...<br><br>the wave of hot air... are the clearing of energy blockages... raising our vibration...possibly due to the relaxation brought about by chanting... Feels  good?<br><br>Actually, i did not intentionally want to see any pastlife. The past live memories were not really in very deep meditations. For me, they are the 'layer' that disturb our peace. These imprints affect us... so we must heal them.<br><br>I think you should meditate too. You may just discover things about ourselves and its relationship to the universe.<br><br>regards</div>

It would be no surprise to me that Dalai Lama is involved in this political battle one way or another.<br><br>It has nothing to do with how authentic he is, but the amount of influence he has on the future of the region is pretty much what US needed to create controversy in Tibet.</div>
