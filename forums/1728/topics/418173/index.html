              <div class="review-text" style="display: none;">I went to Vegan Burg on a
               friend's recommendation (all the way from Queenstown mind you), and I 
              was not disappointed. I had a Charcoal BBQ burger and my boyfriend had a
               Satay burger. The patty was absolutely delightful as was the healthy 
              buns around it. The satay burger had a nice generously gingered peanut 
              sauce which was amazing! It was served with a side of crispy fries, 
              which did not at all feel oily. The icing on the cake was that this kind
               of combo, comes with healthy juice! Made me think of all the food 
              options we take these days and how best to be as healthy as possible. I 
              would definitely go back but i do sincerely hope they start shop in the 
              west as well! (<a href="http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/VeganBurg/#show%20less%20content">Hide</a>)</div>

              <p>We were absolutely 
              blown away at how good this vegan option of hamburgers and hotdog were! 
              We're both big meat eaters, just went here due to my milk allergy to get
               something 100% free from dairy and try something unusual, expecting 
              weird taste and dry food, but oboy were we wrong. Everything was 
              completely fresh, juicy and scrumptious :)</p>
              <p>We tried the satay 
              burger, Cracked pepper mayo burger, BBQ burger, vegan dog in bread and 
              potato balls. The potato balls were also surprisingly good and juicy, 
              had almost a cheesy taste to them, and no disgusting greasyness from 
              being fried. The vegandog was my favourite (just had to add some 
              ketchup), had I not known it was vegan I would have thought it was 
              ordinary meat in it. Of the three burgers, we both liked the BBQ burger 
              best, seriously delicious...</p>
              <p>The atmosphere and decor inside were
               not nice at all, but considering it is an alternative to a fast food 
              place, it is ok. The staff receiving the order spoke english well and 
              was very pleasant. There was advertised on a chalk board that they had 
              brown rice ice cream, but when we ordered it, they answered that they 
              would only be starting selling that in some days... oh well, means we 
              have to come back :D Which we gladly will do. However, living and 
              working quite far away from this place, we hope they will start delivery
               soon! (<a href="http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/VeganBurg/#show%20less%20content">Hide</a>)</p>

              <p>I was eager to try 
              this out when I read on the newspaper and oh boy, it was a treasure to 
              be found alright!</p>
              <p>I've been waiting for a restaurant that has 
              eco-consciousness and organic value and Vegan Burg is certainly the 
              answer.</p>
              <p>The outlet was easy to spot on with their Big Round Logo 
              on top of the entrance door, just before the Eunos MRT Rail Track on 
              Eunos Road</p>
              <p>Loved the ideas of the tables having an open squared 
              compartment that stores some magazines.</p>
              <p>Ordered the Set Menu, 
              consisted of 1 Burger, French Fries and Drinks (no soft drinks here!!)</p>
              <p>I tried the Smoky BBQ which was delicious; the patty felt fresh and I
               assured you it didn't taste funny, strange or that kind of sort; it was
               smooth with mushroom combination.</p>
              <p>The organic ciabatta was fresh
               and I don't usually like ciabatta but for this one, I admitted defeat..</p>
              <p>Fries wasn't Oily and it came in just a right amount...</p>
              <p>Ordered
               the Juice for drink, a bit let down by having too much ice cubes...</p>
              <p>Thumbs up for Vegan Burg by being considerate, the burger was cut in
               half, the fries and burger came in a square tin box, really put a 
              saving on paper waste.</p>
              <p>Tried my colleagues burgers; a Hawaian 
              which had fresh sliced pineapple and Tangy burger; which had soft patty 
              with mayonaisse.</p>
              <p>Must try their Spinach Pops which was crispy on 
              the outside and soft fluffy in the inside; combination of potato and 
              spinach never felt this good</p>
              <p>The staff were young and could see a
               bit inexperienced but fast serving for our burgers delivery.</p>
              <p>Loved
               the ideas of having a place where I know it's a gem for environment and
               tasty on the same time...</p>
              <p>Definitely will be a regular there...</p>
