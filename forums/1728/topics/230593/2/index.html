All these have nothing to do with the ultimate reality that Buddhism is talking about.<br><br>Dealing with spiritual entities are discouraged in Buddhism because almost always dealing with spiritual entities means dealing with the spirit, lower realms. We do not want to create that kind of affinity even though the spirits may provide us with certain benefits. Secondly, all these things are far off, and have nothing to do with gaining insights, liberation, enlightenment, finding the highest bliss of Nirvana.</div>

The calmness is felt relative to our daily living because often in our daily living our minds are highly agitated like bad weather in the sky causes the sea waves to be stronger. Even when there is no wind there is still waves but just lesser and we feel relatively peaceful.<br><br>Absorption is a totally different thing and is a completely different dimension from our daily living kind.<br><br>Anyway I was saying, for beginners without sustained effort, it would even be more impossible to maintain a state without thought for more than a matter of seconds, like 10 seconds.</div>
