            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway just to add on: it is impossible to attain samatha jhana when interacting with things. Samatha jhanas can only be attained in deep meditation. There is also a danger of entering chanting samadhi when driving so when driving don't be too concentrated on chanting, maintain awareness of surroundings as well.<br><br>Back to jhana and interaction. By typing all these, there are already thoughts. You need to plan and think how to ask me, etc. All these are thoughts. In Samatha jhana the mind is absorbed into a mental state and has no room for interacting in the real world.<br><br>Insight is however not the same and even the reality of thoughts can be investigated.</div>
