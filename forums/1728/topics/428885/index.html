              Hi Rooney,
              In Kong Meng San, during Vesak eve and actual day got programmes. Even if you are not doing the 3-step-1-bow ritual, you can attend their youth programme, where they gather at a hall and do some rituals too. Of course there will be Dharma talks.
              
              But Dharma talks you can listen any other day. Why not give 3-Step-1-Bow a try? If you have been to army, well, this 3 steps ritual is "siong ah". You know KMS (Kong Meng San) inside got many like 10 temples inside. This 3Step ritual will bow and walk around the perimeter of all the 10 temple.
              But if you do on Vesak Eve nite. Its very peaceful and serene. You do it once only you'll want to do it every year.
              
              Thousands of people doing it, including old grannys and old grandfathers and even yound children. 
              
              So Young Man, give it a try.
              You haven't PM (private message) me your handphone.

              <p>Last year on Vesak Day, Bright Hill also organised a nice temple tour. My oversea friends joined and they enjoyed the guided tour in English.  I hope they organise it every year. </p>
              <p>For the 3 steps bow 1, i wish i have the stamina to complete it one day.  I heard from my friend it is good to keep a distance from the people in front because your head is facing the backside and sometimes they fart. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>I witnessed personally when I was at Putuo Shanï¼ˆæ™®é™€å±±) in China. I was out of breath walking up, it is amazing that they can 3 steps 1 bow (in Tibetan 3 steps 1 bow) up the hill. I saw not one but a few Tibetan monks doing that.</p>

              To all above,
              Well, you don't have to complete all the whole 10 temples round inside Kong Meng San.
              As long as you are sincere in doing, just 1 round of bow around 1 temple is great too.
              for those with personal reasons, or lack of stamina, you don't have to bow or kneel down.
              There are devotees who just walk, yes, just walk. Every few steps you walk, there'll be a bell as guidance, once you hear the bell, just bend as in 90 degree bow while standing, no need to kneel down to bow. 
              Then as mentioned above, there is another type where devotees prostrate whole body on the floor too. 
              for those who faint easily (say lack of blood flow), standing up and kneeling down to bow can cause the blood flow to one moment flow to your head, next down your body again when you stand up. Then in that case, you just walk. 
              For me, I got bit of breathlessness, hence when I can't take it , I will just walk most of the distance, and kneel bow for some distance. 
              The final part of the walk (like a marathon) till the end, everyone will reach a golden buddha statue which spouts out cold water onto your body, as in like receiving blessing.
              That's really a sense of accomplishment at the final point.
              I see from above post none of you are interested in this walk. Nevermind, you can still
              PM me your handphone. Hope all of us can meetup at KMS. There are loads of
              activities at various hall too. Or all of us can enjoy a vegetarian meal together. 
              Other than the vegetarian meal served in the newest hall at KMS, at downstair along 
              the walkways there are many kiosk serving kuehs and snacks too.
              If you have other friends/foreign friends interested to visit KMS on Vesak nite, bring 
              them along too.

Or all of us can enjoy a vegetarian meal together.<br>Other than the vegetarian meal served in the newest hall at <span>KMS</span>, at downstair along<br>the walkways there are many kiosk serving kuehs and snacks too.<br>If you have other friends/foreign friends interested to visit <span>KMS</span> on Vesak nite, bring<br>them along too.</p>

              <p>hi, i'd like to share this...</p>
              <p>3 steps 1 bow was an excellent experience for me. it took me almost 3hrs to complete the whole process. we reached there about 10pm on the eve of vesak day, queue up (no need tickets) and waited for our batch to begin. it was very good excercise indeed! my elbows were bruised and knees were soft &amp; weak after that. there were many people from young children to elderly old folks. people joined in the chanting "namo shi jia mo ni fuo" as we walked &amp; bowed. there were paths with small slopes going up &amp; down, rough &amp; smooth grounds. let's not focus on the boundless merits one could acquire from this practice but to appreciate it as a condition &amp; opportunity which one reaps to assist in further progress &amp; development in our daily practice. during the whole journey, we could practice single mindedness in chanting, walking, bowing and at the same time just experience &amp; observe our 6 senses fully in the immediate moment throughout the process. if your mental &amp; physical condition allow, take it as a ground to train one's endurance, perseverence &amp; focus. for some it may be an expression of faith, grattitude or repentance. i admit it was really exhausting, tough &amp; challenging for me and each time i learn to drop &amp; bow and learn to get up &amp; move on. i never knew or thought i could complete. when i have finished, i felt thankful to all that walked and bowed with me as it was supportive (everyone was doing together), it was motivating and inspiring. 3 steps &amp; 1 bow is a beautiful experience. if you have not done it, go for it. if you have been doing it many times, just go on ahead.</p>
              <p>enjoy it!</p>

              <p>Sorry Lavender. I forgot that day is weekday, I don't think I can be early. So, without tickets is also fine because I can't be early.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">. We shall arrange how to meet nearer the time. I've pm you my hp.</p>

              I have already took refuge hence can wear Hai Qing but I don't like to wear.
              The monks will lead the very first batch of ticket holders at 5pm. Nite time also got
              people wear Hai Qing to do.
              
              Since on the topic of clothing. Just my advice to 1st timers.
              
              Do not wear white T-shirts/pants, at the end of the walk your shirt become black.
              
              Do not wear 3 quarters pants, cos your lower leg can get brush against the rough
              road surface when kneeling down.
              
              Do not bring any bag or haversack, cos no one will look after for you. You can bring a waist pouch, but clinging the waist pouch to your front waist or back will hinder each
              time you bend. 
              
              Do not wear slippers or shoes that are easily slipped off. Cos each time you bow,
              your ankle will arch a bit and each time you got to adjust your shoe.
              
              If got long hair, bring along a rubberband to bun up your hair or each time you
              bow your hair will sweep the floor or stick to your face when sweat.
              
              What I usually do is 
              I will wear long pants with back/side pockets.
              I won't bring any wallet, as wallet inside the pocket can be heavy when bowing.
              I just bring dollar notes, slip them into a Mrt card plastic holder then put in my
              pants pocket.
              I won't bring a whole bunch of keys as it can be heavy in pocket. I just slip 1
              door  key into the card holder as well.
              I won't bring towel as hanging a towel around my neck, each time bend down,
              towel follow down. I just bring few packets of tissues slip into my pants pockets.
              I will slip 2 rubberbands around my wrist, when doing then bun up my hair.
              
              And of course, I won't wear skirts. Haha.

              <p>can bring a maid/friend/family to carry everything and wait at the side or walk along while you bow.  ( walk on one side )?  allow or not ?</p>
              <p>Like that , wear a Hai Qing may be nicer.  Protect the backview and can slip card/key/money in the pocket of Hai Qing.</p>
