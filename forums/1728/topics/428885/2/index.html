              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By the way, drink a bottle of 100 plus before you start on the ritual, as you will be totally dehydrated by the time you complete the journey and the thirst along the whole way can be very tiring. Also brush away all the sands on your elbows and knees after a few bows each time, as by the time you reach the slope going to the Hall of Compassion it is going to be very painful on your knees and elbows. You will have to live with the bruises on your knees and elbows for a few days. That is my experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Well, enjoy the ritual as there are few of such activities that lay people can partake in.</span></p>

              Dawn, Wiser and Aik
              Good idea.
              years ago, my friend just hide her haversack under the Altar table of a temple.
              But at the ending point, she got to walk back to the beginning point to reclaim
              her haversack. Hence hide it at the ending point temple. 
              Lots of devotees just leave their slippers around - and no one takes cos everyone
              here in the temple observed good deeds. 
              As for the tonic drinks. Along the way, KMS volunteers all hold a tray of water
              As you do, you saw this volunteers, can just pick up a glass of water to drink.
              Along the way got toilets too, just tell the volunteer you excuse from the walk
              to visit the toilet so that you can join back the walk after using the toilet. 
              I don't recall my Hai Qing got so many  pockets. But my cargo pants got 5 pockets.
              Hehe.
              And lastly, don't wear jeans. Its thick and tight hinder your bending.
              Even my cargo pants is soft material.

              <p>Years ago maybe safe to hide bags , nowadays with 2.5 million foreigners from other countries, you can't play safe anymore.</p>
              <p>Beside, Bright Hill also hang signs warning people of pickpockets.  As for shoes, unless you stupid wear HUSH PUPPIES shoes there la, and the thief know brands.</p>
              <p>Don't believe try wear Calvin Klein, Chanel, Hush Puppies, Coach, Nike  sandals/shoes and leave them there, see you need to walk home barefoot or not.</p>
              <p>lols.....</p>
              <p>Some Hai Ching has a inner small pocket but the expensive good quality silk one doesn't. But it is cooling to wear a silk hai ching and it is also much lighter than the other version. But to put weigh in the pocket also hinder bowing and bending.</p>

              <p>Got to bring my perfume to refresh myself, some wet tissue also to clean myself, some tonic water to boost my strength. And some snacks like chocolate bar to give me the energy to carry on.</p>

              <p>It is ok that the ritual is tough because it can lighten our past life and present life sins. To live with our sins, life will be tougher. One of the master said when we do the 3 steps 1 bow, we have to sincerely repent our past and present sins. Sins is something that no higher beings can lighten, we can only lighten it ourselves.</p>
              <p>Thanks guys for your advise. I guess I shall just walk if I can't complete.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"><strong>Cleansing the Heart: Buddhist Bowing As Contemplation -</strong> Rev. Heng Sure </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Meditation masters practiced bowing as an active counterpart to seated meditation. Bowing has many purposes; perhaps its primary psychological function in the Buddhist context is to dispel arrogance and to transform the affliction of pride. Master Chengguan (737-839) the Tang Dynasty exegete, in his commentary to the <em>Flower Adornment Sutra,</em> explains "bowing in respect to all Buddhas,” the first of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva’s Ten Practices and Vows:<br><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 24pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; "><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span>When one bows in respect to all Buddhas, a feeling of reverence arises in your heart, and animates your actions and speech. You express this feeling by bowing to all Buddhas. <strong>The practice gets rid of both obstacles of arrogance and ego.</strong> When respect arises, you deepen your ‘good roots’ of reverence and faith. </span></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: right; LINE-HEIGHT: 24pt"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><span>—<em>Avatamsaka Exegesis</em></span><em><a name="_ednref6" href="/forums/1728/topics/#_edn6"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;   "><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[vi]</span></span></a></em><span><br><br></span></span></p>

He places his point of reference inside the mind of the practitioner as he or she bows to the Buddha. Chengguan says that body, mouth and mind experience a feeling of respect. The feeling of respect multiplies the awareness of the sacred presence around and within the worshipper. The obstacles of arrogance and ego diminish as bowing reduces affliction and increases good qualities. The <em>Avatamsaka</em> contemplations used when “bowing in respect to all Buddhas,” according to Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, constitute a unique feature of bowing in Buddhism.</span></span></p>

              <p>thus learn that unless u got some medical reason, wearing knee pad and elbow pad is a showing of insincerity.</p>
              <p>also there are other places doing 3 steps 1 bow, where they book a stadium and do it on the running track.  </p>
