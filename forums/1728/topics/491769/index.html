              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/columnist/61"><span style="color: windowtext;">Sanitsuda Ekachai</span></a> Bangkok
              Post</span></p>
              <p class="preparagraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A case of arson at a bhikkhuni centre in Rayong is
              shocking. Although it is yet to be determined what caused it -- land conflicts,
              gender discrimination, or both -- it is clear that it is not easy being a
              female monk. And the next charter -- if it passes the referendum -- will not
              make it any easier.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The incident took
              place at the International Women's Meditation Centre in Rayong early this
              month. Run by two female monks, Bhikkhuni Lee, an American, and Bhikkhuni Rattanavali,
              a Thai national, the centre has ordained 35 bhikkhuni and samaneri (female
              novices) as of 2013, according to its website.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Like other
              bhikkhuni centres in Thailand, it does not call its premises a temple to avoid
              legal problems with the clergy. But other bhikkhuni centres have not
              experienced such extreme violence despite being similarly frowned upon by the
              clergy for their persistence in ordaining women.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhikkhuni Lee
              blames the attack on sexism in Thai society. Bhikkhuni Rattanavali said land
              problems might also play a part, which raises questions about the centre's
              relationship with locals.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet, the problem
              underscores a huge burden faced by women monastics. Apart from having to
              support themselves, female monks have to work hard to gain the acceptance of
              locals, all while their male counterparts receive unquestionable support as the
              legitimate "fields of merits".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This burden is
              especially heavy if female monks are strangers to the neighbourhoods, which is
              probably the case of the Rayong centre. Bhikkhuni centres that were once
              nunneries are spared part of this burden by long-established ties with locals
              and local monks.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Interestingly, the
              arson incident at Rayong has received attention from rights groups, but there
              is still silence from other local bhikkhuni communities.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite the
              growing number of female ordinations in the country, each centre operates
              independently, each engrossed in its own activities, careful of minding their
              own business.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This is both a
              strength and weakness. Independence allows more room for creativity. But
              without mutual support and oversight, straying from monastic rules is easy.
              Help is not readily available either when you are in trouble. And without a
              strong network, there is little chance of female monks combining forces to
              change unfair laws and cultural practices.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Their cause is not
              furthered by the Constitution Drafting Committee's draft charter. Apart from
              strengthening the patriarchal clergy which is suppressing female ordination,
              the draft charter will also remove old constitutional mechanisms which protect
              religious freedoms.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According to
              scholar Kanjana Suthikul, previous charters made it clear that the state is
              prohibited from infringing on religious practices of any individual or groups
              just because they are different from mainstream beliefs and practices.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Legally,
              therefore, Thai women have a constitutional right to become female monks and
              the clergy's prohibition against female ordination or any action to make it
              difficult is unconstitutional.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To avoid legal
              hurdles with the Sangha Council, female monks have declared that since they are
              ordained by the clergy in Sri Lanka, they are not under Thai Theravada
              jurisdiction. This means elders do not have power over them.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet, the clergy
              insists on prohibiting any female ordination on Thai soil. They have also asked
              the Foreign Ministry not to give visas to monks from Sri Lanka and other
              countries who will come to Thailand to ordain women.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">All this is
              happening even as female monks are supposed to receive constitutional
              protection from state intervention. Imagine what will happen when the draft
              removes these protections altogether.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sangha reform
              requires monks and temples to stop being dependent on state patronage and
              financial support so that they can start improving themselves to regain public
              respect. But the new charter further strengthens state patronage.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In a departure
              from previous charters, the current draft has made it clear that the state will
              provide special support to the Thai Theravada clergy. That's not all. The draft
              practically kills the principle of religious freedom by promising to punish "all
              forms of violations against Buddhism".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The big question
              is who holds the power to decide and interpret what "true" Buddhism
              is.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This dangerous
              move to monopolise the interpretation of the teachings actually stems from the
              charter drafters' fear of the capitalist Dhammakaya Temple given its dominance
              in the Sangha Council. The clause aims to give a constitutional tool to the
              powers-that-be to punish Dhammakaya, which teaches that one can buy your way to
              heaven by donating to the temple. The more donations, the more luxurious your
              real estate in heaven.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The drafters --
              and the military regime -- want to stop Dhammakaya from taking over the Sangha
              Council. What if they cannot? Do we face the prospect of Dhammakaya having the
              last say in what "true" Buddhism is? Even if it can, should we allow
              anyone to monopolise the teachings?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Why should we
              think our Thai Theravada Buddhism is purer than Buddhism as practiced in other
              countries? Isn't this part of nationalism, of egotism, which is exactly what
              the Buddha teaches us to transcend?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhikkhuni face a
              special threat under the new charter.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At present, the
              clergy insists the Theravada bhikkhuni lineage is extinct, thus cannot be
              revived. They fiercely insist their opposition does not stem from gender
              discrimination, but from their strict observance of original rules related to
              female ordination which require double ordinations from the male and female
              clergy. With the Theravada bhikkhuni lineage already extinct, they argue, new
              female ordinations are simply impossible.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many Buddhist
              experts disagree. In ancient times, female monks were involved with only
              initial preparations for the ordination to be performed by monks. So even when
              there are no female monks present, male monks can still ordain women. The
              elders say no. Worse, they threaten to punish any monks for ordaining women and
              also for showing their support for bhikkhuni.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The clergy see it
              as a technical problem. Others see it as sheer misogyny.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With the draft
              charter allowing the clergy not only to monopolise the teachings but also to
              punish any individuals and groups that undermine Buddhism -- read the clergy --
              it is possible that female monks will be targeted in future crackdowns.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If the current
              draft charter cannot protect female monks, then the people can. Disillusioned
              with monks' widespread misconduct, people are increasingly seeking spiritual
              teachers outside the male-dominated clergy. It is now no longer necessary for
              spiritual teachers to be monastics.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As long as the
              bhikkhuni are maintaining their spiritual paths and cordial relations with
              local communities, there is no stopping female ordination.</span></p>
