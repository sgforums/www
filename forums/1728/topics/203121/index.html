            <div class='col-md body'>All of us end in one place, either heaven or hell. That is the common belief of most religions. Does Buddhism share this viewpoint?<br><br>What was the religious thinking in India at the time Of Buddha<span style="color: blue;">?Â“God created everybody; god is responsible for everything; god will reward; god can forgive all our sins; and god is responsible for our lives after our death; god will send us to heaven or he will send us to hellÂ”. </span><br><br><strong>These are the basic ingredients of all religions even today.</strong> At the same time there were certain other religions also in India which taught that it was necessary for believers to torture their physical bodies, thinking that they could wash away all their sins during their lifetimes so they could go to heaven after death.<br><br>Another religious group encouraged religious rites and rituals and ceremonies and animal sacrifices to please their gods. This group believed that through these practices they could go to heaven. Some others again introduced prayer and worship and asked forgiveness for the sins committed.<strong> The Buddha did not recognise the efficacy of all these practices</strong><br><br><strong>It was in a religious climate such as this that the Buddha appeared</strong>.The Buddha did not promise heavenly bliss and rewards to those who called themselves his followers nor did he promise salvation to those who had faith in him. <strong>To him religion was not a bargain but a noble way of life to gain enlightenment and salvation.</strong>  The Buddha did not want followers with blind faith; he wanted human beings to think and understand.<br><br>The world is indebted to the Buddha for the rise of rationalism as protest against the superstitions of religion. It is he who emancipated man from the thraldom of the priests. <strong>It is he who first showed the way to free man from the coils of hypocrisy and religious dictatorship</strong>.<br><br>According to Buddhists, even those who have no Â“religionÂ” but who live in dignity, with compassion and goodwill can Â“go to heavenÂ”, that is, experience happiness.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">When we are happy and contented we are in Â“heaven.Â” When we suffer physically or mentally we are in Â“hell.Â” There is no need to wait to die to experience either of these states. </span><br><br>Buddhism is unique because we can talk about this Â“religionÂ” even without any reference to heaven or hell. I am sure that others cannot talk about religion in this way.  The BuddhaÂ’s message of goodwill and understanding to all beings is a universal message.<br><br><strong>A well known American rationalist who lived a long time ago, once said that to his observation, he would prefer to go to hell rather than heaven, because of the concept maintained by some religionists that all intellectuals, scholars, scientists, psychologists, free-thinkers, rationalists, including the Buddha, were all in hell as they did not believe in their God. He said that in that case, if he happened to go to Heaven, he would feel out of place there without any intellectuals, and heaven would be a very dull place. As far as he was concerned heaven is a place only for those who want to enjoy worldly pleasures without using their brains. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Pls read</span><br><br><a href="http://www.ksridhammananda.com/pictures/PUBLI/BUDDHIST%20COINCEPT%20OF%20HEAVEN%20%20HELL.pdf#search='buddhist%20concept%20of%20heaven%20and%20hell'" rel="nofollow">Buddhists Concept Of Heaven &amp; Hell</a></div>

True happiness can only come about when a person completely loses his or her egoistic concept of a Self or Â“IÂ”. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

He is not regarded as violating god's will or as a person who must beg for divine mercy and forgiveness.

Many of us believe that our entire existence is only a life span beginning the moment we are born or conceived and ending the moment we die. We believe that we are born from nothing and that when we die we become nothing. And so we are filled with fear of annihilation.<br><br>The Buddha has a very different understanding of our existence. It is the understanding that birth and death are notions. They are not real. The fact that we think they are true makes a powerful illusion that causes our suffering. The Buddha taught that there is no birth, there is no death; there is no coming, there is no going, there is no same, there is no different; there is no permanent self, there is no annihilation. We only think there is. When we understand that we cannot be destroyed, we are liberated from fear. It is a great relief. We can enjoy life and appreciate it in a new way.</span><br><br>- Thich Nhat Hanh: No Death, No Fear</div></blockquote>Since Unborn, in Buddhism, no creation and origin, nor death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NT2:</div><div class="quote_body">Buddhism deny creation -  no answer for our origin<br><br>Buddhism does not have salvation - no solution for our sins<br><br>Buddhism is jus a way of life - for wat when there's no origin, no God and no salvation.</div></blockquote><strong>No Coming, No Going</strong><br><br>For many of us, our greatest pain is caused by our notions of coming and going. We think that the person we loved came to us from somewhere and has now gone away somewhere. But our true nature is the nature of no coming, no going. We have not come from anywhere, we shall not go anywhere. When conditions are sufficient, we manifest. When conditions are no longer sufficient, we no longer manifest. It does not mean we do not exist. Like radio waves without a radio, we do not manifest.<br><br>Not only do the notions of coming and going not express reality, neither do the notions of being and non-being. We hear these words in the Prajnaparamita Sutra: "Listen Shariputra, all dharmas [phenomena] are marked by emptiness, they are neither produced nor destroyed, neither increasing nor decreasing."<br><br>The meaning of emptiness here is very important, it means first of all to be empty of a separate self. Nothing has a separate self, and nothing exists by itself. If we examine things carefully we will see that all phenomena, including ourselves are composites. We are made up of other parts. We are made of our mother and father, our grandmothers and grandfathers, our body, our feelings, our perceptions, our mental formations, the earth, the sun and innumerable non-self elements. All these parts depend on causes and conditions. We see that all that has existed, exists or will exist is interconnected and interdependent. All that we see has only manifested because it is a part of something else, of other conditions that make it possible to manifest. All phenomena are neither produced nor destroyed, because they are in a constant process of manifesting.<br><br>We may be intelligent enough to understand this, but to understand it intellectually is not enough. To really understand this is to be free from fear. It is to become enlightened. It is to live in inter-being.<br><br>We have to practice looking deeply like this to nourish our awakened understanding of no birth and no death in our daily lives. In this way we can realise the wonderful gift of non-fear.<br><br>If we just talk about inter-being as a theory, it will not help us. We should ask: "Piece of paper, where do you come from? Who are you? What did you come here to do?" We can ask the flame: "Flame, where do you come from and where will you go?" Listen to the reply closely. The flame, the piece of paper, is replying by its presence. We only have to look deeply and we can hear it reply. The flame is saying: "I do not come from anywhere."<br><br>That would be the answer of the japonica flowers also. They were not the same and not different. They did not come from anywhere and they did not go anywhere. If there is a baby who is lost, we should not be sad. It is because there were not sufficient causes and conditions for it to arrive at that time. It will come again.<br><br>- Thich Nhat Hanh: No Death, No Fear</div>
