              <p>This book was borrowed from the library a few days ago. I would like to share them with fellow Buddhists and interested parties.</p>
              <p>Excerpts from the Editor's Preface (Marcus Borg):</p>
              <p>...As a Christian, I have lived with Jesus all of my life. I have not lived with the Buddha.  In adulthood, I have become a non-exclusivist Christian.  It seems clear that "the sacred" has been known in all of the makor religious traditions, and I do not think that Christianity is the only adequate religion, even though it is my "home".</p>
              <p>Thus I write as a Jesus scholar and a devoted but non-exclusivist Christian.  Buddhists might see matters differently, and I know that some Christians would.  But the cumulative product of my thinking and experience is the conclusion that Jesus and the Buddha are the two most remarkable religious figures who have ever lived.</p>
              <p>Moreover, there are striking similarities between them.  I have sometimes said that<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong> if the Buddha and Jesus were to meet, neither would try to convert the other - not because they would regard such an effort as hopeless, but because they would recognise one another.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p> ...As a Christian, there was a time when I thought Christianity was the only way - the only true religion. It was part of the inherited belief of my childhood. There came a time when this belief crumbled, and all religions looked like human interventions. The disappearance of my belief in the uniqueness of Christianity was accompanied by a skepticism about religions in general.</p>
              <p>In more recent years, my appreciation of religious pluralism - my acquaintance with a number of the world's religions, and my studies of religious experience across cultures - has reversed that skepticism.</p>
              <p>The parallels among the religions (especially at the level of experience and teaching about "the way", though not very much at the level of doctrine) suggest that there is something here worth taking seriously.</p>
              <p>In short, seeing the parallels between the wisdom teaching of Jesus and the Buddha adds to the credibility of both. Acceptance of religious pluralism need not generate skepticism, but can provide grounds for saying, "Here is something I must not ignore".</p>
              <p>And so I invite you to ponder the parallels between these two enlightened teachers of an enlightenment wisdom. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The path of which they both speak is a path of liberation from our anxious grasping, resurrection into a new way of being, and transformation into the compassionate life.</strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>Some parallel sayings on Compassion:</strong></p>

              <p>Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. From anyone who takes away your coat, do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. </p>

              <p>If a religion/faith was managed with 'true of heart' and sincerity, there would never have been such great separatism of Man as a result of differences in faiths and beliefs in our world today.</p>
              <p>Both Jesus and Buddha had important roles and missions to carry out on Earth. Converting and fighting each other's followers (in words, thoughts or deeds) was never once on their mind. Unfortunately, those who came after them had other interpretations of their original teachings, whether intentionally or otherwise. No texts being circulated in this world today were written <strong>100% personally </strong>by them, only those who came after them. No teaching style being used in this world today were used <strong>100% personally </strong>by them, only those who came after them.</p>
              <p>For anyone with a religion or faith, he should ask a trusted friend of a different religion or faith, what he thinks of him truthfully. If someone cannot find such a trusted friend in multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-faith peaceful Singapore, then obviously, some self-reflection is seriously needed to understand why that is so.</p>

              <p>Buddhism was born in a India, where he refuted the basis of an eternal soul independent of a body, and also an eternal creator.In this way, the teaching are different from Hinduism. He also teaches what that be attainable by man, through his own efforts, each for himself. In short, one is accountable for one's future, and not to be dependent of an external god.  Buddhism believes in reincarnation but not an eternal soul.  </p>
              <p>Christianity is god based as are many of the other monothestic religions, where salvation is only possible through christ.Obedience is called for, that believers are part his flock, The lines are clearly drawn, salvation or eternal condemnation upon judgement day. With exception of the state called limbo. Once a person dies,he either goes to heaven or lies in dead slumber, until risen to face judgement.</p>
              <p>So one is an inclusive religion, yet not polytheistic, the other is an monotheistic, exclusive.</p>
              <p>Also in christianity, stewardship of animals are given for man's consumption, so eating animals is a right. So compassion and lovingkindness is not extended to animals or their suffering. </p>
              <p>Buddhism,Ioving kindness extends to all sentient beings, including the devas and asuras, where else the gods of polytheistic beliefs are regarded as demons, fallen angels.  Any mediumship or channelling is is understood to be demonic in nature. </p>
              <p>Most importantly, Buddhism believes in inherent goodness of man, hence Buddha nature, through cultivation and practice of mindfulness, nirvana, or cessation can be achieved. Whereas all human are sinners due the original sin, however, many good deeds is done, cannot wash away the sins. Only through the blood of christ and accepting him, one can be redeemed or "reborned".  </p>
              <p>Loving kindness is unconditional, bodhisattvas make great vows to help all sentients being,regardless of beliefs. However, the love in christianity, is ultimately reserved for those who accept christ, the rest is condemned in hell. You will be able to read of god leashing in anger and obliterating objects of his anger in the bible.</p>
              <p>In many aspects ,christianity is dualistic in nature, where else not budhism is not. Others may be able to put in context  better then me. </p>

              <p>He who sees the Dharma sees me, the Buddha lives in the Dharma, the Sangha. To say otherwise, is not understand the Buddha,or his teachings. Buddhahood is attainable by each for himself, although that is not to say it is going to easy.</p>

              <p>If a religion/faith was managed with 'true of heart' and
              sincerity, there would never have been such great separatism of Man
              as a result of differences in faiths and beliefs in our world
              today.</p>
              <p>Both Jesus and Buddha had important roles and missions to carry
              out on Earth. Converting and fighting each other's
              followers (in words, thoughts or deeds) was never once on
              their mind. Unfortunately, those who came after them had other
              interpretations of their original teachings, whether intentionally
              or otherwise. No texts being circulated in this world today were
              written <strong>100% personally</strong> by them, only those who
              came after them. No teaching style being used in this
              world today were used <strong>100% personally</strong> by
              them, only those who came after them.</p>
              <p>For anyone with a religion or faith, he should ask a trusted
              friend of a different religion or faith, what he thinks of him
              truthfully. If someone cannot find such a trusted friend in
              multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-faith peaceful Singapore, then
              obviously, some self-reflection is seriously needed to understand
              why that is so.</p>

              <p>It's easy to view ourselves as holy and superior, if our personal social circle shares our same faith/belief. But ask a trusted friend of a different belief system what he thinks of us truthfully, and we'll get a more accurate picture, not one through rose-tinted glasses. There are people (of various religions/faith/beliefs) who seem to have this invisible protective field around themselves whenever they talk down another religion/faith/belief. If one does not dare and is not ready to see the true image of oneself, how can one be ready to comment on image of others?</p>

              <p>the root of this is the understanding of the core teachings of both religions. much of this understanding for most people are shaped by an important condition: interpretations. of cos there are countless conditions that shaped both religions to what they are today, and interpretations is one big condition through the time until now.</p>
              <p>of cos when i reflected upon my own interpretations of the teachings of both religions, i can recognize the many other conditions that came into play. just to share a few: my understanding had been shaped by my immediate family and friends and their opinions, the environment, the interpretations of the teachings from the relevant teachers etc.</p>
              <p>what im pointing to is that i start to question ' is what is being explained (by someone) the real meaning?'</p>
              <p>to quote from above,</p>
              <p>JESUS</p>
              <p>Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. </p>
              <p>JOHN 1.17</p>
              <p>the first interpretation that we have of this statement will be different based on the different conditions of our lives. and since everyone's interpretation is different it is then, upon reflection, that it is very possible the real meaning is lost.</p>
              <p>and also the way the teachings had been presented in its language also makes it difficult for us to realize that much of them are in fact similar.</p>
              <p>hopefully i make sense here :)</p>

              <p>From my experience, it will be easier to convert free thinkers to Buddhists if you explain to them the differences between other religion and Buddhism.

              <p>Buddhism was born in a India, where he refuted the basis of an eternal soul independent of a body, and also an eternal creator.In this way, the teaching are different from Hinduism. He also teaches what that be attainable by man, through his own efforts, each for himself. In short, one is accountable for one's future, and not to be dependent of an external god.  Buddhism believes in reincarnation but not an eternal soul.  </p>
              <p>Christianity is god based as are many of the other monothestic religions, where salvation is only possible through christ.Obedience is called for, that believers are part his flock, The lines are clearly drawn, salvation or eternal condemnation upon judgement day. With exception of the state called limbo. Once a person dies,he either goes to heaven or lies in dead slumber, until risen to face judgement.</p>
              <p>So one is an inclusive religion, yet not polytheistic, the other is an monotheistic, exclusive.</p>
              <p>Also in christianity, stewardship of animals are given for man's consumption, so eating animals is a right. So compassion and lovingkindness is not extended to animals or their suffering. </p>
              <p>Buddhism,Ioving kindness extends to all sentient beings, including the devas and asuras, where else the gods of polytheistic beliefs are regarded as demons, fallen angels.  Any mediumship or channelling is is understood to be demonic in nature. </p>
              <p>Most importantly, Buddhism believes in inherent goodness of man, hence Buddha nature, through cultivation and practice of mindfulness, nirvana, or cessation can be achieved. Whereas all human are sinners due the original sin, however, many good deeds is done, cannot wash away the sins. Only through the blood of christ and accepting him, one can be redeemed or "reborned".  </p>
              <p>Loving kindness is unconditional, bodhisattvas make great vows to help all sentients being,regardless of beliefs. However, the love in christianity, is ultimately reserved for those who accept christ, the rest is condemned in hell. You will be able to read of god leashing in anger and obliterating objects of his anger in the bible.</p>
              <p>In many aspects ,christianity is dualistic in nature, where else not budhism is not. Others may be able to put in context  better then me. </p>

              <p>woah it is a good read for me... interesting....</p>
              <p>I do not know much about Christianity so I hope what u write is neutral.</p>
              <p>Afterall, we still have the freedom to choose which religion suit us.</p>

              <p>This verse sounds very Buddhist. Why is knowledge of good and bad forbidden? Isn't it a good thing? The story appears metaphorical not literal.</p>
              <p>The original mind preconceptual is non discriminative and doesn't have the concepts of good and bad, me and others. This is opposite to ignorance or original stupidity in paticcasamupada that <span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 14px;">Dependent on Ignorance arise Activities (Moral and Immoral).</span></p>
              <p>Subsequent teachings differ in that salvation depends on an outside agent and the belief in eternity in heaven and hell. They became confused due to the political interference from the Roman rulers.</p>

              <p>I had read about the "The Lost Years of Jesus" somewhere. It said during these lost years when there was no biblical record of Jesus whereabouts. It said there was a Russian journalist Nicolas Notovitch found an ancient Buddhist scripts in one of an ancient temple in Tibet which recorded the arrival of someone who fits the description of Jesus from Israel.</p>
              <p>He said Jesus been to Tibet to learn Buddhist Teachings which explained why there are many similarities between teachings of Buddha and Jesus.</p>
