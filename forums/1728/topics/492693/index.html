              Rain is hammering down onto the canopy, causing thick water drops to coalesce
              on leaves and fall heavily onto the earth.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>As dawn approaches,
              a rhythmic, elongated Pali chant can be heard through the trees. An orange
              candle illuminates a heavily bearded man, draped in tiger skin, who is sitting
              cross-legged on the ground in a morning ritual to bless the rainforest ahead of
              the coming day.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>He goes by the name
              Ruesee Ketmunee and is one of a disappearing breed of mystics. The word<span> </span><em>ruesee</em><span> </span>has many interpretations, but it can
              be best translated as ‘sorcerer’. The direct translation, ‘forest monk’, fails
              to take into account the fact that many ruesee practice magic. And they are a
              far cry from the region’s long tradition of forest-dwelling monks, falling
              somewhere between sage, monk and wizard.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Ketmunee splits his
              time between his rented house outside a rural village and the nearby forest.
              This part-time return to the modern world came in 2013, after he had lived in
              caves for five years.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>A cultural descendant
              of the<span> </span><em>rishi</em><span> </span>hermit sages of India, the priorities
              of each individual ruesee differs: some act as healers, and others perform
              magic for hire, such as curse removals or exorcisms. Some also claim the
              ability to bring wealth and good fortune through the amulets and potions that
              they create and bless.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>A more traditional
              purpose is to live an austere, simple life so as to gain a deeper
              understanding of the universe, in imitation of the Buddha. It is estimated that
              fewer than 100 remain in Thailand, and many ruesee, who are outcasts from
              mainstream Theravada Buddhism, find it difficult to gain widespread acceptance.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Far from the
              Uttaradit jungle, in a suburban housing estate outside of Chiang Mai, a gaggle
              of disciples dressed mostly in white mingle in the front yard of a modern
              townhouse. Forming a loose line, one by one they enter the living room where
              Ruesee Phuttavet, dressed in black and wearing dark sunglasses, sits
              atop a small stool. This is a<span> </span><em>waikrue</em>,
              or ‘master worship’, ceremony commonly found in schools and temples across the
              country. Today, it comes with a ruesee twist.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>“Ruesee are meant
              to help people, heal people, help bring them closer to the Buddha,” Phuttavet
              says. “As long as I am capable, I will help with whatever they ask.”</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Day to day, Phuttavet
              assists people with problems ranging from spiritual to financial and romantic,
              offering both guidance and practical solutions, as well as healing physical
              ailments. Often, this help comes in amulet form: one amulet to help with family
              life, another to bring great wealth. He also offers a variety of potions, which
              he mixes himself. Love potions garner the most attention and come with a
              warning to use responsibly.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Before the waikrue
              ceremony begins Phuttavet holds up a ceremonial dagger and proceeds to gently
              push it into the roof of his mouth. A stack of white linen sheets is laid in
              front of him and he spits blood onto each of them. Once finished he lifts his
              head and opens his jaw to show that, miraculously, he hasn’t suffered any
              wounds. The sheets will later be distributed amongst his devotees as good luck
              charms.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>As each disciple
              finally enters the room, they fall to their knees at Phuttavet’s feet. A large
              golden mask, moulded into the face of a ruesee god, is lifted over their heads
              as Phuttavet mumbles a blessing.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>While some politely
              proffer their thanks and move on, others erupt into an uncontrollable frenzy,
              howling and thrashing about on the floor as assistants attempt to pin them
              down. “The mask unlocks the spirits inside of them. Particularly if they have
              spirit tattoos – if they have a tattoo of a tiger, they will act like a tiger,”
              Phuttavet says. “This gives them strength and courage.” Typically, the fits
              last no more than ten to 20 seconds before worshippers pull themselves up off
              the floor and sheepishly move on.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Hailing from a
              family of ruesee and magic men, Phuttavet describes the “clear path” that was
              laid out for him. “My father was a magic teacher and my grandfather was a
              ruesee, so I was always going to go into this line of work.”</span></p>
              <h2 style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #080808; '>Social

              is very much a ruesee of the modern age. He is internationally travelled,
              speaks serviceable English, owns three properties and holds a master’s degree
              in Thai language from Chiang Mai University. His Facebook page boasts more than
              4,000 followers, and a fan page has also sprung up, managed by his disciples.
              He posts Instagram-style shots that document his spirituality. Through Facebook
              and his online shop, he sells charms, amulets and potions for the devotee in
              need.</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'></span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Back at the small
              jungle camp in Uttaradit, Ketmunee reminisces about a tougher upbringing, with
              fewer opportunities, in Thailand’s impoverished Isaan province. “My father was
              a poor farmer. I worked in a rubber factory when I was 14 after spending time
              as a novice monk. But I always knew I wanted to do something more spiritual.”</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Ketmunee displays
              his worldly possessions on a straw mat: two grey cloths cut and worn in the
              same style as monk robes, a linen bag, leopard-print hat, sleeping mat with
              blanket, a book of holy texts and his bead necklace. “I lived with just this
              for all those years in the caves,” he says, patting the bag. “You can find
              whatever you need in nature, and if I get sick I can just heal myself.”</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span class="s1"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>While
              ruesee often have a small following of disciples, they are considered to be a</span></span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'> </span></span><a href="http://sea-globe.com/thai-nationalism-and-the-rise-of-buddhist-extremism/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #080808;'>niche part of

              elements of Hinduism leaves mainstream Theravada adherents uneasy. </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'></span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span class="s1"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'> “Belief in ruesee is separate to organised
              religion,” says Somkiat Lophetcharat, a Thai religious scholar. “It’s a strand
              of belief not incorporated into any mainstream religious practice.”</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'></span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Somchot Ong-Sakul,
              associate humanities professor at Chiang Mai University, points out that ruesee
              played a significant role in ancient Thai kingdoms, such as Lanna 1,000 years
              ago, and were instrumental in founding the cities of Chiang Mai and Lamphun.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span class="s1"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>“However,
              the ruling classes were uneasy about the degree of power the ruesee held. They
              wanted to keep their status as rulers, and the privileges given to ruesee were
              gradually phased out,” Somchot says. “Thai people today are wary of the ruesee
              because of preconceptions that ruesee aren’t Buddhist. They aren’t associated
              with righteousness like Buddhism is.”</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'></span></p>

              magic, curses and even murder swirl. Most Thais have never seen a ruesee in the
              flesh, except on television where they are typically portrayed in period dramas
              as eccentric sorcerers with sinister powers.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>The second floor of
              Phuttavet’s townhouse does little to dissuade this stereotype, with its statues
              of gods holding giant phalluses, Hindu sculptures showing couples embracing in
              Kama Sutra sex positions and bottles of love potions stacked in the corner.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>“We’re not monks.
              That’s what is so useful about ruesee. We can help with things that monks will
              not want to talk about,” Phuttavet says, referring to matters of love and lust.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Turning to the
              subject of murders rumoured to have been orchestrated by ruesee, his grin
              disappears. “There are some cases of this, but the vast majority of us are
              good, just like everyday people. Sometimes, though, people come to ask of me
              spells I will not do – I have morals just like normal people,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>In Uttaradit,
              Ketmunee chuckles when asked about the portrayal of ruesee in the media. “I
              don’t really watch television, but we are nothing like how they portray us. I
              just like to be alone, to focus on my meditation, to bless the world around
              me,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Yet he still feels
              the need to modernise. With the help of a loyal disciple, he started a Facebook
              page in 2013 that now has more than 1,000 followers. He also posts heavily
              edited photos of himself, along with mystical amulets and status updates
              quoting Buddhist texts.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>This ancient
              profession is now taking advantage of social media marketing as ruesee look to
              shape their personal style of magic into a brand. The largest financial income
              for many ruesee comes via the international touring circuit. Popular
              destinations include Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, countries where a
              belief in mystics is commonplace and those with an air of the exotic find
              themselves in high demand. Phuttavet and Ketmunee both travel overseas to hold
              blessing ceremonies and healing seminars.</span></p>
              <p class="p3" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span class="s1"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'>Ketmunee
              is targeting the lucrative, growing Chinese market and regularly posts images
              on Facebook accompanied by text in Mandarin – online marketing graft that seems
              to be paying off. A follower recently travelled from China just to receive a
              blessing. As with monks, ruesee claim to accept money purely on a donation
              basis, but you can’t put a price on spiritual enlightenment. This business plan
              appears to be capturing a niche but rich market. The disciples at Phuttavet’s
              waikrue ceremony, for example, all appear to be wealthy and successful.</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #232323;'></span></p>

              has travelled from California for the waikrue ceremony. “I come every year;
              it’s extremely important to me,” he says. “I used to be in the army, and before
              I was deployed to Afghanistan I put on an amulet [blessed by Phuttavet]. I had
              a few close calls there, bombs exploding right next to me. I’m certain the
              amulet saved my life.”</span></p>

              <p>To really renounce one worldly life, there have to be some weariness of our current existence. These are not Buddhist practice per say, comes as part of the package of their heritage. Simply was, simply is.</p>
              <p>There are practising laymen and there are devotees, and there are both. These contribute to the material support of the renunciate community.</p>
              <p>Institutionalized monkhood is prevalent in  South East Asian Theravadan countries. Most will return to lay community after a stint. Some of the Buddhist values get reinforced with the community at large.</p>
