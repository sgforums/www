              Enlightenment?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Sander Tideman Jan. 5, 2017
              Wall Street Journal</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Facebook shareholders could benefit if the company’s CEO
              takes up Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Over the holidays, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that
              he is no longer an atheist. “I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period
              where I questioned things,” he wrote in (appropriately) a Facebook post, “but
              now I believe religion is very important.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It isn’t clear whether Mr. Zuckerberg is returning to Judaism
              or instead embracing his wife’s religion, Buddhism. But in the past he has
              described the latter faith as “an amazing religion and philosophy” in which he
              has taken a keen interest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I have studied the intersection of Buddhist meditation and
              business for years. I’ve also had several conversations with the Dalai Lama
              about what modern business could learn from the faith. Along with intangible
              spiritual benefits, Mr. Zuckerberg might soon realize that studying Buddhism
              could be good for his company.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism places a strong emphasis on critical analysis. Its
              founder, Shakyamuni Buddha, said some 2,500 years ago that his followers should
              examine his teachings like gold buyers, carefully scrutinizing the authenticity
              of the object. So let’s examine how the practical aspects of Buddhist ideas
              have found their way into the business world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In today’s fast-paced economy, stress is endemic, especially
              in knowledge-based industries. Overstress causes workplace absence, drains
              productivity, and increases health-care costs. In most organizations success
              relies on the very things that unhappiness and stress erode—collaboration,
              creativity, focus and cognitive flexibility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Put simply, business leaders can’t succeed in the “outer”
              world if they haven’t mastered their “inner” world. This is where
              meditation—that is, training the mind—comes in. In Buddhism the mind is the
              beginning and end of meditation. Disciplining the mind can remove all cognitive
              and emotional errors. Once these flaws are gone, one can achieve a state of
              lasting happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Research from the neuroscientists Richard Davidson and Sharon
              Begley shows that regular meditation causes measurable changes in brain
              patterns, improving mental, physical and emotional health and well-being. This
              provides a basic inner stability to help business leaders deal with several
              challenges and tasks simultaneously while objectively considering their
              options.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A particular form of meditation popular in the West is
              mindfulness. This involves paying purposeful attention to inner experiences
              with calm and curiosity. People are all too familiar with the opposite: a
              heedless, distracted state that is akin to operating on autopilot. This default
              inattentiveness and disengagement from present experience can mean we react to
              life out of habit or impulse rather than care, openness to new solutions and
              consideration. A business leader like Mr. Zuckerberg, whose firm must
              constantly innovate, cannot afford to become stuck in old ways of doing
              business.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yet this fusion between Buddhism and business is not without
              risks. Evan Thompson, a philosopher at the University of British Columbia who
              studies cognitive science, has pointed to the danger of “McMindfulness,” a
              cheapened and diluted meditation. In the original Buddhist context,
              mind-training generally occurred in a communal setting with a defined set of
              ethics and transcendent purpose. When mind-training occurs in a context of
              maximizing shareholder value, for example, it could lead to someone’s being
              unnecessarily hurt in the pursuit of profit. This results in “negative karma,”
              suffering of someone else and oneself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lama also emphasizes the ethical dimension of
              meditation: The very purpose of training the mind is to be of more benefit to
              others, he says. But he does not believe this necessarily conflicts with the
              purpose of business, which should likewise be geared toward creating value for
              clients, employees and the communities that they are part of. Business is meant
              to create societal value, according to the Dalai Lama, and in the long run a
              company’s success depends on the society’s success. This is in line with
              another key tenet of Buddhism: Everything in life is deeply interconnected and
              interdependent. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is emerging consensus that meditation at the office
              enhances workers’ sense of personal well-being and happiness. But it isn’t
              clear yet whether this can help enhance social and ecological well-being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">From a Buddhist viewpoint, this would be the next step in
              leadership development: recognizing how the inner world of the CEO—his mind-set
              and motivation—drives all business outcomes. The goal would be to create more
              value for the organization, customers and society. For someone running as
              important a business as Facebook, that isn’t a bad deal. Something, perhaps,
              for Mr. Zuckerberg to meditate on.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">HOW CAN YOU TELL IF SOMEONE IS
              ENLIGHTENED?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the start of his book „Precious Teachers“ Sangharakshita tells that he has
              sometimes been asked if one of his teachers was more spiritually developed than
              the rest. He goes on:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">„A
              similar question was once put by a disciple to one of the members of the celebrated
              trio of spiritual masters that was made up of Chattrul Rimpoche, Jamyang
              Khyentse Rimpoche, and Dudjom Rimpoche… The master replied, „One of us is
              indeed more spiritually developed than the others, but you disciples will never
              know which one it is.“</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              unenlightened disciple cannot see directly into an enlightened person’s mind.
              But if this is the case, how, then, is a spiritual follower to determine
              whether a teacher is enlightened? This is a very relevant question when,
              nowadays, many teachers and authors of books claim to be enlightened. To
              provide an answer let’s turn to what the Buddha himself said in the Pali Canon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Pali Canon to be enlightened is to be completely free of the three root
              poisons of greed, hatred and delusion. There is no compromise in the Pali Canon
              with this definition of enlightenment. I’m emphasising this because many modern
              claims of enlightenment are clearly not based on such a straightforward and
              stringent definition, but are instead based on a claim of some experience of
              insight or glimpse of enlightenment that, however, does not destroy the root
              poisons of greed, hatred and delusion. Because of this we have the confusing
              situation where many people claim to be enlightened even if they sometimes
              acknowledge that they still have much work to do to overcome their limitations.
              In other words they are not free of greed, hatred and delusion. According to
              the Buddha’s own definition they are not enlightened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              how, then, could we tell if someone was enlightened? In the Canki Sutta the
              Buddha advises that the proper test of the truth of someone’s claim to be
              enlightened is an examination of their conduct for any evidence of greed,
              hatred or delusion. If we cannot see directly into a person’s mind to test
              whether they are enlightened or not, we can nevertheless rely on the indirect
              evidence of their ethical purity or otherwise. A person’s actions of body and
              of speech are a decisive indicator of the extent of their spiritual attainment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Vimamsaka and Thana Suttas the Buddha gives some detailed advice on how to
              go about testing the ethical conduct of a teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Is
              the appearance of ethical purity a recent phenomenon or has it been
              consistently evident for a long time? Here the Buddha is advising caution with
              initial appearances, and even suggests that one of the ways to examine a
              person’s behaviour is to get close to them and to live next to them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              person’s behaviour should then be carefully examined in a variety of
              circumstances, watching not just for initial responses but paying attention to
              what might happen later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              does the person respond when faced with adversity? If suffering the loss of a
              relative or of wealth, or becoming ill, does the person respond with
              equanimity? Do they reflect that suffering happens when one clings to the self,
              or do they become afflicted with sorrow and grief?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              they become a popular and even famous teacher, how do they respond to such
              popularity and fame?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              their dealings with other members of the sangha, do they say one thing to one
              person and something else to another? Are their later dealings in harmony with
              their earlier dealings? Do they publicly rubbish some members of the sangha
              whilst praising others?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              they make false claims in their conversations and teachings, saying that they
              know or see things when they don’t?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              they avoid indulging in sensual pleasures out of fear of the consequences, or
              because they are truly without lust?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              teaching or in discussion how does a person respond to an issue? How do they
              apply reasoning? Are they dull? Can they make the meaning plain and clear?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These
              are tough criteria! But they are minimum ethical standards expected of someone
              who claims to be enlightened. And, of course, it would also be expected of an
              enlightened person that they were unfailingly compassionate and kind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              where does this leave us if, when we look at our spiritual teachers, we
              conclude that we either do not know them well enough to be able to judge them
              in the way the Buddha suggests, or we conclude that, as far as we can tell,
              they are not enlightened? Let’s return again to Sangharakshita;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">„For
              my part, I have never tried to find out how my teachers compared with one
              another, spiritually speaking. Indeed, I never thought in such terms. It was
              enough that they were vastly superior to me in wisdom and compassion and that,
              by a strange combination of circumstances, I had come to be in contact with
              them and could benefit from their teaching and spiritual influence.“</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              our own observations we can surely judge whether someone is spiritually
              superior to ourselves, even if we also see imperfections in them. I made a
              decision fourteen years ago to go and live at a retreat centre with fellow
              buddhists I regarded as my potential teachers. I lived for six and a half years
              in everyday close proximity to them and was able to clearly see their virtues
              and their failings – as they could also see mine! — and was able to gain
              enormous benefit from their spiritual example. None of my teachers would claim
              to be enlightened but it is enough that they are my kalyana mitras (spiritual
              friends) whose guidance is invaluable to my spiritual progress. They do not
              have to be perfect to be invaluable teachers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              if we ourselves become teachers then we have a tremendous responsibility to be
              honest with others about our personal failings and not to give, or encourage
              others to hold, misleading impressions about our own spiritual attainments.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              if your spiritual teacher claims to be enlightened then why not follow the
              advice of the Buddha in the Vimamsaka Sutta, and directly ask them „ Can you
              honestly say that you never give way to any feelings of anger or irritability
              or to any feelings of lust or desire? Can you honestly say that you fully
              understand that all things whatsoever are impermanent, that life is
              unsatisfactory, and that everything is empty of fixed and separate self-nature;
              and can you honestly say that you always act in accordance with this
              understanding? “</span></p>
