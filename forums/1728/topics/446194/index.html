              <p>No time to translate to english. But there's a sutta that also talks about a similar instance:</p>
              <p>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.5.03.than.html</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Once, monks, in this very Rajagaha, Suppabuddha the leper was the 
                  son of a rich money-lender. While being escorted to a pleasure park, he 
                  saw <a id="tag" name="tag">Tagarasikhi</a> the Private Buddha going for 
                  alms in the city. On seeing him, he thought, 'Who is this leper prowling
                   about?' Spitting and disrespectfully turning his left side to 
                  Tagarasikhi the Private Buddha, he left. As a result of that deed he 
                  boiled in hell for many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of
                   years, many hundreds of thousands of years. And then as a result of 
                  that deed he became a poor, miserable wretch of a person in this very 
                  Rajagaha. But on encountering the Dhamma &amp; Discipline made known by 
                  the Tathagata, he acquired conviction, virtue, learning, relinquishment,
                   &amp; discernment. Having acquired conviction, virtue, learning, 
                  relinquishment, &amp; discernment on encountering the Dhamma &amp; 
                  Discipline made known by the Tathagata, now — on the break-up of the 
                  body, after death — he has reappeared in a good destination, the 
                  heavenly world, in company with the devas of the heaven of the 
                  Thirty-three. There he outshines the other devas both in beauty &amp; in
                   glory."</p>

              <p>hi jacky,</p>
              <p>this is not a translation but i roughly tell u what one part of article is about.</p>
              <p>Once, Shen Kai Reverend sent one of his monk disciple to bring a lay disciple to come to his temple immediately, it was an unusual request because the trip back and forth takes several hours and the disciple could have come up the mountain on his own. But it seemed to be due to an urgent matter.  When the disciple arrived, Reverend was quite stern (different from his usual amiable self) and asked this lay disciple to think back whether he did anything wrong as the Reverend had summoned him there to help him purify a very serious karma. The  lay disciple recalled that once he had come upon a very ragged-looked monk and due to his discrimination, he had given rise to disdain on this ragged monk.  He asked the Reverend if this was the matter in question.  The Reverend then informed this disciple that the monk he had seen was in fact an Arhat and that his attitude of disdain had created a very serious karma.  He then asked the disciple to repent and bow down 108 times...</p>

              I think we have to take into account of the dharma books and materials too?
