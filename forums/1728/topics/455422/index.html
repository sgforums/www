              Asunthatneversets:
              
              True dzogchen is a non-causal vehicle, but some mistake this as advocating that nothing need be done, and that this present afflicted awareness is indeed "it" when it surely isn't. The master reveals the nature of mind, which is an innate quality (that is why it is non-causal) and then that knowledge must be cultivated (also why the nature of mind is simultaneously the base, path and fruit). Rigpa is the "knowledge" of the basis (i.e. the nature of mind). Mistaking this present "awareness" as it is a grievous mistake. Although there is a thin line between ignorance(avidya) and wisdom(vidya), they are worlds apart. 
              
              "The sage oriented toward realization who explains to every flawed person with little merit he meets, 'The genuine realization that whatever arises is the nature of the dharmakaya is itself self-arisen wisdom,' and 'Absorption is accordingly nescience and manas,' teaches what is tantamount to a fabrication that seduces beings. Because of this, one sees [disciples] who are cut off from the profound dharma, which will not be found elsewhere. Such a teacher is a thief of this vehicle. There are many appearing nowadays". - Jigme Lingpa
              
              "Designating appearances as the dharmakaya obscures me,
              designating whatever appears as mind obscures me,
              designating wisdom as mind obscures me"
              - Samantabhadra (The Natural State)

              <p>Thanks, i did think it was a little dangerous when u mentioned mind and nature is the same.</p>
              <p>I have read that the pith instructions section (mengagde) sometimes contains contradicting instructions because they are relevant for people at different stages/capacities. So it is important to be discerning.</p>
