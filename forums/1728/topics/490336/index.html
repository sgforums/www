              a student's troubles to confront the human suffering in the Middle East.</span></p>

              colleague called out and asked me to mediate in an argument he was having with
              a student about the Middle East. I was running late, so, with a burst of
              laughter, I spontaneously answered, "They are all crazy over there! That
              is all you need to know."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Those words have haunted me ever since, both because of their flippancy
              and because I meant them. I did not have time to enter a discussion then, and I
              was—to an extent—just kidding. But I did believe, although I never admitted it,
              that everyone in the Middle East <em>was</em> crazy, that it was that simple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There is something deeply troubling about this view, and I've heard it
              voiced often. For many of us, the Middle East is a land of insanity. We watch
              the news and can barely wrap our minds around the images bombarding us. We hear
              of suicide bombers. We see sobbing Israelis searching the streets for the
              remains of those they have lost. We hear of the Palestinian water crisis while
              watching Israelis water their luscious mango trees. We see militant
              Palestinians chanting at the camera and Israeli soldiers, faces frozen,
              wielding their weapons. We see so many crying mothers, hardened fathers,
              children on the front lines. We see bombs falling in Lebanon. Again. It is no
              wonder most of us simplistically choose a side or cut ourselves off from it by
              concluding that they are all equally insane.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I've been thinking lately about a dear student of mine from a few years
              back. Ahmed (I've given him a pseudonym) was a Palestinian Muslim living in the
              Diaspora. He, too, was in pain, confused, enraged. He belonged to a community
              that was suffering, but he lived far from it. Guilt plagued him. He wanted to
              express his solidarity with his suffering brothers and sisters. He wanted to do
              so all the more because he was living here in comfort, far from the turmoil:
              his pain and anger were transparent. His wasn't the kind of anger that seethes
              beneath the surface, but an open anger, an open confusion, an open quest for
              identity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>For some reason Ahmed sought me out. He took my religion courses and frequently
              visited my office. He knew of my Arabic-Jewish heritage, and he knew of my
              Buddhist practice and faith. He didn't spare me his anger, however. During the
              wave of suicide bombings in 2002, for instance, he ran into to my office after
              an attack and asked in angry glee, "Did you see that? Wasn't that
              great?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Ahmed was goading me, eager to draw me into a fight. But I wasn't taking
              the bait. After one particularly gruesome attack—more than a dozen killed and
              hundreds injured—I knew enough to expect him bright and early the next day.
              Sure enough, he appeared, exclaiming triumphantly, "That was a good one,
              wasn't it? We really got a lot of them this time!" I looked at him quietly
              and asked, "What exactly is it that you're looking for, Ahmed? What kind
              of a reaction do you want? Why do you keep doing this?" He didn't have an
              answer, but I could see that he was tormented. He made a point of coming to see
              me at these times. Had he been truly hateful, he would have spent his energies
              elsewhere. But I knew he was looking for something, so I waited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Eventually, Ahmed took a Buddhism course with me. Halfway through the
              term, he appeared at my door and asked, "To practice compassion the way
              the Buddhists do, what would I have to do?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We had been discussing the monastic precepts, the first of which is to
              avoid harming all living beings. I had given the students an assignment on the
              precepts, and Ahmed was genuinely trying to understand what they meant and how
              he might implement them. I suggested that, for starters, he not celebrate
              violence. If he wanted to go a step further, he might even consider apologizing
              to some of the students he had fought with—verbally and physically—about the
              Middle East. Ahmed said he couldn't possibly do it. His honor was at stake,
              along with his pride and his standing with his community. Besides, it wasn't
              his fault alone. He'd been provoked, taunted, pushed around by the Jewish kids.
              Why should he apologize?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A few days later I heard Ahmed was wandering the school looking for
              students he had fought with. Apparently, he was making amends. He even posted a
              letter on the "Jewish side" of the cafeteria—a public apology. He did
              not expect any apologies in return. A few days later, he showed up at my door.
              Neither of us said anything, but I certainly smiled. <br> <br> <strong>I
              HAVEN'T SEEN</strong> Ahmed much since he graduated. I hear from him
              every once in a while, or I am given his regards through a friend. He is an
              engineer now, working hard, and successful. He remains involved in the
              Palestinian struggle for independence, and, so I am told, he refers to me as
              the teacher who made him apologize. That always makes me laugh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Ahmed was written off by many students and teachers during his time at
              college. He was a troublemaker, bringing the chaos and pain of the Middle East
              into our backyard in a way that made many nervous. Concordia University, only a
              few blocks from our campus, had been experiencing quite a bit of turmoil
              centered on the Middle East, and nobody wanted that turmoil to spread.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The fear we had of students like Ahmed laid bare our collective aversion
              to anything too difficult, complicated, or painful. We wanted his raw suffering
              to go away. Would it not be so much nicer if all our students were happy? But
              life isn't that way. As the First Noble Truth so emphatically declares, life is
              suffering. People in Israel, in Palestine, and throughout the Middle East are
              openly suffering. It would be nice if they were all happy, but they are not. It
              would be nice if we could make sense of it all, but most of us cannot. It would
              be nice if we could at least take sides in good conscience, but most of us
              cannot do that either.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Middle East is the perfect teaching ground. It points its fingers at
              us and asks, "Can you handle this? Can you look at me and see me as I am?
              Can you take in my suffering? How good is your bodhisattva vow when you see
              me?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When we talk of the bodhisattva vow in Buddhism, we talk about extending
              our arms and our hearts outward, about reaching out to the whole world and
              embracing all, without exception. We talk about truly seeing the ones standing
              before us and loving them deeply, just as they are, with their many faults. The
              challenge the Middle East presents us with is the very same challenge presented
              by Shantideva some thirteen hundred years ago: Can you be a bodhisattva? Can
              you love everyone and not become suffocated by the pain? When I flippantly
              disregard the Middle East and all of its pain, I am only revealing my personal
              limitations. I am telling others, and myself, that it is too much for me, that
              my arms are not yet wide enough to provide for all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A recent visit to Israel/Palestine opened my heart in ways I did not
              anticipate. I looked around and saw suffering much more than ever before. I
              cried daily, and I continue to cry every time I think about it seriously. But
              the tears don't scare me. They are freeing up space in me, so that I may be
              capable of taking in even more.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I heard a lovely Sufi story during my stay. God sent an angel down on
              earth and asked it to return with the most precious thing in the world. The
              angel descended and returned with jewels, silks, books, art—in short,
              everything that we naturally associate with man-made beauty—but none of these
              was right. So the angel descended again, and this time returned with one
              solitary and delicate human tear. God looked at it and smiled. It was what He
              was looking for. </span><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
