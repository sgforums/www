              His Holiness The Dalai Lama of Tibet </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">19 March 2017 Jane Cook,
              Tibet Post International</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Bhopal,
              Madhya Pradesh, India – The spiritual leader of Tibet, His Holiness the Dalai
              Lama described himself as a "son of India" and hailed the secularism
              prevailing in the country. "I am living in India for the past 58 years and
              hence, I am a 'son of India'. In the field of secularism there is no other
              country like India," the Noble Peace Prize laureate said in his speech
              after inaugurating an international seminar on Buddhism in Bihar's Nalanda
              district, on Saturday, 2017.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“India
              is the only country where all the world’s major religious traditions live
              together. Now Indians need to be more active in promoting religious harmony,
              especially in those places where conflict is going on in the name of religion.
              The time has come to share your longstanding traditional values of religious
              harmony and secularism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Holiness observed that a special feature of Buddhism is that it takes a
              scientific approach. “No other religious tradition states so clearly that
              simple faith is not enough. The Buddha encouraged his followers to examine and
              investigate what they are told. This is why Einstein suggested that Buddhism
              can augment modern science," he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Indeed,
              many scientists today are showing genuine interest in Buddhism in general, and
              particularly in what Madhyamaka philosophy and the Buddhist science of mind
              have to say. “Over the last 1000 years we Tibetans have kept the Nalanda
              tradition alive. Now the time has come for us to share this knowledge with our
              Buddhist brothers and sisters, with non-Buddhists and even those who have no
              particular religious faith. “</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sunday
              morning His Holiness the Dalai Lama drove to the nearby Nava Nalanda
              Mahavihara, which was established as a university in 1951. He was welcomed by
              the Vice Chancellor, Shri M.L. Srivastava. Before addressing more than100
              students and faculty in the University's conference hall, His Holiness planted
              a Bodhi Tree Sapling and unveiled a commemorative plaque on a new
              administrative building.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"When
              I was in Tibet my thoughts were narrow. But when I moved out of my homeland and
              came to India, I developed a broader thought about Tibet as well as about the
              entire world. The Nalanda school of thought was an important aspect of
              Buddhism. "Whatever I am today is due to the Nalanda thoughts", he
              said. The spiritual leader of Tibet stressed that good education would help
              develop tolerance among mankind and inculcate the habit of forgiveness.
              "Today's system of education is making us a consumer. The traditional mode
              of education was good," His Holiness added at Rajgir that is known globally
              for the Nalanda University, a historic seat of learning. The new Nalanda
              University, which has come up near the historic site, is also drawing
              international attention.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Holiness recalled visiting the University in 1956, when he was in India
              participating in the 2500th Buddha Jayanti Celebrations organized by the
              Mahabodhi Society of India. "Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai was supposed to
              visit Nava Nalanda Mahavihara, but for some reason he was not able to do so. I
              was asked to go in his stead. At that time I was a Vice Chairman of the
              Standing Committee of the National People Congress of the People's Republic of
              China. Today, I visit you as a refugee."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Stressing
              the importance of applying themselves in their studies, His Holiness advised
              the students: "Merely wearing the robes of a monk or nun is not
              sufficient. You must also study seriously. Today, Tibetan nuns, having spent 18
              to 20 years in rigorous study, have achieved the highest degree of Geshe-ma.
              They have become equal in scholarship to their monk counterparts who are
              Geshes. On the one hand Buddhism focuses on our inner world through the
              practice of meditation, but we also make extensive use of logic and reasoning.
              As a result, Buddhists in India, and here at Nalanda in particular, were able
              to rise to challenges from non-Buddhist traditions, taking them as an
              opportunity to develop and deepen their understanding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"You
              should deepen your knowledge through listening to your teachers and reading a
              broad range of books. It is by comparing one point of view with another that
              you come to understand the subject matter more extensively."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Before
              returning to Rajgir, His Holiness presented the University with a statue of
              Buddha Shakyamuni and a Tibetan Thangka (scroll painting) that he commissioned
              featuring the Buddha in the centre surrounded by 17 great masters of Nalanda.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Back
              in Rajgir, His Holiness participated in the morning session of the second day
              of the International Conference on The Relevance of Buddhism in the 21st
              Century. He and nine senior monks from Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia, and
              one senior nun from Thailand, took turns addressing the audience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I
              have really enjoyed this meeting," His Holiness told the conference.
              "I'm especially pleased to see how many people have come from different
              Buddhist countries. It's not an easy journey, yet the fact that so many of you
              have come shows your concern for the Buddhadharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"In
              this 21st century we are facing many problems of our own making. Humanity as a
              whole has a responsibility to find solutions to, for example, the violence and
              killing that is going on in many places and the unnecessary starvation stalking
              parts of Africa. Similarly, we have to learn to do more to take care of our
              environment," he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              added: "If the Buddha were able to transfer us to another planet once this
              planet becomes uninhabitable we could relax. But that isn't possible. This
              planet is our only home, so we have to take care of it. As Buddhists I believe
              we also have a responsibility to promote religious harmony. We should create opportunities
              to meet more regularly to exchange ideas. We can learn from each other."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              Holiness pointed out that observance of the Vinaya or monastic disciple and
              teachings like the Four Noble Truths are fundamental to all Buddhist
              traditions. He suggested that some followers of the Pali tradition might also
              find it helpful to pay attention to Sutras from the Sanskrit tradition, such as
              the Heart Sutra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              conclusion, His Holiness thanked the Government of India, and the Ministry of
              Culture in particular, for organizing this important conference. As the session
              came to an end he presented each of his fellow speakers with a statue of the
              Buddha and a white silk scarf.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              monks and scholars from various countries are participating in the seminar 'Buddhism
              in 21st Century' being held at International Convention Centre, about 100 km
              from the capital Patna.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              a quick lunch, His Holiness left for Gaya. From there he flew to Bhopal where
              he was received on arrival by the Honourable Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh,
              Shri Chouhan Singh, who welcomed him on behalf of the people of the state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Monday
              morning, His Holiness has visited Turnal to participate in the Narmada Sewa
              Yatra, an initiative of the Madhya Pradesh State Government dedicated to the
              saving of water and the conservation of the Narmada River. In the afternoon,
              the spiritual leader has delivered a talk on the 'Art of Happiness' in the
              auditorium of the Vidhan Sabha---the State Assembly.</span></p>
