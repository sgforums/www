There's one art exhibit that my friend has been telling me but I need to check out with him if its still there. If you're talking about Buddhist Art/Sculpture they all differ from culture to culture. Like those 'Zen' kind of art (from japan and china) has a more simplistic feel. Tibetan art is a little different.. you can go images.google.com and search 'tibetan thangkas'. Music in Buddhism is certainly something quite new to many Buddhists.. we do sing in the dharma centres and create Buddhist music.<br><br>As to your question 'Where do you guys go to hang out in Singapore? I know this might sound cheesy, but are there any 'buddhist hotspots' around Singapore where people go to discuss, practice, meditate, etc?', there are really a lot of dharma centres around in Singapore where we do that.. discuss, practice, meditate, etc.<br><br>As for Buddhist-inspired products, I am not too sure... maybe others may know.</div>

But anyway, just some contributions... These are some things u might wanna look out for:<br><br>- There's a book sold in Evergreen which attempts to trace the development of Buddhism in SIngapore. Won't say it's fully comprehensive, but I think it's quite a fair reflection of the development. It is a MUST if you want to study the evolution of BUddhism and its culture in Singapore. Forgot the book title, check it out with the staff.<br><br>- Buddhist youth groups, I guess u could check out the Singapore Buddhist Mission youth group; Phor Kark See Youth Ministry; Buddhist Fellowship; Fo Kwang Shan; Tzu Chi; there's a Buddhist meditation group that uses Cheng Beng Buddhist Society for their weekly meditation group practice, mostly are youths, but I can't remember the group's name, so maybe u can check with Cheng Beng. And of course check out all the Tertiary Institute Buddhist Societies,  (NYP, NP, SP, NUS, NTU, not sure if SMU has any yet). THere are also many temples where many youths congregate for various purposes maybe for dharma lessons etc but they may not be formally organized as a "youth group" per se. OK for my own sentimental sake, I just want to mention about the now-no-longer-existing Viriya Young Buddhist Fellowship which used to comprise 30-odd youths from the #buddhism channel from the MIRC. Though it's non-existent now, many youths from the VYBF are now actively involved in other BUddhist organizations or continue to be Buddhist students and practitioners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>- You also may want to check out the Buddhist Youth Leadership Training Course which used to be developed by Cheng Beng Buddhist Society and forgot which organizations. Later I think it was adopted by the Buddhist Fellowship then I don't know what happened after that.<br><br>- And then there are the Buddhist conferences. The almost yearly Global Conference on Buddhism check it out on http://www.buddhistfellowship.org/bf_new/pages/main/index.html Recently there was also the Mahayana Buddhist Conference.<br><br>- Not to forget the annual celebrations of Vesak Day at the various Buddhist temples and societies. And of course those three-step-one-bow, bathing the baby Buddha, countdown, singing songs, Dharma talks, etc.<br><br>- Also large-scale retreats attract youngsters too, like the annual Om Retreat, the Meditation retreat held for professionals by Dharma Drum, and I think a lot more which I don't know or can't finish listing.<br><br>- where they congregate. Needless to say, the temples they are affiliated with. And also some other places where there are teachings/activities maybe like the Awareness Place Meditation Centre; where there are Sunday schools like PHor Kark See, Tai Pei Buddhist Centre, Buddha Mangala Vihara, Singapore Buddhist Mission; where there are Buddhist courses, like Amitabha Buddhist Centre, Sagaramudra, Phor Kark See, Hui Yan Jing She, Foo Hai Chan Monastery; where there are Buddhist shops, like Awareness Place, Kwan Yin Chan Lin; vegetarian restaurants, like Su Shi Lin (opposite of Evergreen bookshop), Magenta Cafe, Fo You Yuan, Ci Hang, Yogi Hub, The Whole Earth, Quality Hotel; where there are welfare services, like SIngapore BUddhist Welfare Services, Tzu Chi, Metta, Ren Ci, Viriya Community Services; Buddhist shops, like Evergreen, Awareness Place, Ren Ting etc. Of course not to forget the wonderful Buddhist Library!<br><br>- Buddhist music. Nobody has a full grasp of its development, but everybody knows it's develoing albeit slowly. Check out the "Dharma Resonance" which holds regular performances at the Ark Cafe (http://www.dharmaresonance.com/). Check out the CDs by Wayfarers (which I'm sure you can't find many now), Bodhicitta, D-Kidz (http://d-kidz.com/), and many many new songs by the Tertiary Institute Buddhist Societies. Check out the religious music sections at the Buddhist bookshops. You'll find an amazing collection. There are also many informal bands made up of BUddhist youths who want to experiment with Buddhist music but they are probably not so well known.<br><br>- Buddhist art. Unfortunately i'm no artistic person. Can't help you much. But I remember last Vesak, there was an exhibition on Gandhara Buddhist sculpture exhibition. Think there are 1-2 art galleries at Bras Basah complex that have very nice and artistic Buddhist sculptures.<br><br>- Movies with Buddhist themes/Buddhist-inspired. Can't say that all of them are Buddhist-inspired, but many certainly seem to be so. Little Buddha, Matrix, Da Zhi Lao, The Cup, Travellers &amp; Magicians, Kundun, Seven Years in Tibet, Angulimala, Words of My Perfect Teacher, Zen &amp; Love. Check out the International Buddhist Film Festival http://www.ibff.org/<br><br>- Check out all the various Buddhist magazines at the Buddhist book stores.<br><br>- Buddhist online games, such as http://dharmagames.org/<br><br>- Have a search on the yahoogroups to see if you could find local online Buddhist groups. Also online forums like this one lor.<br><br>If there are too many names and organizations that I mentioned above which you're unfamiliar with, try a search at http://www.4ui.com/indexeng.htm it is one of the most comprehensive directory of local Buddhist services and activities.<br><br>Also, do you happen to be a NUS student? There's a current NUS student whom I know used to do a paper on Development of Buddhist Culture in SIngapore, something like that. If you're interested, you could try to approach him. Let me know if you need to.</div>
