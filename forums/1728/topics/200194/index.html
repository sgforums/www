There must be the quality of clarity... shi fu says... in practising the dharma, even the tiniest insect - perhaps a mosquito which flies past you, you will be aware. he also mentioned before, meditation in buddhism is not a form of concentration that is practised in other religions... in which he gave an example (not in exact words but along this line):<br><br><blockquote>At one time, a meditator exclaimed to the Buddha how great his meditative experience was. He said 500 vehicles passed by, he did not know any of it at all.<br><br>The Buddha replied: I also had great meditative experience. 500 Vehicles pass by, I am aware of every single one of them.</blockquote>500 vehicles passed by, Buddha wasnt disturbed. meditation isnt escaping from 6 sense experience, but be fully aware (and thus undisturbed).<br><br>So i believe the point is whether you are shivering or just breathing what matters most is the level of mindfulness.<br><br>In terms of anapanasati, we must be so closely aware of the breathing, we must know the sensation, the coldness or warmness of the air, the 'touch' of the air... sense it fully. is there effort required to bring awareness? no... when you drop all labels and wandering thoughts, the breathing itself knows... this is the function of the buddha nature. it takes no effort to see, smell, touch, it takes place by itself, it is awareness itself. no effort to control anything at all...<br><br>We are bound to get physical and mental disturbance in meditation especially when we are still not trained in them... it's ok, do not resist them, accept them as it is and be aware. ultimately you're not seeking some kind of great experience in meditation, good or bad doesn't matter, but to remain conscious throughout. if thoughts has been creeping up in your mind, ignore them, dont be interested in them and they will pass. Do not treat as if the thoughts have anything to do with you and they will just fall away.<br><br>Anyway good u're starting to meditate.</div>

In most cases, if have done all these, then your concentration shouldn't be affected by your body and shivering of your head.<br><br>I can only tell you the steps, but the actual technique has to be acquired by your own. There are many methods in meditation, best if you can take up a meditation class and guided by a zen master.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Buddhism, we never say that we must meditate. (Sitting) Meditation is one out of 84000 dharma doors... We also do not tell those people who just stepped into Buddhism that they need to practise meditation everyday. For example, you cannot expect ever old person to meditate everyday... We can only encourage them to chant 'Namo Amitabha' regularly. It depends on each individual... In fact not only old people, some healthy adults do not have time for meditation due to busy schedule. That is why shi fu advocates 'Dong4 Zhong1 Xiu1' is very important.<br><br>It is true that the most important thing is to practise in everyday living, this is most important, however, it is also told that those who 'receive dharma transmission' (chuan fa) in ren cheng should have the habit of sitting meditation... best is to sit at least 30 minutes everyday. Why... because sitting meditation can develope our samadhi better. It is quite difficult to develope that kind of samadhi in everyday living. And then of course, essentially, after meditation we have to bring that meditative state into the living. This is most important.</div>
