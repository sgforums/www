              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="kosambi" name="kosambi">Kosambi</a>, at <a id="ghosita" name="ghosita">Ghosita</a>'s
               monastery. Then in the early morning, having put on his robes and 
              carrying his bowl and outer robe, he went into Kosambi for alms. Having 
              gone for alms in Kosambi, after the meal, returning from his alms round,
               he set his own lodging in order and — without calling his attendant or 
              informing the community of monks — set out wandering, alone &amp; 
              without a companion.</p>
              <p>Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, a certain monk went to <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> and on arrival said to him, "Just now, my friend Ananda, the Blessed 
              One set his own lodging in order and — without calling his attendant or 
              informing the community of monks — set out wandering, alone &amp; 
              without a companion."</p>
              <p>"Whenever the Blessed One sets his own lodging in order and — without
               calling his attendant or informing the community of monks — sets out 
              wandering, alone &amp; without a companion, he wants to live alone. He 
              is not to be followed by anyone at such times."</p>
              <p>Then, after wandering by stages, the Blessed One came to <a id="parileyyaka" name="parileyyaka">Parileyyaka</a>. There he stayed at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree.</p>
              <p>Then a large number of monks went to Ven. Ananda and on arrival 
              exchanged courteous greetings. After an exchange of friendly courtesies 
              &amp; greetings they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they 
              said to Ven. Ananda, "It has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma 
              talk in the Blessed One's presence. We want to hear a Dhamma talk in the
               Blessed One's presence."</p>
              <p>Then Ven. Ananda went with those monks to where the Blessed One was 
              staying in Parileyyaka, at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree, and on 
              arrival, after bowing down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting
               there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, &amp; encouraged them
               with a talk on Dhamma.</p>
              <p>Now, on that occasion this train of thought appeared in the awareness
               of one of the monks: "Now I wonder — knowing in what way, seeing in 
              what way, does one without delay put an end to the effluents?"</p>
              <p>The Blessed One, perceiving with his awareness the train of thought 
              in the monk's awareness, said to the monks, "I have analyzed &amp; 
              taught you the Dhamma, monks. I have analyzed &amp; taught you the four 
              frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases of power, 
              the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for Awakening,
               &amp; the noble eightfold path. And yet, even though I have analyzed 
              &amp; taught you the Dhamma, still there appears this train of thought 
              in the awareness of one of the monks: 'Now I wonder — knowing in what 
              way, seeing in what way, does one without delay put an end to the 
              effluents?'</p>
              <p>"Well then — knowing in what way, seeing in what way, <em>does</em> one
               without delay put an end to the effluents? There is the case where an 
              uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones,
               is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard 
              for men of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma —
               assumes form to be the self. That assumption is a fabrication. Now what
               is the cause, what is the origination, what is the birth, what is the 
              coming-into-existence of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, 
              run-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt born of contact 
              with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. And 
              that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That 
              craving... That feeling... That contact... That ignorance is inconstant,
               fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It is by knowing &amp; seeing in 
              this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents.</p>
              <p>"Or he doesn't assume form to be the self, but he assumes the self as
               possessing form... form as in the self... self as in form... or feeling
               to be the self... the self as possessing feeling... feeling as in the 
              self... self as in feeling... or perception to be the self... the self 
              as possessing perception... perception as in the self... self as in 
              perception... or fabrications to be the self... the self as possessing 
              fabrications... fabrications as in the self... self as in 
              fabrications... or consciousness to be the self... the self as 
              possessing consciousness... consciousness as in the self... self as in 
              consciousness.</p>
              <p>"Now that assumption is a fabrication. What is the cause, what is the
               origination, what is the birth, what is the coming-into-existence of 
              that fabrication? To an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, touched by
               the feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That 
              fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is inconstant, 
              fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That craving... That feeling... That 
              contact... That ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently 
              co-arisen. It is by knowing &amp; seeing in this way that one without 
              delay puts an end to the effluents.</p>
              <p>"Or he doesn't assume form to be the self... but he may have a view 
              such as this: 'This self is the same as the cosmos. This I will be after
               death, constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change.' This 
              eternalist view is a fabrication... Or... he may have a view such as 
              this: 'I would not be, neither would there be what is mine. I will not 
              be, neither will there be what is mine.' This annihilationist view is a 
              fabrication... Or... he may be doubtful &amp; uncertain, having come to 
              no conclusion with regard to the true Dhamma. That doubt, uncertainty, 
              &amp; coming-to-no-conclusion is a fabrication.</p>
              <p>"What is the cause, what is the origination, what is the birth, what 
              is the coming-into-existence of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, 
              run-of-the-mill person, touched by what is felt born of contact with 
              ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. And that 
              fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That 
              craving... That feeling... That contact... That ignorance is inconstant,
               fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It is by knowing &amp; seeing in 
              this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents."</p>
