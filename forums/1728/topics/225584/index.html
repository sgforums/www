            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NewAge:</div><div class="quote_body">frm books, martial art books like books on tai chi and aikido.

Aikido: concentrate on breathing under the state of mindlessness. I also read a book that says focus between the eyebrow.</div></blockquote>Tai chi and aikido is a bit different from Buddhism because if I am not wrong, Tai Chi has a sort of using intent to regularise, control the breathing am I right? In Buddhism our meditation does not involve regulating the breath. From your description aikido may also be a form of shamatha, concentration practise. Aikido if I am not wrong is Buddhist related. That is also one way to practise.<br><br>But best is to learn from a Buddhist teacher the right meditation practise. The quality of clarity, awareness, is quite important in mindfulness of breathing especially in Insight practise. It is like zooming into the minutest details of the breathing with clear knowingness (i.e you know whether the air is hot or cold very clearly, the quality of sensation), but no intent, effort or 'self' involved. It is not merely a concentration practise because it is not fixated at any particular objects, the breathing is flowing, not something dead or fixed.<br><br>Focusing between eyebrow is not recommended especially if you are not under guidance of a spiritual teacher.<br><br>In another topic where a person is being threatened to take up mediumship...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Have you practised concentration without proper guidance especially in focusing between the eyebrow? Cos this can open up the channel for medium.<br><br>I am told by a friend.. thusness, that <span style="font-style: italic;">There are several reasons, it can arise due to karmic affinity, it can arise due to karmic debt, it can arise due to wrong practices.  If he practice concentration without proper guide especially focusing in between the eyebrown, it might open up the channel for medium.  Without proper guidance, this could happen.</span><br><br>If it is due to karmic affinity and karmic debt, then i think it is easier to solve as the experience negotiator can do something about it.  But if one practices wrongly, that level stays and is open...this can be quite troublesome.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes thats right. Often this needs to be done.. if you want to overcome yourself without such help with negotiators, then you must be prepared to suffer many years, it can take years and depending on your practice... no doctors can help. We must start practising the dharma diligently ourselves to overcome such situations. If you practice no-self and is able to experience presence in the correct way, it does not affect you. Because there will be no entry point. When we are constantly authenticated by Presence and there is no entry for that trance level to take place.  That level of consciousness does not exist.  No external forces can forcefully create that communication unless it is open due to some reason.  Due to lack of proper practices.<br><br>Thats wat i learnt from thusness.</div></blockquote></div>

Our days at work and school are filled with non-ergonomic tasks and habitsÂ—staring at computers, lugging heavy shoulder bags, and cradling the phone in the crick of our necks. Now our backs are paying the price. According to a Duke University study, back pain is costing the country $90 billion a year.<br><br>Beyond back pain, bad posture can aggravate other problems like joint degeneration and osteoarthritis. "Bad alignment predisposes you to joint and muscle stress, which may lead to back pain and arthritis," says Shirley Sahrmann, professor of physical therapy at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.<br><br>Here's how it worksÂ—or doesn't work: Sitting at a badly arranged workspace, for example, tilts the torso forward, placing extra tension on the spine and causing it to curve. Your muscles then adjust to this newfound position. From there, chest muscles shorten and abdominal muscles weaken, while back muscles stretch and overextend. Also, this posture can compress and contribute to the breakdown of cartilage between your vertebrae. Over time, this can contribute to osteoarthritis. In short, "our bodies weren't designed to sit all day," says Tammy Bohne, a chiropractor in New York City.<br><br>To combat this rampant slouching, straightening one's back should be simple enough. But according to John Christman, standing straight is not enough. You must build, stretch, and retrain your muscles to counteract slouching. Christman, who has a Ph.D. in biophysiology, has developed an exercise program that strengthens and stretches muscles for better body alignment. "Posture is not about the vertebrae being knocked out of alignment. It's about muscle strength and you have to do the work."<br><br>Christman and Bohne offer a few tips for the slouch in all of us. First, find out if your posture is at risk by asking these questions:<br><br>1. By the end of the workday, are your neck and shoulders more tired than the rest of your body?<br>2. Are your shoulder muscles significantly more developed than the rest of your body? Do they feel rock hard?<br>3. Does a neck and shoulders massage give you tremendous relief?<br><br>If you answered yes to any of these questions, your posture may need help.<br><br>How to Improve Your Posture:<br><br>* Maintain a slight tension at your belly button, pulling it toward your back. This tightens the abdominal muscles to support your rib cage.<br>* Stretch your chest. Face a wall and lift one arm up at a right angle against the wall, turn your body away while your arm is still against the wall and feel the stretch across your chest. Hold for a few moments and switch sides.<br>* Stretch your hamstrings. Sitting shortens these muscles, causing tension in the lower back and weakened abdominal muscles.<br>* Strengthen your back muscles. Hold your arms in front of you, with your hands in loose fists. Pull back and squeeze the shoulder blades together.<br><br>Sometimes it's the little things that count. According to Bohne, most people are not aware of proper ergonomics.<br><br>* Be aware of your posture. The more familiar you are with proper alignment, the easier it is to maintain.<br>* Don't overload yourself with a heavy bag worn over one shoulder. Find a good fitting, double-strapped backpack and don't overload it.<br>* Avoid high-heeled shoes.<br>* Get a firm mattress and sleep on your side or back.<br>* Invest in an ergonomic chair.<br>* Don't cradle the phone receiver between your neck and shoulder.<br>* Your computer screen should be at a 15-degree angle.<br>* Take a break from your desk every hour or two and move around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mmm i just came bk from dharma camp. The venerable says a straight back help to keep one from falling asleep while practise meditating.<br><br>My two cents of worth.<br><br>If your back is hurt or u are suffering from backache. It is okay not to do meditation with a straight back. You can sit on a chair and meditate too.Wisdom comes with concentrating on the breathe i.e if you are practising breathing meditation. Whether you are doing with an absolute straight back or not...i think it is okay. Just made sure one posture is conducive for meditation i.e Not too comfortable or too comfortable.<br><br></div>
