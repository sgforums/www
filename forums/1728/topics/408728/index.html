              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 17px;">People with wrong views say, “Don’t take the precepts. What do you want to take them for? Why get some precepts to restrain you?” That is a wrong view. You think that not receiving precepts is being free. But it’s very easy to fall into the hells that way. That's where your so-called "true freedom” may lead you.<br><br>If you receive the precepts, you will have the protection of precepts. The precept marks, percept dharma, and precept substance will support you. You will not fall into the hells that easily. Even if you do fall into the hells, you will get out quickly. If you like to be free and don’t take precepts, then later when you fall into the hells, it's not for sure when you will come out.<br><br>On the other hand if you have received precepts your time span in the hells can be shortened. It is like when someone who committed a major crime gets caught by the police. If the criminal had worked as a personal guard or an attendant for the president, then the president may write a note ordering that criminal's release. If the criminal doesn’t have such connection, he won’t be released for who knows how long. It is similar to that. When you have the protection of precepts, the long duration of your suffering can be greatly condensed. Therefore, don’t get smart and say, “It’s good not to receive the precepts.”<br><br>It’s good for you to receive the precepts. Let me say this to you, “Having taken the Buddha’s precepts, living beings enter the position of all Buddhas.” When living beings take the precepts of Buddhas, it’s the same as having entered the position of the Buddha. Therefore, don’t disparage the precepts or slander the Vinaya of the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><strong>WHAT IF I BREAK THE PRECEPTS?</strong><br><br><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 17px;">Precepts are the mother of Buddhahood. If you want to become a Buddha, you must uphold precepts and not break them. Having transgressed the precepts is just like drifting in the ocean in a leaking boat. Won't the boat sink? Violating the precepts is just like causing the boat to sink in the ocean. When you have received the precepts, you must uphold them. If you don’t, it’s the same as having leaks. When you leak, you are not free of outflows. Having no outflows comes when we do not break the precepts; when you break the precepts, you have outflows. What should you do if that happens? You must mend the precepts. How? You may create merit and virtue either by making monetary donations or by doing volunteer work. By redeeming your offenses and establishing merit before the Triple Jewel, you will wipe out your offenses.</span></p>

              <p>My two cents is it depends on the level the person is upholding the precepts. The five precepts teach us to be unselfish, because we only break the precepts when we are selfish.<br><br>At the strictest level, last paragraph of the link states how the precepts should be uphold...<br><br><span style="font-family: ï¿½sï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½; line-height: 32px; font-size: 19px; text-transform: uppercase;">WHAT ARE PURE PRECEPTS?</span><br><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 19px;">You should pay attention to the word “pure.” What does “pure” mean? It means being pure and clean, free from all defilement. Not having the slightest defilement is the kind of purity in which not even a single thought arises.<br></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 19px;"><br>Not killing includes purifying our thoughts. If we uphold precepts on the surface and claim that we don’t kill, but we complain about others constantly or get angry with people, we are still violating the precept against killing.<br></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 19px;"><br>Not stealing includes mental states. We don’t have to steal physically. When we envy other’s wealth or talents, or become jealous of people, we transgress the precept against stealing.<br></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 19px;"><br>Not committing sexual misconduct includes not having improper thoughts about the opposite sex. If we indulge in improper thoughts about the opposite sex, then we are being impure and breaking the precept.<br></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 28px; font-size: 19px;"><br>Holding the precepts purely means leading a clean life without any defiled thoughts. That is to hold the precepts purely.</span><br><br>But if we tell people "hey, you have to cut off those thoughts that break the precepts immediately", hardly anyone in this day is willing to hold the precepts because we can't cut off these thoughts immediately. So when starting out first observing the precepts usually we just keep it at body and speech. However, as we progress on the path, we should upgrade the plan, and sweep our minds clean and hold these precepts in our mind as well.<br><br>Meat is tricky because people like to eat it. My 2 cents is, if a person is keeping precepts on the strictest level, meat should be avoided. But the general case is the 3 kinds of pure meat is accepted. So again, my 2 cents is how strictly a person wants to uphold the precept.<br><br>Yes, taking alcohol is definitely breaking the 5th precept.</p>
              <p>Although the 5th precept did not mention gambling or taking drugs to get a high or smoking, they are indirectly implied - because not taking alcohol is not to confuse the mind. Drugs confuse the mind. Maybe smoking and gambling not to the extent of drugs, but it's still a form of greed that is addictive and should be abandon. Smoking and gambling is also against the practice of the ten good deeds of avoiding greed and wrong views.</p>

              <p>Even though Buddha did not include gambling in 5 precepts, he actually advised thus:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7. "And what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoided? Young 
              man, heedlessness caused by intoxication, roaming the streets at 
              inappropriate times, habitual partying, compulsive gambling, bad 
              companionship, and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>11. "These are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling: 
              winning breeds resentment; the loser mourns lost property; savings are 
              lost; one's word carries no weight in a public forum; friends and 
              colleagues display their contempt; and one is not sought after for 
              marriage, since a gambler cannot adequately support a family.</p>
