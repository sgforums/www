              Dear All,
              
              I am keen on Buddhism and lately I am keen on the Nichiren Buddhism tradition that teaches the chanting of "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" (å�—æ— å¦™æ³•èŽ²å�Žç»�) or the title of the Lotus Sutra. This tradition of Buddhism was founded in Japan.
              
              I would to know what do other Buddhists from view about this school of Buddhism as I also read on website that this form of chanting the title of the Lotus Sutra was not taught by Shakyamuni Buddha?? Is this true? There are Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu and Soka that I know of this tradition of Buddhism.
              
              Can chanting this title of the Lotus Sutra still be able to rebirth in western paradise?
              All views and opinions will be greatly appreciated! 
              
              Thank you =)

              Hi Peace For All
              
              I am into chanting Namu Myoho Renge Kyo which is upholding the title of the Sutra. According to Lotus Sutra Dharani-Chpter 26, the Buddha told the rakshasa women that it is a meritorious acts to protect those beings who receive and uphold even the name of the Dharma flower. Hence upholding the title of the Sutra has been a form of practice practised by Chinese Tien Tai Master, Zhiyi.
              
              As for the question life after death, Nichiren advocate follower to seek rebirth in Land of Eternal Tranquillity Lights, known aså¯‚å…‰åœŸ which is also a Buddha Pureland. In Nichiren Shu, we dedicate our merits in our routine prayer ç¥ˆæ„¿æ–‡ã€‚ã€‚å�Œå½’å¯‚å…‰hoping all beings to return to it. However, please do not mistaken this Pureland as Amitabhaâ€™s Pureland, because in Buddhist cosmology, there are many Purelands. Why Nichiren advocate this? Because we believe that Eternal Shayamuni Buddha is still sharing the truth of Lotus Sutra and the complete enlightenment to beings there based on Chapter 16, Lotus Sutra.
              
              Finally, Nichiren advocate his followers to live our life to the fullest, so that we can be a blessing to others in the little we can especially when we are alive. The transformation begin in our heart when the mind is pure, the land is pure. When the mind is defiled, the land is defiled. Hence we should spend our energy in making this world a better place then this world will also become a pureland äººé—´å‡€åœŸ.
              Hope this help in clarifying the Nichiren Shu stand. However, I had a video link below on Ven Chin Kung, Pureland view on the origin of chanting the Lotus Sutra title and your question.

              Thank you Sinweiy and Reborn76 for your response. I appreciate them. Buddha is really compassionate to all sentient beings.
              
              Reborn76, does it matter if one say Nam-myoho-renge-kyo or Namu-myoho-renge-kyo? I have read that in Nichiren's time, he openly condemned Pure Land, Zen, Shingon and other Buddhist schools in Japan and said saying the name of Amituofo is leading to hell of incessant suffering. What did Nichiren make this statement that eventually got him in series of troubles and persecution?

              Hi Peace For All
              
              Nichiren is not the only person who has emphasise the importance of focusing on Shakyamuni Buddha. In fact, the late Ven Yin Shuå�°é †å°Žå¸« has said the same thing in his book,The Way to BuddhahoodVerses æˆ�ä½›ä¹‹é�“.
              
              â€œä¸‰ä¸–ä½›ç„¡é‡�, å��æ–¹ä½›äº¦çˆ¾, æ‚²é¡˜ä¾†æ¿�ä¸–, ç¦®ä½›é‡‹è¿¦æ–‡
              
              Buddhas of the three periods are innumerable,
              Buddhas of the ten directions are also countless.
              Having come to this impure world because of his compassionate vow,
              ÅšÄ�kyamuni Buddha is deserving of our worship.
              
              æ™ºåœ“æ‚²ç„¡æ¥µ,æ–·éšœç„¡é¤˜ç¿’,ä¸‰å¾·ç­‰ç©¶ç«Ÿ,æ–¹ä¾¿ç¤ºå·®åˆ¥
              His wisdom is perfect, his compassion infinite.
              Overcoming all obstructions, he is totally without remnants of habit.
              These three virtues are equal and ultimate for all Buddhas,
              But for the sake of skillful means, there are differences.â€�
              
              Your Question
              
              I have read that in Nichirenâ€™s time, he openly condemned Pure Land, Zen, Shingon and other Buddhist schools in Japan and said saying the name of Amituofo is leading to hell of incessant suffering. What did Nichiren make this statement that eventually got him in series of troubles and persecution?
              
              A Rissho University Professor has told Late Ven Sheng Yen è�–åš´æ³•å¸«, founder of Taiwan Dharma Drum Mountain when he was studying there. â€œNichiren used strong admonition due to the hardening of people heart in order to save them. If he is born in today Japan, perhaps his method of saving people might be different. In order to save the people, Bodhisattva need to use appropriate means due to the condition and one cannot be attached to a particular mean. Nowadays, Nichiren Shu scholars do not take the strong condemnation in Dharma propagation nor are they critical about other Buddhist sects.â€�
              
              ã€Šç•™æ—¥è¦‹è�žã€‹Pg 427,

              Besides, the late Ven Sheng Yen mentioned about Nichirenâ€™s unyielding spirit in facing the persecution. He thinks that Nichiren is an accomplished Buddhist monk who is well versed in the Buddhist Sutra and someone with real encounter with the Dharma. Thatâ€™s why, he can endure the hardship with traces in history.

              By the way, do note that there are some teaching differences between Nichiren Shu  and Nichiren Shoshu or SGI doctrine. The latter tend to see Nichiren as a current Buddha whereas Nichiren Shu views him as a Bodhisattva.

              Hi Peace For All
              
              Your Question
              Does it matter if one say Nam-myoho-renge-kyo or Namu-myoho-renge-kyo?
              
              In order to answer that we need to understand what is å�—ç„¡=Namo in Chinese &amp; Namu in Sino Japanese. It means seeking refuge. In Nichiren case, we are taking refuge in Lotus Sutra which is teaching taught by all Buddha of the past, present and future. 
              
              Lotus Sutra 
              Chpter 1
              Manjushri Bodhisattva  told Bodhisattva Mahasattva Maitreya
              "The portents now seen do not differ from those, and so, in my estimation, today the Thus Come One is about to speak a Great Vehicle Sutra called The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, a Dharma for instructing Bodhisattvas of which the Buddha is protective and mindful." 
              
              Chpter 21 
              At that time the Shakyamuni Buddha told Superior Conduct and all the great assembly of Bodhisattvas,"In general, all the Dharmas of the Thus Come One, all the sovereign spiritual powers of the Thus Come One, all the secret storehouses of the Thus Come One, all the extremely profound deeds of the Thus Come One are all proclaimed and revealed in this Sutra." 
              
              Hence when we seek refuge in the Lotus Sutra, we are seeking in all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and their teaching. 
              
              In regards, to Nam or Namu it is a matter of language convenience. In Japan, some people will omitted the vowel "U" in daily chat. However, they will pronouce in full during official ceremony. 
              
              It is like when we post letter  in singapore sometime we put SG, SIN in the address instead of writing in full. At the end of the day, the letter still reach the receiver. Therefore, it is not a great matter, the importance is the heart of sincerity.
