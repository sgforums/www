                  Morality of Lies and Falsehoods</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Buddhistdoor Global |
                  2016-08-12 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Hogeweyk,
                  a Dutch care home for people with dementia, is an entire village that provides
                  a façade of normal life for its residents. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
                  weeks ago Buddhistdoor published a report about Hogewey Care Centre, a Dutch
                  care home for people with dementia that in 2009 built an entire village that
                  provides a façade of normal life for its residents. The village, “Hogeweyk,”
                  comes complete with a restaurant, gardens, and health workers who assume
                  fictional personas such as that of neighbors or shopkeepers, to help the
                  residents function as if they were still living in conventional society.
                  Dementia care centers elsewhere are also adopting a similar methodology of
                  simulated normality, such as Grove Care in the British city of Bristol.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
                  Hogeweyk model raises an interesting question about what it means to tell lies
                  or to create falsehoods, ostensibly for the benefit of others. From the
                  perspective of care homes like Hogeweyk, it’s unproductive to remind patients
                  of the “normal” world that they can no longer enjoy and which would only
                  intensify their distress. It truly seems more helpful to provide a therapeutic
                  outlet that might enable dementia sufferers to tell their attendants (who are
                  trained specialists) about the buses they used to catch, or the streets down
                  which they used to walk, even if that outlet is based on fabrication.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
                  this sense, the falsehood of Hogeweyk differs from the typical deceptions we
                  encounter in everyday life because it has an ethical purpose based on
                  compassion and care. Yet even well-intentioned lies can be morally ambiguous
                  and have unintended adverse outcomes—a white lie is sometimes not even told for
                  the benefit of the person being lied to, but for the liar’s own peace of mind.
                  Telling an emotionally fragile person that their recently deceased loved one is
                  still alive to avoid giving them the potentially devastating truth could have
                  catastrophic consequences. A child questioning the existence of Santa Claus
                  might justifiably ridicule the adult who persists in defending the myth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Conversely,
                  more misanthropically inclined people might adhere to a somewhat mean-spirited
                  and disingenuous commitment to “telling it as it is” by delivering
                  superficially truthful statements in a callous or hurtful way, without regard
                  for the feelings of others or the context. This is the opposite of a white lie,
                  and can be just as counterproductive and harmful. “Life is characterized by
                  suffering,” the Buddha stated honestly, and since then his teachings have often
                  been misunderstood as being pessimistic. But not only did the Buddha offer a
                  real, practical solution to this truth, he was also infinitely compassionate;
                  he was never an insensitive or hurtful person even when communicating great
                  truths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
                  everyday life, it’s usually advisable to tread a middle ground between lying
                  for convenience and unskillful truth-telling. For the Buddhist, this middle
                  ground is known as “skillful means.” In the Lotus Sutra skillful means are
                  famously a concept indicating the Buddha’s ability to teach according to the
                  inclinations and capacities of each being. The well-known 84,000 Dharma gates described
                  in the Pali Canon (later adopted by the Mahayana) was intended to illustrate
                  how many methods of teaching the Buddha had at his disposal, perhaps implying
                  that anything in life can serve as an entryway into spiritual practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
                  concept of skillful means has since been expanded upon in popular Buddhist
                  culture to mean something that is “handled well.” This is an incredibly broad
                  category since the situations in which a Buddhist must necessarily apply
                  compassion and wisdom are endless, and include relatively common contexts such
                  as comforting a child over the death of a loved one or defusing a heated
                  confrontation between friends, as well as more sensitive situations such as
                  handling an emotionally distressed person spewing verbal abuse, or comforting
                  someone who has just accepted that she is extremely disliked. Dealing with
                  these situations requires not merely the blunt instrument of the truth, but the
                  deftness of knowing when and how to wield it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Skillful
                  means are flexible because human life and relations are messy, subject to
                  chance and circumstance, and riddled with hypocrisies and contingencies that
                  can’t be anticipated by neatly laid out doctrines and philosophies. Therefore,
                  while we should seek to tell the truth whenever possible, what happens when we
                  are confronted by shades of grey? When telling the unvarnished truth is not
                  always the most skillful or ethical thing to do?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Another
                  good example of skillful means (perhaps less dramatic than that of Hogeweyk) is
                  the case of a child in hospital who was unresponsive to a counseling pastor.
                  The counselor decided to use a plush toy, which he imbued with a name and
                  personality, inviting the child to interact with it rather than directly with
                  himself. It helped to give the little girl enough emotional and mental space
                  that she felt comfortable relating her pain and anxieties to the toy, although
                  it was obvious even to her that the pastor was creating a “fiction.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
                  a situation as serious as coping with dementia, it becomes clear that
                  extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary skills—skills that many of
                  us might not possess. More often in our everyday lives we encounter a muddled
                  morass of human vulnerabilities that need to be treated sensitively, and this
                  will sometimes mean the need to employ fictions or, put more bluntly, lies. The
                  question is how skillfully and ethically such fictions are deployed.</span></p>

              <p>I find the title a little misleading The Morality of Lies and Falsehoods, suggesting that there is only one reality, fitting everybody else within our world. When  we see harsh reality, does it  evenly applies to everyone else?</p>
              <p>In  the first instance, we must realise that another reality have been created for the sufferers' benefit. It aims to restore a sense of familiarity and predictable environment where the patient can exist and interact comfortably. It is not the cold impersonal or stark reality as we see it and face everyday. Granted, but we are not them, and they are not us, but a sentient being with their  individual consciousness. We know full well from the article that they no longest enjoy the full mental or  maybe physical faculties you and I have.</p>
              <p>A new reality  have been created for them, and if they are non any wiser to that fact, then they will suffer no distress. Such  is their fortune or good karma that society can afford such effort for them.</p>
              <p>We too can create for ourselves an  ideal reality, our personal Pureland, if we so choose. There are two realms, one  within our mind, the other the physical  reality.</p>
              <p>It is believed that those whose chose to  go Pureland, ultimately will come back for a final rebirth after  attaining enlightenment  in Pureland.</p>
              <p>Why not  do it now, reside in your personal Pureland and emerge with  equanimity. Little by little, day by day, bit  by  bit, the Bodhisattva's Way.</p>
              <p>But I digress.</p>
              <p>I see the second situation as a bridge, a crutch, or device for the  little  girl.  We attempt to reach out to the  unspoken mind of the little child, with trust or communication issues. Perhaps we also forgotten how we,  as a child used to  have imaginary or toy friends where we spoke in our normal  tone and voice  while we speak on  behalf of voice in a different tone and voice.  </p>
              <p>I  can easily imagine using a childlike subservient or non authoritarian as the doll's voice when  talking through the  toy. On a different note, ever  notice how we talk to infants?</p>
              <p>In  the first instance, I would say it is a new reality for dementia patients  as they  are probably unable to return to "our" reality.</p>
              <p>In the second, it is  a  make believe world for the children as eventually we expect them to engage our real world  when they grow  up. </p>
              <p>What we  should say is we  are  trying make the world  easier for  them tto manage, given their predicament.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,<br><br>I may sound a little... detached.. but skillful means should have no room for any unfactual content... not even to justify or fit our emotions. Check out Abhaya sutta....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>However,the implication of telling lies, white ones or otherwise,whether immoral or not is not in  question. It is also not that I am amoral, lacking in  basic virtues,  that I am unable to determine  good or bad conduct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is in  the context of this article, where I hope to find out the argument of immorality , that they, the methods, are lies, and the people employing them are  therefore immoral.</p>
              <p>One is a make believe world to allow old people function with  normalcy and familiarity hopefully, until the end of  their lives. Dementia is a degenerative disease which  does not improve with time, only managed.  These old  folk are mentally incapacitated and will increasingly dysfunctional. They can  suddenly become lost in our midst. And it is because we love them, we do not  want to see them suffer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for children, we did not create a makeup world  or imaginary friends, they do that quite well on their own! It is  when we  want to get closer to them that we take on  a persona befitting that make believe world.</p>
              <p>How many adults have been scarred for life for having found out Santa Claus is  not real? Or Cinderella or Snow White in Disneyland are not real either. We grew out of it, don't we?</p>
              <p>What about death, how did you figure out about death? Or  really understand the concept, when no  is comfortable talking about it?</p>
              <p>So perhaps my moral compass is broken, I am unable  to see the immorality of the actions, and that they are lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully,  others would care to  share their rationale, that we could contemplate from a different perspective.</p>

              <p>I see the implication that the scenarios are fabricated, therefore falsehoods.</p>
              <p>So falsehoods are ultimately deceptions. </p>
              <p>An analogy can also be fabricated to draw a parallel, so in a sense not real, so it is also a falsehood too?</p>

              <p>Hi Weychin,<br><br>I heard of a story whereby a lady asked why her son have to die...</p>
              <p>and was advised by the Buddha to ask for sesame seeds from a family who have nobody died before...and subsequently.... (I assume you know the story...)<br><br>In matters that are unfactual... The Buddha would not say anything... I don't think even parables is allowed too... it undermines the integrity of a person<br><br>By writing this post doesn't mean i got higher integrity than you.. haha....</p>

              <p>Thank you for patience for bearing with me.</p>
              <p>Before giving further examples of skilful means, or expediency, I now refer to the terms upaya kausalya (skrt), and upaya kosala Nana(Pali). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Skilful means applied in this instance and most examples I am aware of originates from Mahayana Buddhism. If you subscribe to this form of Buddhism, then mention and examples of such expediency can be cited from Mahayana Sutras.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If, however, you hold that a traditionist way as the only legitimate view, then further discussion is not fruitful, as I do not accept that being the only position . It invalidates the authenticity of the teachers and their teachings whom I have accepted . Any further discussions will perceived as imposing my beliefs and view over yours. </p>
              <p>Traditionist refers to holding hinayana point of view and in no way imply any particular lineage. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My understanding of  upaya kosala Nana is that in conjunction with maha karuna, the basic requirement for attaining the paramitas.</p>
