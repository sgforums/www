              <p>I
               bow to Vajra Dakini.</p>
              <p>1<br> Mahamudra cannot be taught, Naropa,<br> But your devotion to your teacher and the hardships you’ve met<br> Have made you patient in suffering and also wise:<br> Take this to heart, my worthy student.</p>
              <p>2<br> For instance, consider space: what depends on what?<br> Likewise, mahamudra: it doesn’t depend on anything. <br> Don’t control. Let go and rest naturally.<br> Let what binds you let go and freedom is not in doubt.</p>
              <p>3<br> When you look into space, seeing stops.<br> Likewise, when mind looks at mind,<br> The flow of thinking stops and you come to the deepest awakening.</p>
              <p>4<br> Mists rise from the earth and vanish into space.<br> They go nowhere, nor do they stay.<br> Likewise, though thoughts arise,<br> Whenever you see your mind, the clouds of thinking clear.</p>
              <p>5<br> Space is beyond color or shape. <br> It doesn’t take on color, black or white: it doesn’t change.<br> Likewise, your mind, in essence, is beyond color or shape.<br> It does not change because you do good or evil.</p>
              <p>6<br> The darkness of a thousand eons cannot dim<br> The brilliant radiance that is the essence of the sun. <br> Likewise, eons of samsara cannot dim<br> The sheer clarity that is the essence of your mind.</p>
              <p>7<br> Although you say space is empty,<br> You can’t say that space is "like this".<br> Likewise, although mind is said to be sheer clarity,<br> There is nothing there: you can’t say "it’s like this".</p>
              <p>8<br> Thus, the nature of mind is inherently like space:<br> It includes everything you experience.</p>
              <p>9<br> Stop all physical activity: sit naturally at ease. <br> Do not talk or speak: let sound be empty, like an echo.<br> Do not think about anything: look at experience beyond thought.</p>
              <p>10<br> Your body has no core, hollow like bamboo. <br> Your mind goes beyond thought, open like space.<br> Let go of control and rest right there.</p>
              <p>11<br> Mind without projection is mahamudra.<br> Train and develop this and you will come to the deepest awakening.</p>
              <p>12<br> You don’t see mahamudra’s sheer clarity<br> By means of classical texts or philosophical systems,<br> Whether of the mantras, paramitas, <br> Vinaya, sutras or other collections.</p>
              <p>13<br> Ambition clouds sheer clarity and you don’t see it. <br> Thinking about precepts undermines the point of commitment. <br> Do not think about anything; let all ambition drop.<br> Let what arises settle by itself, like patterns in water.<br> No place, no focus, no missing the point — <br> Do not break this commitment: it is the light in the dark.</p>
              <p>14<br> When you are free from ambition and don’t hold any position,<br> You will see all that the scriptures teach.<br> When you open to this, you are free from samsara’s prison.<br> When you settle in this, all evil and distortion burn up.<br> This is called "The Light of the Teaching".</p>
              <p>15<br> The foolish are not interested in this.<br> The currents of samsara constantly carry them away.<br> Oh, how pitiable, the foolish — their struggles never end.<br> Don’t accept these struggles, long for freedom, and rely on a skilled 
              teacher.<br> When his (her) energy enters your heart, your mind is freed.</p>
              <p>16<br> What joy!<br> Samsaric ways are senseless: they are the seeds of suffering.<br> Conventional ways are pointless. Focus on what is sound and true. <br> Majestic outlook is beyond all fixation.<br> Majestic practice is no distraction.<br> Majestic behavior is no action or effort.<br> The fruition is there when you are free from hope and fear.</p>
              <p>17<br> Beyond any frame of reference mind is naturally clear.<br> Where there is no path you begin the path of awakening.<br> Where there is nothing to work on you come to the deepest awakening.</p>
              <p>18<br> Alas! Look carefully at this experience of the world.<br> Nothing lasts. It’s like a dream, like magic.<br> The dream, the magic, makes no sense.<br> Experience this grief and forget the affairs of the world.</p>
              <p>19<br> Cut all ties of involvement with country or kin,<br> Practice alone in forest or mountain retreats.<br> Rest, not practicing anything.<br> When you come to nothing to come to, you come to mahamudra.</p>
              <p>20<br> A tree spreads its branches and leaves.<br> Cut the root and ten thousand branches wither.<br> Likewise, cut the root of mind and the leaves of samsara wither.</p>
              <p>21<br> Though darkness gathers for a thousand eons.<br> A single light dispels it all.<br> Likewise, one moment of sheer clarity<br> Dispels the ignorance, evil and confusion of a thousand eons.</p>
              <p>22<br> What joy!<br> With the ways of the intellect you won’t see beyond intellect.<br> With the ways of action you won’t know non-action.<br> If you want to know what is beyond intellect and action,<br> Cut your mind at its root and rest in naked awareness.</p>
              <p>23<br> Let the cloudy waters of thinking settle and clear.<br> Let appearances come and go on their own. <br> With nothing to change, the world you experience becomes mahamudra.<br> Because the basis of experience has no beginning, patterns and 
              distortions fall away.<br> Rest in no beginning, with no self-interest or expectation.<br> Let what appears appear on its own and let conceptual ways subside.</p>
              <p>24<br> The most majestic of outlooks is free of all reference.<br> The most majestic of practices is vast and deep without limit.<br> The most majestic of behaviors is open-minded and impartial.<br> The most majestic of fruitions is natural being, free of concern.</p>
              <p>25<br> At first, practice is a river rushing through a gorge.<br> In the middle, it’s the river Ganges, smooth and flowing.<br> In the end, it’s where all rivers meet, mother and child.</p>
              <p>26<br> When your mind is less acute and does not truly rest,<br> Work the essentials of energy and bring out the vitality of awareness.<br> Using gazes and techniques to take hold of mind<br> Train awareness until it does truly rest.</p>
              <p>27<br> When you practice with a sexual partner, empty bliss awareness arises.<br> The balancing of method and wisdom transforms energy.<br> Let it descend gently, collect it, draw it back up,<br> Return it to its place, and let it saturate your body.<br> When you are free from longing and desire, empty bliss awareness arises.</p>
              <p>28<br> You will have a long life, you will not gray, and you will shine like 
              the moon.<br> You will radiate health and well-being and be as strong as a lion.<br> You will quickly attain the ordinary abilities and open to the supreme 
              one.</p>
              <p>May these pith instructions, the essentials of mahamudra,<br> Abide in the hearts of all worthy beings.</p>

              <p><em>These are the great Tilopa’s oral instructions. On the

              the river Ganges to the Kashmiri pandit, the wise and learned Naropa. 
              Naropa taught The Twenty-Eight Vajra Verses to the great interpreter, 
              the king of translators, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö. Marpa finalized his
