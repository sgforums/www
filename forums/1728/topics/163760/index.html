            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fellow Buddhists,<br><br>My Christian bf recently had a vision of me bald and wearing a nun's Buddhist robes. It stunned me because I was formerly told by a fortune teller (who uses the "ba zhi" and "san si shu" to see the past, present and future lives) that I would attain eternal happiness if I leave my parents and seek refuge in Buddhism. (somewhat indicating that I may renounce a secular life and become a nun)<br><br>It worries me because although I have converted to Christianity, my faith seems to remain pretty strongly in Buddhism. I converted on my own accord because I believed that God or my Creator healed me when I was unwell (my bf encouraged me to pray to God). Personally I believe that God appears in many forms, one of which is Buddha. But I just can't identify with what is written in the bible, no matter how hard I try. On the other hand, I can agree and accept the teachings in Buddhist books, and the image of Buddha and Goddess of Mercy instils a feeling of calmness and well-being in me, even when I'm upset, agitated or feeling down.<br><br>For the past few months, I have been struggling with an internal religious conflict within me. Somehow I feel as if I'm in no man's land. Even though I'm a Christian, but I don't feel nor behave like one. And my bf's persistently trying to pull me back to church and cell group, but I feel a strong resistance against his attempts. It's straining our relationship.<br><br>Quite troubled about it now...</div>

Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.<br><br>That is your answer.<br>be well and live well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Muslim. Quite honestly, let me tell u guys my experience....<br><br>Before my father passed away coz of cancer about 10 years ago, on his deathbed he was seeing 'things'.<br><br>1) He saw a Buddhist or Taoist monk chanting some mantras at the foot of his bed one nite.<br><br>2) He saw a Christian priest and a group of nuns singing a choir on another<br><br>3) He saw the Devil offering him a glass of water (coz muslims believe before a person dies, he will feel an utmost sense of thirst) on the pretext of declaring to himself that Muhammad is a liar. I saw him staring with anger to his left coz the Devil came from his left side.<br><br>4) When i recite the Quran (holy book of Islam), he felt peaceful and comfortable.<br><br>Muslims believe the Devil will try his best to stray u away from The Path before your death coz that is the best and last time he may be able to do so.<br><br>From that day onwards, I truly believe that Allah is God and muhammad is His Messenger.<br><br>My advice to you........study all the known religions and make your choice. Religion cannot be forced upon, it must be received with an open mind and heart.<br><br>Humanity is breed through religion.......</div>
