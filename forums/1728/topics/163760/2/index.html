Quite honestly, let me tell u guys my experience....<br><br>Before my father passed away coz of cancer about 10 years ago, on his deathbed he was seeing 'things'.<br><br>1) He saw a Buddhist or Taoist monk chanting some mantras at the foot of his bed one nite.<br><br>2) He saw a Christian priest and a group of nuns singing a choir on another<br><br>3) He saw the Devil offering him a glass of water (coz muslims believe before a person dies, he will feel an utmost sense of thirst) on the pretext of declaring to himself that Muhammad is a liar. I saw him staring with anger to his left coz the Devil came from his left side.<br><br>4) When i recite the Quran (holy book of Islam), he felt peaceful and comfortable.<br><br>Muslims believe the Devil will try his best to stray u away from The Path before your death coz that is the best and last time he may be able to do so.<br><br>From that day onwards, I truly believe that Allah is God and muhammad is His Messenger.<br><br>My advice to you........study all the known religions and make your choice.

It stunned me because I was formerly told by a fortune teller (who uses the "ba zhi" and "san si shu" to see the past, present and future lives) that I would attain eternal happiness if I leave my parents and seek refuge in Buddhism. (somewhat indicating that I may renounce a secular life and become a nun)<br><br>It worries me because although I have converted to Christianity, my faith seems to remain pretty strongly in Buddhism. I converted on my own accord because I believed that God or my Creator healed me when I was unwell (my bf encouraged me to pray to God). Personally I believe that God appears in many forms, one of which is Buddha. But I just can't identify with what is written in the bible, no matter how hard I try. On the other hand, I can agree and accept the teachings in Buddhist books, and the image of Buddha and Goddess of Mercy instils a feeling of calmness and well-being in me, even when I'm upset, agitated or feeling down.<br><br>For the past few months, I have been struggling with an internal religious conflict within me. Somehow I feel as if I'm in no man's land. Even though I'm a Christian, but I don't feel nor behave like one. And my bf's persistently trying to pull me back to church and cell group, but I feel a strong resistance against his attempts. It's straining our relationship.<br><br>Quite troubled about it now...</div></blockquote>I had read some dream book. Sometimes dream that u only dream for 1 time may not mean wat it is... Some dream book says that if a man dream of a nun will have a small tragedy. In another way, maybe ur bf somehow sub-consiously afraid u may leave him to become a nun? Even if fortune teller says so doesn't mean u will become a nun. Fate lies in ur hand. You had the choice. Some people can read palm but yet the lines can change from time to time. If u study buddhism, you may find that there are lots of story about changing destiny. Maybe u are fated with buddhism. But doesn't mean you will become a nun. Unless you had ur mind of becoming one.<br><br>I also had seen a fortune teller, he says almost the same as urs. I am not so kind of fate with this world. Quite true also, but I still will not become a monk. Maybe some day i may change my mind but for now, no way. I also had read some christian and other religion stuff. There is even books on buddhism and christian that says some of the similar meaning in the quotes.<br>In the end, u can take ur time to make ur choices, wat ever the religion u choosen.

That's really unfair if one only believe what people say, w/o seeing it for oneself.<br><br>another thing is if Buddhism is dark side(satanic), it should be after Christianity, yet it's 500 years before Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'>below is a very good letter/note/gift to ur bfriend: An Episcopalian Priest writes about Amitabha :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thoughts on Amida Buddha<br><br>I find the symbol of Amida (Amitabha) Buddha to be one of the most radical symbols of self-sacrificing love in the world. In fact, my own conception of Christ has been changed and deepened through my encounter with Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha symbolizes the universal embrace of compassion and in doing so, calls and inspires us to follow in the BuddhaÂ’s footsteps.<br><br>Buddhas, like the saints, are people like you and I who managed to break free from the shackles of illusion and self-centeredness to attain true awakening. But to be a Buddha is not merely to attain enlightenment for one's self--it is to strive to bring all people into the light and life of true enlightenment, freed from the suffering of illusion and self-deceit. To be enlightened is to touch and be assured of nirvana. Yet the Buddha delays nirvana in order to serve others out of deep compassion. One of the primary Buddhist prayers is to pray for Â“the salvation of all beings.Â”<br><br>Amida Buddha sacrificed everything...he vowed and aspired never to reach full enlightenment unless all beings would join him in enlightenment upon hearing and entrusting in his name. To me, this symbolizes the ultimate end of faith and life not only for Buddhists, but for all people on the spiritual journey. Like Amida, I desire to embrace this level of compassion, that I may touch and know what it means to truly love others.<br><br>And this is grace...to be drawn irresistably by the light and life of true compassion.<br><br>I find inspiration from Buddhism--with it's universal hope in humanity, its principles of karmic reality, its Eight Fold Path, Four Noble Truths, its path of humility, non-attachment, liberation, wisdom, and peace..but above all, its compassion and grace.</span><br>From Rev Rebecca's website (<a href="http://www.franciscan-anglican.com/Buddha.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.franciscan-anglican.com/Buddha.htm</a>)<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fyi, Buddha never do convert btw. Buddha was not discriminating to race, countries and religions. People of other faith went to ask Buddha, Buddha was always delighted to help. He never tell them to convert. You never see it in the texts/sutras. If they are Brahma religion, they can still have faith in Brahma religion. They just went to Buddha to look for wisdom. Buddha always respect all the many religions in India during that time. He never even criticize them in any way. Rare and understanding was Buddha. Look at Earth store Sutra, Po Luo Men Nui (Brahma girl) was a hindu also, and did not convert even when she attain enlightenment.<br><br>/\</div>

There is one story of Upali, a great Jain disciple and debator, who was eventually 'converted' into Buddhism and attained enlightenment... (note that this Upali is different from the top disciple in Precepts)<br><br><blockquote>Upali was one of the chief followers of the Jain master, Mahavira. Because of his intelligence, Upali often appeared in public debates on behalf of the Jains.<br><br>There was one incident where Upali had a debate with the Buddha. At the end of the debate, Upali was so impressed with the Buddha's teachings that he asked to be the Enlightened One's follower. "Venerable Sir, please allow me to be your follower".<br><br>To that, the Buddha answered, "Upali, you are at the height of your emotions. Go home and reconsider it carefully before you ask me again".<br><br>Upali was extremely impressed, "If it was any other guru, he will parade a banner saying, 'Mahavira's chief lay-disciple has become my follower'. But you, Venerable Sir, you asked me to go home and reconsider. Now, I want to be your follower even more. I will not stand up until you accept me".<br><br>Finally, the Buddha agreed to accept Upali, under one condition, "Upali, as a Jain, you have always given alms to Jain monks. When you become my follower, you will CONTINUE to give alms to Jain monks. This is my condition".<br><br>Upali agreed to this condition.</blockquote></div>
