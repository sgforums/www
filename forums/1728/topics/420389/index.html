              <h1>Integrating the Personal  and the Transpersonal</h1>
              <p>Although people desire the non-dualistic and limitless (awareness, 
              they make a) limit out of that which is not limited and thereby 
              constrict the essential mind itself. Even though people desire (the 
              realization of) both (the transcendent and relative) realities they fall
               into an extreme understanding of these. Although they desire the union 
              of the two realities this is not the way things naturally are. No matter
               in what way you think about this you are trapped in the cage of 
              (conflicting) desires.</p>
              <p>Longchenpa</p>
              <p>Throughout the ages spiritual masters and sage philosophers have 
              pointed to a limitless, tran- scendent mystical reality by contrasting 
              this with the limited, deceptive, and impermanent reality that we 
              experience through our senses. Amongst other names, this mystical 
              reality has been called the Godhead, Brahman, Tao, Source and Emptiness.
               However, according to the Dzogchen or Com- plete Fulfillment tradition,
               these realities are limited to the very same extent that they are 
              distin- guished from that which is limited. In other words, as soon as 
              limitlessness displaces that which is limited it assumes its own limits 
              and restrictions.</p>
              <p>In the above lines, the famous fourteenth century Tibetan master, 
              Longchenpa, cautions people against limiting themselves by becoming 
              fixated on the limitlessness of the mind itself. By distin- guishing the
               nature of the mind itself as being fundamentally different from mental 
              phenomena, such as thoughts and feelings, people can become 
              intellectually and philosophically captivated by the “idea” that the 
              mind is limitless. But in so doing they fall into a fixed and extreme 
              understanding of the Complete Fulfillment perspective. The Chinese Zen 
              master Foyan makes the same point about Zen when he writes that, “You 
              shouldn’t set up limits in boundless openness, but if you set up 
              limitlessness as boundless openness, you’ve trapped yourself.”</p>
              <p>This type of fixation is based on making a distinction between 
              appearance and Reality. In orthodox Buddhism and mystical philosophies 
              such as Hindu Advaita Vedanta, this distinction has been formalized in a
               theory of two levels of reality, the social or relative and the 
              transcendent level. The relative reality corresponds to the world that 
              is known through our body and mind. The tran- scendent reality 
              corresponds to an open, unmarked and insubstantial reality that 
              underlies the exist- ence of everything.</p>
              <p>In terms of our spiritual development, knowledge of the relative 
              reality primarily refers to understanding the consequences of being 
              embodied. As a practice this involves understanding the inner dynamics, 
              wherein our physical, verbal and mental behavior conditions what we 
              experience in the future. In Indian spiritual systems this is called 
              “understanding the workings of karma”. Through this practice we can gain
               skill in modifying our actions so that we consistently create 
              opportunities for on-going spiritual practice. The implementation of 
              these behavioral changes occurs mainly in the interpersonal arena. As 
              such, an appreciation of the relative reality is mainly cultivated 
              outside of formal sitting meditation. In contrast, an understanding of 
              the transcendent reality is gained mainly through formal medi- tation 
              practice during which one generates an unalloyed experience of an 
              insubstantial voidness. While these contemplations begin with an 
              empirical content, as soon as meditators see the inherent voidness of 
              their object of contemplation, they let any imagery recede from their 
              awareness, so that they can focus single-pointedly on the emerging 
              experience of a formless, transcendent reality. In Buddhist traditions 
              this is called generating a “space-like equipoise”. The rationale behind
               structur- ing their practice in this way is that one can produce deeper
               and more pure realization of the ultimate reality by focusing on a 
              vacuous experience that is uncontaminated by any thoughts, feelings or 
              sensory images. This type of meditation practice requires tremendous 
              concentration and control in order to break through the seeming solidity
               and reality of our thoughts, feelings and perceptions. The downside in 
              pursuing the realization of the transcendent and relative realities 
              independently of each other is that they then need to be integrated into
               a way of being that seemlessly blends the freedom of unconditioned 
              awareness with the complexities of living in a conditioned world. Tradi-
               tionally this is done in two different ways. Firstly, when meditators 
              arise from their formal sitting practice they cultivate seeing things as
               though they are an illusion. In this way they attempt to directly 
              suffuse their appreciation of phenomena with the experience of 
              insubstantiality. Then within their space-like meditations on the 
              transcendent level they will begin to allow objects such as thoughts and
               feelings to remain in their awareness alongside the emerging experience
               of the tran- scendent realm. In time the experience of the empirical 
              and the transcendent become inseparable-one cannot be had without the 
              other.</p>
              <p>A further consequence of this way of practicing is that people can 
              over-emphasize one or other of the two realities, and thus be led into a
               distorted spiritual path. For example, if someone cultivates an 
              experience of transcendence but fails to appreciate how their thoughts, 
              speech and physical behavior influences what they will experience in the
               future, they can easily lose touch with empirical world. They might 
              become completely spaced out and lose their ability to operate safely 
              and effec- tively in the physical world. This is called erring to the 
              nihilist extreme and it can have extremely damaging consequences for 
              people’s spiritual development. Philosophically this is falling to the 
              extreme of misinterpreting the ultimate reality to mean non-existence. 
              This error can make people foolhardy, careless, and a danger to 
              themselves and others.</p>
              <p>Conversely, if someone cultivates the relative reality while ignoring
               the transcendent reality they err to the realist extreme. So while they
               might take meticulous care with their behavior and gain real control 
              over their capacity to filter out negative experiences they fail to gain
               the unconditional freedom that comes from realizing that nothing is 
              solid and fixed including any connection between our behavior and what 
              we experience. By believing that karmic conditioning is a real and 
              invariant phenomenon they are trapped by the need to constantly monitor 
              and control their behavior. Philo- sophically this is falling to the 
              extreme of believing that reality has a real or intrinsic existence. A 
              consequence of this error is that spiritual practice becomes a terribly 
              serious and unforgiving en- deavor.</p>
              <p>Thus, whilst the theory of two distinct levels of reality is designed
               to assist practitioners’ spiri- tual evolution, from a practical angle 
              it can be misused so that it gives license and support to the innate 
              human impulses to: (1) seek happiness and freedom by manipulating the 
              empirical world, or (2) disconnect from the physical world in an effort 
              to be free of suffering. The brilliance of the Complete Fulfillment 
              tradition, is that it doesn’t split reality into two different types or 
              aspects that then need to be assimilated. Right from the very outset, 
              the notion of two realities is seen as a purely intellectual 
              construction. As the great bodhisattva Subhuti says: “Absolute openness 
              and relative functioning are not divided. They are not two alternative 
              dimen- sions, but utter simplicity.”</p>
              <p>The personal and transpersonal dimensions of the spiritual life are 
              integrated right from the very beginning. Consequently, there is no need
               to subsequently recover an artificial split in our experience that is 
              conditioned by segmenting our practice into separate meditational and 
              post-meditational phases. This integrated approach also removes the 
              possibility of producing extreme and potentially dangerous spiritual 
              experiences, since it automatically corrects any personal bias that 
              might lead someone to disconnect from the physical reality, or believe 
              that they are nothing more than an embodied mind. In other words, it is 
              difficult for someone to skew the Complete Fulfillment per- spective 
              towards either the relative or transcendent extremes, since the 
              perspective to be cultivated is one in which we begin to connect with a 
              disclosive space that allows all things to be just as they are. In our 
              usual way of living we relate to the flux of our experience by rejecting
               our pain and becoming addicted to pleasure. The alternative is to shift
               our attention so that we begin to experience the disclosive space 
              within which we and the universe appear as processes that come into 
              existence, endure and decay. This disclosive space isn’t the same as the
               space that allows physical phenomena to subsist. Rather, it is the 
              space that allows physical space to be where and as it is, and precludes
               it from being where it is not. It is also the space that allows 
              thoughts and emotions to emerge and subside as they do.</p>
              <p>As Longchenpa says:</p>
              <p>The state of spaciousness, the true nature of being, is without 
              boundaries and is non-dual. It does not come into being and cannot be 
              destroyed. It neither endures nor decays, and neither comes nor goes. 
              Within this space the entire variety of phenomena appear distinctly yet 
              when they manifest they are natu- rally devoid of complexity.</p>
              <p>When we begin to relate to our experience as a disclosive space, we 
              see that it is the very nature of what we are experiencing. That which 
              is disclosed by the forms of our experience is the disclosive space 
              itself. In fact, outside of what is disclosed there is no disclosive 
              space. Similarly, the very structure of our personality reveals the 
              transpersonal nature of being itself. When we begin to experi- ence the 
              world as this disclosive space, the modulations of our thoughts and 
              emotions, and changes in our physical environment become balanced and 
              harmonized. Our experience becomes simple and uncomplicated yet without 
              compromising the full richness of its texture and distinctiveness. The 
              Complete Fulfillment tradition invites us to appreciate that we are a 
              totally unconditioned locus of experience, without making this in any 
              way special. There is absolutely no effort, struggle, or need to escape 
              who we are, since this is our unique expression of transcendence. We 
              open out so that we can experience the subtle and dramatic modulations 
              of our thoughts, moods, feelings and perceptions, all the while 
              realizing that they are just a free play of appearances. Instead of 
              arming ourselves with a battery of techniques for running away from 
              unpleasant experiences and enhancing those that we approve of, we come 
              to see that every aspect and dimension of our experience is an exquisite
               expression of freedom and transcendence. In this way, the Complete 
              Fulfillment closes the traditional rift between physical embodiment and 
              spiritual transcendence.</p>
