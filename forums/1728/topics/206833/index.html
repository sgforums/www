I do not know the exact cause for some spirit to follow your friend. It depends. I think it is certain kind of karmic link but I do not know what kind of karmic link is that. Your friend may have to visit a wise Buddhist venerable to enquire more. BTW, is your friend a Buddhist or..?</div>

Many cases where ghost follow someone is when a person visited a 'dirty' place and then got followed. But i tink usually it is also bcos of certain karmic link. I do not know your friend, and I would advise him to visit an experienced and wise Buddhist venerable to talk about it.<br><br>Also your friend should dedicate merits to that spirit that is following him.</div>

Everywhere there's many spirits.<br>and i kind of agree with the 'down on luck'. but my meaning of 'luck means that the person's yang chi/energy/guang/light is low. this spirit deptor(s) already followed the person for sometimes. but cannot do anything to him when he's yang chi is high. but when the yang chi is low they have their chance to cause trouble.<br>however b4 a spirit follow a person, the person must have done something wrong in the past that offended the spirit, be it during it was alive. they seek vengence, if not they seldom bother ppl.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Although their hair is mostly white, their face is smooth and delicate like a child's. Why? Their moral virtue has induced this change. Although their hair is white, it is very glossy, not at all dry. (But it's not because they applied hair wax.) The hair on their head can emit light. Those who have skill in cultivation, or who have opened the Five Eyes, can recognize them right away.<br><br>Buddhism is a level higher because it includes the state where not only the hair on the head gives off light, the whole body emits light. The tip of every hair on the body can send out light, and each hairpore is different from ordinary hairpores. Skilled cultivators in Buddhism can cause white hair to turn black again, and new teeth to grow in where the old ones have fallen out. In Taoism, the phenomenon of teeth growing in again also occurs, but they cannot make all the hairpores emit light. That's one difference. Do you know how to tell if someone is a Good and Wise Advisor? You don't have to open your Five Eyes. If you're an expert, you can tell if he's a Good and Wise Advisor, a virtuous person, just by using your ordinary eyes. If a person has no virtue, his facial muscles will typically be contorted into a very disagreeable expression.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello!<br><br>Whomever is being or seems to be troubled with spirits, simpy have compassion for them, for they are sentient beings aswell. As Buddhist we must have compassion for all these beings, therefore recite for them. Great Compassion Dharani is very great for such situations, the Great Compassion dharani helps develop inner compassion within oneself aswell as bestow great compassion towards other sentient beings so that their suffering shall cease.<br><br>Also you can keep the shurangama dharani with you aswell. As stated by Most Venerable Master Hsuan Hua, the dharani protects from goblins, demons, angry spirits etc...<br><br>Aswell reciting towards Amitabha Buddha shall also help these beings reborn in Sukhavati.<br><br>Namo Great Compassion Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva!<br></div>

Aswell, I find it pretty harsh to call them "dirty things." <span style="font-style: italic;">Like us they suffer as much as we do</span>, therefore they need our compassion.<br><br>As I have posted earliar, I mentioned about reciting dharanis' and mantras for these beings. I will now explain myself clearer on how this works.<br><br>Venerable Master Hsuan Hua had stated before:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>1. "All mantras are the names of god and ghost kings. When you recite the names of the god and ghosts kings, the small gods and ghosts are well-behaved, and do not dare to cause you trouble. Why? It is because they wonder, "How do you know our ghost king? How do you know our god king?" </strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>2. "Mantras are also like a soldier's password. In the army there is a different password every day. Only your own people know it and the people outside do not know. Let's say the password is "victory". If you meet a soldier whom you do not know, then you ask him what the password is. If he says "victory" then you say "right". You know that he is one of us. But if you ask him the password and he says "lucky", you know that he is not one of us. Mantras work the same way. As soon as the gods and ghosts hear you recite the mantra, they say, "Oh, that is our password," so they are all well-behaved. Otherwise they would want to fight with you." </strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>3. "Mantras are a kind of secret language, which only certain people understand. An analogy will make this clear. Suppose there is a person who is very poor and lowly. He goes abroad where people do not know him. He tells them, " I am the king of a certain country, but the generals revolted and there was a change of government.  I secretly escaped and came to this country." The king of this country really does not know whether he is genuine or not. He's a phony, but the king thinks that he is genuine, so he gives him one of his princesses for a wife. This makes hima  prince, a member of the king's household. He wasn't a king before, but he acts like it. Day in and day out he is always losing his temper.<br><br>Then a person comes in this country who knows that this imposter was a poor and lowly person, and says to the princess who is married to him, "When he gets angry, you need only say these few sentences: 'Originally you were a poor and lowly person who drifted in from another country far away, WHy must you have such a big temper?' As soon as you say this, he will know, 'Oh , she knows of my humble origins,' and will not get angry anymore. A mantra has the same effect. As soon as you recite the mantra, the god and ghosts will assume you understand their origins, that you know what they are all about, and so they will not dare to cause you trouble." </strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><strong>4. "Mantras are like the mind-imprint of all Buddhas. "Mind-imprint" alludes to the way in which the minds of two enlightened beings interact and acknowledge each other. They are the secret language of the Buddhas which can only be known by them. Because of other living beings do not understand them, mantras are left untranslated."</strong></span><br><br>These were the words of Master Hsuan Hua. I typed it all out, sorry if there are careless spelling mistakes, if there are any mistakes and you cannot understand, please let me know and I will stand corrected.<br><br>Thus, as you can see you need not be afraid of these beings. As I've said they suffer like us, therefore need our compassion, and we must have the wisdom to bestow it upon them. So, we should not be alarmed and or afraid, we must have the wisdom to understand why they are here, and that they suffer just as we do, and therefore we be a bodhisattva understanding their suffering, become one with them and bestow compassion and loving kindness upon all beings.<br><br>Om Tare Tutare Ture Svaha!</div>
