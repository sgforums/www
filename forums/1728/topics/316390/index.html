              <h4>PATIENCE - THE MAIN ANTIDOTE</h4>
              <p>Patience is the main antidote to anger. As common 
                            wisdom says: just count to 100... During this time, any of the below 
                            methods can be effective. The most effective method will depend 
                            on the actual situation. Especially in our age of rush and intense 
                            change, patience may not be seen as a positive quality, but take 
                            a minute to think impatience can easily give rise to a general feeling 
                            of anger.</p>
              <p>Patience is like a beautiful ornament. When you 
                            become a person with great patience, it brings a certain element 
                            of charm to your life. You are loved by others, and you give no 
                            problems to your friends. You bring an element of joy, happiness, 
                            and calmness to other people's lives - your friends, your family, 
                            and the community. You do not have to ask to be accepted; everyone 
                            longs for your presence. Everyone looks up to you and respects you, 
                            not because you have worked for that or expected it, not because 
                            you were competing for their favor, but simply because of the nature 
                            of patience. You are respected and trusted, and you acquire dignity 
                            with the practice of patience. When you are honored, it is with 
                            sincerity, and it is something you can live up to.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>...Just hearing about patience does not mean 
                              you are experiencing it now or will easily develop it. To lay 
                              the ground for training the mind, you must first tame the mind. 
                              To tame the mind, it is extremely important to do the basic shamata 
                              [tranquility meditation, calm abiding] practice, which develops 
                              calmness and tranquility. Then you can add the practice of patience, 
                              understanding the benefits of patience and reminding yourself 
                              to take advantage of the available antidotes.<br> <em>From <a href="http://www.snowlionpub.com/store/store.cgi?affiliate=International_Kalachakra_Network&amp;page=pages/DHPA.php">Dharma

              <h4><strong><a name="4"></a>HANDLING ANGER - APPLYING ANTIDOTES </strong></h4>
              <p>Below is a summary of various approaches to anger. 
                            They obviously will be most efficient when used with a calm and 
                            concentrated mind, either during meditation or at the moment you 
                            realize that something needs to be done about your anger. Obviously, 
                            the problem during an actual difficult situation is to have a calm 
                            and concentrated mind - a regular meditation practice can be of 
                            great help then! One of the best ways to really make progress with 
                            understanding and changing the functioning of our own mind is to 
                            try out analytical meditation, combined with these clues, see also 
                            <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/Meditations/anger_aversion_meditation.html">Meditation 
                            on Anger</a>.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 1 - Patience. </strong><br> Patience is the main antidote to anger. As common wisdom says: just 
                            count to 100... During this time, any of the below methods can be 
                            effective. The most effective method will depend on the actual situation. 
                            Especially in our age of rush and intense change, patience may not 
                            be seen as a positive quality, but take a minute to think impatience 
                            can easily give rise to a general feeling of anger.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 2 - Realisation of the Noble Truth 
                            of Suffering. </strong><br> Once one understands that problems and frustration is a basic fact 
                            of life, it can reduce our impatience with our own unrealistic expectations. 
                            In other words: nothing is perfect, so don't expect it. <br> Because of my belief that things are or can be perfect, it is easy 
                            to feel hurt.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 3 - Understanding Karma. </strong><br> As explained in the page on <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/karma.html">Karma</a>, the 
                            real reasons for our problems are our own actions, which are in 
                            turn caused by our own negative states of mind. If someone makes 
                            us angry, it has a sobering effect if we dare to think that the 
                            real reasons for this situation are our own past actions, and the 
                            person is just a circumstance for our own karma to ripen.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 4 - Changing or Accepting.</strong> <br> Basically, we can find ourselves in two types of unpleasant situations: 
                            ones we can change and ones we cannot change. <br> - If I can change the situation, I should do something about it 
                            instead of getting all worked-up and angry. Not acting in such a 
                            situation will cause frustration in the end. <br> - If I cannot change the situation, I will have to accept it. If 
                            I don't, it will only lead to frustration and a negative and unpleasant 
                            state of mind, which will make the situation only worse. <br> For some reasons unclear to me, Westerners (including myself) appear 
                            to have big problems with accepting unpleasant situations which 
                            we cannot change. Could this be a result of impatience (a form of 
                            anger) with imperfection (an unrealistic expectation)?<br> Do consider the wisdom in the following remarks (from an online 
                            discussion - forgot the writer.):</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"How does this effect my Buddhist practice? 
                              <br> It doesn't. <br> These reported events are like an arrow shot at my heart but it 
                              lands at my feet. <br> I choose not to bend over, pick it up, and stab myself with it."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 5 - Realistic Analysis. </strong><br> For example: someone accuses me of something. <br> - If it is true, I apparently made a mistake, so I should listen 
                            and learn. <br> - If it is untrue, the other person makes a mistake. So what? Nobody 
                            is perfect. I also make mistakes, and it is all too easy to label 
                            the other as "enemy", in which case a helpful discussion or forgiving 
                            becomes difficult. <br> It may also be worthwhile searching for the real underlying reason 
                            of the problem. Of special importance is to evaluate one's own role 
                            in the situation: my own fears, insecurity, being very unfriendly, 
                            or not being blameless (like leaving home much too late for an appointment 
                            and blaming the 5 minutes delay of the train).</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE - Realisation of Emptiness. </strong><br> See the page on <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/wisdom_emptiness.html">Wisdom</a>. To summarise 
                            it briefly, if one deeply realises the emptiness of inherent existence 
                            or interdependence of the other person, the situation and oneself, 
                            there is nothing to be angry about. The realisation of emptiness 
                            is therefore the ultimate means of ridding oneself of unrealistic 
                            negative emotions like anger.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 7 - Equanimity.</strong> <br> Equanimity means that one realises the basic equality of all sentient 
                            beings; others want happiness, just like I do. Others make mistakes 
                            just like I do. Others are confused, angry, attached just like I 
                            often am. Is the other person happy in this situation, or just struggling 
                            like I am?</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 8 - Openness </strong><br> Be prepared to be open for the motivation of others to do what causes 
                            you problems. Talking it over and being prepared to listen can suddenly 
                            make a problem acceptable. <br> Did you ever notice the difference when a plane or train has much 
                            delay and nobody gives any reasons for it? People very quickly become 
                            irritated and hostile. Then when the driver or pilot explains there 
                            is a technical defect or an accident, suddenly waiting becomes easier.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 9 - Relativity. </strong><br> Ask yourself if this situation is actually important enough to spoil 
                            your own and other people's mood. Is this problem worth getting 
                            upset in a life where death can hit me at any moment?</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 10 - Change Your Motivation. </strong><br> In case a situation is really unacceptable, and another person needs 
                            to convinced that something is to be done or changed, there is no 
                            need to become upset and angry. It is likely much more efficient 
                            if you show of understanding and try to make the other understand 
                            the need for change. If one needs to appear angry for some reason 
                            to convince the other person of the seriousness of the situation, 
                            one can think like a parent acting wrathful to prevent the child 
                            from harming itself.<br> In general, to be really effective one needs to reflect on quite 
                            a number of aspects in one's own mind like; forgiveness, peace of 
                            mind, fears, self-acceptance (no acceptance of others is really 
                            possible without self-acceptance), habits, prejudices etc. A list 
                            of aspects to start with is given in the page about the <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/mind.html">mind</a>, 
                            under the 26 non-virtuous mental factors.</p>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 11 - Watch Your Hands.</strong><br> An interesting suggestion from Jon Kabat-Zinn, from '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401307787/internatio0c4-20">Wherever 
                            You Go, There You Are</a>':</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"All our hand postures are mudras in that 
                              they are associated with subtle or not-so-subtle energies. Take 
                              the energy of the fist, for instance. When we get angry, our hands 
                              tend to close into fists. Some people unknowingly practice this 
                              mudra a lot in their lives. It waters the seeds of anger and violence 
                              within you ever time you do it, and they respond by sprouting 
                              and growing stronger. <br> The next time you find yourself making fists out of anger, try 
                              to bring mindfulness to the inner attitude embodied in a fist. 
                              Feel the tension, the hatred, the anger, the aggression, and the 
                              fear which it contains. Then, in the midst of your anger, as an 
                              experiment, if the person you are angry at is present, try opening 
                              your fists and placing the palms together over your heart in the 
                              prayer position right in front of him. (Of course, he won't have 
                              the slightest idea what you are doing.) Notice what happens to 
                              the anger and hurt as you hold this position for even a few moments."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>ANTIDOTE 12 - Meditation.</strong><br> Last, but certainly not least, meditation can be the ultimate cure 
                            to completely eliminating anger from your mind. In the beginning, 
                            one can do analytical meditations (like <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/Meditations/anger_aversion_meditation.html">this 
                            meditation on anger</a>), but also meditation on <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/Meditations/equanimity_compassion_meditation.html">compassion</a>, 
                            <a href="http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/Meditations/love_forgiveness_meditation.html">love and 
                            forgiving</a> reduce anger as well. Ultimately, the realization

              <p>Just posted this in another topic:</p>
              <p>Just now some thoughts arose and an emotion arose due to the
                                                  arising of the egoic mind...  immediately that was recognised
                                                  (so mindfulness is very important) and released, and I could
                                                  actually feel the tension in my chest area being released. Taking
                                                  persons, situations and events in an impersonal manner feels really
                                                  liberating! :D (btw does anyone have trouble viewing the list of
                                                  emoticons on sgforums?)</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>I think the key here is maintaining a mindful awareness (so that no thoughts, feelings and perceptions go unnoticed), and practice dropping the self, the attachment to all thoughts and perceptions moment to moment... and remain calm and thoughtless as far as possible. Be the space that allows whatever things or person to appear in, rather than (the thought of being a) 'person' facing lots of other 'persons'. My dharma teacher would give the example of people throwing arrows into empty space, whatever shoots up will only return to the ground because there is no where to land and so nothing can affect that space. This is easier said than done because of our ingrained tendency to react negatively to events and 'personalize' situations. But it can be done through gradual practice.</p>
              <p>When we practice long enough we'll realise that the cause of anger or any emotion is not due to a person or an external event... but due to the ignorance of the "I"-thought.. giving rise to "personalization" of events -- i.e. thoughts "I am betrayed by him!" When this 'personalization' is dropped, there is an inner OK-ness with everything, but actions can still be done in this state to prevent further 'manipulation, betrayal, swindled.'</p>

              <p>Dear both, thanks for the advice. But how do we exactly deal with unfaithfulness in marriage? How should we apply Buddhism? Dissolving the marriage is not an option...</p>
              <p>Theoretically, I know that lots of good deeds must be done to redeem the sins. But it's frustrating that there's no end in sight to this agony - and I have to suffer for bad things I have unknowingly committed in the past.</p>
              <p>People around me see me as obliging and patient. Sometimes, I feel that I am too forgiving. But if we don't forgive, how do we move on in life?</p>
              <p>Seeking explanation from the other party... all my requests for an explantion have fallen onto deaf ears...</p>
              <p>Can't wait to get out from this cycle of suffering...</p>

              <p>My Buddhist knowledge is quite limited here; I thought maybe we should keep our minds open to all available options and not get attached a certain position?</p>

              <p>Here's what the Buddha said:</p>

              <p><strong>15. "Young man, be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends:
                      the taker, the talker, the flatterer, and the reckless companion.</strong></p>
              <p>16. "The taker can be identified by four things: by only taking,
                      asking for a lot while giving little, performing duty out of fear, and
                      offering service in order to gain something.</p>
              <p>17. "The talker can be identified by four things: by reminding of
                      past generosity, promising future generosity, mouthing empty words of
                      kindness, and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help.</p>
              <p><strong>18. "The flatterer can be identified by four things: by supporting
                      both bad and good behavior indiscriminately, praising you to your face,
                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and putting you down behind your back.</span></strong></p>
              <p>19. "The reckless companion can be identified by four things: by
                      accompanying you in drinking, roaming around at night, partying, and
                      gambling."</p>
              <p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>
              <p>20. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>
              <div class="verse">
              <pre><strong>"The friend who is all take,<br>The friend of empty words,<br>The friend full of flattery,<br>And the reckless friend;<br><br>These four are not friends, but enemies;<br>The wise understand this<br>And keep them at a distance<br>As they would a dangerous path."</strong><br></pre>
              </div>
              <p>21. "Young man, be aware of these four good-hearted friends: the
                      helper, the friend who endures in good times and bad, the mentor, and
                      the compassionate friend.</p>
              <p>22. "The helper can be identified by four things: by protecting you
                      when you are vulnerable, and likewise your wealth, being a refuge when
                      you are afraid, and in various tasks providing double what is requested.</p>
              <p><strong>23. "The enduring friend can be identified by four things:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> by
                      telling you secrets, guarding your own secrets closely,</span> not abandoning
                      you in misfortune, and even dying for you.</strong></p>
              <p>24. "The mentor can be identified by four things: by restraining you
                      from wrongdoing, guiding you towards good actions, telling you what you
                      ought to know, and showing you the path to heaven.</p>
              <p><strong>25. "The compassionate friend can be identified by four things: by
                      not rejoicing in your misfortune, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">delighting in your good fortune,
                      preventing others from speaking ill of you, and encouraging others who
                      praise your good qualities.</span>"</strong></p>
              <p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>
              <p>26. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>
              <div class="verse">
              <pre>"The friend who is a helper,<br>The friend through thick and thin,<br>The friend who gives good counsel,<br>And the compassionate friend;<br><br>These four are friends indeed,<br>The wise understand this<br>And attend on them carefully,<br>Like a mother her own child.<br><br>The wise endowed with virtue<br>Shine forth like a burning fire,<br>Gathering wealth as bees do honey<br>And heaping it up like an ant hill.<br>Once wealth is accumulated,<br>Family and household life may follow.<br><br>By dividing wealth into four parts,<br>True friendships are bound;<br>One part should be enjoyed;<br>Two parts invested in business;<br>And the fourth set aside<br>Against future misfortunes."<br></pre>
