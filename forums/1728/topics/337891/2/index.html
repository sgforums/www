              <p>Hmm... did you do a direct translation from chinese to english with online tools like babelfish for this following article? Cos it sounds weird.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <a name="Real%20Buddhist%20faith">Real Buddhist Faith</a></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: underline;">What is Real Buddhist 
              Faith?</span></p>
              <p><span>In fact, the 
              essence of Buddhism, not superstition and the letter is different from Buddhism 
              is Buddhism, Buddhism, the basic content is the same everywhere, as are 
              permanent.</span> <span> Buddhism is big from the sleep of the Buddha Sakyamuni â”€ â”€ release a large 
              statue of the sea Beizhi to show that it was full of wisdom, full of mercy, full 
              of bright, cool comfort of a precept, according to the precept of this faith And 
              the establishment of the Church form of Buddhism is.</span></p>
              <p><span>The so-called faith, the 
              belief is correct, just as the Xin Shi, a letter on the right track solution, 
              the integrity of the line of the letter, the real trust.</span> <span> Is the content of 
              the letter should have three main conditions: the first is to be permanent, must 
              be universal in the second and the third is the inevitability of the need.</span> <span> In other 
              words a way, we can see that in the past has always been the case, so now, so is 
              bound to the future.</span> <span> For whatever 
              reason, or a matter of belief or a trust if it can not withstand the test of the 
              three conditions, it is not superstition but a letter.</span> <span> Of a religious 
              doctrine, can not withstand the test of the times, pass environmental flow, not 
              open new realms, it is superstition, not faith.</span></p>
              <p><span>But it is an 
              undeniable fact, is a letter of Buddhism, the Mahayana popular in the region, 
              particularly in China, has always been the mountains, as well as a high priest 
              of a small number of taxis which were gentlemen's proprietary, as non-faith, has 
              not been universal, general The people are always in the release of the three 
              religions of Confucianism and Taoism mixed with faith in the concept of life, 
              such as for the spirits of the dead and worship of the convictions that is a 
              ghost, not a product of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText" style="text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 15pt;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: underline;">Is Buddha the Creator?</span></p>
              <p><span>Buddhist belief, 
              there is no concept of the Creator, is that people's awareness of the Buddha, 
              the Buddha in the world are able to consciousness all the principles, but no 
              change has been the state of the world; Buddha degrees of all living creatures 
              are able to, the ability to get beings, By the people of the need to be able to 
              decide themselves.</span> <span> Buddha is 
              the best Liang Yi, but for all living creatures prescription pain diagnosis, he 
              served the drugs, they are bound too, if a person refuses medication, is also 
              sympathetic with the cause of the Buddha; Buddha is the best guide, the people 
              can lead a world away from the sea, Follow the guidance of the Buddha, must 
              have, if not from the guide, but also helpless.</span> <span> So, Buddha 
              does not claim to the Creator, and even they do not want to Tuzhong only for 
              formal worship Buddha; be able to practice the Buddhist precept, it means 
              Jianfojingfo Otherwise, although the audience at the time of the Buddha, but 
              also does not mean Xianfo.</span> <span> Therefore, the 
              Buddha is neither a Creator or God is where the Buddha taught the people Liku 
              only way to get music, the Buddha himself has Liku Sidel, but it can not replace 
              the people Liku Sidel.</span> <span> Buddha is a 
              great educator, mentor-day people, not a magician and illusionist home, he said 
              that the family do not lie 'on behalf of the people of Atonement', he is all we 
              have to teach people responsible for themselves â”€ â”€ 'Jhonggua get melons, 
              species Dou Dou was.</span> <span> <span class="google-src-text" style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">’</span> '</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: underline;">What is Buddha?</span></p>
              <p><span>Buddha, which is a 
              transliteration of ancient Indian Sanskrit.</span></p>
              <p><span>Buddha, with its 
              own consciousness, awareness of others, awareness and all-knowing mean sleep all 
              times, therefore, also known as the all-Homo sapiens, or are perceived.</span></p>
              <p><span>Buddha, the Buddha 
              is translated as Jane in the world, dating back about 2600 yrs ago(563 BC), born 
              India Acropolis vastu Buddha Sakyamuni's Prince Edward, Cheng Road, known as 
              Sakyamuni Muni.</span> <span> Zuxing 
              is Sakyamuni, which means Nengren, Muni is the ancient Indian saints for the 
              common honorific title, meaning Jimo. This is the founder of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, the precept of 
              the Buddha, made us realize that the existing historical records, although only 
              one person is Sakyamuni Buddha, but in the past long ago, the world had the 
              Buddha was born, after a long future in this world Buddha was born there will 
              now Shifangshijie, there are a lot of the existence of Buddha.</span> <span>Therefore, 
              Buddhism is not unique to the Buddha, the Buddhist recognition of past, present 
              and future, with numerous Buddha immeasurable, as well as all those who believe 
              that all sentient beings (animals) Xinfo whether or not, has its own in the 
              future become the Buddha Probably because I believe Buddhism: The Buddha is the 
              people's consciousness, all living creatures are not yet aware of the Buddha.</span> <span> In the 
              state, although Van, in essence, the Buddha are equal, so that when the Buddha 
              Buddhism not only to worship rather not admit that the creation of another 
              universe, the existence of God. Therefore, Buddhists are atheists.</span></p>
