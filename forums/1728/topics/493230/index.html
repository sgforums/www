              silence</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Dec 24th 2016 The Economist</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;">Where, how and why to be quiet</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">IF YOU had heard it on one of Yangon’s chaotic streets you
              would have paid it little mind. It would have been a euphonious whisper swiftly
              lost in a cacophonous torrent. But in the pre-dawn quiet of the monastery it
              was as piercing as an air-raid siren. Shortly before 4am a monk struck two
              gongs, one about a second after the other. They sounded two different notes,
              the second just short of a fourth higher than the first. Then, pausing for a
              few seconds, the monk struck the gongs again. He did this several times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The monastery began to stir: soft footsteps and the rustling
              of clothes—no voices. Most of the monks, nuns and lay worshippers filed out of
              their cells and into the dhamma halls—one for men and one for women—for an hour
              of seated meditation before the first of the day’s two meals. Some instead did
              an hour of walking meditation: slow, deliberate, measured steps forward, hands
              clasped either in front or behind. After the morning meal the day’s meditation,
              eating, sweeping, cleaning were done slowly, deliberately, and, for most lay
              worshippers, in complete silence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The silence of this monastery, like most silence outside the
              fanciest anechoic chambers, is an aspiration rather than a fact. Not that long
              ago the chanting of the monks of Mingaladon would have carried over nothing but
              the fields and farms of what was then a rural township of Yangon, with little
              more than the crowing of cocks and lowing of cattle flowing back the other way.
              No longer. Though there are still farms in Mingaladon, it is also home to
              Myanmar’s biggest and busiest airport, which is set to get even busier as the
              ever-less-secluded country assumes its place on the trails of backpackers and
              adventurous investors. Highway Number 3, a tributary to the busy Yangon-Mandalay
              Highway, bisects the township; in the monastery monks and laypeople alike
              meditate to the constant thrum of passing traffic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the silence of not speaking, as opposed to that of not
              hearing, persists. And, if anything, it gets more attractive as the noises
              outside the walls mount up. For someone whose working days are relentless
              blizzards of phone calls, e-mails, tweets and deadlines, and whose home life is
              filled with the constant screeching and breaking that only children at the
              demon-puppy stage can provide, a week spent in silent meditation within the
              monastery’s walls sounded heavenly. No demands, an inward focus, time to
              breathe and reflect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In fact, the plunge into silence proved powerfully
              disconcerting: like a cartoon character shoved over a cliff, running
              fruitlessly in mid-air. Your correspondent’s modern mind craved stimulation;
              the sought-after silence brought only soured boredom. This, say meditation
              enthusiasts, is just the first stage: you have to push through it to reach
              something worthwhile on the other side. It turned out to be easier said—or
              easier to recall, in silence, someone else once saying—than done.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The quiet, once you are in it, is difficult. Saying you want
              it is easy, and commonplace. After the age of 30, if you tell any friend that
              you are in need of peace and quiet he is likely to nod in recognition. The
              demand is high enough that silence of all sorts is for sale. Noise-cancelling
              electronics, first discussed in public as a throwaway joke by the
              science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, now sit in hundreds of millions of
              dollars-worth of high-end world-excluding headphones. The intrepid,
              tight-lipped tourist can choose from silent retreats on six continents; many of
              the growing number headed for the seventh, Antarctica, probably do so in part
              out of yearning for a great white silence. Smaller doses of silent meditation,
              in the guise of mindfulness, are cropping up in secular school curricula across
              the Western world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Finland boasts of its rural wooded silence as other countries
              sing the praises of their beaches or mountains: it markets itself as a silent
              tourist destination. Gordon Hempton, an “acoustic ecologist” (he records
              natural sounds) has designated a small chunk of territory deep in Olympic
              National Park in Washington state, far from roads and flight paths, “One Square
              Inch of Silence”. He believes it is the quietest place in America’s lower 48
              states, and wants to keep it that way. He monitors the area for noise
              pollution, and tries to track down the offenders and ask them to quieten down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Obviously, the inch is far from silent. The forest is alive
              with the whispers of nature: frogs and crickets, distant streams, squirrels and
              deer running over fallen leaves. This is the contradiction built into the
              pursuit of silence; the more sources of noise are stilled, the more the
              previously imperceptible rises to the level of perception. This was the essence
              of the silence that John Cage, a composer, used in several of his works, most
              famously “4’33”, a composition for piano that consists of three movements. At
              the beginning of each the pianist opens the instrument’s lid, and at the end of
              each he closes it. No notes are played. The piece allows an audience to attend
              to the sounds around them and the questions within.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What the silence reveals can be grim. Samuel Beckett’s mimed
              plays “Act Without Words I” and “Act Without Words II” use silence to draw out
              the frustration, pointlessness and endured unendurability of life. His novel
              “The Unnamable” ends on a similar note (or absence of note): “I’ll never know,
              in the silence you don’t know, you must go on, I can’t go on, I’ll go on.”
              Beckett believed that “every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and
              nothingness”; and yet he went on writing them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Fundamental though it is to some finished art, silence may
              matter even more as a circumstance for art’s creation. “The impulse to create
              begins—often terribly and fearfully—in a tunnel of silence,” wrote the American
              poet Adrienne Rich. In “The Aesthetics of Silence”, the writer and critic Susan
              Sontag urged artists to maintain a silent “zone of meditation” in order to
              protect their creative impulses from a world that wants to stifle them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That said, stifling can be a silence of its own—one imposed
              through convention or power. In the censor’s hands silence can be a brutal
              intervention. Part of the strength of Harold Pinter’s plays, in which
              characters taunt, worry, threaten and displace each other with unnervingly long
              pauses, is their ability to dramatise in domestic form the silence imposed by
              states on many other political artists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But although silence can be a necessary beginning, a tool of
              oppression and, properly deployed, a cutting critique of power, it is
              comparatively rare that it is the essence of an artist’s work. Few have trusted
              their audience to create the art without them, as Cage did; most feel a need to
              say something. For the deepest human relationships with silence—and also those
              most widely incorporated into the mundane life—turn not to art, but to religion</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Some Christians, Buddhists and, to a lesser extent, Muslims
              have chosen silence for centuries, and there are rooms like those available in
              the Mingaladon monastery set aside for those who wish to explore its potential
              in Buddhist and Christian monasteries around the world. For the religious,
              silence offers a way to ponder and listen for the divine, the unsayable and
              inexplicable. Christians commonly choose silence because they believe in a god
              who speaks. They need to be silent to create a space for him—always at the risk,
              as in Shûsaku Endô’s novel, recently filmed by Martin Scorsese, that the
              silence remains unfulfilled, an abyss. Silence is also, the religions teach,
              personally improving. The Prophet Muhammad told Muslims that, “One can greatly
              beautify himself with two habits: good manners and lengthy silence.” For
              Buddhists, silence teaches devotees to master their passions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Silence is often a retreat from worldliness, and the
              inauthentic. Ignatius of Antioch, an early Church father, advised Christians at
              Ephesus: “It is better to be silent and be real than to talk and not be
              real”–foreshadowing by around 1,800 years Mark Twain’s advice that it is better
              to keep one’s mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all
              doubt. It is also a way to avoid doing ill. One of the admonitions that
              comprise Buddhism’s eightfold patch is to practise samma vaca, or “right
              speech”, which scriptures define as abstaining from false, slanderous, harsh
              and idle speech; all major religions counsel their adherents to choose their
              words carefully and use them sparingly. Religions can supplement the self
              control required for such abstinence in ways that may be helpful or oppressive;
              if the faithful cannot speak, they can ask no questions, preserving the
              authority of their superiors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many forms of religious practice make use of silence; some,
              such as that of Quakers, may consist of little else. But there are particular
              places where it really lives and breathes: in wildernesses like Mr Hempton’s;
              in some monasteries. Benedict, the sixth-century monk seen as the father of
              Christian monasticism, did not explicitly include silence in his rule, but in
              the cloistered life speech is widely seen as something requiring permission or
              exigency. Today monks who live by the Rule of St Benedict in hundreds of
              (normally small) Trappist monasteries speak only sparingly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thomas Merton, an influential American Trappist who was
              ordained in 1949, held that the only words required of a priest were those of
              the Mass. This disdain for speech (which caused him to agonise about his own
              copious writings) stemmed in part from his belief that God’s words were beyond
              the scope of “human argument”. Some things are mysterious, and not subject to
              analysis. One must be silent to understand them, and it is better to say
              nothing than to try to explain them. As Ludwig Wittgenstein, an Austrian
              philosopher, put it in his “Tractatus Logico-philosophicus”: “Whereof one
              cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.” It is not power that compels
              silence here, but the inadequacy of any attempt at communication.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha would have called this practice “Noble Silence”.
              When asked a question the answer to which he believed the questioner incapable
              of understanding, he said nothing. Usually these questions concerned the
              world’s fundamental nature; perhaps more than any other of the world’s great
              religions, Buddhism prizes the observable, and does not much concern itself
              trying to define the undefinable. When a disciple asked Buddha whether the
              universe was infinite or finite; or whether there is a self; or the more
              plaintive, “Will you tell me the truth?”: silence. Better no speech than speech
              that misleads, or answers that limit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddha himself became liberated through silent meditation.
              Though Buddhism varies markedly with geography, from the wry, austere Japanese
              practice of Zen to the rigorous, state-entwined Theravada Buddhism practised in
              Myanmar and Thailand, silent meditation is generally the central practice of
              faithful Buddhists, whether monks, students, housewives or fishermen. When Mr
              Hempton says, of his square-inch of silence deep in the piney wilderness, that
              its silence “is not the absence of something. Silence is the presence of
              everything,” he is expressing a thought Buddhists would understand perfectly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the presence of everything—and of all of one’s self—is
              not always a release. It can be a burden. Around sunset on the second day of
              his seclusion in speechlessness, your correspondent realised that for all the
              equanimity offered by Buddhism, the psychological acuity of its founder’s
              teachings and the hospitality of the Mingaladon monks, he would rather be in
              one of the cars he could hear passing by on Highway Number 3, wherever it was
              going, than inside the dhamma hall, where he was supposed to be meditating. Having
              booked a seven-day retreat, he lasted a bit less than 70 hours. His still,
              small voice within, he decided on listening to it, was insufferable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is possible that pushing further would have brought a
              breakthrough, not a breakdown. It is also possible that, for many people, 15
              minutes of silent meditation each morning and afternoon can be wonderful while
              15 hours of it each day is both a waste of time and a greased slide into
              insanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Discovering the limit to the silence you can bear has its
              advantages. To some extent it can teach you to appreciate the irksome chaos and
              noise that led to the original yearning for silence—to realise that just as
              there can be inner tumult in silence, so there can be tranquillity in the thrum
              of activity. For all that, in English, the words are so often neighbours,
              “peace” and “quiet” are not necessarily conducive to each other. The Hebrew
              word “shalom” is reasonably translated as “peace”, but it has other shades of
              meaning too: completeness, prosperity, wholeness. These are things that need
              not be silent. As Diarmuid MacCulloch writes in his quirky, insightful book
              “Silence: A Christian History”, in Old Testament scripture “peace and rest are
              associated with busy, regulated activity”. The preacher in “Ecclesiastes” tells
              his listener that “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for
              there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
              thou goest.” In its permanence and completeness, the grave is silent. But its
              peace is not one to seek out too soon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is a tradition of silence in those scriptures, too. “Be
              still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him,” the Psalmist says. But it is
              pulled at by the possibility of worldly, noisy peace, and the tension matters.
              Rescued from the austerity of the Mingaladon monastery and plunked down in
              hectic central Yangon, a refugee from silence may jostle less and smile more at
              the whorling sea of humanity that surrounds and presses in upon him. He may sit
              down for a steaming bowl of noodles at a packed stall on a narrow patch of
              pavement and see the customary elbows in the ribs from the diners on either

              whomever is listening.</span></p>
