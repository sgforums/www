            <div class='col-md body'>It's best not to think it's good or bad. Things are the way it should be. Be it good or bad. But when doing it, use you wisdoms to assist you.<br><br>1. Car Loan, actually I think you should not lent her. Cause it's boosting her ego. You actually should advice if cannot afford let it go.<br><br>2. Friend's investment. Same here, you are boosting her ego. If she cannot afford let the chance goes. It's not her $.<br><br>3. This one very hard to say.

To have perfect body and mind is good karma.<br><br>To lend them money is a choice. It is a series of events which led to this choice but you made the decision. Not to wonder if we get good karma from such actions but to learn from the results. Having compassion does not mean we are fools. To help does not mean just lending money, we can find other alternatives like getting them better jobs etc.<br><br>I don't think these are bad things happening, cos you have a choice of how to deal with it. Just apply a little bit more wisdom and you'll see other ways to help. It's not like some sickness or something which is beyond human help. Anything which is related to money is never a problem. It's not whether one is rich or not, it's whether one is contented or not.<br></div>

What you have experienced may happened to anyone here.  It is rather unfortunate for you.<br><br>This could be a one time off, if you put it to a stop by using little widom to judge it. Or it may snow ball to even a bigger problem ahead.
