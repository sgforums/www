              <p>Ten years ago, almost exactly to this date,  I was meditating about 4 
              hours a day, 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening.  I was 
              at the height of my Buddhist meditation practice and I felt like I was 
              really getting somewhere.  Then on the 1st Sept 2000 while doing my 
              morning meditation my mind blew open like a bolt of lightening and 
              suddenly there was no me, no mind, and just the sound of a bird calling 
              to the morning sun.  It was a profound experience that changed my life. 
               It was like waking up from a dream and seeing life through new eyes and
               realising everything you'd ever known before and the way you'd be 
              experiencing life was incorrect.<br> <a name="more"></a><br> Over the years, as I meditated, I started to notice how the mind itself 
              displays very similar characteristics to aspects of nature.  And over 
              time I started to use metaphors to describe aspects of the mind to 
              people to make it easy to understand.  For example, the mind itself 
              displays very similar characteristics to the sky.  It is vast and 
              expansive and no matter how far you go you never actually perceive any 
              boundaries.  If you throw a ball through the sky it passes through 
              unattached.  Clouds arise out of nowhere and disappear again as if they 
              never existed - effortlessly, silently, and without resistance - much 
              like the nature of thoughts in the mind.  The mind also reacts to the 
              environment and displays symptoms of cause and effect - when we perceive
               something, thoughts or emotion arise with them in a dance of 
              interaction. Ideas are born into the mind out of nowhere much like a new
               seedling is born and later it will die away like a fading flower.  This
               ability for the mind to display characteristics of nature always 
              fascinated me.<br> <br> While meditating yesterday a deep insight came over me ... the mind 
              doesn't display these characteristics because it is similar to nature, 
              the mind displays these characteristics because <em>it is</em> nature, <em>it is</em> all these things, <em>it is everything</em>. It was so simple. <strong>The
               mind is not made from some "other" component, it is not made from 
              something that you can strive to understand or experience separate from 
              everything else, the mind quite literally </strong><em><strong>is This</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> everything that you are experiencing now.</strong>  It behaves in the same way as the sky, as clouds, as the wind because 
              it is bound by the same laws that bind everything else and it is made 
              from the same stuff that everything else is made from.  There is no 
              difference.<br> <br> <strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">How to Apply This</span></strong><br> <br> Now those sound like really wise words and if you pick up any spiritual 
              book you'll read lots of stuff like that.  But this doesn't really help 
              you at all and me saying it doesn't really help you understand or make 
              your life better. <strong>You can read a tonne of spiritual books that talk 
              about this concept and you'll feel good reading it and it will inspire 
              you to want to know more but its kind of useless if you doesn't lead you
               to experience this for yourself.</strong><br></p>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">So what is "mind", what is this "stuff" that <em>is</em> everything?  Who 
              are you?  Or maybe you should ask "What are you?"  There are many names 
              for this and people call it many things - nature, spirit, God, Buddha, 
              life, the universe.  What is difficult is most people talk endlessly 
              about it but this doesn't help, in fact in makes things worse for most 
              people because then they get caught on the concept of what you've talked
               about as if its another thing to gain or get or understand.</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">Yet all these words in bibles and books are all talking about one thing, and one thing only - <strong>the direct experiencing of awareness, of life</strong>.  There is nothing to understand in it, there is nothing to get - <strong>you just have to be aware consciously of experiencing life in <em>this </em>very moment</strong>.
               Now you can't describe what that experiencing is like but if you 
              directly experience it then you understand fully in that moment what 
              makes up everything, you understand what the mind is. I'll say it again,
               <strong>it is the </strong><em><strong>direct </strong></em><strong>experiencing of life in this moment.  That is all. </strong> Now
               don't think about that, take a second, look around the room or space 
              where you are now and experience everything going on right now.  That is
               what I mean by the direct experiencing of life.  There is nothing 
              complex about it.  All meditation and spiritual books are attempting to 
              do is to get you to directly experience this for yourself.  Right now. 
              Again, so look around the room.  Feel yourself breathing, see what is 
              being seen, hear what you are hearing now.  This is all that it is 
              about.  This direct experiencing of life.  So simple!</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">Its like talking all day about an apple.  <strong>A thousand words won't 
              allow you to get how an apple tastes.  You don't fully understand 
              "apple" until you put it in your mouth and take a bite, until you 
              directly experience it.  Life is the same.  Meditation is about taking a
               bite from life, "crunch" and then you taste "Ah, this is life". </strong> So
               look around again now, be aware, be conscious, feel yourself breathing,
               hear the sounds, seen what is being seen ... "Ah this is life".</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">So "who am I?"  This question is really asking you to dive head first 
              into the moment and just experience life fully as it is.  In that direct
               experiencing of the senses, the mind, the environment, what is being 
              heard, the sensations in your body ask yourself "who am I"?  You must 
              keep returning over and over again to the present moment with your 
              direct experience right now.  That is all, over and over.  "Who am I?" 
               Stop again for a second, feel yourself breathing, look around, feel, 
              hear.  Ah yes, this is me.  As you do this you begin to see bit by bit 
              the nature of who you are, of what mind is, of what everything is.<br> <br> In many traditions you'll see this idea being expressed.  In Buddhism 
              they ask "What is your true nature?" or "What is your true name?".  You 
              don't have to think about it.  Just stop again for a second, feel 
              yourself breathing, look around, notice the sensations in your body. 
               Yes, this is your true nature.  <strong>Christ said "I am the way, the 
              truth, and the life".  This is the same point.  Breath again for a 
              second, relax and be aware ... this is truth ... seeing, hearing right 
              now ... this is the life ... breathing, feeling, practising being 
              mindful ... this is the way. </strong> This direct experiencing in <em>this </em>moment is the way.  Who is God?  Return to the direct experiencing of life again, be aware, feel your breath ... <em>This</em> <em>is </em>God.  <em>This</em> is death.  <em>This</em> is the Tao.  <em>This</em> is eternity.  <em>This</em> is life. <em>This</em> is enlightenment.</div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">So Buddhist meditation helps you understand this.  No correction, 
              Buddhist meditation helps you experience this!  In the early stages of 
              meditation you begin to understand in a traditional sense who you are, 
              who you are as a person, what you like and don't like and you become 
              happier and you function better in life.  This is about understanding 
              your ego.  As you keep returning to the mindful moment eventually this 
              sense of "I" starts to feel empty, as if its not real.  It becomes 
              almost meaningless and things don't matter as much to you. While this is
               a challenging stage it is important because you start to see through 
              the illusion that "we" are something tangible something real and more 
              importantly you stop being pulled around by emotions, thoughts and the 
              challenges of life.  You start to really feel free and unbound.  Then as
               you continue to be mindful there is deeper insight into this 
              intangibility and the direct experiencing of emptiness, and with this 
              the direct experiencing of the emptiness in all things.  There is a 
              saying "See the emptiness of one thing deeply, and you'll see the 
              emptiness of all things".  The boundary between all things is suddenly 
              gone and all things are experienced as if they are one.  <strong>Therefore, there are no more things, no more separation, just </strong><em><strong>One, </strong></em><strong>just </strong><em><strong>This</strong></em><strong>.  And what is this One?  It is just the </strong><em><strong>direct </strong></em><strong>experiencing
               of life!  Pure consciousness, pure awareness.  Who, or more 
              importantly, what is the "I" in the moment of experiencing?  Again, stop
               now, look around, be aware, breath, see, hear and take a quiet moment.  </strong><em><strong>This </strong></em><strong>is your answer!  Its so simple.</strong></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="margin: 0px;">At times over the last 10 or so years I've had periods where I haven't 
              been as regular with my meditation practice as I'd like to be and I've 
              wondered why.  While I knew deep down during those lapses that I should,
               and deep down I knew all the reasons why I should, and deep down I 
              wanted to, something resisted.  I just couldn't put my finger on why 
              there was this mild resistance to dive fully into regular practice like I
               had at other times.  In the last week I've been waking in earnest at 
              5am every morning to meditate for 45 minutes before work.  I've been 
              contemplating this issue and its cause and what I've realised surprised 
              me for the simplicity of it and because I'd failed to acknowledge the 
              far-reaching enormity of the truth I'd seen through my meditations.  <strong>That is, I do not exist!  There is no "I" separate to the very moment being experienced now.  </strong>In
               this moment right now "Who am I?"  While the insight was clear and life
               changing, I'd been struggling to understand the place of "me" in 
              relation to the truth and wisdom revealed through it and this new life 
              view.  I was struggling to understand "Who am I?" and how did "I" fit 
              into this picture.  And in a lot of ways "I" wanted to still do what I 
              wanted to do and to be honest I still wanted to "be".  While the 
              experience clearly showed there was no me, I'd persisted with the idea 
              that "there was a me" that existed still separate from this insight. 
               The insight was clear but the wisdom had taken time to come full 
              circle.  That is, that "I" is a false notion. There is no "me" to 
              understand in relation to this insight because the insight has long 
              gone.  <strong>In this moment, seeing hearing and typing right now, where am 
              I?  Its like a cloud trying to understand and grasp the difference 
              between the air and the sky.  While you call them different names there 
              is no difference and you cannot separate them, in fact they are the same
               thing</strong>.  The cloud is air and sky and it doesn't attempt to call 
              itself these things.  This week as I returned to meditation practice 
              I've been returning to this moment, to this direct experiencing of life.
                While the insight from 10 years ago is just a distant thought now, as I
               sit here and type and be aware in this moment there is no "I".  So, who
               am I?<br> <br> Looking around, breathing, experiencing, being aware ... ah yes, this is Me!<br> <br> But this is not the "me" I use to know, this is not the "me" we 
              colloquially or conceptually know, this is not the small "me".  This is 
              the "no me", the big Me that <em>is </em>everything.  The "I" as I knew it
               before is just a drop in an ocean, why call itself any different?  With
               this view a profound peace pervades Me, why struggle or resist the 
              meditation practice?  How can I deny it at all?  This is like denying 
              truth, this is like denying the way <em>It </em>is.  <strong>I must meditated 
              because this is the way it is, this is truth, this is also is what I am,
               what I am made of, what My nature is.  </strong><em><strong>This is Me!</strong></em></div>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>Practice is on-going.  10 yrs ago the author already has all these realizations and 10 years later he is still refining these insights.  My personal view is that most practitioners will have to cycle through all these insights time and again until prajna wisdom pervades our entire being. </p>
              <p>It is not really appropriate for me to comment but I will just share with you my view as it also relates to your existing insights.  </p>
              <p>Although what he realized in his last para description is crucial, the problem of his inner resistance will continue.  He does not lack realization on his non-dual essence, he lacks realization of the quinessence of his Empty nature.  </p>
              <p>Experience will be seamlessly whole, vivid, certain, clear, pristine, non-dual and powerfully present but his mind will not be groundless, dispassionate and non-abiding. Being brillantly and Prestinely both in background and foreground is altogether different from being groundless and non-abiding.  One relates to the realization of our non-dual luminous essence and the other is the direct result of realizing our empty nature.  Practitioners will need to integrate both. </p>
              <p>His inner resistance is not because he did not realize the 'Big Me' as a result penetrating no-self, but rather a complete letting of both ME and me(for the nature of Presence is Empty).    </p>
              <p><a href="/users/268011">Amitayus48</a> made a very good comment.  'èˆ�å¾—' - èˆ�ä¸€åˆ‡å¾—.  The author IMO does not lack the ç�µæ˜Ž(non-dual luminosity), he lacks the æ¹›å¯‚.</p>
              <p>Try re-visiting the following 2 articles that I wrote to you, when your mind is too focused on the non-dual luminous essence, you may missed the finer points in the articles.</p>

              <p>Hi Ahimsaka, I wouldn't say it will 'delude the unenlightened mind'. The question 'Who am I' will lead to the realization of I AMness, the pure certainty of being. It is a glimpse of pure formless awareness. But this is not yet the Anatta realization. That is why there is a process. Not everyone will go through the I AM stage, though. Personally, I, Thusness, Simpo have been through that stage... including the blog poster above.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I am the author of this article and thanks for posting it and thanks for reading it and giving your comments. It is great to see you all taking an interest in my spiritual development. It has been great to read them.  Unfortunately due to the use of some non-English characters I can't understand some parts so it would be great if they could be clarified.  That would help me understand and develop in my practice.</p>
              <p>Thusness, I don't completely agree with your comment "It will not lead one to these experiences and realizations that includes anatta, emptiness nature and non-dual luminous essence."  While I wrote the article in this way it does not mean that there is not insight into this.  That said, it also doesn't also mean that there complete realisation into this either.  So your later comment  of "He does not lack realization on his non-dual essence, he lacks realization of the quinessence of his Empty nature." I don't feel is completely accurate either, I would just say this is an ongoing development.  :-)</p>
              <p>There was also the comment: </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; "><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc; " rel="nofollow" href="/users/268011">Amitayus48</a></span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; "> made a very good comment.  'èˆ�å¾—' - èˆ�ä¸€åˆ‡å¾—.  The author IMO does not lack the ç�µæ˜Ž(non-dual luminosity), he lacks the æ¹›å¯‚.</span></p>
              <p>Is someone able to translate this into english for me?</p>
              <p>Thusness, I'll try and get through and read some of your articles that you reference in these comments.  It looks like good reading.</p>
              <p>If I could add one thing in closing, the intention of the article and blog is not to talk about any level of attainment or to try to expound in every article how developed I am.  I think trying to read it and interpret this way is problematic. The purpose of the blog is to discuss meditation practice and aspects that may be beneficial to others as much as it is for my own contemplations. This article was written to discuss a contemplation for me at that time as well as having the reader in mind and what they may get out of it for their own development.  In this way I write it such that the topics are discussing aspects they can relate to in their practice and areas they can work towards. I don't intend to always talk about the highest tip of the mountain, but instead how to walk it and the things experienced along the way. I think in this light how it is read and interpreted will differ.</p>
              <p>Thanks again for posting and commenting everybody.</p>

              <p>Yes Dean,</p>

              <p>èˆ� means letting go<br>å¾— means attained</p>
              <p>There was a parable that Manjushri (Wen-shu Pu-sa), the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, manifested as a helper in the kitchen of a monastery with the dharma name 'èˆ�å¾—'.  <br>'èˆ�å¾—' carries the same message as "this too will pass" which is what you have shared in the articles <a href="/forums/1728/topics/414342">Quietening the Inner Chatter. </a></p>
              <p>Both <a href="/forums/1728/topics/414296">Who am I</a> and <a href="/forums/1728/topics/414342">Quietening the Inner Chatter</a> are two very insightful articles that complement each other well.  However when the "Who am I" is read alone, it lends the danger of falling into Vedanta Adviata Self view. </p>
              <p>In the conclusion paragraph of the “Who am I” article, you mentioned:</p>
              <p><br><strong>“I must meditated because this is the way it is, this is truth, this is also is what I am, what I am made of, what My nature is.  This is Me!”</strong></p>
              <p>Is the ‘inner resistance’ an over negation of ‘self’ (no-I) that we missed the truth of “This is Me” / “the big Me that is everything”</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>We have not penetrated deep enough the profundity of the message “this too will pass”.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the “inner resistance” is like a koan to all sincere practitioners.  It follows us throughout our entire spiritual journey.  So we do not have to answer too fast for practice is on-going</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>we will be re-visited.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for sharing. :)</p>

              <p>To dean:</p>
              <p>Welcome to the forum!</p>

              <p>To Pure Emptiness:</p>
              <p>I do not see this as 'advanced'... it is actually something fundamental in our everyday experience... it is our own nature shining in plain sight, but we overlooked it due to our constant attachments, concepts, self-grasping, etc.</p>
              <p>We just need to do some 'looking'...</p>
              <p>I understand certain concepts may seem very obscure especially to beginners. However, I choose not to label topics as 'advanced', simply because this will discourage new comers from dwelling into them. In other words, I do want newcomers to dwell, learn, and gain new insights from these topics.</p>
              <p>For example if a topic is discussing on emptiness... it may appear somewhat alien to people new to the forum. Yet, it is also something fundamental to Buddhism... I would be happy if that beginner is curious to read (even though it may be difficult to comprehend at first), and ask questions is necessary.</p>
              <p>That means... if the discussion seems not easy to comprehend, then the reader could at least ask something like 'What do you mean by Emptiness'... etc. And then the other more knowledgeable/experienced forummers can then provide an explanation and answer to that.</p>
              <p>In this way, we engage everyone not just 'advanced people' or 'beginners' or separate them up.</p>
              <p>Certain things, like Emptiness, Buddha-Nature, may seem obscure... yet it is essential to understand these things to gain liberation. Buddhism is not just about morality, doing good, getting good karma etc... if these were the only things to Buddhism, then actually there would be no need for Buddhism at all. All the other religions already cover these things... and in fact morality is not the monopoly of religions, religion cannot claim to be the authority of morality. Morality is something even non-religious people should know.</p>
              <p>So what is special about Buddhism? It is the profound insight into human nature, the nature of suffering and grasping, the cause of it, the cessation of it, the way out of it... (aka the four noble truths)... It is the profound insight into the luminous essence and empty nature of experience... It is these insights that liberate us from bondage. All Buddhists should therefore start contemplating on these things so that they can achieve what the Buddha set out to achieve - lead sentient beings to the end of suffering.</p>
