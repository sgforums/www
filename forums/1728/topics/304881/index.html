            <div class='col-md body'>If I had done many good deeds in present lifetime to merit a choice to be a Hell Judge or a Bodhisattva, what should I choose?<br><br>My present understanding about Hell Judges is that they were once humans and having accumulated some big good deeds, they were given the position of Hell Judges. The existence of Hell Judges is briefly mentioned in Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows sutra.<br><br>What are their job responsibilities? What are their goals or main intentions? Is it merely to punish those who are neither very good or very bad while they were alive and send off those who still has some good in them to be humans or animals which need not be slaughtered or tortured?<br><br>Yes, humans do suffer in many ways, and animals as well, but definitely better than being a hungry ghost or a hell prisoner, isn't it? After all, if you die of hunger, you are for that moment, free from suffering. But for punishments meted out for your soul after death, your punishment continues even when you 'die' after suffering the punishment. Your soul revives and returns to its original form for more suffering till your sins are fully repaid.<br><br>If, assuming that this is all or mainly what a Hell Judge has or need to do, I would rather choose to be one than to be a Bodhisattva; whereby it is mentioned in the scriptures that I have to offer my eyes, flesh and brain, to anyone who asks for it, without a single trace of hatred or reluctance prior, during and after my offering. I would also have to endure all kinds of humiliation from sentient beings; from mild slights to outright torture, yet at the same time harbour not even a single thought of hatred or regret during and after.<br><br>It is that hard to be a Bodhisattva, my friend. All such requirements are specifically mentioned by the Buddha himself in various sutras. That's why for those who really choose the Bodhisattva path and follow through it till they attain Buddhahood are the best models for all sentient beings to follow, to emulate, to be in great praise of.<br><br>Seriously I would rather choose to punish or send people off to suitable realms for rebirth than to bear the unimaginably heavy responsibilities of even wanting to try walking the Bodhisattva path.<br><br>And this is why partly most of Buddha's disciples attained sainthood or Arahanthood. But it is seldom mentioned what happens to those who have vowed to become Bodhisattvas in the present and future lifetimes. For having vowed in front of the Buddha doesn't mean you are free from rebirths after this present lifetime. Only an Arahant is.<br><br>So there, the above is my own personal view for now after reading and hearing many exhortations or appeals from Buddhist sutras, related books and audio-visual materials by Venerables to be brave and try walking the Bodhisattva path.<br><br>Remember the American TV show 'Heroes', you would have to do much more and much, much more better than that in order to be a Bodhisattva.<br><br>Seriously I don't even feel like caring for myself, much less for family or strangers. So I feel myself tearing into two personalities of good and evil; where for now the evil is very strong.<br><br>At times, I wish that I'm in the Bible setting, and then I would ask God: "Oh dear merciful God, strike me down with your lightning! I don't want to be tested by you nor tempted by the devil anymore. If you are indeed all merciful, all-loving, grant me this small but deeply sincere wish!"<br><br>But well, I'm a Buddhist now, so I can't really say that to anyone but myself. Even though this is a public forum where many people will read this, I know not many will take to my words. Because those who truly believe will still continue to believe. And also it could be I'm just a beginner who just doesn't know what Buddhism really is.<br><br>So just take it that I am having male periods, thereby hard not to sound cranky. But those parts about Bodhisattva are indeed true, and it is indeed very noble and compassionate to be able to help people in such a selfless way throughout countless lifetimes. I would praise such people deeply and continously if I get to meet them but I don't think I feel like walking their paths, at least for now.<br><br></div>

The thing is for now, I'm just doing good deeds for two main reasons which are not at all altruistic by the standards laid down in sutras or in the minds of most men.<br><br>I'm doing good deeds to avoid being reborn into evil realms and to hope for rebirths in good realms.

It is also absolutely correct that it is the wisdom and bodhicitta that counts. But I'm talking about a layman who has no single drop of spiritual achievement to merit rebirth in heaven nor as a rich man/woman who need not worry to working like a cow to put rice on the table.<br><br>Indeed only karma can decide where one goes. However the hell judge's main purpose is to judge and sentence those souls who are neither too burdened with evil deeds or supported by good deeds from present lifetimes, hence the need to also consider their deeds from previous lifetimes in totality to arrive at a final and fair sentence.<br><br>Who are those who need not go through the hell judge? It is mentioned that those who commit the five serious sins need not go through the hell judge right after one's last breath. They are: Killing parents, saints like Buddha, Arahants or saints like Confucius, create schism in the monastic order and slandering any Buddhist teaching taught by the Buddha. There are also other serious sins like stealing any property or belonging of the monastic order. These sins need not go through trials by Hell Judges.<br><br>These people are mentioned in Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Original Vows sutra to fall straight into Avici and Abyss hell after their last breath, where after uncountable eons, they are still reborn in evil realms.<br><br>However, it is to a very large part due to these groups of seriously sinful sentient beings that prompted Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to continuousy make new vows even after attaining the 2nd last stage of Bodhisattvahood, to save all of us who commit serious sins, especially in the Dharma Ending Age.<br><br>Please refer to the The sutra of the Original Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva for more details.<br><br></div>

Agree. But take one step at a time. From zero to hero is not an overnight thing that will happen magically. Even if it seems to happen overnight, it is through immense training of not only this lifetime but many lifetime of practises. The conditions were just right for Bodhicitta sprout. And also do note that an enemy do not appear out of no where just to rape, torture or kill the entire family/village for no good reasons.

If my sister were to be raped in front of me, whether she's a Buddhist or not, I would never say this truth to her in my entire life.

At least you have a vague idea of what that is. Yet due to our temporary defilements, we do not really know what is truly beneficial for others, nor do we really know how to engage in beneficial actions. For now, what we can do is really limited - though that shouldn't stop us from helping beings in our currently limited ways. That's why we should try to generate the motivation to become Buddhas ourselves - not just for our own sake, but really so that we will have the wisdom and skilful means to be truly able to benefit others.<br></div>

Making aspiration is a very important practice, especially for us whom Bodhicitta has yet been firmly established within us.<br><br>As you probably already know, Bodhicitta is usually divided into Relative and Absolute Bodhicitta. And Relative Bodhicitta is further sub-divided into Aspirational Bodhicitta and Engaging Bodhicitta.

The latter is mainly putting the altruistic intention into actual action.<br><br>Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa ever said that (not the exact words, based on my memory which is pretty faulty) for beings like us, it is really difficult to have Engaging Bodhicitta.

For now, we should just put in a lot of effort into the moving the horse (generating the intention) and not worry too much about the cart.<br><br>It is my personal belief that one should try to make great aspirations, whether or not we believe we're able to accomplish it at this point in time. Continually making aspirations don't hurt, don't cost, they're risk-free, yet they plant within our consciousness the very vital seeds of Bodhicitta, that will definitely flower one day. When there are ideals which we hope to attain, but seem too far/hard for us at this point in time, goals that we don't even dare to dream about - then we can even make aspirations that one day we will have the wisdom and courage to aspire for them. This was taught by Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche. He also taught that due to our ignorance we may not really know what is truly good for ourselves and others, so we can even aspire in this way: that whatever aspirations made by Samantabhadra, Manjushri, Avalokiteshvara (u can add on to the list according to your own inclinations), I wish to make aspirations like they do.<br><br>The reason why I'm typing all these, is because I hope you will not be discouraged by the seeming difficulty of the Bodhisattva path and give up on that. Sometimes I try to encourage myself by thinking that Shakyamuni Buddha must have had been through the processes that we're going through presently, and since he eventually became a Buddha, we definitely will become Buddhas in future. As Buddhists, we should have the confidence that we will become Buddhas eventually, even if it does not seem convincing at the moment. But if we don't believe that we will become enlightened one day, then what's the point of becoming a Buddhist? Hadn't the Buddha taught extensively that you and I possess Buddha Nature, by nature we are all Buddhas, only that now our Buddha Nature has been veiled by very thick but temporary layers of defilements.<br><br>I also remember a story of one of Shakyamuni Buddha's students - pardon me for not remembering the name of the student. There was this account that in his past life he wanted to practice the Bodhisattva path. So one of the heavenly gods decided to test him. The god took the form of an ordinary man and appeared before the Bodhisattva. This man cried and told the Bodhisattva, "My mother is very seriously ill and needs the eye of a practitioner. Would you please give me your eye to save her life?"<br><br>Now the Bodhisattva thought to himself, "I had vowed to practice the Bodhisattva path and should help other sentient beings. If I give one eye, I would still have one eye left." So the Bodhisattva agreed and gouged out one eye (I forgot which eye, let's say it's his left eye).<br><br>The man teared again, "Why did you take out your left eye? I need the right eye!"<br><br>The Bodhisattva thought, "Alas, I should have asked him before I gouged out my eye. Now even though I'll become blind, I should give him my other eye." So with that, the Bodhisattva gouged out his right eye and gave it to the man.<br><br>Then this man sniffed at the eye and remarked, "Eeks, this eye really stinks. How can it be from a practitioner?" With that, he threw the eyes onto the ground and walked away.<br><br>At this point, the Bodhisattva thought, "Sentient beings are so ignorant. The Bodhisattva path is really too difficult for me. I think I should just give up and pursue the path of individual liberation."<br><br>Then knowing that the Bodhisattva gave rise to the thought of giving up on the path, the god appeared and explained to him what really happened. The god then encouraged him never to give up on the Bodhisattva path.<br><br>The Bodhisattva regained his eyesight and re-established his motivation to continue on the Bodhisattva path.<br><br>A short anecdote - may not be entirely accurate cos I read this story many years ago. I like this story very much as I think it's very encouraging. Hope it inspires you to continue on the path. Jia you!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi spnw07, if you find it difficult to jump straight to such level like absolute bodhicitta or so on, you can always practice from foundation level.<br>I myself also practicing bodhisattva path, but also find that sometimes I get angry quite easily.<br>To generate compassion or bodhicitta, one method is to imagine yourself being the other party, feel their pain and suffering. Also, know that they were your parents in the past. This is not to hypnotize yourself, but it is true that all beings were really your parents in the past for not just once but many times. Constantly contemplate over this.<br>Actually I think that bodhicitta is one way to make us progress fast. Without it, our progress will slow down and tends to become lazy once our current problems are all resolved.</div>

I even made a vow to myself: Should I become a Bodhisattva in future, I shall be known as Ksitigarbha. I shall carry on what Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva has done and is doing even after he has attained Buddhahood. I want to offer my gratitude and respect for this super compassionate Bodhisattva who vowed to save all beings from 3 evil realms before becoming a Buddha himself, I would like him to quickly feel at ease that someone is willing to take on his vows, so that he can feel assured to quickly attain Buddhahood.<br><br>Dear wanderer, you have been patient, caring and encouraging in your two posts here.

The sad fact is only now that I know what had happened in the end, right after the gouging out of the eyes.<br><br>I only knew that Sariputra decided to turn to the Smaller Vehicle and stayed in that level for many eons, before he finally became Buddha Sakyamuni's disciple and later received his future attaining of Buddhahood prediction by the Buddha himself in the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>Because of this story and later after reading Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows sutra, I made a vow to myself, that should I become a Bodhisattva, the power of vows would be first to guide and help with uncountable skilful means, to help those starting on the path towards cultivation of good, to help those starting on the path towards Smaller Vehicle and those who started making their first vows to be Bodhisattvas.<br><br>Only when all these people and those in evil realms in all ten directions become Buddhas themselves, then only will I attain Buddhahood.<br><br>When all these people become Buddhas, I shall be their Bodhisattva disciple. I will continue to spread their teachings till their Dharma-Ending age, helping especially all sentient beings in Dharma Ending age to at least hear of the Dharma.<br><br>I vow that when I become a Bodhisattva, my manifestations are as many as the uncountable, unconceivable beings of the ten directions. Every sentient being will by the power of my vows, be able to have a wise and caring friend to guide and comfort them, till they finally attain Buddhahood, then only will I rest.<br><br>I know the above is big talk and very laughable, but it came from me cos I understood quite deeply how painful, how hard the route towards Buddhahood is...<br><br>Sorry for the big talk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div>

Also, know that they were your parents in the past. This is not to hypnotize yourself, but it is true that all beings were really your parents in the past for not just once but many times. Constantly contemplate over this.<br>Actually I think that bodhicitta is one way to make us progress fast. Without it, our progress will slow down and tends to become lazy once our current problems are all resolved.</div></blockquote>Hi, thanks for your advice and encouragement too. I really appreciate it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am trying to feel people's pain and suffering, but who cares about my suffering? I'm a human, I need love too...I'm not yet a first-stage saint or an Arahant, my need for love from fellow human beings is comparable to that of the need to eat and sleep...<br><br>I wonder how many Buddhists or Venerables realise that, before you attain the stage of no needs or non-attachment, basic human needs should be adequately met.<br><br>Even if any Buddhist or Venerable has attained non-attachment, hence indifferent to how they are treated by others, I hope they will exercise great compassion in their words and behaviour towards others who has not yet attained that level of cultivation.<br><br>We Buddhists talk about compassion, but we rarely see in practical forms  among fellow Buddhists when interacting with one another. It's my personal experience of course. I will probably get flamed for saying this, but what the heck, it's what happened to me man.<br><br>It's such a conflict inside me: I like Christianity for their warmth, showers of love and concern, fun and friendly, but yet I know I cannot join them because I totally don't agree with the idea of a Creator God and that which likes to test the faith of his creations.  For Buddhism, I took to it cos I agree deeply with Cause and Effect; as I can sort of infer and understand to some extent through the Law, as to why in this present life, I'm so lonely and forlorn, with no close friends at all to talk to and trust with about my feelings and thoughts. My parents will die one day, no matter how much I wish for them to stay, as they are the only ones I can trust with all my heart now. When they have died, I will be all alone, maybe one day die alone in my flat and my corpse will be discovered after it rots like hell...<br><br>Sometimes to comfort myself, I imagine myself attaining buddhahood under the bodhi tree or become a Bodhisattva like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, starting to help sentient beings already...<br><br>It helps to take away the pain and that's what I do when I can't sleep at night sometimes, thinking about all these...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I forget, I know that yakuzas (Japanese gansters or triad members) will cut off their last finger as atonement for their failure in completing tasks given to them.<br><br>If only they could learn Buddhism and start to cultivate aspiring bodhicitta, they could have been able to help lots of people till their last breath.<br><br>A person who can cut off any bodily part like flesh, bones, eyes, with no regret or hatred after that, has already got the potential to be an aspiring bodhisattva. At least this part resembles a bit of most of the trials that would be faced by an aspiring or engaging bodhisattva.<br><br>I speak of the same for self-radicalised terrorists too; if you could blow yourself up just like that without much hesitation, why not use your life, your bodily parts to help those who need you? But of course since they have no qualms about sacrificing themselves in such a tragic and destructive way to kill other innocent lives, I don't think such rationale will appeal to them in any way though...<br><br>If only such people could aspire to be Bodhisattvas...<br><br>If they could, imagine the speed at which these people can progress in their path towards Buddhahood!</div>
