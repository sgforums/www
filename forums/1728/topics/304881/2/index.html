              <p>According to my limited understanding, Hell Judges usually hold trials for those whereby the karma of their bad and good deeds did not manifest as quickly as others who are exceptionally good or bad upon death.</p>
              <p>There are many people who are neither very good nor very bad during their entire lifetimes, these people would usually need to go through trials presided by Hell Judges.</p>

              <p>Sariputra is the name of the disciple mentioned in your story, this was also pointed out by AEN. I have heard of it quite long ago. The sad fact is only now that I know what had happened in the end, right after the gouging out of the eyes.<br><br>I only knew that Sariputra decided to turn to the Smaller Vehicle and stayed in that level for many eons, before he finally became Buddha Sakyamuni's disciple and later received his future attaining of Buddhahood prediction by the Buddha himself in the Lotus Sutra.<br><br>Because of this story and later after reading Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Original Vows sutra, I made a vow to myself, that should I become a Bodhisattva, the power of vows would be first to guide and help with uncountable skilful means, to help those starting on the path towards cultivation of good, to help those starting on the path towards Smaller Vehicle and those who started making their first vows to be Bodhisattvas.<br><br>Only when all these people and those in evil realms in all ten directions become Buddhas themselves, then only will I attain Buddhahood.<br><br>When all these people become Buddhas, I shall be their Bodhisattva disciple. I will continue to spread their teachings till their Dharma-Ending age, helping especially all sentient beings in Dharma Ending age to at least hear of the Dharma.<br><br>I vow that when I become a Bodhisattva, my manifestations are as many as the uncountable, unconceivable beings of the ten directions. Every sentient being will by the power of my vows, be able to have a wise and caring friend to guide and comfort them, till they finally attain Buddhahood, then only will I rest.<br><br>I know the above is big talk and very laughable, but it came from me cos I understood quite deeply how painful, how hard the route towards Buddhahood is...<br><br>Sorry for the big talk <img title="Embarassed" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"> <img title="Embarassed" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"> <img title="Embarassed" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"></p>
