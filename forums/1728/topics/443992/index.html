              <div class="chapter">
              <p>Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii, in Jeta's Grove, in Anaathapindika's monastery.</p>
              <h4>Arittha's Wrong View</h4>
              <p><a id="section-02" name="section-02">2</a>. Now on that occasion a 
              monk called Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, had conceived this
               pernicious view: "There are things called 'obstructions'<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-1">[1]</a> by the Blessed One. As I understand his teaching, those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them."</p>
              <p><a id="section-03" name="section-03">3</a>. Several monks, hearing 
              about it, went to the monk Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, and
               asked him: "Is it true, friend Arittha, that you have conceived this 
              pernicious view: "There are things called (obstructions) by the Blessed 
              One. As I understand his teaching, those things are not necessarily 
              obstructive for one who pursues them'?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, indeed, friends, (I do hold that view)."</p>
              <p>Then those monks, wishing to dissuade Arittha from that pernicious 
              view, urged, admonished, questioned and exhorted him thus: "Do not say 
              so, friend Arittha, do not say so! Do not misrepresent the Blessed One! 
              It is not right to misrepresent him. Never would the Blessed One speak 
              like that. For in many ways, indeed, has the Blessed One said of those 
              obstructive things that they are obstructions, indeed, and that they 
              necessarily obstruct him who pursues them. Sense desires, so he has 
              said, bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment. The 
              perils in them are greater. Sense desires are like bare bones, has the 
              Blessed One said; they are like a lump of flesh, like a torch of straw, 
              like a pit of burning coals, like a dream, like borrowed goods, like a 
              fruit-bearing tree, like a slaughter house, like a stake of swords, like
               a snake's head, are sense desires, has the Blessed One said.<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-2">[2]</a> They bring little enjoyment, and much suffering and disappointment. The perils in them are greater."</p>
              <p>Yet, though the monk Arittha was thus urged, admonished, questioned 
              and exhorted by those monks, he still clung tenaciously and obstinately 
              to his pernicious view, saying: "There are things called 'obstructions' 
              by the Blessed One. As I understand his teaching, those things are not 
              necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them."</p>
              <p><a id="section-04" name="section-04">4</a>. When those monks could 
              not dissuade the monk Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, from his
               pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One, and after respectfully 
              saluting him, they sat down at one side. Being seated they told the 
              Blessed One (all that had happened), and they said: "Since, O Lord, we 
              could not dissuade the monk Arittha from his pernicious view, we have 
              now reported this matter to the Blessed One."</p>
              <p><a id="section-05" name="section-05">5</a>. Then the Blessed One 
              addressed a certain monk thus: "Go, O monk, and tell the monk Arittha, 
              formerly of the vulture killers, that the Master calls him." — "Yes, 
              Lord," replied the monk. He went to the monk Arittha and spoke to him: 
              "The Master calls you, friend Arittha." — "Yes, friend," replied Arittha
               and he went to meet the Blessed One. Having arrived, he saluted the 
              Blessed One respectfully and sat down at one side. When he was seated 
              the Blessed One addressed him thus:</p>
              <p>"Is it true, Arittha, that you have conceived this pernicious view: 
              'There are things called "obstructions" by the Blessed One. As I 
              understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for
               him who pursues them'?" — "Yes, indeed, Lord, I understand the teaching
               of the Blessed One in this way that those things called 'obstructions' 
              by the Blessed One, are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues 
              them."</p>
              <p><a id="section-06" name="section-06">6</a>. "Of whom do you know, 
              foolish man, that I have taught to him the teaching in that manner? Did I
               not, foolish man, speak in many ways of those obstructive things that 
              they are obstructions indeed, and that they necessarily obstruct him who
               pursues them? Sense desires, so I have said, bring little enjoyment, 
              and much suffering and disappointment. The perils in them are greater. 
              Sense desires are like bare bones, have I said; they are like a lump of 
              flesh... they are like a snake's head, have I said. They bring much 
              suffering and disappointment. The perils in them are greater. But you, O
               foolish man, have misrepresented us by what you personally have wrongly
               grasped. You have undermined your own (future) and have created much 
              demerit. This, foolish man, will bring you much harm and suffering for a
               long time."<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag" name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-3">[3]</a></p>
              <p><a id="section-07" name="section-07">7</a>. Then the Blessed One 
              addressed the monks thus: "What do you think, O monks: has that monk 
              Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, produced any spark (of 
              understanding) in this teaching and discipline?"<a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag" name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-4">[4]</a> — "How should that be, Lord? Certainly not, O Lord."</p>
              <p>After these words the monk Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, 
              sat silent, confused, with his shoulders drooping and his head bent, 
              brooding and incapable of making a rejoinder.</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One, knowing (his condition), spoke to him: "You 
              will be known, foolish man, by what is your own pernicious view, I shall
               now question the monks about this."</p>
              <p><a id="section-08" name="section-08">8</a>. Then the Blessed One 
              addressed the monks: "Do you, O monks, also understand the teaching 
              proclaimed by me, in the same manner as this monk Arittha does, who 
              misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped; who has 
              undermined his own (future) and created much demerit?"</p>
              <p>"Certainly not, Lord. For in many ways has the Blessed One told us of
               those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed, and that 
              they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them..."</p>
              <p>"Good, monks. It is good that you thus understand the teaching proclaimed by me.<a id="fnt-5" class="noteTag" name="fnt-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-5">[5]</a> For in many ways have I spoken of those obstructive things that they 
              are obstructions, indeed, and that they necessarily obstruct him who 
              pursues them. Sense desires, so have I said, bring little enjoyment, and
               much suffering and disappointment. The perils in them are greater. 
              Sense desires are like bare bones, have I said; they are like a lump of 
              flesh, like a torch of straw, like a pit of burning coals, like a dream,
               like borrowed goods, like a fruit-bearing tree, like a slaughter-house,
               like a stake of swords; like a snake's head are sense desires, have I 
              said. They bring much suffering and disappointment. The perils in them 
              are greater. But this monk Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, 
              misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped; he 
              undermines his own (future) and creates much demerit. This will bring to
               this foolish man much harm and suffering for a long time.</p>
              <p><a id="section-09" name="section-09">9</a>. "Monks, it is impossible indeed, that one can pursue sense gratification<a id="fnt-6" class="noteTag" name="fnt-6" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-6">[6]</a> without sensual desire,<a id="fnt-7" class="noteTag" name="fnt-7" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fn-7">[7]</a> without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire.</p>

To them these teachings wrongly grasped,
               will bring harm and suffering for a long time. And why? Because of 
              their wrong grasp of the teachings.</p>
              <p>"Suppose, monks, a man wants a snake, looks for a snake, goes in 
              search of a snake. He then sees a large snake, and when he is grasping 
              its body or its tail, the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or 
              arm or some other limb of his. And because of that he suffers death or 
              deadly pain. And why? Because of his wrong grasp of the snake.</p>
              <p>"Similarly, O monks, there are here some foolish men who study the 
              Teaching; having studied it, they do not wisely examine the purpose of

              <p>"Suppose, monks, a man wants a snake, looks for a snake, goes in 
              search of a snake. He then sees a large snake, and with a forked stick 
              he holds it firmly down. Having done so he catches it firmly by the 
              neck. Then although the snake might entwine with (the coils of) its body
               that man's hand or arm or some other limb of his, still he does not on 
              that account suffer death or deadly pain. And why not? Because of his

              <p>"Similarly, O monks, there are here some noble sons who study the

               should question me about it, or else (ask) those monks who are wise.</p>
              <h4>The Raft</h4>
              <p><a id="section-13" name="section-13">13</a>. "I shall show you, 
              monks, the Teaching's similitude to a raft: as having the purpose of 
              crossing over, not the purpose of being clung to. Listen, monks, and 
              heed well what I shall say" — "Yes, Lord," replied the monks. and the 
              Blessed One spoke thus:</p>
              <p>"Suppose, monks, there is a man journeying on a road and he sees a 
              vast expanse of water of which this shore is perilous and fearful, while
               the other shore is safe and free from danger. But there is no boat for 
              crossing nor is there a bridge for going over from this side to the 
              other. So the man thinks: 'This is a vast expanse of water; and this 
              shore is perilous and fearful, but the other shore is safe and free from
               danger. There is, however, no boat here for crossing, nor a bridge for 
              going over from this side to the other. Suppose I gather reeds, sticks, 
              branches and foliage, and bind them into a raft.' Now that man collects 
              reeds, sticks, branches and foliage, and binds them into a raft. Carried
               by that raft, laboring with hands and feet, he safely crosses over to 
              the other shore. Having crossed and arrived at the other shore, he 
              thinks: 'This raft, indeed, has been very helpful to me. Carried by it, 
              laboring with hands and feet, I got safely across to the other shore. 
              Should I not lift this raft on my head or put it on my shoulders, and go
               where I like?'</p>
              <p>"What do you think about it, O monks? Will this man by acting thus, 
              do what should be done with a raft?" — "No, Lord" — "How then, monks, 
              would he be doing what ought to be done with a raft? Here, monks, having
               got across and arrived at the other shore, the man thinks: 'This raft, 
              indeed, has been very helpful to me. Carried by it, and laboring with 
              hands and feet, I got safely across to the other shore. Should I not 
              pull it up now to the dry land or let it float in the water, and then go

              <p><strong>Things called "obstructions" </strong>(<em>antaraayikaa dhammaa</em>). 
              Comy gives here a list of ideas and actions that obstruct either 
              heavenly rebirth or final deliverance or both. Arittha, so says Comy 
              being a learned exponent of the Teaching, was quite familiar with most 
              of these "obstructions"; but, being unfamiliar with the Code of 
              Discipline (Vinaya), he conceived the view that sex indulgence was not 
              necessarily an obstruction for a monk. Arittha is said to have used a 
              rather sophistic argument, saying, "If some of the five sense enjoyments
               are permissible even for lay adherents who are stream-enterers (<em>sotaapanna</em>),
               etc., why is an exception made as to the visible shape, voice, touch, 
              etc., of women?" According to Comy, Arittha goes so far as to charge the
               Buddha with exaggerating the importance of the first grave offence (<em>paaraajikaa</em>)
               for a monk (i.e., sexual intercourse), saying that the emphasis given 
              to it is like the effort of one who tries to chain the ocean.</p>
              <p>The similes about sense-desires, given in the following section of 
              the discourse, seem to support the commentarial reference to sexual 
              intercourse.</p>
              </dd><dt><a id="fn-2" name="fn-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-2">2</a>.</dt><dd>
              <p><strong>The similes about sense-desires.</strong> Of the ten similes, the first seven were explained in detail in the Potaliya Sutta, (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.054x.than.html">MN 54</a>; see <em>The Wheel</em> No. 79). A summary of these explanations follows here; and after each 
              of these, and also for the remaining three similes, and expansion is 
              given of the one-word explanation found in the Comy to our present text:</p>
              <p>(1) <strong>Bare bones</strong>, fleshless, blood-smeared, are thrown to a 
              starving dog but cannot satisfy the animal's hunger. Similarly, 
              sense-desires give no lasting satisfaction (Comy: <em>appasaadatthena</em>).</p>
              <p>(2) <strong>A lump of flesh </strong>for which birds of prey fight each other;
               if the bird that has seized the lump of flesh, does not yield it, it 
              may meet death or deadly pain from the beaks and claws of the other 
              birds. Similarly, the sense-desires are common to many (<em>bahusaadhaarana</em>), i.e., the same sense objects may be claimed by many and may become the cause of deadly conflict.</p>
              <p>(3) <strong>A torch of straw </strong>carried against the wind may cause 
              severe burns to the careless man if not quickly discarded. Similarly, 
              sense-desires will severely burn (<em>anudahana</em>) i.e., greatly harm 
              him who thoughtlessly, and unaware of the great danger, partakes of them
               in the belief that they will bring light and joy to his life.</p>
              <p>(4) <strong>A pit of burning coals </strong>towards which a man is dragged by 
              others; if he cannot free himself from the grip, he will be thrown into 
              the fire and consumed by it. Similarly, sense-desires are like a vast 
              conflagration (<em>maha-bhitaapa</em>) into which the victim is dragged by bad company, or by his own deeds, causing his rebirth in miserable states of woe.</p>
              <p>(5) <strong>A dream </strong>of a beautiful landscape that vanishes on awakening. Similarly, sense-desires are a brief illusion (<em>ittara-paccupatthaana</em>) like a dream, and disappointing after one awakens from infatuation to reality.</p>
              <p>(6) <strong>Borrowed goods </strong>on which the borrower foolishly prides 
              himself in public; but which are withdrawn by the owners when they see 
              the boastful man. Similarly, sense-desires are temporary (<em>taavakaalika</em>) and not a true and lasting possession of him who enjoys them, filled with vain glory.</p>
              <p>(7) <strong>A fruit tree </strong>climbed by one who craves for the fruits; 
              but another man, likewise greedy for them but unable to climb, chooses 
              another method and fells the tree; and unless the first man quickly 
              descends, he will break his limbs. Similarly, in the blind pursuit of 
              sense pleasures one may "break all one's limbs" (<em>sabbanga paccanga bhañjana</em>),
               may suffer severe injury of body and mind. The Sub-Comy refers also to 
              punishment and torture incurred by reckless deeds to which people are 
              driven by sense infatuation.</p>
              <p>(8) <strong>A slaughter house </strong>(or place of execution): because sense-desires are like a butcher's (or executioner's) block (<em>adhikuttana</em>). This may mean that sense-desires kill much that is noble in man and cut off his higher development.</p>
              <p>(9) <strong>A stake of swords</strong>: sense-desires are piercing (<em>vinivijjhana</em>)
               penetrating deep within, causing wounds where there had been none. 
              Unfulfilled or frustrated desire, or the pains of jealousy, are, indeed,
               like that ancient torture of the state of swords.</p>
              <p>(10) <strong>A snake's head</strong>: sense-desires are a grave risk and peril (<em>sasanka-sappatibhaya</em>) for the present and future welfare, if one walks unwarily.</p>

              Pitaka. In the Cuula Vagga (Kammakkhanda) it is followed by announcing 
              the Sangha act of suspension (<em>ukkhepaniya-kamma</em>) against Arittha 
              as he did not give up his wrong views. In the Paacittiya section of the 
              Vinaya, Arittha's refusal to renounce his wrong view is defined as the 
              monastic offence called "<em>paacittiya</em>."</dd><dt><a id="fn-4" name="fn-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-4">4</a>.</dt><dd>...<strong>produced any spark (of understanding) in this teaching and discipline</strong> (<em>usmiikato pi imasmi.m dhammavinaye</em>).
               This is a stock phrase in similar contexts — e.g., in MN 38, where 
              Saati's misconceptions are rejected. Our rendering follows Comy: "This 
              refers to one who has (not) produced the 'warmth of understanding' (<em>ñaan'usmaa</em>) that can bring the 'seed of wisdom' (<em>paññaa-biijaa</em>; Sub-Comy) to the maturity required for attaining to the paths and fruitions of sanctity."</dd><dt><a id="fn-5" name="fn-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-5">5</a>.</dt><dd>Comy says that by questioning the other monks the Master wanted to 
              clarify the opinion held by the community of monks; and, on the other 
              hand, leave no doubt in Arittha that through obstinately clinging to his

Comy adds: <em>methunasamaacaara.m samaacarissati</em>,
               "It is impossible that he can commit the sexual act (without 
              perceptions and thoughts of sense-desire)." Sub-Comy says that also 
              other physical acts expressive of sexual desire, are to be included, as 
              embracing, stroking, etc.</dd><dt><a id="fn-7" name="fn-7" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-7">7</a>.</dt><dd><em>Aññatra kaamehi</em>: this refers to <em>kilesa-kaama</em>, "sensuality as a defilement of mind," i.e., sense desire, the subjective aspect of <em>kaama</em>.</dd><dt><a id="fn-8" name="fn-8" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-8">8</a>.</dt><dd>Comy: After the Master had pointed out Arittha's wrong views, he 
              continues now by showing the grievous fault that lies in a wrong grasp 
              of what has been learned (i.e., the serious danger inherent in 
              misconceiving and misinterpreting the Teaching).</dd><dt><a id="fn-9" name="fn-9" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-9">9</a>.</dt><dd>The text inserts here the ninefold division of the codified 
              teaching: "Discourses, mixed prose and verse, prose expositions, verses,
               solemn utterances, sayings, birth stories, marvels, and replies to 
              questions." Since this enumeration interrupts the flow of the sentence, 
              it has been shifted from the text to the Notes.</dd><dt><a id="fn-10" name="fn-10" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-10">10</a>.</dt><dd>
              <p><em>Dhammaa na ni jjhaanam khamanti</em>. Comy: The teachings do not 
              become clear, do not come into the range (of understanding); so that one
               cannot discern whether in the respective place of the exposition, 
              morality is spoken of, or concentration, insight, the paths, the fruits,
               the round of existence or its ending. Sub-Comy: "That is, once cannot 
              understand that the purpose of morality is the attaining of 
              concentration, the purpose of concentration the winning of insight, 
              etc."</p>
              <p><em>Nijjhaana</em> has here the meaning of "insight" or "comprehension" (Sub-Comy: <em>nijjhaana-pañña-kkhamaa na honti</em>). This phrase appears with the same meaning and in the same context, in the Kiitaagiri Sutta (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.070.than.html">MN 70</a>) and the Cankii Sutta (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html">MN 95</a>), that is, likewise preceded by an "examination of purpose (or meaning)." Also <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn25/sn25.001.than.html">SN 25.1</a> confirms our rendering: <em>Yassa khobhikkhave imedhammaa evam paññaaya mattaso nijjhaana.m khamanti aya.m vuccati dhammaanusaarii.</em></p>

              <p><strong>The three ways of studying the teaching.</strong> Comy: "They, the 
              noble sons, study the Teaching for the sake of crossing (the ocean of 
              sa.msaric suffering). There are to wit, three manners of studying the 
              Teaching: studying it in the manner of the Snake-simile (<em>alagadda-pariyatti</em>); studying it for the sake of crossing over (<em>nittharana-pariyatti</em>); and studying in a treasurer's (or store-keeper's) position (<em>bhandaa-gaarika-pariyatti</em>).</p>
              <p>(1) He who studies the Buddha's word for getting robes and other 
              requisites, or for becoming widely known; that is, he who learns for the
               sake of fame and gain, his study is that of the Snake-simile (i.e., the
               wrong grasp); but better than such a study would be for him to sleep 
              and not to study at all.</p>
              <p>(2) But there is one who studies the Buddha's word, and when 
              morality is the subject, he fulfills morality; when concentration is the
               subject, he lets it take deep root; when insight is the subject, he 
              establishes himself well in insight; when the paths and fruitions are 
              the subject, he studies with the intention, "I shall develop the path, I
               shall realize the fruition." Only the studying of such a one is 
              "studying for the sake of crossing over" (as expressed in the simile of 
              the raft; §13).</p>
              <p>(3) But the studying by one who (as an arahant, a saint) has extinguished the taints (<em>khiinaasavo</em>),
               is "studying in the Treasurer's position." For him, indeed, there 
              remains nothing unpenetrated, nothing unrelinquished, nothing 
              undeveloped, and nothing unrealized. [This refers to the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 
              and 3rd Truths, respectively.] He is one who has penetrated the 
              aggregates of existence (<em>khandha</em>), who has relinquished the 
              defilements, developed the path and realized the fruition. Hence, in 
              studying the Buddha's Word, he studies it as a keeper of the scriptures,
               as a guardian of the tradition, as a preserver of the continuity. Thus 
              his study is like (the activity of) a treasurer (or store keeper).</p>
              <p>"Now, when those proficient in the books cannot live at one place, 
              being afraid of starvation, etc., if (in such a situation) there is one 
              who, while himself going the alms round with very great fatigue, as an 
              unliberated worlding takes up studies with the thought: 'Lest the 
              exceedingly sweet Buddha-word may perish, I shall keep the scriptures 
              (in mind), shall preserve the continuity and guard the tradition,' in 
              that case, is his study of the Treasurer's type or is it not? — It is 
              not. And why not? Because his study is not applied to his own situation (<em>na attano thaane thatvaa pariyaapunattaa</em>;

              study [be he a monk or a lay follower] will either be of the type of the
               Snake-simile, or for the sake of crossing over; while for the seven 
              (noble persons; <em>ariya-puggala</em>) who have entered the higher training (<em>sekha</em>), the study is only for the sake of crossing over; for the saint (<em>arahat</em>) it is only of the Treasurer's type."</p>

The Blessed One, indeed, enjoins us to abandon desire and attachment (<em>chanda-raaga</em>)
               concerning tranquility and insight. Where, then, has he enjoined the 
              abandonment of desire and attachment in the case of tranquility? He did 
              so in the following saying: "Thus, Udaayi, do I teach the abandoning 
              even of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Do you see 
              Udaayi, any fetter fine or coarse, that I did not tell you to discard?" (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.066.than.html">MN 66</a>).
               And in the case of insight, the abandoning was enjoined by him as 
              follows: "And to that view thus purified and cleansed, you should not be
               attached, should not be enamored of it, should not treasure it." But 
              here, in this present text, he enjoined the abandoning of desire and 
              attachment concerning both (tranquility and insight), by saying: "You 
              should let go even (good) teachings, how much more false ones!" The 
              meaning is this: "I teach, O monks, the abandoning of desire and 
              attachment even for such peaceful and sublime states (as tranquility and
               insight); how much more so in regard to that ignoble, low, 
              contemptible, coarse and impure thing in which this foolish Arittha does
               not see any harm, saying that desire and attachment for the five 
              sense-objects is not necessarily an obstruction! But you, O monks, 
              unlike that Arittha, should not fling mud and refuse into my 
              dispensation!" In this way, the Blessed One again rebuked Arittha by 
              this admonition.</dd><dt><a id="fn-15" name="fn-15" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-15">15</a>.</dt><dd>
              <p><strong>Grounds for false views</strong> (<em>ditthi-tthaana</em>). Comy: By the
               words "There are, monks, these six grounds for false views," the Master
               wishes to show this: "He who takes the five aggregates of existence as 
              'I' and 'Mine', by way of a threefold wrong grasp (<em>tividha-gaaha</em>), he flings mud and refuse into my dispensation, like this Arittha."</p>
              <p>Comy and Sub-Comy: False views themselves are "grounds" (or bases, 
              starting-points) for subsequently arising false views, like personality 
              belief, eternalism, etc. (Comy: <em>ditthiipi ditthi-tthaana.m</em>). Further, the "grounds" are the subject-matter (<em>aarammana,</em> "object") of the views, i.e., the five aggregates, the visual objects, etc. Finally, they are also the conditioning factors (<em>paccaya</em>) of the false views, e.g., ignorance, sense-impression (<em>phassa</em>), (faulty) perceptions and thoughts, unwisely directed attention (<em>ayoniso manasikaara</em>),
               bad company, others' speech, etc. [These, with the aggregates as the 
              first, are the eight "grounds for false views," as mentioned in the 
              Patisambhidaa Magga (Ditthi-kathaa). The term <em>ditthi-tthaana </em>also occurs in the Brahmajaala Sutta (DN 1) and in the commentary to it.</p>

"This I am": this is wrong grasp induced by conceit (<em>maana-gaaha</em>). "This is my self": this is wrong grasp induced by false views (<em>ditthi-gaaha</em>).
               Here, reference is to craving, conceit, and false views which have 
              corporeality as object; but corporeality cannot be said to be a self. 
              The same holds true for feeling, perception and mental formations.</dd><dt><a id="fn-17" name="fn-17" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-17">17</a>.</dt><dd>"<strong>What is seen</strong>": (Comy) the visual sense-object base (<em>ruupaayatana</em>); <strong>"heard": </strong>the sound-base; "<strong>sensed</strong>" (<em>muta.m</em>): the sense-object bases of smell, taste, and touch-sensations; "<strong>what is thought</strong>": the remaining seven bases, i.e., the mind-object base (<em>dhammaayatana)</em> and the six sense-organ bases.</dd><dt><a id="fn-18" name="fn-18" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html#fnt-18">18</a>.</dt><dd>

              <p>"<strong>The universe is the Self</strong>," lit.: "This (is) the world, this (is) the self" (<em>so loko so attaa</em>).
               That, in fact, an identification of the two terms is intended here, 
              will be shown in the following comments. The best explanation of the 
              passage is furnished in the Brahmajaala Sutta (DN 1) where a similar 
              phraseology is used: "There are, monks, some ascetics and brahmans who 
              are eternalists and who proclaim self and world to be eternal" <em>(sassatavaadaa sassata.m attañca lokañca paññapenti</em>);
               subsequently the theorist is introduced as stating his view in similar 
              terms: "Eternal are self and world... they exist as eternally the same" (<em>sassato attaa ca loko ca... atthi iveva sassatisama.m</em>).
               The last term appears likewise in our text; see Note 21. From this we 
              may safely conclude that it is the identity, or unity, of the Self (or 
              soul; <em>mahaatman, paramaatman</em>) with the universe (or the Universal Spirit, Brahman) which is conveyed by our text.</p>
              <p>In the Commentary specific to our text, this eternalistic view is 
              rendered and classified in the terminology of the Dhamma. The Commentary
               says:</p>
              <p>"This statement ('The universe is the Self') refers to the (wrong) view 'He considers corporeality, etc., as the self (<em>ruupa.m attato samanupassatii' ti aadinaa nayena</em>).'"</p>
              <p>The canonical quotation (e.g., in MN 44), included here in the 
              Commentary, has two implications which are of importance for 
              understanding the reason why it was cited in this context:</p>
              <p>(1) As very often in the commentaries (e.g., to Satipatthaana Sutta), the term "world" (<em>loko</em>) is explained as truly referring to the five aggregates (<em>khanda</em>, i.e., corporeality, feeling, etc.), singly or <em>in toto</em>.</p>
              <p>(2) This quotation is the formula for the first of the twenty types of personality-belief (<em>sakkaaya-ditthi</em>; e.g., in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html">MN 44</a>).
               In the first five of these twenty, the self is said to be identical 
              with each of the five aggregates (as in the earlier part of §15 of our 
              text). Hence the application of this quote to our textual passage 
              signifies that the theorist conceives the "world" (i.e., corporeality, 
              feeling, etc.) as <em>identical </em>with the self.</p>
              <p>The double "<em>So (loko) so (attaa)</em>" in our text, should therefore, be taken as standing for "<em>yo (loko) so (attaa)</em>," lit.: what is the world that is the self. In the Comy to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html">MN 44</a> we find a similar phrase: "Someone considers corporeality as self: what
               is corporeality that is 'I'; what is 'I' that is corporeality. Thus he 
              considers corporeality and self as non-dual' (... <em>ya.m ruupa.m so aha.m, yo aha.m ta.m ruupan' ti ruupañca advaya.m samanupassati</em>)." According to this interpretation the phrase has been translated here by "This universe is the Self."</p>
              <p>Mostly, the first five types of personality-belief are explained as referring to the wrong view of annihilationism (<em>uccheda-ditthi</em>). [See, e.g., Patisambhidaa-Magga, Ditthikathaa, Ucchedaditthi-niddesa; further Comy to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html">MN 44</a>.]</p>
              <p>But their being quoted in our context, shows that they may also apply to eternalism (<em>sassata-ditthi</em>).
               We have come to this conclusion since it is improbable that, in our 
              textual passage two mutually exclusive views should have been combined 
              in a single statement formulating the sixth "ground for false views"; 
              that is, in the first part of that statement, annihilationism, and in 
              the second, eternalism.</p>

              <p>"<strong>Eternally the same</strong>" (<em>sassati-sama.m</em>): an Upanishadic term; see Brhadaranyaka-Upanisad, 5, 10: <em>saasvatiih samaah</em>.</p>
              <p>This entire statement of the sixth 'ground for views' may well have 
              been the original creed of an eternalistic doctrine. The phrasing 
              appears rather vague in the first part, and in general it is rather 
              loosely worded (<em>so</em> for <em>so aham</em>). To contemporaries, 
              however, the meaning may have been quite clear since it was perhaps the 
              stock formula for teachings that were well known. Hence, in this 
              translation, we have left the first part of the statement in its rather 
              cryptic and ambiguous original form, while giving the interpretations in
               the notes only.</p>

               maintained) and by conceit (deeply ingrained ego-centricity). Here one

              <p>"<strong>He is not anxious about unrealities</strong>" <em>(asati na paritassati)</em>; or "about the non-existing" ("I" and "Mine"). The verb <em>paritassati </em>has, according to Comy the twofold connotation of fear (<em>bhaya</em>) and craving (<em>tanhaa</em>).
               Hence this passage may also be rendered: "he has no fears nor cravings 
              concerning the non-existent." Comy and Sub-Comy to the Brahmaajala Sutta
               have a long disquisition about the corresponding noun <em>paritassana</em>, occurring also in <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.138.than.html">MN 138</a>, SN 22.7, SN 22.8, <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.053.than.html">SN 22.53</a>, and <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.055.than.html">SN 22.55</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Attavaadupaadaanam upadiyetha</em>. While in most translations the term <em>upaadaana</em> has been rendered by "clinging," we have followed here a suggestion of 
              the late Bhikkhu Ñanamoli, rendering it by "assumption" [see <em>The Wheel</em> No. 17: <em>Three Cardinal Discourses of the Buddha, </em>p.
               19 (Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy)]. In this context, the word 
              "assumption" should be understood: (1) in the sense of a supposition, 
              (2) in the literal sense of its Latin source: <em>adsumere</em>, "to take up," which closely parallels the derivation of our Paali term: <em>upa-aadaana</em>, "taking up strongly." In this sense we have used it when translating the derivative verb <em>upaadiyetha </em>by "you may accept." <em>Attavaadupaadaana </em>is one of the four types of clinging (see Nyanatiloka's <em>Buddhist Dictionary</em>), conditioned by craving (<em>tanhaa</em>). This term comprises, according to Comy, the twenty types of personality-belief </p></dd></dl></div></div>
