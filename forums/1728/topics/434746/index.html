              Namdrol:
              
              In terms of the origin and evolution of Buddhist texts? No. NÄ�gÄ�rjuna did not recover the PrajÃ±Ä�paramita SÅ«tras from sea monsters off of the coast of Andra Pradesh, as romantic as that might sound. Likewise, Buddha did not teach Abhidhamma pitika in one session to the gods in the thirty three heavens, as romantic as that sounds. 
              
              One of the nice things about Buddhist texts, especially MahÄ�yÄ�na texts is that one can study their evolution. Why? Becauase they were translated into different languages over the period of a thousand years. How is the possible? For two reasons -- we have the Chinese canon and the Tibetan canon. 
              
              Buddhist sutras in the Chinese canon clearly show textual development over the many recensions of their translations. The Tibetan forms of these sutras are always in more mature forms than the earlier Chinese translations. And interestingly enough, the surviving Sanskrit copies of many sutras and tantras too show evidence of textual development subsequent to their translations into Tibetan. We can see this type of development even between translations from the Imperial period and the so called "later translation period" which begins with Rinchen Zangpo in the late tenth century. 
              
              Another thing we notice with Bon texts is that their orthography is solely post Ralpachen i.e. post 840 or so. In other words, we do not find the kinds of archaic spellings in Bon canonical texts in general (such as the Zer mig, etc) that one would expect to find in ancient, pre-Buddhist texts.
              
              So you can speculate all you like about Ancient Buddhas in mythical kingdoms writing down all the Buddhist sutras in independent form and depositing them in Tibet in the some prehistorical period. But the simple fact of the matter is that texts are plastic culture, they are susceptible to evolution and emendation, and in the case of Buddhist texts, these emendations are trackable to a very large degree until the Chinese and Tibetans stopped translating Indic texts. Of course, even in Tibetan Buddhist treasure literature one can find clear evolution and consolidation of language and terminology and very little in the way of truly archaic spellings, etc., spellings we have actual evidence of from texts which clearly date to that time period. 
              
              I think you ought to make yourself more useful, and go get a PhD in Tibetan studies somewhere, like Oslo - with Per Kvarne, who has a Bon studies program, university level. Then you can be really, truly insufferable as only academics can be. 
              
              Otherwise, you should study Tibetan Medicine, since you stated you wanted to be a healer. There are a bunch of Bon doctors in Nepal. Go study with them.

              <p>It is good to recite sutras as it plants good seeds and results in merits. But always keep in mind:</p>
              <p>(Ch'an Patriarch Bodhidharma)</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/THE%20ZEN%20TEACHINGS%20OF%20BODHIDHARMA.htm">http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/C%20-%20Zen/Ancestors/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/The%20Zen%20Teachings%20of%20Bodhidharma/THE%20ZEN%20TEACHINGS%20OF%20BODHIDHARMA.htm</a></p>
              <p><br> Buddhas of the past and future only talk about this mind. The mind is 
                  the Buddha, and the Buddha is the mind. Beyond the mind there’s no 
                  Buddha and beyond the Buddha there’s no mind. If you think there is a 
                  Buddha beyond the mind’, where is he? There’s no Buddha beyond the mind,
                   so why envision one? You can’t know your real mind as long as you 
                  deceive yourself. As long as you’re enthralled by a lifeless form, 
                  you’re not free. If you don’t believe me, deceiving yourself won’t help.
                   It’s not the Buddha’s fault. People, though, are deluded. They’re 
                  unaware that their own mind is the Buddha. Otherwise they wouldn’t look 
                  for a Buddha outside the mind.<br> <br> Buddhas don’t save Buddhas. If you use your mind to look for a Buddha, 
                  you won’t see the Buddha. As long as you look for a Buddha somewhere 
                  else, you’ll never see that your own mind is the Buddha. Don’t use a 
                  Buddha to worship a Buddha. And don’t use the mind to invoke a Buddha." 
                  Buddhas don’t recite sutras." Buddhas don’t keep precepts." And Buddhas 
                  don’t break precepts. Buddhas don’t keep or break anything. Buddhas 
                  don’t do good or evil.<br> <strong><br> To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his nature 
                  is a Buddha. If you don’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting 
                  sutras, making offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking
                   Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts 
                  results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future 
                  blessings-but no buddha. If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll 
                  have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death. But 
                  unless he sees his nature, such a person isn’t a teacher. Even if he can 
                  recite the Twelvefold Canon he can’t escape the Wheel of Birth and 
                  Death. He suffers in the three realms without hope of release. Long ago,
                   the monk Good Star was able to recite the entire Canon. But he 
                  didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If this was 
                  the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or
                   shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind,
                   reciting so much prose is useless.<br></strong> <br> To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is 
                  the Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free: free of plans, free
                   of cares. If you don’t see your nature and run around all day looking 
                  somewhere else, you’ll never find a buddha. The truth is there’s nothing
                   to find. But to reach such an understanding you need a teacher and you 
                  need to struggle to make yourself understand. Life and death are 
                  important. Don’t suffer them in vain.<br> <br> There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have mountains 
                  of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the 
                  Ganges, you see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your 
                  eyes are shut? You should realize then that everything you see is like a
                   dream or illusion.<br> <br> If you don’t find a teacher soon, you’ll live this life in vain. It’s 
                  true, you have the buddha-nature. But the help of a teacher you’ll never
                   know it. Only one person in a million becomes enlightened without a 
                  teacher’s help. If, though, by the conjunction of conditions, someone 
                  understands what the Buddha meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. 
                  Such a person has a natural awareness superior to anything taught. But 
                  unless you’re so blessed, study hard, and by means of instruction you’ll
                   understand.</p>

All this could be clearly seen by everyone. And the voices of all the Buddhas of the ten directions could be heard proclaiming their teachings of the Dharma in all the worlds, the sounds reverberating in the space beneath the great precious canopy.</p>

              <p>Yes. But don't only see the ungraspable aspect.... the luminous aspect of mind is equally important.</p>
              <p>The Aá¹£á¹­asÄ�hasrikÄ� PrajñÄ�pÄ�ramitÄ� SÅ«tra states: Thus, there is no mind in the mind, but the nature of the mind is luminous-clarity (prabhÄ�svarÄ�)</p>
              <p>The JñÄ�nÄ�lokÄ�laá¹ƒkÄ�ra SÅ«tra states: MañjuÅ›rÄ«, enlightenment by its 
              nature consists of luminous-clarity, because the mind's nature is 
              luminously clear. Why is it so designated? The mind's nature is detached
               from any inner defilement and is like the nature of space, while 
              encompassing space through its identical characteristics. For all these 
              reasons it is designated as being luminous-clarity.</p>

              <p>You see, those thoughts are doubtful imaginations of your mind. It is simply a bunch of concepts! It is not reality.</p>
              <p>Reality is not a bunch of concepts you imagine... those names you give, they are simply fabricated concepts.</p>
              <p>What you are, the nature of mind, must be already here before thoughts. That is why no thought is necessary to find out.</p>

              <p>You see, before you are conceptualizing male and female, good or bad, this or that, you are already brightly aware and present, isn't it?</p>
              <p>What is this? Don't think... you need to look in your direct experience.</p>
              <p>Actually self-inquiry requires patience (but at some point it is no longer a thing of perserverance, you cannot stop inquiring at that point because a great mass of doubt has grew and taken hold of you, and this is an important condition for realization)... it took me almost two years. For some it might be faster. But it is certainly a direct path to realization.</p>
