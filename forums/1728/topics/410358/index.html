              <p>When we look more closely at what it is that we call ‘I’, we can see 
              that it includes several elements, not just the parts that make up our 
              physical bodies, but also our various senses and our minds.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, when we want to examine the <a class="new" title="Self (page does not exist)" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Self&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">self</a> more precisely, we can make use of the five categories, which we call the ‘five skandhas’.</p>
              <p>In actual fact, all conditioned phenomena may be included within 
              these five groups, but when we are investigating the self, we limit 
              ourselves to the form of our bodies, and our own thoughts and so on.</p>
              <p><a id="Form.2FMatter" name="Form.2FMatter"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Form/Matter</span></h2>
              <p>In its broadest sense, form is spoken of in terms of causal and 
              resultant forms. Causal forms are the elements of earth, water, fire and
               wind, and then the resultant forms – which are made from these elements
               – are said to include the five sense faculties and their objects, as 
              well as a slightly more problematic category called ‘imperceptible 
              forms’, which we do not need to go into here.</p>
              <p>The <a class="new" title="Sense faculties (page does not exist)" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Sense_faculties&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">sense faculties</a> are not the ordinary sense organs—our eyes and ears and so on—but 
              subtle forms within the sense organs. They have particular shapes which 
              are described very precisely in the <a title="Abhidharma" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Abhidharma">Abhidharma</a> literature.</p>
              <p>The first of the sense objects is <strong>visual form</strong>, which means
               the various colours and shapes that appear to our eyes. Broadly 
              speaking, colours may be divided into the primary colours—which 
              according to the Abhidharma are white, red, yellow and blue—and the 
              secondary colours. They may be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.</p>
              <p><strong>Sounds</strong>, the objects of the ears, may occur naturally or be
               man-made, or they may be a combination of the two, such as when a 
              person beats a drum. A lot of sounds are just meaningless noise, but 
              some impart meaning. In the case of the latter, they might be a vehicle 
              for ordinary notions, or else the sublime, liberating message of the 
              Dharma. As with sights, sounds can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.</p>
              <p><strong>Smells</strong> or odours can be natural or artificial, and once again, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.</p>
              <p><strong>Tastes</strong> are said to be of six kinds, roughly translated as sweet, sour, bitter, hot, astringent and pungent.</p>
              <p><strong>Textures</strong>, or tactile sensations, may be felt on the body’s
               surface or in its interior. Interior ‘textures’ include hunger and 
              thirst, and the feelings that come with being ill or deeply relaxed.</p>
              <p>In this investigation, form means our physical bodies. More 
              generally, it is all that we can see, hear, smell, taste and touch, and 
              also the subtle faculties that do the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting
               and touching.</p>
              <p><a id="Feelings.2FSensations" name="Feelings.2FSensations"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Feelings/Sensations</span></h2>
              <p>Although this is called the skandha of feelings, it does not mean 
              emotional feelings, but something more like sensations. These are said 
              to be the painful, pleasant and neutral sensations in the body and the 
              pleasant or unpleasant sensations in the mind. (It is said that neutral 
              sensations of the mind are not counted separately, because they are 
              indistinguishable from the neutral sensations of the body.)</p>
              <p>We are always experiencing sensations, mostly neutral ones, but also painful and pleasant.</p>
              <p>They can also be thought of as the sensations that occur based on
               sense impressions. A sense object such as incense would belong under 
              the skandha of form, but the sensation created when we smell it belongs 
              in this category. In this case, it would most likely be a pleasant 
              sensation.</p>
              <p>According to the teachings, feelings are important because they 
              are the basis for attachment and aversion, which lie at the heart of 
              many of the conflicts between lay people, who have not renounced mundane
               concerns.</p>
              <p><a id="Perceptions" name="Perceptions"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Perceptions</span></h2>
              <p>Perception means the apprehension of a specific object, as circumscribed and distinct from something else.</p>
              <p>On the conceptual level, this means the recognition of identities
               or names, and on the sensory level it means the discernment of the five
               objects of sense.</p>
              <p>Technically, perception is defined as ‘that which grasps or 
              identifies characteristics’. Perception could be non-conceptual, in the 
              case of the five physical senses, or conceptual, as in the perception of
               thoughts and ideas.</p>
              <p>In all these cases, perception can either be ‘discerning’ or 
              ‘non-discerning’. The five non-conceptual sense perceptions are regarded
               as discerning when they are operating normally and perceiving their 
              proper objects: colours/shapes, sounds, smells, tastes and textures. 
              Mental perception is said to be discerning when it distinguishes 
              identities or names. This happens when (a) mind recognizes an object and
               associates it with its name, and (b) the mind knows what is referred to
               when a name is given.</p>
              <p>Perception is non-discerning when the sense organ in question is 
              fully functional but there is no object. This occurs in states of deep <a title="Samadhi" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Samadhi">meditative absorption</a>,
               and also when the mind is unable to identify and name objects, as, for 
              example, when you encounter something for the first time and therefore 
              do not recognize it. This is the common experience of children.</p>
              <p>Mental perception is also non-discerning when it does not know 
              what is referred to when names are given as, for example, when an 
              unknown language is heard.</p>
              <p>(It should however be noted that non-discerning perception does 
              not refer to the mere privation of sensory stimulus, as, for example, 
              when you are in a dark place with your eyes open or in a soundproof 
              room. In these cases, the senses do in fact have objects – darkness and 
              silence, respectively.)</p>
              <p>There are as many types of perception as there are phenomena.</p>
              <p>Perceptions are subjective experiences, and are said to be 
              important because they are the basis for disagreement and controversy, 
              leading to conflict amongst philosophers who have renounced worldly 
              affairs.</p>
              <p><a id="Formations" name="Formations"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Formations</span></h2>
              <p>The category called formations is a little complicated. But if we 
              just limit ourselves to mental formations, then it basically refers to 
              thoughts and emotions, or what are technically referred to as the ‘<a class="mw-redirect" title="Mental states" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Mental_states">mental states</a>’. Although there are many possible mental states, the <a title="Abhidharma" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Abhidharma">Abhidharma</a> teachings speak of fifty-one, which are held to be particularly important.</p>
              <p>Sensation and perception are actually included in these 
              fifty-one, but are treated separately in the list of the five skandhas 
              because they are especially noticeable.</p>
              <p>There is no need to go into all fifty-one here, but we should 
              know that they include the components necessary for any cognition to 
              occur, namely sensation, perception, intention (meaning the mind is 
              directed towards a particular object), attention (the mind is held on 
              that object) and contact (an object, a functioning sense organ and 
              consciousness all come together).</p>
              <p>There are also five states which assist in the discernment of 
              objects. These are interest, appreciation, mindfulness, concentration 
              and discernment. We are talking about these on a subtle level. For 
              example, we need a certain amount of concentration to focus on a 
              particular object, and some discernment to identify it.</p>
              <p>These first ten are called ‘general mind states’.</p>
              <p>Then there are the virtuous states of mind such as <a title="Faith" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Faith">faith</a>, <a title="Conscientiousness" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Conscientiousness">conscientiousness</a>, absence of attachment, absence of aggression, absence of delusion, and <a title="Diligence" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Diligence">diligence</a>.</p>
              <p>Then there are the principal non-virtuous states of ignorance, 
              desire, anger, pride, doubt and harmful beliefs; as well as the 
              secondary negative states such as vindictiveness, spite, envy, deceit, 
              stinginess, laziness and forgetfulness. Here we also include the 
              drowsiness and agitation we experience in <a title="Meditation" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Meditation">meditation</a>, as well as distraction.</p>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Consciousness</span></h2>
              <p>Consciousness here refers to the consciousness of impressions from 
              the five senses, and also consciousness of mental objects, like 
              thoughts, ideas and emotions.</p>
              <p>The consciousnesses of the five senses (seeing, hearing, 
              smelling, tasting, and touching) are non-conceptual. Then the 
              information is fed to the mental consciousness, where concepts can enter
               in.</p>
              <p>Visual consciousness registers only colours and shapes. It does 
              not recognize particular colours, which is the function of the skandha 
              of perception. Nor does it identify certain colours as pleasant, which 
              is done by the feeling skandha.</p>
              <p>The followers of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mind Only" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Mind_Only">Mind Only</a> school identified eight types of consciousness. In addition to the 
              consciousnesses of the five senses and the mind, they spoke of a 
              ‘defiled mental consciousness’ and the famous ‘all-ground 
              consciousness’, or <em>alaya vijñana</em>.</p>
              <p>The <a title="Defiled mental consciousness" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Defiled_mental_consciousness">defiled mental consciousness</a> is closely connected with the ego, and is where the notion of ‘I’ and 
              ‘mine’ enters into experience. It is absent in the meditation of noble 
              beings, but never ceases in the mind stream of an ordinary being. This 
              seventh consciousness relates very closely to our ‘self-image’. After we
               receive data from the senses, and process them with the sixth 
              consciousness, the defiled mental consciousness asks whether or not this
               experience fits with how we have come to think of ourselves – our 
              ‘image’, in other words. This means there is a lot of judgment here, 
              paving the way for attachment and aversion.</p>
              <p>The <a title="All-ground consciousness" href="http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=All-ground_consciousness">alaya consciousness</a> is described as ‘mere knowing, an unspecified apprehension, the object 
              of which is general and uncircumscribed’. It is often likened to a 
              storehouse, in which we keep all our habits and instincts, the imprints 
              or ‘seeds’ of our actions which will ripen into future experiences.</p>
