The Â‘Yang BodyÂ’, which is the grown up primordial baby, is the body that is doing all the tricks like flying around (not the physical body) and passing through walls..etc.  However, this achievement was the result of focus attention sensing the chi (vital energy), concentration and visualization.  The Yang Body is thus the ultimate thought-form body vitalised by chi as opposed to yin-body.  The achievement does not require the awakening of prajna wisdom and thus is not the sort of Â‘highÂ’ level from the perspective of Buddhism.  After Yang Sheng cultivation, Yang Sheng would have to nuture itself into becoming oneness with Tao.  It is here that is of the point of interest.  The Yang Sheng dissolves into Tao to realize its true nature.    </div></blockquote></div>

Â‘IÂ’ Ching affects almost every aspect of the Chinese life -- religion, martial arts, calendar, medicine, philosophy and astrology.  Unfortunately nowadays, it is commonly misunderstood as a book of divination.<br><br>The Chinese word Â‘IÂ’ (yi) means Change.  If Heaven and Earth did not change, the power would penetrate nowhere.
