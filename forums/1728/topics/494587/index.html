              Bhutan — and Tourists, Too</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">STEVEN LEE MYERS AUG. 24,
              2017The New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">LOBESA,
              Bhutan — For centuries, Bhutan has celebrated the phallus.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They
              are painted on homes, or carved in wood, installed above doorways and under
              eaves to ward off evil, including one of its most insidious human forms,
              gossip. They are worn on necklaces, installed in granaries and in fields as a
              kind of scarecrow. They are used by masked jesters in religious festivals and
              at one temple near here in Lobesa as a blessing of fertility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now,
              as Bhutan increasingly opens up to the world, the ancient tradition has been
              evolving or, some say, sullied — by commercialization.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              still a religious symbol, it has become, to some, a relic of a patriarchal
              past, something vaguely embarrassing and not fit for the modern new democracy
              that has, by all appearances, taken firm root in Bhutan after decades of
              relative isolation and absolute monarchy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              has also become a curio to peddle in all sizes and colors to the increasing
              number of tourists visiting this remote Himalayan kingdom, renowned for its
              pursuit of “gross national happiness.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> “People still use it as a symbol,” said
              Needrup Zangpo, the executive director of the Journalist Association of Bhutan,
              who has written about the historical inspiration for the symbol, “but the
              necessity of having it painted on your house is going away.” He attributed this
              erosion of tradition to “the exposure to Western culture.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              symbol, like Bhutan itself, seems suspended between two impulses: the country’s
              headlong embrace of modernity and its preservation of traditions that made it
              unique to start with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Stories
              of Bhutan’s engagement with the phallus shed light on traditions and lifestyle
              that make Bhutan one of the happiest places on earth,” Karma Choden wrote in
              the 2014 book “Phallus: Crazy Wisdom from Bhutan,” which was published here and
              claims to be the first scholarly effort to document the ubiquity of the
              phallus.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              tradition has been widely traced to one lama, Drukpa Kunley, who spread the
              tenets of Buddhism through Bhutan in the 15th and 16th centuries.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Called
              the “Divine Madman,” he was a holy fool, a mendicant, drunkard and Lothario who
              subdued women and demons alike with his heightened spirituality and what legend
              called his “Flaming Thunderbolt of Wisdom.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Drukpa
              Kunley is celebrated throughout the country — and in Tibet, across the border —
              but his cult is centered on Chimi Lhakhang, the “no dog” monastery, near
              Lobesa, which encompasses a cluster of still smaller hamlets nestled in a
              valley of terraced paddies of red and white rice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              monastery was built in 1499 on a knoll above the Puna Tsang River, though given
              the hazy mythology surrounding Drukpa Kunley’s evangelism, there are
              contradictory accounts of the monastery’s founding.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the prevailing one, the lama subdued a demon haunting a nearby mountain pass called
              Dochula by turning her into a red dog, which he buried “with a pile of earth to
              resemble a woman’s breast.” Hence the name “no dog.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the other, according to an oral history compiled in the 1960s and translated
              into English as “The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa
              Kunley,” the lama built a stupa, or monument, on the spot where a follower died
              after repeating a ribald prayer the lama had taught him. (“I take refuge in the
              maiden’s Lotus,” one couplet begins.) The lama himself was said to have lived
              to 115.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              neither scenario of the monastery’s founding, Mr. Zangpo emphasized, did he use
              his penis, though that is how the legend is often garbled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We
              don’t have a clear line between history and mythology,” said Mr. Zangpo, who is
              compiling his own translations of the oral histories that he hopes will set the
              record straight. Like other scholars, he argues that the phallus symbol can
              more likely be traced to pre-Buddhist pagan rituals than to the Divine Madman’s
              legend.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nevertheless,
              the tales of the lama’s sexual appetite have prevailed — in no small part
              because of the oral histories, in which Drukpa Kunley flouts both secular and
              religious sensibilities by reveling in sex and alcohol on his path to
              enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              this day, hopeful couples traverse Bhutan to partake of the monastery’s
              fertility blessing. They reach it by climbing the knoll on foot after passing
              through the hamlets of Sopsokha and Teoprongchu. The valley is indisputably
              beautiful. Dragonflies swarm in circles overhead. Small aqueducts feeding the
              green rice paddies spin colorful prayer wheels like water mills.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              has made the area famous, though, are the phalluses, a must-see for foreigners
              who pay the $250 per day minimum that Bhutan requires for tourist visas. And
              more tourists, perhaps inevitably, mean more phalluses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">House
              after house is painted with phalluses. While highly stylized, they are in some
              cases graphically detailed: always erect, often ejaculating. One appears with
              the country’s name, a marketing ploy by the owner of one of the proliferating
              souvenir shops. The displays in some — rows of colorful wooden carvings — would
              not seem out of place in a sex shop.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan’s
              phalluses are not considered explicitly sexual, noted Ms. Choden, the writer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              essence, the phallus represents the center of the male ego, and not a
              celebration of sex,” she writes. “It reminds onlookers that if this force is
              harnessed properly, it will fuel productivity and creativity rather than wanton
              lust.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Lotay
              Tshering, a 51-year-old rice farmer, owns a house in Sopsokha that is adorned
              with two giant penis murals. His wife’s uncle painted them in homage to the
              Divine Madman, “who has blessed this place,” as he put it. He and his wife have
              six children.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              a cup of salt butter tea, Mr. Tshering lamented the proliferation of shops and
              cafes that accompanied the rise of tourism (though his main complaint for the
              authorities was the sorry state of the local roads).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“When
              I grew up, there were no shops,” he said. He says the trend came with the
              advent of parliamentary elections in 2008, which Bhutan’s former king ordered
              after abdicating in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> “From then on there was no stopping the number
              of shops sprouting up,” Mr. Tshering said, adding that he found the trend
              unseemly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              have no commercial interest,” he said, referring to his display of phalluses,
              which have been so widely photographed that they appear on Wikipedia. “I ask
              for nothing.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              phalluses certainly have been a boon for the villages here, a two-hour drive
              from the capital, Thimphu. The area has around 2,700 people, according to the
              most recent census, in 2005. Most are farmers, though there is a growing number
              of shopkeepers and artists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tenpa
              Renchen, the deputy headman of the village, an elected post, said the gains to
              the local economy had come mostly from the rents that villagers can charge to
              the souvenir shops. A few more opened in the last year, as did a restaurant
              with a stunning view of the monastery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Personally,”
              he emphasized, with a diplomatic touch, “I don’t like people selling these in
              shops, but they have to make a living.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              village elders, however, are watching the commercialization with caution. The
              proliferation of shops has not yet reached a crisis, Mr. Renchen said, but
              could soon test the limits of tolerance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mr.
              Renchen sounded wistful in an interview, lamenting the modern exploitation of
              something with a deeper religious significance.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              Divine Madman,” he said, “has much more to offer than just a phallus.</span></p>
