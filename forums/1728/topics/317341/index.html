Imagine if this sad story applies to millions of people...<br>Therefore, I sincerely hope everyone especially as a buddhist who practice compassion and bodhicitta, pls dedicate your merit to them.<br><br>We all know that the doing life release will give most merit as it already include giving of dharma, wealth, love and protection from suffering.<br>If we manage to do our part to save millions of life, the merit will be beyond our imagination.<br>This is a special month where whatever good deeds we do, the good karma are multiplied.<br><br>Pls dedicate merit to them with pure heart, I will dedicate my merit to stop the future disaster from happening and those who do the merit dedication.</p></div>

              <p>the fact is that human beings are so vulnerable. during safe times people will start getting restless and do so many things to harm the nature, to one another. i believe every thing has its cause and effect, as in buddhism.</p>
              <p>ppl do not realise that its their actions that somehow lead to the anger of mother nature. How do they ever understand?</p>

              <p>even those spirits from the <span style="color: #000000;">indonesia tsunami went to look for Ven ChungXi ä¼ å–œæ³•å¸ˆ, which i think they "spiritually" saw that He's really well cultivated. amazing.</span></p>

              <p>from what i just heard from MCK recently, the place he was staying never felt the quake, even though, other places of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Shanghai GuangDong, Thailand felt the quake.</p>
              <p><strong>Small-intensity earthquake shakes Hong Kong</strong><br><a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=27370&amp;sid=9895531&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060915">http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=27370&amp;sid=9895531&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060915</a></p>
              <p>that say Meirt/virtue of Nianfo is unconcievable.</p>
              <p>Mount Dong Tian Mu got 4 monasteries, abt 300-400 people doing nianfo practice. nianfo there is 24/7. when the surrounding of Mount Dong Tian Mu encounter disasters, the monastries were unaffected.</p>
              <p>ChingYun also got a HaiDao monastery, also got a big nianfo hall. when the surrounding got disasters, they were also unaffected.</p>
              <p>now there's æ±¤æ± é•‡Tangchi Town, also doing very well with morality and Buddhadharma.</p>
              <p>there's also a Buddhist story about a girl who was very concentrated on dharma(?) study in her room, when the surround neighbours encounter a fire broke out, the surround rooms where burnt down, but her room where not affected.</p>
              <p>this is true, like Buddha said å¢ƒéš�å¿ƒè½¬ enviroment is turn by the people's mind/emotion around the area. or somehow or rather, they are protected by Dharma protectors.</p>

              <p>There are many incidents happened in Myanmar that doesn't cause any chain effect in China.<br>But when some tragedy happen, it will create some opportunities for people to make bad karma through speech or mind.

              Eight Causes of Earthquakes said by Gautama Buddha
              
              This great earth is established upon liquid, the liquid upon the atmosphere, and the atmosphere upon space. And when mighty atmospheric disturbances take place, the liquid is agitated. And with the agitation of the liquid, tremors of the earth arise. This is the first reason, the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes.
              
              when an ascetic or holy man of great power, one who has gained mastery of his mind, or a deity who is mighty and potent, develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element, and to a boundless degree on the liquid element, he, too, causes the earth to tremble, quiver, and shake. This is the second reason, the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes.
              
              when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mother's womb, mindfully and clearly comprehending; and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mother's womb, mindfully and clearly comprehending; and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment; when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma; when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on; and when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains â€”  this great earth trembles, quivers, and shakes
              
              These are the eight reasons, the eight causes for a great earthquake to arise

              <p>Buddhism being a cult? What are you talking about ?</p>
              <p>The increase in disaster on our planet is actually a cyclical thing. We are entering a new era characterised by intensified changes now.</p>
              <p>Not only the planet will change. In the future, the consciousness of human beings will also change. The physical structure, life spans of beings will also changes over a long time.</p>

              <p>This is a very weird logic.<br>Are you saying due to the separatists riot occured in Tibet, it caused so many civilians in Sichuan including those students, young kids, old people to die in earthquake?<br>How can one receive the bad karma while the mistake is in fact done by other people?</p>

              <p>Glad that all if not most of us has the compassion towards the earthquake victims.</p>
              <p>Let's share the methods we use to accumulate merit.<br>Before we do chanting or read any dharma book or article, we should in our mind invite all protectors and nearby beings to listen to dharma together with you. Giving dharma to them can benefit them a lot. If they feel the joy of it, can anytime reborn to higher realm.<br><br>Attending puja is also very auspicious. But we must rejoyce, so it will give us even more merit.<br>Rejoyce is one of the practice in the 7 limb practice that can gives you hurge merit.<br><span style="color: #888888;">More at http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level1_getting_started/approaching_study_meditation/preliminaries_meditation_study_7-limb.html</span></p>
              <p>Whatever good deeds we do, we must dedicate wholeheartedly to all beings or to the victims.<br>To achieve that, one need to have compassion. To cultivate compassion, the easiest way is when disaster happened, care about them. One can also practice the 4 immeasurables (å››æ— é‡�å¿ƒ), exchange of self and others.</p>

              <p>If i did not remember wrongly, i read somewhere that there is such thing as shared karma, among the people in the world.</p>
              <p>the logic is similar to if one does bad deeds, incur bad debts, he may not be the first to experience the bad karma effect. Other people will suffer as the result, though they may be nice people. he may suffer in his next life.</p>

              <p>i still think its the warning to the people. its like a king who declare war, but he may not suffer directly, the soldiers and the civilians are the ones to suffer first. the king still enjoy the fruits. it may due to the king who has not used up his positive karma that may have accumulated in previous lives. once ended, then will he suffer.</p>
              <p>this can be brought to the present situation china / tibet is in. Please correct me if i am wrong.</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I've heard disturbing news that there were kidnappers who attempted to abduct babies from the earthquake victims.  Those inhumane things even fed the babies with sleeping pills.  Luckily, they were found out by an alert inn owner. </p>
              <p>Is this an isolated incident?  Or, how many babies who "disappeared" in the earthquake actually ended up being sold for some nefarious reasons?  Let's pray that these attempts would not succeed and the babies will safely return to their anxious mothers. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, let's also pray for the kidnappers to gain a conscience and stop before making a grave mistake - the bad karma is great and may ripen in their present lifetime affecting themselves and their love ones.  Same goes for the soldiers who sold or tried to sell aid items.</p>
              <p>Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva</p>
