              <p>Yes, didn't mentioned my Master though because he asked for 'living'...</p>
              <p>My Taiwanese teacher has hinted that he will pass away in a few years. In fact he almost passed away a year back or so, but after hundreds of people requested him to continue teaching, he did continue to live on. (he had around 5k students in Taiwan, but at that time when he was dying, just nice our Singapore community was visiting him and they all prayed and requested him to stay)</p>
              <p>He has the ability to go at will... he also described how he can die at will by entering very deep samadhi and cessation.</p>
              <p>He's still not very old (60 now) but he said he and Master Shen Kai always 'take turn'... like passing the baton to one another, for many lifetimes (even in previous lifetimes they were abbots of the same Zen monastery in Kyoto)... their relationship began when they were both students of Rahula (Buddha's son) in Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime (anyway, my Master became the 'in charge' of Rahula's students after Rahula passed away... though I can't exactly find out info about who that is). When Missionary Chen first met Master Shen Kai, even without advanced notice, the first words Master Shen Kai said to him was 'finally you have come... (ä½ ç»ˆäºŽæ�¥äº†) ' as Master has been anticipating his successor for a long time.</p>
              <p>So he didn't want his age gap to be too big with Master Shen Kai's current incarnation in America (and yeah, he can see Master Shen Kai's current incarnation and described to us before)... end up he know Master Shen Kai only when Master is old and passed away after a while.</p>

              <p>think why agree with zero, is due to some people MAY use the name of enlightenment to gain more follower and money from student. t'is the concern, other than that u see for yourself....i see humbleness/loving kindness/compassion/wisdom.</p>

              <p>Years ago, someone told me that there was one master from India
              who attained enlightenment in this lifetime. He taught meditation
              for free at the United Nations for 37 years before he passed away
              in 2007. This master even composed over 20,000 of his own spiritual
              mantra songs and drawn over 15 million soul-birds, it is said that
              the birds were like his prayers for world peace. He even lift very
              heavy weighs like elephants and airplanes. His name is Sri Chinmoy,
              anyone heard of him? </p>

              <p>By the way, I hope you do understand that enlightenment is not reserved for superhumans or great beings. And I hope every single Buddhist should aim for enlightenment in this life - it is truly possible.</p>

              <p>According to Sri Chinmoy, the purpose of reincarnation is for human beings to return back to earth to continue our spiritual quests until we reach to goal. It takes many lifetimes for humans to perfect one's nature to the fullest before one is ready for enlightenment or realization.  Enlightenment or realization does not come from book knowledge but actual cultivation though practice of meditation and other deep spiritual cultivation. Lord Buddha is a good example. Book knowledge cannot bring enlightenment or realization. It's like learning to swim by reading a book manual without entering into the water. It is impossible for anyone to know how to swim just from book knowledge alone. And even without a book, one can still learn how to swim.   </p>
              <p>When temptation comes, that is the best time to see who has completely transform his or her nature. So, how many here can remain pure in thoughts and nature in the face of temptation? </p>
              <p>It is my belief that enlightenment is for all, Buddhists, as well as non Buddhists. </p>

              <p>In fact... few years is enough if your quest for truth is deep and you know the direct path to realization. I speak from experience, not book knowledge.</p>

              <p>In our latest podcast with Theravada teacher Daniel Ingram he 
              breaches the taboo of enlightenment by discussing the enlightenment of 
              other teachers. Not only that but he argues for a more transparent 
              approach to enlightenment within certain teaching circles, in hopes that
               enlightenment can become more attainable. Listen and see why he thinks 
              this will help.</p>

              <p>Many people in the world today, did not realize that during part of your lifetime, a great Master had just came and gone. Just like Lord Buddha many many years ago, when he appeared on earth, how many people during that lifetime who had met him, recognized a great Master in Buddha. People today can only see Lord Buddha in the forms of statues, but when he was alive, how many honored him the way he is being honored today in hundreds and thousands of temples?</p>
              <p>Many times in history, when great masters appeared, very few people truly gave them the respect they truly truly deserved. Lord Jesus was even crucified. Many criticized and dishonored these great teachers. They hurled insults, totally disregard the true stature of these great men and women.</p>
              <p>These great Masters came to serve humanity. Some had the capacity to go if they so wanted it. But they endured until the end. How they suffered very painful wounds for us.</p>
              <p>We simple do not know how lucky we are to be born during the time of a great Master. He blessed us all regardless of whether we knew of his existence or not. His love is totally unconditional. Many years from now, many will finally understand.  </p>

              <p>i believe (or taught by MCK) that if a place have an enlighten(ed)(ing) /well cultivated person, the place will be "blessed" without (great) calamity/disaster. HIs pure energy will vibrant and purified the negative energy there.</p>
              <p>some ppl ask if MCK believe in fengshui, he said yes. there's some truth in fengshui, if not it would not have survive for so long. but he said the concept of fengshui is in the mind. when the mind is pure the land is pure. if u can cultivate the mind to pureness, who need fengshui?</p>
              <p>lated Ven Shen kai also said it similarly. feng is wind, shui is water. if a person sitting in a room and feel hot, he can open the window to let the wind in. if the person become thirsty, go drink some water. so it revolve around the feeling of the person in the area. </p>

              <p>Reason why I stress this is because the strangely common view of enlightenment as somehow being only achieved by special or great beings is tremendously disempowering in practice and simply not in accord with reality. One simply has to open our eyes and take a look around.</p>
