              <p>Many defilements is natural and unavoidable before
              enlightenment</p>
              <p>Prior to sotapanna stage, everybody has 10 defilements.</p>
              <p>Prior to sakadagami stage, everyone has at least 7
              defilements</p>
              <p>Prior to anagami stage, everyone has at least 7 defilements but
              2 are weakened after attaining sakadagami</p>
              <p>Prior to Arhat stage, everyone has at least 5 defilements.</p>
              <p>After arhat, no more defilements.</p>
              <p>In the Bodhisattva bhumi stages, they also have a rather similar
              model where defilements are gradually removed.</p>
              <p>If you don't have defilements to begin with, something is very
              wrong.</p>
              <p>If think you don't have defilements, you just aren't seeing
              clearly.</p>
              <p>If you don't have defilements, why bother to practice in the
              first place?</p>
              <p>Have confidence that this life is enough to become enlightened
              whether or not you practiced before or not. And if you are reading
              this and have an interest in this, chances are you probably have
              certain karmic conditions there.</p>
              <p>In the Mahasatipatthana sutta, the Buddha said that those who
              practices the four foundations of mindfulness attains Anagami or
              Arhatship in 7 days, much less 7 months or 7 years. In the
              commentaries, it further explains that those of low calibre attains
              that in 7 years, those of high calibre attains in 7 days.</p>
              <p>I am very low calibre already, I have not attained insight in 7
              days, and I have not even attained Anagami or Arhatship.</p>
              <p>Insight shouldn't take more than 7 years if one has the proper
              teaching, view, technique, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Basic point I want to point out: you don't remove
              afflictions (in fact: can't) in order to end ignorance, you end
              ignorance via realization in order to remove
              afflictions.</strong></p>

              <p>Hmm... the analogy of the scholar and master doesn't apply to me, 
                          because I am no scholar, just a practitioner reporting what I have 
                          experienced and seen (though it is not only me who have experienced and seen the same things in this forum, simply ask Thusness or Simpo in this forum - they too have gone through the same phases).</p>
              <p>I am fine with posting things from others - but I am ruthless and
                           fearless so to speak, in speaking out my mind when necessary. There is a
                           site called 'ruthless truth' - I like that title. As I see it, when it 
                          comes to spirituality, respect is out of question - it is about 
                          objective truth, and sometimes blind faith can hinder seeing. This goes 
                          even to Buddhist masters and teachers (as geis knows, I comment on 
                          certain Buddhist teachers as well) so please don't misunderstand that I'm being biased towards Buddhism.</p>

              For any true meaning intercourse to take place, requires emotional maturity, and also the acceptance of beliefs can be allowed to be clarfiied  either as opinions and facts.  Just because I believe something to be true does'nt necessary as constitute fact,  that you believe for a fact is also just an opinion unless thoroughly investigated. Still you are entitled your right to your beliefs.

              An excerpt from Kalama  Sutta :-
                              o not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing,
                              nor upon tradition,
                              nor upon rumor,
                              nor upon what is in a scripture,
                              nor upon surmise,
                              nor upon an axiom,
                              nor upon specious reasoning,
                              nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over,
                              nor upon another's seeming ability,
                              nor upon the consideration, "The monk is our teacher."
                              Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.'
                              Thus, the Buddha provides ten specific sources which should not be used to accept a specific teaching as true, without further verification:
                              Oral history
                              Traditional
                              News sources
                              Scriptures or other official texts
                              Suppositional reasoning
                              Philosophical reasoning
                              Common sense
                              One's own opinions
                              Authorities or experts
                              One's own teacher
                              Instead, the Buddha says, only when one personally knows that a certain teaching                    is skillful, blameless, praiseworthy, and conducive to happiness, and that it is praised by       the wise, should one then accept it as true and practice it.

              <p>Just like to clarify: this forum is totally ok with posting non-Buddhist materials - but as far as right view is concerned, I have to point out. Also, the different phases of insight and experience, it is also good for a practitioner to know.</p>
              <p>Sometimes a master or teacher can point out something that helps the practitioner progress... but up till a certain point, it then becomes a hindrance, if one invests too much faith in that teacher and stops investigating.</p>
              <p>Still, I still recommend Eckhart Tolle books to people (recently to my family members) even though it only leads to the I AM stage. I believe it can help them progress spiritually.</p>

              <p>There is also nobody to let go and let live... life lives on regardless, and is letting go of itself every moment, only that we take it too seriously and take it to be real and then grasp on our illusions. ;) No trace of enlightenment remains with the dropping away of the self... and this traceless enlightenment goes on and on as life goes on and on.</p>

              <p>Many defilements is natural and unavoidable before

              <p>Prior to sotapanna stage, everybody has 10 defilements.</p>
              <p>Prior to sakadagami stage, everyone has at least 7
              defilements</p>
              <p>Prior to anagami stage, everyone has at least 7 defilements but
              2 are weakened after attaining sakadagami</p>
              <p>Prior to Arhat stage, everyone has at least 5 defilements.</p>
              <p>After arhat, no more defilements.</p>
              <p>In the Bodhisattva bhumi stages, they also have a rather similar
              model where defilements are gradually removed.</p>
              <p>If you don't have defilements to begin with, something is very
              wrong.</p>
              <p>If think you don't have defilements, you just aren't seeing
              clearly.</p>
              <p>If you don't have defilements, why bother to practice in the
              first place?</p>
              <p>Have confidence that this life is enough to become enlightened
              whether or not you practiced before or not. And if you are reading
              this and have an interest in this, chances are you probably have
              certain karmic conditions there.</p>
              <p>In the Mahasatipatthana sutta, the Buddha said that those who
              practices the four foundations of mindfulness attains Anagami or
              Arhatship in 7 days, much less 7 months or 7 years. In the
              commentaries, it further explains that those of low calibre attains
              that in 7 years, those of high calibre attains in 7 days.</p>
              <p>I am very low calibre already, I have not attained insight in 7
              days, and I have not even attained Anagami or Arhatship.</p>
              <p>Insight shouldn't take more than 7 years if one has the proper
              teaching, view, technique, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Basic point I want to point out: you don't remove
              afflictions (in fact: can't) in order to end ignorance, you end
              ignorance via realization in order to remove
              afflictions.</strong></p>

              <p>Basically any practice that can shock you into seeing what is really going on is acceptable. 
              But understand, you want to know what's really going on, to feel it, to contact reality. It 
              shouldn’t take long, a few years at most, less for some. If a practice or a teacher tells you 
              it will take 10 or 20 years, find a new practice or teacher. Remember you are your own 
              salvation, ultimately it is you who will wake you up. Any method that can shock you into seeing
               what is really going on is acceptable but the perspective shift must occur.</p>

              <p>Emptiness Dancing and End of the World are written at different phases of Adyashanti's development.</p>
              <p>Emptiness Dancing, True Meditation, and all books prior to that are all about the I AM and Eternal Witness phase. It's all about realizing the I AM, the pure beingness that underlies all forms and beings.</p>
              <p>In End of the World, he has progressed into Thusness Stage 4. He no longer sees the division between witness and experience, or emptiness and forms. He even writes a chapter ("<span id="search" style="visibility: visible;"><em>Being Stuck In The Witness")</em></span> in which he talked about how he got stuck at the Witness phase previously but has now gone beyond it.</p>
              <p>But whatever he said is still nothing about Anatta... it is the One Mind phase.</p>
              <p>It's all over the book so I don't have to quote... you just need to be able to discern what are the different phases of insights, then you can see that the difference is as clear as daylight.</p>

                       you are. Emptiness is a profound aspect of what you are, it's a 
                      profound taste of your true nature, it's not the totality of what you 
                      are any than getting up in the morning and feeling good is the totality 
                      of what you are, or feeling bad is a totality of what you are... 
                      ...Whenever you touch upon a deep truth, suchness of reality, your true 
                      nature, each aspect feels like it's total and complete and all-inclusive
                       at that moment. So that's why teachers have a very hard time getting 
                      through to people when they have an initial experience of anything 
                      because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if it's an initial experience of reality it feels totally

              <p>I heard you say this (we can all be enlightened) more than
                              once... but I really do wonder about a person like myself with
                              still so many defilements.  I feel it might take a few
                              lifetimes, unless I aim for Pureland.  Don't know why I think
                              like that, but I feel like a sinner. </p>
              <p>It's heartening to hear that there are living enlightened
                              beings, but just wondering if maybe they cultivated for many
                              lifetimes, and that's why they achieved it this time round.  I
                              read bits and pieces about your realizations (your writing is
                              lengthy, haha) and I cannot help but wonder maybe you practised
                              well in previous incarnations, and that's why you can realize
                              quickly now despite your young age. </p>

              <p>Thrangu Rinpoche:</p>
              <p>"One night Rechungpa was dreaming that he was in a realm where the stories of the lives of great masters were being told. They were wonderful accounts. Some dakinis said, "These are wonderful, but it would be much more wonderful to only hear about the life of Milarepa. It is much more important." They asked, "Who is going to tell the life story of Milarepa?" Rechungpa noticed that some dakinis were pointing at him. When he woke up, he went to see Milarepa and told him, "I asked for an received all these meditation instructions from you, but I have never asked you to tell the story of your life. Based on what you have accomplished, you can't be an ordinary person. You must be an emanation of someone like vajrapani or one of the Buddhas of the five families." He then asked Milarepa, "Please tell the story of your life, how you developed your diligence, how you developed realization, and how you attained the result."</p>
              <p>Milarepa told rechungpa, "You think that I am an emanation of someone. This is an expression of your faith and pure vision of me, but in terms of the dharma it is the wrong view because I am not an emanation of the Buddha. I am not an emanation of a bodhisattva. I am an emanation of nothing. I am merely an ordinary person. Not only am I an ordinary being, I had such bad karma because I practiced sorcery and I brought hailstorms down on people and killed them. Your belief that I am not an ordinary person is incorrect because this view actually denies the power of the dharma. I was an ordinary person with extremely bad karma, but due to the power of the dharma I met my master Marpa who gave me instructions, and I practiced these with diligence. Through this effort I was able to purify my bad karma and attain the result." Thus, you should not think that the dharma doesn't have that power. On the contrary, even someone with very bad karma can purify it and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime if he or she practices diligently."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This story also reminds me of how Angulimala killed almost a thousand person, but was converted by Buddha and later attained Nirvana.</p>
              <p>It is incorrect to think of practitioners with realizations as having to do with past life emanations. Most of them are actually very ordinary people. It is just that due to the good conditions, having met the dharma, and having known good teachers, we are being transformed by the power of dharma. You too, can be transformed by the power of dharma, regardless of how bad your karma is or how low your capacity is.</p>

Emptiness is a profound aspect of what you are, it's a profound taste of your true nature, it's not the totality of what you are any than getting up in the morning and feeling good is the totality of what you are, or feeling bad is a totality of what you are... ...Whenever you touch upon a deep truth, suchness of reality, your true nature, each aspect feels like it's total and complete and all-inclusive at that moment. So that's why teachers have a very hard time getting through to people when they have an initial experience of anything because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if it's an initial experience of reality it feels totally complete and there is a certain innate confidence that arises within you.

              <p>ok, thanks for the clarification. I'd look out for the things you pointed out if i get the chance to read the books again. because when i read the book, i jumped to chapters randomly. But somehow his talks gives a sense of spaciousness and inspires to look at mind. Just as reading on mind nature or your posts help.  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi, <br><br>I just wanted to add my two cents to this thread.<br><br>In my own experience, all past experiences don't really lead anywhere.<br><br>If anything all they do is bring about a greater appreciation of the freedom and wholeness of this present moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So seeking truth in any words, or any appearance or meaning... is just another way of solidifying yourself around certain concepts and beliefs.<br><br>What is more useful in my own opinion, is to let go of all this need to express outwardly and see that nothing is really needed in this moment, nothing need change or happen for this moment to be as it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any idea whatsoever about truth is just that, just another idea, is that really necessary?  Does this really need to be picked apart and understood?  Or is it simply what it is?  Can you really come to any real conclusions about yourself or life?  Or is it simply the way the it is?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not really trying to convey anything here, except perhaps the peace and freedom in dropping all of it, which i guess, in the end, is still saying too much! :)</p>
