              <p>so the point is not to get somewhere, but to see that our deeply held notions of a self, coming and going, a getting somewhere, and existence and non-existence, all such notions simply dont apply to reality that is luminous and empty</p>
              <p>words and meanings ultimately dont apply to reality and reality only reveals its nature when we drop our dualistic conceptions.</p>
              <p>yet, words are needed to point out the various view of duality and inherency in order that we drop them. it goes far more subtle than most see. therefore there is this thing called right view which buddha always stress, which is nevertheless just a raft that we let go in the end.</p>

              If you look through this model of progress, it's basically ending all mode of interpretations of the mind, and its tendency to give legitimacy to "thingness" of things...A complete and fearless opening to what arises, without giving ground to what was, is, or will be.
              
              But I hesitate to write things such as "there is no grandiose universal consciousness." It's just that whether there is, or isn't one is an unnecessary supposition. Once you have gone, who is there to know
              -----------
              Yeah I understand. At present, I embrace a view that can allow me to fully experience whatevar arises fearlessly and unreservedly and that has helped me tremendously. E.g. from intimacy to "thingness" of things, then more to "thingness" of whatever arises.
              
              For example, what exactly is Consciousness? In Anatta, I do not deny consciousness. All is experienced as consciousness in a dependently originated way. In the eighteen dhatus. Awareness is understood and experienced in terms of the eighteen dhatus. For example, I do not say eye-consciousness is the same as ear-consciousness, or that eye-consciousness turns into ear-consciousness, or that a previous moment of thought is the same as this moment of thought. As 'Awareness' is not an entity and is a mere label collating experiences, it has to be these diverse manifestation. This understanding enables practitioners to fully and completely experience whatever arises.
              
              Now, let's say I tell someone to "experience consciousness as sound". How are you going to experience that? How thorough can it be? First of all there is already this delineation - there is sound, and consciousness. Either consciousness is here or sound is there, or is taking place in here, or out there. But when you say, in hearing only heard - or there is only sound - sound-consciousness, sound, is fully and totally experienced. This moment of 'arising sound' is fully experienced.
              Quote
              Once you have gone, who is there to know?
              Whatever arises speaks thusly.
              
              A thousand petals
              Drift into an empty house.
              
              Though the sound of the herder's flute passes by,
              The man and the ox are no where to be seen.

But when we deal with the inner c<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>sciousness, which is the boundless, illumined, transformed c<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>sciousness, then our focus of c<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>centrati<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span> can go <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>, go <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>, go <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>.<br><br>C<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>sciousness is <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>ly <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">on</span>e.

              <p><strong>Experience, Realization, and View</strong></p>
              <p>Our paradigm, view, insights, experiences, affect our every
                                          moment perception of life, self, the universe. Speaking from
                                          experience, this is what a seeker might go through:</p>
              <p><strong>Duality</strong></p>
              <p>Generally every normal non-spiritual person sees himself as a
                                          subject, self, perceiver, doer, which is a psychic entity conceived
                                          as locating inside the body - be it inside the head behind the eyes
                                          or in the heart or some other locations.</p>
              <p>This conceived psychic entity causes a sense of alienation as
                                          'I' am inside my body, looking outwards at the world through my
                                          eyes, ears, etc. I am self-contracted, separated from the world out
                                          there, and so experience is divided into 'inner' and 'outer'.
                                          Reality consists of three components: I, the seer, sees the world
                                          out there. (Seer, seeing, seen) I, the doer, does the deed (Doer,
                                          doing, done). All these actions, and perceptions, are felt to have
                                          occured by virtue of this psychic entity residing inside my body,
                                          which I call Me.</p>
              <p>This mentally conceived sense of alienation from a separate
                                          objective world resulting from the perceived existence of a
                                          separate self and psychic entity residing within this body-mind
                                          results in all manners of passionate feelings such as fear, anger,
                                          craving, malice, sorrow, and all forms of destructive undertakings
                                          endemic in our world: war, murder, torture, rape, domestic
                                          violence, corruption and so on.</p>
              <p>Basically it comes down to this: craving (craving for sensual
                                          pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for extermination),
                                          which arises due to the view of there being an inherently existing
                                          self alienated from the world, whereby the self must always get
                                          away from unpleasant experiences and chase after pleasant
                                          experiences, in search for happiness and the attenuation of
                                          suffering, not knowing this process of craving is precisely what
                                          causes suffering.</p>
              <p><strong>Self-Realization, Partial Duality</strong></p>
              <p>By the practice of contemplating on the Source of experiencing
                                          ("Who am I?", "Who is the Source?"), we trace the radiance back to
                                          the essence of mind-consciousness. At the moment where the seeker
                                          reaches the pinnacle of his self-inquiry, one has a non-dual,
                                          non-conceptual, direct, immediate perception of the self-luminosity
                                          of mind's Presence. The self-felt certainty arising from the
                                          non-dual, non-conceptual, direct, immediate mode of perception
                                          (NDNCDIMOP) of mind's luminosity leads to a self-felt certainty
                                          that results in utter conviction of having touched the essence of
                                          being and existence. As all doubts pertaining to the nature of
                                          one's identity can no longer linger, one's self-inquiry into 'Who
                                          am I' comes to a closing conclusion. Being absolutely intimate as a
                                          sheer sense of Presence, Beingness, and Existence, shining in plain
                                          view prior to conceptual sullying, it is nevertheless immediately
                                          reified due to the paradigm and view of duality and inherency, even
                                          though in itself it is a non-dual perception.</p>
              <p>What it is reified into is a grander entity than the psychic
                                          entity conceived as locating in the body as previously conceived.
                                          Though the psychic entity located inside the body, aka. the ego, is
                                          now being released through seeing the falsity of a personal self,
                                          the Identity remains intact at large, now expanding to become a
                                          Metaphysical entity transcending space and time, the grand,
                                          impersonal, and universal Self that is birthless and deathless. Due
                                          to the view of duality still largely being intact - Presence and
                                          Awareness is also seen as the Eternal Witness, an impartial and
                                          unchanging watcher of all phenomena that passes. 'I' am God, the
                                          ground of being, the source of all animate and inanimate objects,
                                          the universal consciousness underlying all my manifestations which
                                          comes and goes like waves in the ocean of Being.</p>
              <p>All along not knowing that what they have realized is simply an
                                          aspect of luminosity pertaining to non-conceptual thought, a
                                          manifestation of mind-cognizance, and is as such nothing ultimate
                                          or special (as compared to any other manifestations).</p>
              <p><strong>Non-Duality</strong></p>
              <p>Via the contemplation into the absence of a separate self or the
                                          seamlessness of awareness and its contents, a direct and
                                          experiential realization that the subject-object separation and
                                          dichotomy is illusory arises. Everything is experienced at
                                          zero-distance in the absence of the bond of dualistic psychic
                                          construct.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless at the beginning, as the insight of non-duality
                                          arises but not the insight into no-inherency, one ends up falling
                                          into:</p>
              <p><strong>Substantial Non-duality</strong></p>
              <p>- Subject-object dichotomy collapses, and is subsumed, into
                                          inherent oneness</p>
              <p>- Due to the view of inherency (that reality must have
                                          'existence' located somewhere and somewhen, even if it is Here and
                                          Now), the vivid 'realness' of non-dual luminosity is being treated
                                          as something Absolute, as having inherent, independent and
                                          unchanging existence, and is being reified into Noumenon (in
                                          contrast to illusory phenomenon), and as being the ultimate
                                          non-dual Self</p>
              <p>- the intimacy experienced via the collapse of subject-object
                                          dichotomy is being referenced to a grandiose all-pervasive Self ("I
                                          am Everywhere and I am Everything")</p>
              <p>- all phenomena are seen to be illusory projections of a single
                                          underlying source, such that all phenomena are self-expressions of
                                          the single nature of Awareness, as depicted by the analogy of the
                                          mirror and its reflections - reflections as such do not have an
                                          objective, independent existence outside the mirror - and in fact
                                          only the Mirror is seen to have absolute, independent, inherent
                                          existence - only the Mirror is Real, and the appearances are only
                                          Real as the Mirror</p>
              <p>- appearances are inseparable from the Source, and yet the
                                          Source is independent of appearances</p>
              <p><strong>Insubstantial Non-duality</strong></p>
              <p>- Also known as the arising insight into anatta, it is seen that
                                          seeing, cognizing, awareness is precisely and only what is seen,
                                          heard, tasted, touched, manifesting</p>
              <p>- The intimacy experienced via the lack of separation has no
                                          frame of reference due to the lack of something inherent - in the
                                          seeing is just the seen, in the hearing is just the heard, there is
                                          no True Self of any sorts - the world only references itself
                                          without an agent</p>
              <p>-There is no grandiose, universal consciousness, only
                                          individual bodies and mindstreams interacting with each other due
                                          to interdependent origination, without any conceived 'underlying
                                          oneness behind multiplicity' - absolutely no identity remains, even
                                          the notion that "I am you and you are me" is seen as absurd</p>
              <p>- There is no such thing as 'seamlessness of awareness and
                                          contents' or 'inseperability of awareness and its contents' - for
                                          awareness IS the process and activities of cognizance only, there
                                          is no such thing as 'awareness + its contents'</p>
              <p>- seeing, cognizing, awaring never exists as nouns pointing to a
                                          noumenon but as verbs collating various activities of cognizance -
                                          what is seen, heard, taste, touch, are activities manifesting on
                                          its own accord with the presence of requisite conditions and
                                          factors via interdependent origination, without an agent,
                                          perceiver, controller, doer</p>
              <p>- further penetration into anatta reveals that all phenomena are
                                          disjoint, unsupported, unlinked, bubble-like, insubstantial,
                                          dream-like, and self-releasing - there is absolutely nothing, not
                                          even an Awareness that underlies two thoughts, two manifestations -
                                          in fact there is not even two thoughts as such, just this thought,
                                          which spontaneously self-releases upon inception leaving absolutely
                                          no traces</p>
              <p>- There is absolutely no collapsing of subject-object dichotomy
                                          into a base existing somewhere, even as a Here/Now - there is no
                                          linking base or source at all, only the experience of dispersed-out
                                          and de-linked multiplicity</p>
              <p>- All manifestations are intrinstically luminous and vivid yet
                                          insubstantial and vanishes without a trace upon inception like
                                          drawing pictures on water manifests vivid appearances that does not
                                          leave trace - no existence of any sorts can leave traces when
                                          reality is a dream-like process with no inherent existence, like an
                                          illusion but not an illusion.</p>

              <p>Once a student came to a spiritual master and told him that he was very upset with people from different paths trying to promote their own gurus as being the best in the world. It's like a competition to see who can promote whose master to the top.</p>
              <p>To this, the spiritual master said to this student that it is very good for people to promote their own gurus to be of the highest because for those who follow these gurus, they will be thinking of the highest divine in their own gurus all the time. Which means that people will be spending more time thinking of the highest divine and they will benefit for doing so. The more time people think of the divine, the faster they make spiritual progress, even if their master may not be as great as they think, it does not matter. What matters is that their own faith in their gurus will help them make great progress in their own spirtuality.  </p>

                  If you are correct then is ok. But most people don't even have a very clear understanding of what Bodhisattva and what Arhat is. In thailand, any monk with some powers are mistaken to be 'arhats'... which is ridiculous and goes to show how pervasive is the ignorance of what Buddhism is about. Or some people with some realizations may be mistaken to be arhat, when they are actually sotapanna, or something else. So unless you are very sure and have a very good understanding of dharma, better not to make judgements.

              <p>In a sense, that's true. But it isn't saying 'who n who is enlightened' per se that is harmful, but it is the lack of understanding what enlightenment and its stages really entail and making false conclusions based on false/incomplete information and understanding of enlightenment and its stages, that is harmful, imo.</p>
              <p>If you have the correct knowledge of what enlightenment is and its stages, then no problem...</p>
              <p>As for other people's enlightenment, usually you can tell if there is a very clear experiential description from that person... you can often tell his states from what he describes. There is a difference between sprouting words from knowledge and speaking from experience though, those that have experiential realization are able to provide experiential accounts.</p>

              <p>For someone to understand a doctor's writing, the person has to be at least a nurse. Not everyone can recognise a true master, just as not everyone can recognise a real gem from all the colorful stones in the market. Those with some spiritual knowledge from previous lifetimes can feel whether a teacher is realised or not. It also has to do with one's affinity with one's destined master. The amount of spritual development within a person and the sincere cry in wanting to make further progress will show him / her where their Master is.  </p>

              <p>note of special situation in Shurangama Sutra (or Lotus sutra) where Ananda while only a stream entry understood what the Buddha is saying, while those 4th stage arahats cannot understand.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; " lang="EN-US">In Shurangama sutra, Ananda reached 1st stage stream entry, but He study Mahayana. When Buddha preached Shurangama sutra about half way, Ananda was already Understand what the Buddha is talking about, so He praised the Buddha. Purnamaitreyaniputra, a 4th stage Arahat, saw Ananda's reaction, and was confused, how a stream entry could understand what Buddha said, but an arahat couldn't. Buddha explained, sentient being have 2 kind of obstruction. namely obstruction based on affliction (çƒ¦è„‘éšœ fan nao zhang/jian si è§�æ€�) and obstruction based on doubt (æ‰€çŸ¥éšœsuo zhi zhang). Ananda was heavy on affliction, so He did not reached 4th stage arahat. However Ananda was light on doubt, ie He can see things as they really are(Kan poçœ‹ç ´). So Ananda had difficulty renoucing(fang xiaæ”¾ä¸‹) than Purna. Purna is directly opposite. Purna was light on affliction and heavy on doubt obstruction. So Purna could let go easily. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">note also enlightenment is like onion peeling. got layers by layers of deepening. from intial enlightenment to Full enlightenment. there are different situation between æ­£æ‚Ÿ(True Enlightenment) and è§£æ‚Ÿ(understanding form of enlightenment).</p>
