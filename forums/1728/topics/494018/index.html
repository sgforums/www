              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And other strategies for
              self-help</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Noelle Oxenhandler WINTER
              2015 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              years ago when a friend of mine was going through a very painful divorce, a
              neighbor dropped off a basket of items with a gift tag marked “For Self-Care.”
              I happened to be visiting when my friend discovered the basket on her doorstep,
              and I watched as she opened the accompanying handmade card: “Take a bubble
              bath,” she read aloud. “Sip a glass of wine while watching the sunset. Curl up
              with a good book. Meditate—”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Somehow
              I knew the next word was going to be “Masturbate,” and when I spoke it before
              she did, we both burst out laughing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              I myself have found both comfort and counsel in the realm of self-help, there’s
              often something in the language that makes me cringe—and it was present in the
              gift basket. As my friend read the list of tips, I recognized that utterly
              bland yet emphatic voice of authority, dispensing its one-size-fits-all advice
              without any regard to a hierarchy of value, as if getting a brow wax or a
              pedicure really was equivalent to forgiving your enemy or volunteering to work
              at a homeless shelter. Feeling blue? Pamper yourself. Get a facial. Treat
              yourself to a new set of towels. Organize your closet. Join a walkathon to help
              combat a disease of your choice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              no coincidence that lists have a special place in the literature of self-help.
              After all, the very ground of self-help is a Can-Do approach to life, and if
              you’re a Can-Do kind of a guy or gal, then you’ve got to go around and collect
              your strategies. Once you’ve collected them, it’s like being a child with a bag
              of Halloween candy: you’ve got to sort through your stash, counting out the
              Tootsie Rolls, the gummy worms and licorice coils. Even the titles of a lot of
              self-help books entice us with their magical numbers: the Seven Habits, the
              Four</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Agreements,
              the Six Pillars of Self-Esteem. Once my sister and I discovered a book that had
              been left behind in a rented cabin in the redwoods, and we read it avidly from
              cover to cover. The book was about finding your soul mate, and it included a
              list of some 100 ways to conduct your search. Of all the tips (“Take your
              laptop to the local coffee shop,” “Strike up a conversation at the
              laundromat”), our favorite was “Organize a parade.” Now, whenever one of us is
              feeling stuck, she is apt to tell the other, “Why don’t you just go out and
              organize a parade?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Stuckness,
              in its myriad forms, is the raison d’être of self-help. Whether you’re stuck in
              the muck of low self-esteem, addiction, dysfunctional relationships, financial
              insecurity, or a chronically cluttered house, you can reach for the ladder of a
              list and pull yourself up, rung by rung. Meditate, masturbate, organize a
              parade. . . . There’s something in the very nature of a list, with its simple
              trust in the power of addition, its optimistic belief in mobile, open-ended
              experimentation (“Try this! Now this!”) that offers itself as antidote to the
              fixed, consistent nature of stuckness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              easy to make fun of the fluid, flexible approach that is so apt to yield a
              willy-nilly list of tips. But it’s sobering to contemplate the other end of the
              spectrum. Whenever a friend of mine complained of boredom as a child, his
              mother always gave him the same response: Gey klop kop af vant. Go bang your
              head against the wall. It was a Yiddish phrase that his mother’s parents had
              recited to her and that doubtless her grandparents had recited to them, for who
              knows how many generations back in the old country. Perhaps, in its origins, it
              was meant to shock an idle child into realizing that in the harsh conditions of
              the shetl, boredom is a luxury. Whatever the case, in its resignation, its
              blunt refusal to generate any more than one utterly futile, self-punishing
              strategy—which is really not a strategy at all but rather a comically absurd
              gesture of frustration—it represents the very opposite of self-help. Feeling stuck,
              are you? Then make yourself stuck-er. Feeling bored? Then stand in one place
              and bore your head into the wall. The wall is hard. Your head is hard. Life is
              hard. Get over it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the face of such steadfast helplessness, why not reach for a ladder of strategies?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Then
              again, before reaching quite so quickly for the nearest rung above, we might
              choose to pause for a moment. And in that pause we might discover or remember
              that when we feel stuck in the muck of our lives, there is another approach we
              could take. It’s the one evoked by William Butler Yeats in his poem “The Circus
              Animals’ Desertion,” which ends with these lines:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              must lie down where all the ladders start </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              lines are so beautiful, with their stately rhythm and perfect rhyme, but their
              dose of truth, if we really try to absorb it, is actually quite galling. To lie
              down in the foul shop of the heart is to abandon all strategy, all effort to
              exert control over the muck of our experience. Could there be anything more
              terrifying—not only to sink into the muck itself but to refrain from our
              habitual attempts to rescue ourselves, and instead let ourselves feel its
              distinct texture, weight, ooze, and odor?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              if only we don’t rush too quickly to pull ourselves up and out, there’s an
              extraordinary joy that can come to us here, a most rare kind of comfort. It’s
              the comfort of coming into contact—if only for a moment—with the unconditioned,
              with life as it is without all our fears and preferences, our compulsions to
              make it conform to some image that we hold in the mind. Isn’t this what
              meditation is really about?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Long
              ago, at the start of my Zen practice, a young monk told me: It doesn’t really
              matter how happy we are. It was evening, and we were standing under a circle of
              pines in a monastery in the mountains of northern California, and I’ve never
              forgotten the explosion of happiness that I experienced in that moment.
              Throughout my childhood and adolescence, my mother often asked me: “Why can’t
              you ever be content?” My whole life I’d been striving to manipulate my
              experience in order to achieve some set of conditions, some state of mind that
              nearly always eluded me. Now I felt I could let go of that effort. I still
              remember looking up at the face of the monk, and seeing through the pines the
              white gleam of a volcanic peak that suddenly looked as though it too was about
              to explode with happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              the poet Antonio Machado tells us, there are four things that are no good at
              sea: rudder, anchor, oars, and the fear of going down. Upon hearing the monk’s
              words under the circle of pines, I think that’s what happened: at least for a
              moment, I stopped groping for any possible list of tools or strategies and
              simply let myself be at sea. That might be the flaw that afflicts much of the
              literature of self-help: an inability or refusal to acknowledge the sea, the
              utterly untameable vastness out of which we emerge and into which we inevitably
              return, no matter how rich, gorgeous, successful, powerful, and clutter-free
              we’ve managed to become in our earthly lives. Which is to say: no matter how
              many oars we’ve managed to carve for ourselves, impelled by our fear of
              drowning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              yet . . .</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              doubt there’s ever been a single sea-, river-, or lake-faring people on earth
              who didn’t treat the paddle or the oar as an object of grave consequence and
              great reverence. We do need our tools, our strategies, our tips for successful
              living. And if we don’t properly collect them and organize them, then we become
              like Silly Jack in the fairy tale who gets everything wrong, who can’t see that
              every context requires its own method, and who thus creates waste, chaos, and
              suffering for himself and others as he melts the butter that he tries to carry
              on his head in the sun and kills the puppy that he wraps in cool, wet leaves.
              As Chögyam Trungpa says, “don’t put your shoes on your head as a visor.” To
              live with skill and grace in the phenomenal world requires exquisite precision.
              For the great equation has two halves: Form is emptiness. And emptiness is also
              form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Driving
              to work some time ago, I turned on the radio and my car filled with a male
              voice, speaking in a language that I couldn’t even begin to recognize, in
              syllables full of breath and urgency. Somehow I could tell that what he was
              saying was a matter of life and death for him, and at the end of the program, I
              learned that it was a recording of Ishi, known as “the last wild Indian,” the
              man who, in 1911, had stumbled half-naked and starving into the light of day
              near the town of Oroville, California. In the voice that had suddenly entered
              my car, he was describing how to carve an arrowhead.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              don’t know if I can put into words how this moved me. He was imparting the most
              necessary means of survival for his people, though his people had been wiped
              from the face of the earth, and though even the language he spoke was on the
              brink of extinction. He who has ears to hear, let him hear, his voice conveyed,
              as it uttered the words without waver or wobble. The sound of his voice
              reminded me that in ancient traditions, there’s no room to be snobby about
              practical knowledge, and there is awe for the most humble instruments and
              techniques that sustain life: the digging sticks bequeathed by the god of corn,
              the recipe for corn cakes passed on by the corn maiden. When scholars
              deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls, they found inextricably interwoven in its
              theology a trove of tips for maintaining personal hygiene in a land with little
              water. And at a bar mitzvah I once attended, when it came time for the 13-year-old
              boy to recite his passage of Torah, we listened to the Hebrew words of an
              ancient building code that gave us precise directions for setting stones and
              spacing lintels.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Render
              unto God what is God’s and to Caesar what is Caesar’s, the New Testament tells
              us in the parable of the coin. But isn’t it amazing when the two sides of the
              coin merge, when God turns into Caesar and Caesar into God so quickly that you
              can’t tell which end is up? I’ve had moments when the most apparently
              metaphysical, even radically esoteric teachings have become like the most
              down-to-earth instructions, when the words of the Heart Sutra turn into a GPS
              saying “Go right. Now go left.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Between
              banging one’s head against the wall and rushing out to organize a parade, there
              is a middle way. Walking this middle way, I need to remember that for all of us
              there comes a time when oars fail, when there is nothing left to do but
              surrender to the great unknown. When this time comes—if we’re lucky enough to
              find a friend at the threshold with a basket of gifts—who can say what will
              matter most: a lighted stick of incense, a massage, an ice chip for our lips,
              or a voice chanting, “No suffering! No death!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Someone
              asked me recently if I had any tips for maintaining calm and adapting to
              change, “even if I can’t meditate frequently.” This reminded me of one of my
              big questions in life: “How can I get fit and strong without exercising?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              moment was an epiphany. I saw, in a flash, the lure of the self-help
              culture—the promise that everything can be made easy, a piece of cake. All you
              need is the right tip.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              here’s the catch with tips. If you want to improve your golf stroke, or buy a
              cheaper airline ticket, or find the best tacos in town—go ahead, ask around for
              a tip. If you’re attempting something more ambitious—say, how to adapt to
              change—a tip isn’t going to cut it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Think
              about the weight loss wing of the self-help industry. The tips keep coming, the
              industry flourishes, we lose some pounds, gain back what we lost plus a few
              more, and go back for the next tip. How we eat, how we react to life’s
              pinpricks and tectonic shake-ups—these are well-worn grooves in our minds and
              we can resist them for only so long. We expect the power of will to—poof!—make
              us perfect, yet willpower is an unreliable and limited source of energy. We
              return defeated to the old ways, with deeper disappointment in ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              truth is that changing a habitual way of being is a huge challenge. Rome wasn’t
              built in a day; neither is calm. Rome wasn’t built with twigs; calm isn’t built
              with tips. It’s not that we can’t help ourselves: We can learn to maintain
              calm, to roll with change when change rolls in. We just have to acknowledge,
              even honor, the scale of the adventure before us. It requires nothing less than
              rewiring our own brain. Or rather, allowing the mind to be rewired by mind
              training—by meditation. It untangles us. Gradually it replaces ancient
              patterned reactions with fresh and appropriate responses. This is why it’s
              called practice. It takes time and effort, but to an amazing extent we find
              ourselves helped.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practice
              changes our relationship to what would otherwise be upsetting. Facing change,
              we see how futile and painful it is to try to hold on to what is passing—which
              is everything. Compassion washes in with a kinder, truer understanding of why
              people do what they do (and that includes you). Things seem simpler, easier.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              self-help mentality is a matter of shopping, accumulating tips. We don’t have
              to go shopping. We just need to sit back and let practice work on us. We don’t
              need tips; we need patience, we need equanimity. How to develop these
              qualities? I have a great tip for you: Meditate! Start now, continue forever!</span></p>
