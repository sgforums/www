              primordial, the manifestation and the source of the universe
              (self/world). In Dogen's writings, which maintain a particularly strict (radical?)
              adherence to the principles of nonduality, dharmas (objective or subjective)
              are always viewed and treated as qualitatively equal in regard to the
              significance of their reality, importance, value, and meaning
              - a dream, a concept, and a fleeting thought are as real, important, valuable,
              and meaningful as a pebble, a cup, a scripture, and a solar system. </span></div>

              organs (with eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body) and "thoughts" as

              the notion of "objects" (dharmas); all "the myriad dharmas"
              amount to (and only to) "six objects of consciousness" (sights,

              divisions between objective and subjective dharmas are recognized as conceptual
              conveniences, not metaphysical or literal facts. Thus, to say that dharmas
              constitute the fundamental elements of reality, is simply to acknowledge that
              they cannot be analyzed into "more fundamental" elements - in this
              context dharmas can be discussed "as if" separate entities, only by
              accounting for their interdependence and stressing the import of maintaining a
              conscious understanding that dharmas are impervious to generalization,
              classification, and categorization, as well as literal description or
              definition. For, according to the principles of nonduality (i.e.
              nonduality/duality) each dharma is recognized as a coextensive realization or
              exemplification that is both nondual and dual - each dharma is one with all
              things (nondual; indistinct and undifferentiated) and unique, one-and-only
              instance of existence-time (uji) (dual; a distinct element, one <em>of </em>the
              many). The nonduality/duality of "nonduality" is the true nature of
              dharmas that is often designated in Buddhism as "thusness" (immo).
              "Thusness" is the "as it is" reality of dharmas.</span></span></span></div>

              the nonduality of dharmas (i.e. nonduality/duality) can be generally understood
              thus: "the "nonduality" aspect of dharmas is their unequivocal
              real existence (ontology) in/as the universe (i.e. the totality of
              existence-time); and: the "duality" aspect of dharmas is their
              irreplaceable uniqueness, their one-and-only place-moment (dharma-position)
              in/as the universe (which is what makes them impervious to classification,
              literal definition, etc). The Buddhist recognition of the "thusness"
              of dharmas, then, is recognition of the <em>inherent denial</em> of any <em>likeness</em> among dharmas adequate for precisely accurate comparability; a dharma <em>is</em> exactly <em>as it is</em> - it <em>is not</em> exactly like any other dharma</span>. </span></span></div>

              of "Indian Naturalism" (particularly the "Senika School"),
              for instance, Dogen outlines the obstructive potential of views or theories
              that posit (or imply) a noumenal nature or aspect of dharmas. Thus, the
              affirmation that "dharmas are <em>always</em> phenomenal" is
              followed-up with the assertion that "dharmas are <em>never</em> </span><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN">noumenal</span></span><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 10pt;'><span style="font-size: small;">." In expressing the obvious - an
              obvious <em>negative</em> at that - this assertion may seem superfluous, but its
              significance is important in light of certain notions prevalent in Dogen's day,
              as well as within the contemporary Zen community.</span> </span></span></div>

              notions that make it important to understand dharmas "<em>are not </em>noumenon"
              primarily involve views on the nature and role of language, thinking, and
              reason in Zen practice-enlightenment. More specifically, within the
              contemporary Zen community the prevailing views - which are variable and
              indistinct, thus more accurately "general notions" - that regard language,
              thinking, and reason as <em>less important</em> or <em>inferior</em> to other
              aspects of practice-enlightenment (particularly seated meditation; i.e. zazen,
              shikantaza, etc.). Not infrequently, such notions go beyond views of
              inferiority and demonstrate a tendency to see language, thinking, and reason as
              <em>nonessential</em>, <em>dispensable</em>, or even as <em>hindrances</em> to Zen
              practice-enlightenment.</span></span></span></div>

              especially the more extreme forms, are rarely explicitly stated. First, most of
              those holding such views are doing so unconsciously (or largely so); second,
              when such notions are explicitly articulated they tend to collapse rapidly due
              to their inherent lack of logic as well as their failure to harmonize with
              Buddhist principles. They fail to harmonize with Buddhist principles because
              they are inherently dualistic. The inherent dualism of such notions is
              sometimes extremely subtle, not only because it is expressed in vague or
              ambiguous language (implicit rather than explicit), but also because it is
              typically couched in terms of "nonduality." Thus, it is crucial to
              understand that dharmas are "not noumenal" in order to see through,
              avoid, or overcome wrong views (dualistic notions) that are largely unconscious,
              often subtle, widespread, and possessed of the power to obstruct accurate
              understanding (not to mention authentic practice-enlightenment).</span></span></span></div>

              discussing this relationship between the self and all beings. He is pointing
              out that we like things we think are useful, meaningful, or valuable, but we
              dislike or ignore things that do not suit us. This evaluation occurs within the
              relationship between self and the myriad dharmas, but there is no such
              dichotomy within the reality of the myriad dharmas. Within the relationship
              between self and all beings, there is good and bad, positive and negative,
              right and wrong. We don't really see the myriad dharmas as they are. We think
              about things we encounter and name them, assign value to them, and put them
              into categories such as good and bad, valuable or worthless, likable or
              unlikable. Our life is actually formed by what we encounter because we create
              our own world of likes and dislikes based on how we categorize the things we
              meet. Within this world of likes and dislikes, we do not perceive the myriad
              dharmas as they really are. Things we like and things we hate look bigger than
              they are, and things we are not interested in become small or invisible to us.
              The world we live in is the world we create based on how our mind encounters
              the myriad dharmas, We cannot prevent our mind from creating our world as it
              does, but it is possible to realize that the world of our creation does not
              reflect true reality.</span></span></strong></div>

              we dislike them. Conveying oneself towards all things to carry out

              this is one teacher's interpretation of one passage of one fascicle of one
              writing by Dogen - thus it should not be considered as a full or accurate
              indication of Shohaku Okumura's views, much less Dogen's; that is not our
              purpose in citing it. What this passage does present is an unusually explicit
              account of a subtle form of dualism common to the general view we been
              discussing. As mentioned, there are many variations of this view, thus this
              passage should not be taken as representing a "universal view" of the
              contemporary Zen community or even the Soto Zen community. Nevertheless, it is
              my experience that the basic notion expressed here generally accords with the
              views held by a majority of contemporary Zen practitioners, especially those
              identified with Soto Zen.</span></span></span></div>

              comments diverge from the classic Zen teachings on a number of points - all of
              which are grounded on the dualistic presupposition succinctly revealed in his
              statement, <em>"We don't really see the myriad dharmas as they are."</em> This statement presupposes the same subtle form of dualism found in a variety
              of common "Zen" expressions like, "The true nature of reality
              cannot be perceived," "The forms we see are illusory," "The
              'appearance' of things is <em>relative</em> (or provisional) while their
              'essential nature' (emptiness) is <em>absolute</em>" (i.e. ultimate, real),
              "The world we perceive is not thusness as is," etc.</span> </span></span></div>

              inherent to all such statements (i.e. dualism), and there are two traits that
              reveal this flaw; first, its violation of a basic Buddhist principle, second,
              the speciousness of its basis. In the first case, for Okumura's assertion to be
              true there would have to be more than one reality (a "false" one we
              see, and a "real" one we don't see) - this would violate the Buddhist
              teaching of emptiness which unequivocally refutes the existence of independent
              entities. The second case presents a two-fold problem; a) the failure to
              account for or explain <em>what</em> or <em>where</em> "the <em>real </em>reality"
              (that we don't see) is, and, b) the failure to account for or explain how it
              is, or what means were used to <em>attain</em> or <em>acquire</em> the "<em>knowledge</em> of a reality" that "we <em>don't</em> or <em>can't</em> really see"
              - in short, how is/was it<em> perceived</em> that things "are not" <em>as</em> "they are" perceived? If they were truly "not as perceived"
              then "<em>perceiving</em> that truth" would <em>instantly disprove</em> that very proposition.</span></span></div>

              let's look a little closer at Okumura's expression. He speaks about a
              "relationship" between "the self and all beings"
              (synonymously with the "self and the myriad dharmas"). Next, he goes
              on to explain that we "don't really see the myriad dharmas as they
              are" because an "evaluation occurs" within this relationship
              that ultimately results in "the world we create" which "does not
              reflect true reality." This "evaluation" is described as a
              process in which we "think about things we encounter and name them, assign
              value" etc.</span></span></div>

              what could this "relationship" consist of? According to Buddhism the
              "self" (experiencer) and "all beings" or "myriad
              dharmas" (experienced) are not two different things - each depends on and
              is dependent on by the other. Also recall that "thoughts" (including
              "evaluations") are regarded as one of the six kinds of "myriad
              dharmas." If this "evaluation occurs" as Okumura contends, then
              this evaluation itself must be qualified as a dharma - <em>as it is</em> - an
              expression of Buddha-nature. All dharmas are dharmas - as they are; thus Dogen
              often points out the Buddha-nature expressed as "doubt,"
              "fear," and "surprise," even "wrong views" are
              real manifestations of Buddha-nature; a wrong view is, as it is, a wrong view.</span></span><span> </span></span></div>

              includes the phrase asserting "there is no such dichotomy within the
              reality of the myriad dharmas." Why say this? This is a good example of
              what we mentioned earlier about dualistic views being couched in terms of
              nonduality; here <em>it sounds as if</em> "self and other" are being
              recognized as "nondual," while <em>in fact</em> they are actually <em>being
              merged into one</em> thing (or nothing). In failing to account for the
              distinction (not separation) between self and other, this
              "explanation" amounts to a casual dismissal of the <em>infinite
              variety</em> of the universe, the <em>multitudinous array</em> that make the
              dharmas "<em>myriad</em>" rather than "<em>uniform</em>." Dogen
              explains the basic fallacy of this view is based on a misunderstanding of the
              Buddhist teaching that "all things are empty." Rather than
              recognizing that this means "all things - as they are - are empty,"
              they mistakenly think that "all things - despite or behind appearances -
              are empty." In short, they think that the "emptiness (non-form)"
              of things is separate from the "form (non-emptiness) of things."
              Dogen explains this, for instance, in <em>Shobogenzo, Kenbutsu:</em> </span></div>

              "conscious subjects"). This necessarily implies that our (subjective)
              self is also an independent entity. This is a clear violation of the basic
              Buddhist principle that regards dharmas as nondual essence/form unties. In Zen,
              all forms (all six types of objects) are real, as they are - <em>and their

              and have forgotten all about the profound and the wondrous as well, then
              dualities will no longer arise, and they will experience the Truth that the
              Buddha promised them.</span></strong></div>

              the same subtle dualism inherent in the view expressed by Shohaku Okumura. It
              is doubtful that such a superficial view was really expressed by Daie Soko.
              Nevertheless, it is the <em>view</em>, not Daie, that Dogen is concerned with;
              and the way the view is voiced here captures the essential nature of the
              fallacy at the heart of even the most sophisticated forms of dualism. First,
              this view presents an almost perfect subversion of Dogen's own, as his comments
              make perfectly clear:</span></div>

              he was still unaware of the silken thread that binds the Buddhas and Ancestors
              together, nor had he comprehended what the lifeline of the Buddhas and
              Ancestors is. Accordingly, he only understood 'mind' to refer to discriminative
              thinking and consciousness, so he spoke this way because he had not learned
              that the various functions, such as discriminative thinking and consciousness,
              are what the intellective mind is. He wrongly viewed 'nature' to mean something
              that is abundantly clear and peacefully inactive, and did not understand
              whether Buddha Nature and the nature of all thoughts and things existed or did
              not exist. And because he had not seen his True Nature as It is, not even in
              his dreams, he had a false view of what Buddha Dharma is. The 'mind' that the
              Buddhas and Ancestors spoke of is the very Skin and Flesh, Bones and Marrow.
              And the 'nature' that the Buddhas and Ancestors have preserved is a monk's
              traveling staff and the shaft of a bamboo arrow. The Buddhas and Ancestors have
              profoundly realized the Buddhahood promised Them by the Buddha, and this is
              what is meant by being a pillar of the temple or a stone lantern. How wondrous
              it is that the Buddhas and Ancestors hold up and offer to us Their wise
              discernment and understanding!</span></strong></div>

              a teacher that "wrongly viewed 'nature' to mean something that is
              abundantly clear and peacefully inactive" makes us wonder what he might
              say of contemporary teachers that advocate "letting go of thoughts"
              or "just sitting without goals" (often appealing to the authority of
              "Dogen" as they do so!).] </span></div>

              enough, but it is worth stressing his emphasis that "the various
              functions" of mind are<em> just what the </em>"mind is" - as it is
              (thusness). Dogen's point, then, is that the very <em>substance</em> of the
              myriad dharmas is <em>our experience</em> - as it is- of them. The directly
              perceived image or form of a thing (<em>dharma</em>) is the thing <em>itself</em>.
              "An idea" is really "an idea" as it is, "an abstract
              concept" is true nature totally exerting itself as "an abstract
              concept."</span></div>
              <br>
              <div style="margin: 0in 0.1in 0pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;'><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span></span></div>

              notion" we have been discussing is grounded in the same misunderstanding
              that caused Dogen to say Daie "did not understand whether Buddha Nature
              and the nature of all thoughts and things existed or did not exist."
              Notwithstanding the fact that many contemporary Zen teachers do not know the
              meaning of "Buddha nature" or "the nature of all thoughts and
              things" or even whether they exist or not, there is no reason for any genuine
              Zen practitioner to fail to verify it. Apart from "the nature of all
              thoughts and things" what is "Buddha nature"? Apart from
              "discriminative thinking and consciousness" what is "mind"? </span></div>

              particularity, specificity, and uniqueness of things (<em>dharmas</em>) is far more
              important than their uniformity, equality, or mutual identity. So here are some
              juicy bits to get that Dharma-Eye lighted up:</span></div>

              previously doubted is the same as what they may now have doubts about, for
              doubts themselves are merely "just for the moment" kinds of time, and

              deliberate acts, becoming aware of things, and so forth, are also inseparable
              from the One Whole Mind. Since the darkness of ignorance is inseparable from
              cessation, then deliberate acts, becoming aware of things, and so forth, are
              also inseparable from cessation. Since the darkness of ignorance is inseparable
              from nirvana, deliberate acts, becoming aware of things, and so forth, are also

              set in motion by the flowering of the Dharma", we are referring to the
              mind's wandering off onto deluded paths. And the mind's delusive wandering,
              accordingly, refers to what is set in motion by the flowering of the Dharma.
              That is to say, our mind's wandering off is precisely what is set in motion by
              the Dharma's flowering. What this means is that, even though the mind's
              delusions are synonymous with the myriad thoughts and things that arise, the
              form their True Nature takes is what is aroused by the flowering of the Dharma.
              This "being set in motion" is not something to rejoice in, or watch
              for, or obtain, or arrive at; even so, what the Dharma's flowering sets in motion
              is precisely "neither two things nor three". Since the flowering of
              the Dharma is our having only One Vehicle to Buddhahood, because it is the
              flowering of the form of things as they really are, we speak of "being
              able to set in motion what moves". Even so, it is just the One Vehicle to
              Buddhahood, just the One Great Matter for which we train, just the ever-moving
              about of the mind as it is, and nothing more. So, do not reproach yourself for
              your mind's delusions. As the Scripture says, "Whatever is done by you is
              the way of bodhisattvas," and "The fundamental practice of the
              Bodhisattva Way is our serving and paying homage to all the Buddhas." Our
              opening up to this Way, manifesting It, awakening to It, and entering It are,
              all together, what is set in motion by the Dharma's flowering each and every
              time. There are our delusions about what is within the burning house, and our
              delusions about being at the threshold of the gate, and our delusions about
              what lies outside the gate, and our delusions about what being on the other
              side of the gate is like, and our delusions about being within the gate.
              Because, in our delusion, we give rise to such notions as "being within
              the gate" and "being beyond the gate", to say nothing of
              "being at the threshold of the gate" and "being within a burning
              house", we will, of necessity, open up to It, manifest It, awaken to It,
              and enter It whilst upon the cart drawn by the White Ox.</span></strong></div>
