              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The
              Buddha offers more than a dozen convincing arguments against racism in a
              conversation with the brahmins of his day who saw themselves as superior to
              others. These arguments focus on the lack of any real biological or
              psychological distinction between people of different castes, and point to
              social convention as the more obvious source of prejudice. You can read about
              this in the <em>Assalayana Sutta </em>(<em>Middle Length Discourse</em> 93), but
              most people these days hardly need convincing of something so evident.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">We do
              face the more challenging problem of how first to uncover the socially
              constructed prejudices we all harbor and then to transform them, not at this
              level of intellectual argument but at the deeper level of changing emotional
              and behavioral responses. It is not about changing views (the aggregate of <em>perception</em>),
              but of reconstructing patterns of habitual reaction (the aggregate of <em>formations</em>).
              Fortunately, the Buddha bequeathed to us a powerful tool for doing this:
              mindfulness.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Psychology
              has demonstrated clearly that some of what we do is conscious and some is
              unconscious. That is to say, we are consciously aware of a narrow band of our
              experience as it unfolds, but most of what happens is formulated out of view
              and emerges apparently on its own from the mysterious depths of the psyche to
              surge into behavior unhindered by awareness. Our views and reactions are formed
              as they appear, based on patterns laid down in the past, and consciousness is
              more a matter of observing what is already unfolding than of deciding what will
              take place.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Mindfulness
              practice involves training the ability to observe what is happening within us
              in the present moment with an attitude of patience, kindness, and equanimity.
              As different bodily sensations or feeling tones or thoughts arise into
              conscious awareness, we “watch along with” (<em>anupassati</em>) them, or “gaze
              evenly upon” (<em>upekkhati</em>) them, or are simply “aware of” (<em>pajanati</em>)
              and “fully experience” (<em>patisamvedati</em>) them. If we get angry at what we
              see, or if any sort of response rooted in attraction or aversion occurs, then
              we are thrust out of mindful awareness and get carried away by an unhealthy
              emotional response. Eventually we may notice that this is happening and return
              the attention gently back to observing without judgment.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">This is
              familiar territory to meditators. Now let’s see how this might scale from the
              realm of internal personal experience to a collective—even global—practice of
              mindfulness. When something is caught on video and then digitally shared with a
              universal audience, this can be seen as bringing to conscious awareness what
              might otherwise remain unknown and unknowable to all but the immediate
              participants. The Web is our collective mind, and the media sites that allow
              millions to see what one person has recorded can be regarded as supporting an
              emerging form of global meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">Witnessing
              an atrocity, observing injustice in action, or otherwise directly encountering
              the things that have historically been invisible is a way of shining the light
              of awareness into the dark corners of our world—much as meditation shines a
              light into the unexamined shadows of our mind. But the collective challenge is
              as daunting as the individual one: how do we bring patience, kindness, and
              equanimity to what we see instead of having it trigger and release the
              reservoirs of anger and hatred lurking within that are so ready and eager to
              erupt?</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">It is
              natural for fury to arise in the face of injustice, natural because our psyches
              are inhabited by primitive instincts adapted to survival at almost any cost.
              Anger is empowering, and conventional wisdom tells us that righteous anger is
              justified in such circumstances and is even necessary to move the mountains of
              discrimination, exploitation, and disrespect that perpetuate injustice. This
              may be true, but is it therefore the healthiest way to proceed? The Buddha was
              pointing us in a different direction. He encouraged us to acknowledge such
              feelings, but to then let go of them and respond instead with compassion and
              wisdom. Yes, laws and attitudes need to be changed, but how do we do that
              without harming ourselves in the process?</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">The
              challenge and promise of mindfulness practice is not simply to become aware of
              things, but to do so with a particular attitude or emotional tone—one that is
              confident, benevolent, mindful, ethical, tranquil, equanimous. It does no good
              and some harm to blame yourself for your attention wandering off the breath, or
              to get annoyed at the person behind you for coughing, or to resent the fact
              that a pain is arising in your knee. In just the same way, it is not helpful
              and can make things worse to erupt in hatred toward the mob that stones an
              innocent woman, the officer that shoots an unarmed black man, or the fanatic
              who executes a helpless captive. The <em>object</em> of awareness may be
              reprehensible, but the <em>attitude</em> with which we are aware of it is a
              different matter and shapes who we are and what will happen next. All the great
              reformers of our time (Gandhi, Mandela, King) knew the importance of this
              distinction and made it a cornerstone of their life’s work.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">One can
              know with <em>wisdom</em> that these acts are deeply wrong, feel unbounded <em>compassion</em> for the victims of the atrocity, conjure up the <em>energy</em> needed to see
              that the perpetrators are brought to justice, and work with <em>determination</em> and even <em>joy</em> to change the conditions enabling such transgressions to
              occur. These are healthy emotions and can be just as effective as their
              unhealthy counterparts. Taking these steps on as a practice, either when
              examining our own inner prejudices or when exposing the injustices of the
              world, marks the difference between being swept along on the flood and working
              against the stream.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">As the
              Buddha put it in several verses from the <em>Samyutta Nikaya</em> (11.4):</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">It is
              always a big mistake, <br> to return anger for anger. <br> Not giving anger for anger, <br> one wins a double victory.</span></p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">One
              behaves for the good of both: <br> oneself and the other person. <br> Knowing well the other’s anger, one <br> is mindful and remains calm.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="p12"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; ">In this
              way one is healing both: <br> oneself and the other person.<br> The people who think “What a fool!” <br> just don’t understand the dhamma.</span></p>

              <p>Now the reason why the Buddha is worth liking is less about His race.
