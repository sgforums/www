              Friends:
              
              Acutely Aware is Aloof, Above, and at Ease!
              
              
              
              Once the Blessed One was staying at VesÄ�li in AmbapÄ�li's grove.
              There and then, he taught the Bhikkhus in this very way:
              Bhikkhus a Noble Friend should remain: Aware and Settled!
              
              And how does a Noble remain Aware? 
              In this: Such Noble Friend sees any Body as just a frame of materiality
              - a mere transient physical form - thereby keeping any lust and rejection 
              arisen for and of this world under firm control. Aroused, composed, &amp; alert.
              Such Noble Friend sees any Feeling as just a reaction to sense contact
              - a mere short-lived mental response - thereby keeping any desire &amp; aversion 
              arisen for this world under firm control. Just eager, calm and clear.
              Such Noble Friend sees any Mentality as just a passing set of moods
              - a mere ever-changing complex habitual mental formation - thereby keeping 
              any craving and anger arisen from this world under firm control, by being
              keen, balanced and attentive.
              Such Noble Friend sees any phenomenon as just a fleeting experience 
              - a mere blinking appearance of a momentary mental state - thereby keeping 
              any attraction and repulsion arisen from this world under firm control by 
              remaining aloof, above, at ease while acutely aware. Thus is a Noble Aware...
              
               
              
              And how does a Noble remain Settled?
              In this: When going out, &amp; when returning such Friend is continuously
              settled in awareness of exactly that relocationâ€¦
              When looking forward, &amp; when gazing backward such Noble Friend is
              continuously settled in awareness of just exactly that seeingâ€¦
              When bending a leg, &amp; when stretching an arm such Noble Friend is
              continuously settled in awareness of only exactly that movementâ€¦
              When wearing a robe, &amp; when bearing a bowl such Noble Friend is
              continuously settled in awareness of exactly that presence...
              When eating, when drinking, when chewing, when tasting, and
              when swallowing such Noble Friend is continuously settled in
              awareness of exactly that eating processâ€¦
              When using the toilet, when walking, standing, sitting, lying, sleeping,
              waking up, speaking, and when keeping silent such Noble Friend is
              continuously settled in awareness of exactly that activity...
              Thus is a Noble Settled...Â  
              A Bhikkhu should remain Aware and Settled, Bhikkhus. 
              This is our instruction to you.
              
               
              
              Comments. 
              Unfailing Continuity of clear Awareness is the crucial issue here!
              That settled unfailing Awareness of all moments as they pass by mind 
              flickering in time, can disable and eliminate the otherwise domineering 
              autopilot and always pleasure-seeking monkey-mind! 
              Black-hole non-awareness should noted in these common daily situations:
              "Oops where did I put my keys?", "Ach, I forgot my umbrella there... again!"
              
              Illustrative Story:
              A Zen monk once sought a teacher living in the mountains. When he
              reached his hut, he quickly entered after leaving his sandals outside.
              After his reverential bowing, but before he could make any request,
              this teacher asked him: 
              "To which side of the door did you put your sandals outside?"
              Stunned by the fact that he could not remember this trivial fact,
              he realized just there on the very spot, that establishing unfailing
              continuous awareness was an essential requirement, he yet had to
              fulfill... He stayed therefore for years on this mountain with that 
              well seeing teacher to do exactly that!

              <p>Thoughts are like clouds. They are not good or bad. Your job is not to judge the thoughts.</p>

              <p>Yes it's best to find a teacher, but you don't need to wait to start looking right now. Your own Mind is your birth-right, nobody can give it to you or give you permission to look at it right now.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm">http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The big mind of pure awareness is a no-man's-land--a free, open reality 
                  without reference points, property boundaries, or trail markers. Although it cannot 
                  be grasped as an object by focal attention, it is not an article of faith. Quite 
                  the contrary, in the words of a Tibetan text, "The nothingness in question 
                  is actually experienceable" (Guenther 1959, 54). Unfortunately, when the 
                  untutored mind regards it as a mere blankness or nothingness, the jewel-like radiance 
                  of this pure awareness becomes obscured. As Dzogchen teacher Tenzin Wangyal (1997, 
                  29) points out:</strong><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>The gap between two thoughtsis essence. But if in that gap 
                  there is a lack of presence, it becomes ignorance and we experience only a lack 
                  of awareness, almost an unconsciousness. If there is presence in the gap, then 
                  we experience the dharmakaya [the ultimate]. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The essence of meditation could 
                  be described quite simply, in Tenzin Wangyal's words, as "presence in the 
                  gap"--as an act of nondual, unitive knowing that reveals the ground of being 
                  in what at first appears to be nothing at all. As another Tibetan text (Guenther 
                  1956, 269) explains, "The foundation of sentient beings is without roots. 
                  . . . And this rootlessness is the root of enlightenment." Only in the groundless 
                  ground of being can the dance of reality unfold in all its luminous clarity.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Here's another translation by the same venerable: "<span style="font-weight: bold;">4: Phenomena as made up of and manifested by momentary mental states ..."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See if this is not true. All our sense-perceptions and 
                                                                          thoughts, are really momentary, mental states arising and fading... we 
                                                                          think what we perceive are truly existing objects, and that mind is the 'I', the perceiver, of those objects... but there can be no knowing 
                                                                          without the sense faculty and the object, there is no such thing as a 'knowing' without something being known - even if that object is a mental object... it just wouldn't make sense to speak of knowing without something known, so there cannot be knowing apart 
                                                                          from the known in the same way there is no wind apart from the activities of blowing, or a river apart from the activities of flowing... so
                                                                           all that we perceive is simply this fact, this activity and dependently-originated functioning of knowing, 
                                                                          awaring, seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, thinking. Knowing/awareness cannot be separated from the object of knowing, and it cannot be separated from all the causes and conditions that manifest this moment of knowing. Because mind is not some perceiver behind the perceived, everything being perceived is in fact mind, or a mental perception... 'Mind' and 'Awareness' is realized to be simply a label collating the various mental perceptions and modes of consciousness. We realize that in seeing there is just the experience, the vivid mental-perception of seen, without a separate agent or seer.</p>
              <p>And 
                                                                          this fact of awareness, this luminosity, is the essence of all mental 
                                                                          states - without which, nothing at all can be experienced. And this arising consciousness (visual consciousness, ear consciousness, etc etc... up to mental consciousness), depending on our sense faculties and sense objects, does not have an independent existence of its own, so it is a function, a display of dependent origination, so what we see, hear, smell, are really 'constructed mental Appearances' - they are not truly there, independent of the meeting of causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>In truth, there is nothing that is not a moment of mental 
                                                                          perception, much like a dream, and there isn't a true 'I' perceiving 
                                                                          'that'... there is no 'I' apart from this mental perception, so there is
                                                                           simply a vivid mental perception, everything is just a mental 
                                                                          perception, and
                                                                          that mental state is in essence luminous clarity. And it is in nature 
                                                                          void or empty of any substantial substance - it cannot be located as 
                                                                          something inherent or independently existing... certainly the display and the experience cannot be denied, but upon investigation we realize it is just like a dream or a 
                                                                          TV show. Try looking at where a thought arise, abide, and ceases to, and it is discovered that thoughts, like all appearances, are simply a coreless and vivid mental appearances, without an independent existence locatable somewhere. What is constructed, what is dependently originated, turns out to be empty and unborn - there is no independent essence of seeing, hearing, etc to be found or located somewhere... there is no independent essence of mind, of experience, of whatever we see - it is a merely dependently originated mental appearance, that turns out to be empty (yet vivid and luminous). In other words, all constructed mental appearances, like a dream, turns out to be in reality unborn.</p>
              <p>Everything seems very objectively real until you realize that it 
                                                                          is just a mental perception without real substance there! Apart from 
                                                                          being just this shimmering, vivid, and yet empty, transient and 
                                                                          dissolving mental perception... like a shimmering, flickering mirage, a 
                                                                          rainbow, a dream.</p>
              <p>To realize this and abandon all our clingings and false projections of an inherent reality, is liberation.</p>
              <p>If any of this is not clear I can clarify....</p>

              <p>A good example of mental appearance is how our eyes see things around us. We don't actually see the things.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Eyes are organs in your body that detect light, which allows you to see by sending signals to the optic nerve and other areas of your brain. Eyes do not actually see, but they are the medium we use to see through. When rays of light enter our eye, it excites the nerves and sends that message to the brain. The brain is then able to compute what the eye is seeing. Through the eye, we can see darkness, brightness and different colours. When you vary the intensity of the light, you are able to distinguish between colours.</div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">Another good example is the same girl or thing, different people perceive them differently. That is why there is a English proverb  "beauty is in the eye of the beholder", Chinese proverbs  å�„èŠ±å…¥å�„çœ¼ï¼Œæƒ…äººçœ¼é‡Œå‡ºè¥¿æ–½. It is all our perception.<br><br></div>

              <p>So as an example, would it be correct to say...?</p>
              <p>With regards to the eyes and form, the momentary mental states are like quick and successive snapshots of what mind perceives.  Even if the scenery doesn't change, but still the mind is constantly taking snapshots of what's before the eyes.  So every moment actually gives a fresh perception.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, what you said was correct. Many people including me experience mood swings (I try not to "swing" too much nowadays ha ha..). Our moods affect our perceptions. Though it is the same scenery, thing or people, our perception changes according to our mood or other conditions.</p>
              <p>Our Zen master gave a very good example. When we are well and good, many people will try to argue or quarrel with people whom we disagree with but when we are sick and unwell, we can't be bothered to argue or quarrel with anyone because we are not in the mood.</p>

              <p>Everything is a constructed mental state... The six consciousnesses are all mental perceptions (five senses + mind).</p>
              <p>So when the eye meets a visual object, a visual consciousness arises - that means the mental perception of a red flower, for example. We know this is just a mental perception - for example, the dog does not see a red flower, but a black flower instead. If we can see with 'quantum eyesight' we see 99.999% space. So whatever we perceive is simply a Constructed (dependently originated) mental perception according to our karma and conditions. No true independent and objective reality called 'black flower' or 'red flower' could be found apart from the causal conditions that led to that mental perception, that appearance. We think 'redness' is an attribute of an objective reality, yet upon investigation it is discovered to be empty and dependently originated. 'Black flower' and 'red flower' is simply a constructed mental perception.... see if all phenomena are not so.</p>
              <p>As another analogy, if you look at a mirror, you see a reflection of the surroundings... but is the reflection something 'inherently located' inside the mirror? This is not the case, as we know that the function of the mirror is pure potentiality to reflect without a fixed form. The visual perception of the reflection depends on which position you are viewing the mirror from too, for example. So if you walk to another position, another visual perception arises, so we see that every perception is dependently originated, it is a constructed mental perception... it is not something inherent to be found anywhere, inside or outside. Everything is relative to all its causal conditions without independent existence.</p>
              <p>These mental states are constantly fading away... they are impermanent and without substantiality. What arises via conditions, ceases via conditions.</p>
              <p>Do you have some understanding about this now?</p>
              <p>p.s. all the sutras, Heart Sutra, 'Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form' is all talking about this</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>What you spoke is about what is experienced after mental formation. In a sense yes that is true, that our mental formations and conceptualizations varies according to subjective perception, is ever-changing, and therefore they are illusory.</p>

              <p>What you spoke is about what is experienced after mental

              is ever-changing, and therefore they are illusory.</p>

              <p>Yes the cracker is a good analogy. Not only it becomes not a cracker when crushed... even while there is the appearance of a cracker, there is no core of cracker to be found. If there is a core, it should be findable, yet because there is no core, you can split the cracker in any way you want and break it into crumbs.</p>
