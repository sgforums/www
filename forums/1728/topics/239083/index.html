Photo by Gillian Jones/North Adams Transcript Tuesday, February 20</strong><br><br>"They began walking after the events of Sept. 11, 2001," Sister Natalie Cain, director of the Women's House of Peace, said. "They (the Japanese) are still so aware of the effects of nuclear fallout. There are still people alive who survived the atomic bombs. They are aware of the need to awaken the world and stop nuclear warfare."<br><br>As part of this year's "Walk for a new Spring," the Buddhists will visit the cities of each of the 19 Massachusetts mayors who have joined the Mayors for Peace. More than 1,550 mayors worldwide, including Mayor John Barrett III, have committed their cities to stand for the abolition of all nuclear weapons by the year 2020.<br><br>"All of the mayors in Western Massachusetts are Mayors for Peace," Sister Clare, a nun with the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist order out of Leverett, said. "We decided to start here, in North Adams, and travel south for this part of our journey."<br><br>Members of the Nipponzan Myohoji order differ from other Buddhist sects Â— instead of seeking personal salvation or enlightenment, they devote themselves to ridding the world of weapons.<br><br>Sister Clare's order runs the New England Peace Pagoda in Leverett.<br><br>"Nuclear weapons are proliferating around the world," Sister Clare said. "The only real homeland security is to commit to the abolition of nuclear weapons. In a week's time, our walk will bring us to the nuclear power plant (Vermont Yankee) in Vernon, Vt., where we will be calling for it to be closed down."<br><br>As part of the peace walk, which is aimed at finding ways to "root and nourish the power of peace and equity" at the local, national and global levels, people are encouraged to join the group on its walk.<br><br>UNITY program director Mary Parkman said she planned to walk with the monks to St. Mary's Church in Cheshire. She said she was inspired to join the group's walk after learning about it through Cain.<br><br>"I heard Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector, speak at Williams (College) last week," she said. "He made a very believable case for a real possibility of nuclear weapons being used as a result of the Bush administration's policy in the Middle East. I used to think nuclear weapons wouldn't be used, but there is more posturing in the world today. The way things are going, it could happen."<br><br>Deborah Brown, a Women's House of Peace board member, said she was joining the walk because of her feelings about the war in Iraq.<br><br>"The war has just gotten to be so unbearable," she said. "I don't know how far I'll be walking with them today, but I believe any little effort seems worthwhile."<br><br>For Sister Clare, the group's message is one about seeing the human race live in harmony.<br><br>"We are all really one humanity, one family," she said. "We all really want the same thing in the end Â— to be happy and healthy. To do that, we need to put down weapons and renounce war. We need to believe in humanity and let go of our fears."<br><br>She added, "At the same time, we honor all of our soldiers overseas. They are doing an honorable thing, but sadly have to experience a war that is so horrendous. They are suffering physical and spiritual damage."<br><br>The Buddhists planned to reach Pittsfield by evening, where they would go to a potluck supper. The group would then ride to Lee. Today, they plan to walk to Great Barrington and then travel to Westfield. The walk is scheduled to end at the Statehouse in Boston on March 21.<br><br>For daily contact information, call (413) 253-7609.

The four words resonate within the dimmed room where members of Piedmont Karma Thegsum Choling (Piedmont KTC) repeat this mantra. Piedmont KTC, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation group, is based in Chapel Hill.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/piedmont.jpg"><br><strong>Lucy Gorham participates in a chanting prayer practice at the Piedmont KTC Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Center on Sunday. The Chapel Hill-based group in December moved to a new facility at the corner of Perkins Drive and Weaver Dairy Road to provide members a larger space.</strong><br><br>Although the repetition of a mantra, a religious prayer or poem, is an old and integral part of the Buddhist tradition, the room in which the group is meeting is new.<br><br>At the corner of Perkins Drive and Weaver Dairy Road, the room is part of an apartment in a nondescript duplex. Piedmont KTC moved to the new facility in December seeking a larger space to serve its members.<br><br>"We've stayed small over the years," said Lucy Gorham, a Piedmont KTC member. "This is the first time we've had a big enough space to accommodate more members.<br><br>The unremarkable building houses a group whose members aspire to a remarkable degree of contentment and peace of mind.<br><br>Through the teachings of the Dalai Lama, head of Tibetan Buddhism, people are beginning to grasp the peace that the practice of Tibetan Buddhism can create in one's life, said Piedmont KTC Director John Mader, 50.<br><br>"People realize that there might be ways of living that create happiness and peace of mind," Mader said. "These Tibetans have spent more than a thousand years refining methods to calm the mind and to increase the ability to be compassionate, to both others and oneself."<br><br>Tibetan Buddhism stems from Indian Buddhism and was officially brought to Tibet in 817 A.D. by Padmasambhava. Despite trials and persecution, Tibetan Buddhism evolved and developed into four schools. Piedmont KTC is of the Karma Kagyu school.<br><br>Tibetan Buddhism appears a complicated faith at first glance, but the Tibetans were very practical when planning it, Mader said.<br><br>"As complex as the faith is, you can enter and follow a logical path to understand the teachings and contemplate how they are relevant to your life, your practice and your meditation," he said.<br><br>Answers.com cites a U.S. State Department estimate that about 1 percent of the U.S. population practices some form of Buddhism.<br><br>Piedmont KTC member Geoff Driscoll, 57, has been a member of the group since its creation in 1981.<br><br>"We chant prayers and recite mantras while visualizing the Buddha," Driscoll said. "Through this process we begin to develop the qualities that Buddha exemplifies."<br><br>Members of Piedmont KTC meet on Sunday mornings at 10 to chant the prayers and mantras. On three Sundays a month, the members chant in Tibetan to the Buddha of compassion and to the Buddha of endless light to gain compassion and wisdom, and on one Sunday a month they chant to the medicine Buddha to achieve better mental and physical health, Driscoll said.<br><br>After chanting, they take a 15-minute break and then begin a sitting meditation until 11:45 a.m. On Wednesdays, beginning at 7 p.m., a sitting meditation is followed by a class on aspects of Tibetan Buddhism.<br><br>Newcomers need not have prior experience with Buddhism to attend a practice or a class. One of the benefits of the new location is there are now additional rooms where personalized instruction can be held for newcomers, Mader said.<br><br>"We're a friendly and open group of people, and very informal," Gorham said. "People can come when they need it, and leave as they wish."<br><br>"We want to be a resource for the Chapel Hill community," Mader said. "It's great to have the opportunity to tell people about our group if they are looking for a more contemplative lifestyle."<br><br>But Piedmont KTC doesn't have plans to try to expand its membership base.<br><br>"People may come and find a good fit -- others come and then find another Buddhist group, or return to their initial religion," Gorham said.<br><br>"Tibetan Buddhists always say there are lots of different religions for a reason," Gorham said.<br><br>Twelve core members choose Piedmont KTC as the place to routinely practice their religion. An additional 25 to 30 members come irregularly to the Wednesday or Sunday meetings. And about twice yearly, a Tibetan Buddhist leader comes to speak, drawing people from throughout the Piedmont to hear the leader's message.<br><br>The core members keep Piedmont KTC running financially. "We're committed to making these teachings and practices available," Mader said.<br><br>Donations are accepted and encouraged from individuals who feel that a Tibetan Buddhist meditation center is an important community resource.<br><br>And so, the Piedmont KTC is available to anyone seeking a more contemplative lifestyle. The mantra resounds as Chapel Hill and Carrboro residents meditate -- each working toward a deeper understanding of the Buddhist faith and a little peace of mind.<br><br></div>

But none is as unusual as a one-woman effort now underway in San Francisco. She's offering peace of mind.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/cc_zendo.JPG"><br><br>The practice of meditation has been around for thousands of years. But what's happening in this room is unique. This is believed to be the first meditation project in the nation designed for those who are homeless or living on the edge.<br><br>Rev. Jana Drakka, Buddhist monk: "Our aim is to be at peace with whatever comes up."<br><br>You might think meditation is something only yuppies do, but one purpose of meditation is to reduce stress, and as anyone living on the streets will tell you, it's certainly stressful being homeless<br><br>Rev. Jana Drakka, Buddhist monk: "I have had people, especially when I first started doing this about three years ago, people would say are you crazy."<br><br>Rev. Jana Drakka is a Buddhist monk who grew up in Scotland. She first began working with the homeless by going into the city's single room hotels to conduct funeral services for those who died. Meditation is her way of helping the living.<br><br>Rev. Jana Drakka, Buddhist monk: "Everything in this life can and will be taken away from us, but while we're alive, there's one thing no one can take away. They can take away your home, your job, your health can go, but freedom of mind -- we are all free."<br><br>Steve Eastman believes meditation is helping him move forward despite being surrounded by poverty, violence, alcohol and drugs.<br><br>Steve Eastman, meditation client: "The more calm, the more centered, the more rational you are, the more likely it is that you can get some services or find some help."<br><br>Carla Thompson, meditation client: "People are doing drugs and alcohol because they are looking for an escape. They are looking for peace and someone needs to teach them how to become at peace with themselves."<br><br>That's what 54-year-old monk, Priscilla Fleischer, is trying to do. She facilitates five groups a week. Priscilla Fleischer is a clinical social worker from UCSF. She works with the homeless and sometimes sits in on the sessions.<br><br>Priscilla Fleischer, UCSF: "She has offered to people who one would not think could benefit from this kind of intervention, I think a lot of hope."<br><br>At a drop in center in the Tenderloin, Drakka adds movement and stretching along with deep breathing exercises. Research has been done on the medical benefits of meditation, but not specifically on this population and these sessions. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence.<br><br>Anibal Mejia, Mission Neighborhood Resource Ctr.: "We've seen a lot of our clients who've attended the groups regularly use a little bit less drugs or cease using drugs."<br><br>Carlos Mendoza Hernandez, Tenderloin Housing Clinic: "Their attitudes have changed completely. They are able to focus on every day, normal life."<br><br>Drakka was once homeless herself. Now, as a monk she lives at the San Francisco Zen Center and considers the meditation sessions a way of giving back to the community.<br><br>Porter Davis, Meditation Client: "She's reaching out to try to engage people in something she has a passion for." Drakka receives no money for her work, but would like to expand the program. And is hoping to do that someday with community support.<br><br>For more information please click on: www.sfzc.org<br># Email outreach@sfzc.org<br># Phone: 415-354-0380<br></div>

It's a quality of life - an ongoing stream of impermanence, " Lief said Wednesday in a phone interview from her home in Vermont.<br><br>When people come to terms with this impermanence, "we become a little more at ease with our own humanness and vulnerability and flaws," she said. "We are not warding off our own vulnerability in order to be strong."<br><br>Ironically, this relaxed quality makes it easier to connect with those who might be ill or dying, Lief said.<br><br>Lief's approach has roots in Buddhist thought and practice but is accessible to everyone regardless of religious background, she said. The Fort Collins Shambhala Meditation Center and Hospice of Larimer County are sponsoring the event.<br><br>Lief will offer short voluntary exercises that people can use to be more present in their lives - rather than physically or mentally "checking out" during difficult circumstances, and thus be more connected with others.<br><br>"The underpinning of the whole contemplative approach is that you can train yourself to be more present, loving and compassionate," she said. "If you can be there with someone and be really present, they feel supported."<br><br></div>

"We worry because of his health, Tibet is very high," she said.<br><br>But Lama Yeshe only smiled.<br><br>"He always does what he wants," Josep said.<br><br>In 1991, he even raised the money needed to buy an island off the coast of Scotland, Holy Island, that holds retreats and offers courses in meditation, yoga, vegetarian cooking.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the little tea room, visitors and monks shared a quiet time.<br><br>One of the visitors, Judith, had come to take a course in meditation. Eric and Lucie were on a Tai Chi retreat and Anne was there to take a course in thangkas, Tibetan painting.<br><br>The temple is adorned with magnificent thangkas by the great Tibetan artist Sherab Palden Beru, who lives in the monastery. "They are masterpieces, like the Mona Lisa", said Ani Rinchen Kandro.<br><br>After four decades the monastery has become a part of the stunning lowland scenery.<br><br>"Before, the neighbours had a lot of distrust.. but it has changed. They accept Samye Ling... now it's peaceful coexistence," said Mackintosh.<br><br>"The only dispute that I know about happened when some of the yaks went into the fields of one of the neighbours," said Soller. "But that was a dispute between neighbours, it had nothing to do with religion or distrust towards the monks."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">The Big Man meets The Buddha</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">by Peter B. Brace, The Nantucket Independent, May 22, 2007</span><br><strong>Nantucket, MA (USA)</strong> -- We are, as the instructor tells us, sitting for a very good reason with our legs crossed and our knees pointing down below our hips to straighten our spines.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/nantucket.jpg"><br><strong>Brace, in deep thought. MICHAEL GALVIN/The Independent</strong><br><br>Some of us are perched on padded rectangular blocks, others on firm round pillows and even one maverick on his own homemade bench. We hold our postures for about 20 minutes with the tips of our tongues resting on our palates, eyes focused about four feet in front of us and our thoughts pared down to just the gentle in and out of our breath.<br><br>"Calgon, take me away!"<br><br>Sorry. Alittle levity never hurts when one is seeking enlightenment through meditation and leg cramps.<br><br>If I can sit without discomfort for those 1,200 seconds, Elisabeth Hazell, our Shambhala meditation teacher informs me, I'll really get into that zone of repose and transcend from the harrowing deadline stress of the day's newswriting preceding this quiet time. Actually, I'm already halfway there. Having valiantly made it through another one of Susan Brown's grueling "mixed" level yoga classes just before this, my first brush with true meditation and her wonderfully long savasana (a meditative cool-down at the end of yoga class), embracing more relaxation as the unsalted pretzel of my day actually appealed to me.<br><br>Weekly for the last two years, Elisabeth has led this cult of meditators at the Yoga Room, which is owned and run by Shannah Green. Unlike yoga, it's free-form relaxation. There is just a hint of structure to get one elevated into nothingness, but the rest is up to you in the control of your mind. Forget what you couldn't get done at work that day and what your manic schedule holds for you tomorrow; ignore that scrumptious Pi Pizza you're assembling in your mind for an after-class dinner; pay no attention as your lip ferret of a mustache tickles your face; deafen your ears to the guy revving his motorcycle next door and hear only your breathing.<br><br>Imagine the oxygen coming into your mouth, flowing down your esophagus, into your lungs and trading places through your capillaries in the walls of your alveoli with carbon dioxide and then gliding up your esophagus and out through your mouth. All other thoughts Elisabeth wants us to tag as thoughts to be ignored.<br><br>Wax on, wax off! That's it!<br><br>For some, I'm sure that sounds a little too airy and new-age hippy-like to grasp, especially some of you super aggressive power worker bees out there who need a 10-mile run, a 50- minute spinning class and two hours on the free weights just to decompress from a stressful day. But I'm telling you, this stuff is for real. And no, you don't have to sit around in a circle holding hands and chanting Kumbaya. There's no touching, no chanting, just sitting and breathing.<br><br>Why does it work? Why did I sleep eight hours straight that night? I can't explain it. Talk to my legs, which were screaming to be unraveled. Boy, did I ever want to get up and stretch, but something held me there breathingÂ… focusing on the breath in and outÂ…just breathing.<br><br>Well, to be fair, I didn't make the full 20 minutes. About three minutes before Elisabeth banged her little brass gong with a stick to let us know of the next phase of the meditation, my right leg shot out erect in front of me probably thinking it was time to go. I didn't do it on purpose, but I think my leg had had enough enlightenment for one night.<br><br>That's what we're after in Shambhala meditation. It is a Sanskrit term translating into "place of peace/tranquility/happiness," according to www.answers.com. A Buddha called Shakyamuni is believed to have taught the Kalachakra tantra at the urging of King Suchandra of Shambhala and the actual written instructions are said to be preserved there in this Tibetan city.<br><br>What Elisabeth is providing for us is a place to reacquaint ourselves with our basic human goodness in its purest and strongest form. Shambhala meditation allows the student to harmonize mind and body in order to discover that essential goodness inside.<br><br>Following the sitting is walking, thank God, or Buddha! Not outside, but in the room. We are told to walk with our left fists resting on our chests just below our sternums with our right hands covering that fist. Not a competition to see who can leg it around the Yoga Room the fastest, we are told to pace ourselves in this bipedal form of meditation, a practice that Elisabeth said I should apply whenever I'm walking anywhere outside of this class to obtain that connection with my inner goodness.<br><br>There are four of us that night, so we space ourselves accordingly, gaze blankly ahead like gleeful Krishnas about to receive illumination from their Hindu god and take slow, methodical steps in time with each other for about 10 minutes so as not to break from our meditative states. Okay. This is good. I can do this; but after five minutes of striding in unison, I wanted to sit down again, to get back into that nirvana I had barely tasted while sitting and cramping.<br><br>And that's what we get to finish the class. Again, Elisabeth strikes the gong lightly, the slight sound banging off my eardrums and breaking me out of a walking trance.<br><br>Back on my cushions I experience one of the reasons for walking: looser legs for more sitting, but this time only about 10 more minutes. We end with a tonglen, a thought exercise that Elisabeth describes as sending and taking. We are sending our positive thoughts out to a Yogini (a female yoga student) and taking away her pain and suffering leading up to and during an impending surgery she experienced on May 16. Apparently we sent and took enough, as the surgery went well.<br><br>Meditation rocks!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Buddhist art teaches compassion</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">By GARY STERN, THE JOURNAL NEWS, May 26, 2007</span><br><strong>Dobbs Ferry, New York (USA)</strong> -- A mandala is a temporary work of art in a world that prizes endurance, an impermanent tapestry of sand in a culture that is forever seeking the fountain of youth.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/dobbs-mandala.jpg"><br><strong>Students watch as the Venerable Tenzin Yignyen, a Tibetan Buddhist monk, creates a mandala at The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry</strong><br><br>It is created with precision and prayers, according to Buddhist tradition. Only to be washed away.<br><br>The Venerable Tenzin Yignyen, a renowned Tibetan Buddhist monk who was ordained by the Dalai Lama, has spent the past several years creating mandalas - and then destroying them - at schools and museums in the United States.<br><br>He spent this week at The Masters School, a premier boarding school in Dobbs Ferry, teaching his lessons by crafting a brightly colored mandala, filled with messages and meaning, in a study room outside the school's library.<br><br>He worked eight hours a day as students came and went, asking him questions, bringing him tea, watching him work.<br><br>"It's been pretty amazing, to see him start from scratch on a flat table on Monday and to have a work of art on Thursday," said Henry Ginna, 15. "I saw him fill it out, bit by bit. It takes patience, precision, perseverance - artistic creativity and a spiritual drive."<br><br>Yesterday afternoon, students and teachers marveled at the finished product, a circle about 4 feet in diameter, its symbols and lines so perfectly constructed that it looked like a painting. One had to get within several inches of the mandala to see the grains of sand that composed it.<br><br>Tenzin, a short man wrapped in gold and burgundy robes, said he had created a mandala of compassion.<br><br>"It tells how important love and compassion are in our life, how love and compassion can change our day-to-day life, for the individual, for family, for country, for world peace," he said. "It tells that we must carry through obstacles that can obscure your compassion. The tradition holds that love and compassion are the source of happiness."<br><br>Different symbols in the mandala, he explained, represent our positive inner qualities - patience, generosity, wisdom, appreciation. A lotus stands for compassion itself.<br><br>Other symbols stand for hurtful qualities like attachment, hatred, pride, ignorance, jealousy.<br><br>The colors of the mandala each represent elements, he said: white for water; yellow for earth; red for fire; black and blue for air; and green for space.<br><br>"It is very different from other arts," Tenzin said. "Your intention must be pure. You must concentrate, meditate on good qualities. I visit schools because kids want to learn. They understand the message, how important love and compassion are in our lives. The message is not shared with them. This is my calling."<br><br>Tenzin was ordained by the Dalai Lama in 1976. He completed 16 years of study at the Dalai Lama's monastery in India in 1985. He now lives in Geneva, N.Y., between Syracuse and Rochester, where he teaches at Hobart and William Smith Colleges.<br><br>He has constructed mandalas at dozens of colleges and museums nationwide and as far away as Moscow and Mongolia.<br><br>The mandala is a 1,000-year-old Buddhist tradition that symbolizes, in its creation and destruction, the creation of the universe and Buddhist beliefs in impermanence and the interconnectedness of all things.<br><br>Its very creation is a meditation that is supposed to purify its environment and promote harmony in the world. The overall diagram, according to Buddhist tradition, represents many things, among them: the dwelling place of a deity (even though not all Buddhists are theists), the Buddha's enlightened mind, the palace of the Buddha and the universe itself.<br><br>Just a few days ago, a mandala being created in Union Station in Kansas City, Mo., made national news when a small boy innocently danced across it. The monks simply went back to work.<br><br>Tenzin created his mandala by using a funnel with a tiny opening to place a few grains of sand at a time into a pattern. He would rub an empty funnel gently over the sand-filled funnel to make the sand flow, just so, as students watched.<br><br>"It was truly transformational," said Ellen Cowhey, who teaches world religions at the school and helped bring Tenzin to Dobbs Ferry.<br><br>"It was amazing to see the best of the students come out, seeing them with the teacher, bringing him tea, the reverence. It was almost an ancient way of learning."<br><br>Then came what is called the dismantling ceremony.<br><br>With dozens of students huddled tightly around him, Tenzin repeated the project's message - "Don't put off happiness. Who knows if there is a future or not." - before picking up small bits of sand with his fingers.<br><br>Before long, students were helping to brush the sand toward the mandala's center into a pile.<br><br>Tenzin then led a procession of students and teachers to the Hudson River, next to the Chart House restaurant. After several minutes of silence - closely watched by baffled onlookers - Tenzin poured the now gray sand into the water.<br><br>Impermanence. Continuity. Dust to dust.<br><br>After some applause, he said farewell to the students.<br><br>"Have a nice life," he said. "Have a happy life."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Milarepa Center Making A Name</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">BY JACOB L. GRANT, Caledonian Record, July 28, 2007</span><br><strong>BARNET, Vermont (USA) </strong>-- For 30 years it has overlooked the village of Barnet, yet the Milarepa Center, a Buddhist meditation facility, has remained a well-kept secret.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/milarepa-center.jpg"><br><br>Not that keeping it a secret has been intentional, simply the smallness of the facility - though situated on 300 acres - has kept everything on a word-of-mouth level.<br><br>But things are beginning to change. New visions and future plans have cropped up and the center has its sights set on growth.<br><br>Much like its neighboring meditation center, the well-known Karme Choling, the Milarepa Center is a retreat facility. People come and often spend weekends, weeks or longer listening to the various teachings offered.<br><br>Director Wendy Hobbs described it as the perfect place for people to come who need a break from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life.<br><br>"You can come and sit and relax, yet get some pretty intense things to think about," she said during an interview at the center on Thursday. "It offers so much to people."<br><br>Visitors fly in from all over, Hobbs said - California, Florida, and yet not everyone is a Buddhist. She said what makes Buddhism so unique is that you don't have to be a Buddhist to practice what they teach.<br><br>"Everyone's looking for happiness," Hobbs said. "People come here and they start listening and it's like ... lightning bolts." She made a few popping motions with her hands around her head. "It's life changing."<br><br>Looking Ahead<br><br>Situated on 300 acres of forest and meadow overlooking the Connecticut River, the center offers programs based on traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation practices, according to www.milarepacenter.org.<br><br>The main facility occupies a farmhouse dating back to 1865. Nearby is a converted barn, flower and vegetable gardens along with two retreat huts served by the main kitchen. Two additional, more remote huts, have their own kitchen and accommodate longer stays. The facility can house about 22 people at one time, not including the exterior grounds for tenting.<br><br>The Milarepa Center is a nonprofit organization and those who work there are volunteers. Though it operates on a "shoestring budget," Hobbs said they don't charge anything for their teachings, they just ask that people make a donation to cover room and board.<br><br>Hobbs, who has been director for about four years, said she's frequented the center for the last 20 years of her life, bringing her children when they were young and growing closer and closer to the center's way of life. She lives across the border in New Hampshire where she works in the field of assisted care living.<br><br>Hobbs first encountered Buddhism in her early twenties while traveling around India and Nepal. She met some Buddhist teachers who helped her discover, what she called, "the truth."<br><br>The center in Barnet is overseen by Lama Zopa Rinpoche whom, according to Hobbs, has a vision to see the center grow. Right now she said they are trying to transition into more year-round programming while striving to find a resident teacher who will work at the center full time.<br><br>That's not been so easy though because as the demand for Buddhist teachers in the West has grown, the number of actual teachers has not. However, the Milarepa Center remains hopeful and even has a spot picked out for a larger facility some day.<br><br>"With all the help from those who support Milarepa Center, I have confidence that, with Lama Zopa Rinpoche's guidance, all the projects Rinpoche has requested for Milarepa Center to do, will be completed," she said.<br><br>Kid's Camp<br><br>One of the programs those at the center are very excited about is the Kid's Camp, a week of fun activities for area youth involving games, candy, activities, crafts and more.<br><br>Tsunma-la, better known as Sue, has been visiting from a Milarepa Center in Boston, Mass. during the month of July, to help out during the Kid's Camp week.<br><br>She said they try to teach the children two main things: 1) All beings are alike in that we all want happiness. People, animals, insects - she said they try to teach the children to have respect for all life. 2) Be kind. And being kind, she said, doesn't always mean going out of your way to clean someone's house or do a service for them, sometimes it's as simple as smiling at a stranger when you're walking down the street.<br><br>"Buddhism is very kid-friendly because it accepts your nature," said Sue. "[It teaches us to] extend our practice of kindness to all beings."<br><br>Sue admitted, though, that although there is an aspect of self-centeredness to the religion because the ultimate goal is to achieve happinesss for yourself, to become your own Buddha, you do it by making others happy.<br><br>Different styles of Buddhist teachings emphasize different points, she continued. They all stem from buddha shakyamuni and the same basic principals, but different groups package them differently. She illustrated her point by saying different people take different medications to cure a headache. Likewise, different people will connect more intimately with different types of teachers and teachings.<br><br>"It's whatever suits your temperament," she said.<br><br>For more information about Milarepa Center, how to donate or get involved, visit www.milarepacenter.org, or give them a call 802-633-4136.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Buddhism in Germany Finding New Adherents</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">by Tamsin Walker, Deutsche Welle, Oct 10, 2007</span><br><br><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong> -- It's been around in the wings for several decades already, yet only recently has Buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream German society. And it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/germany.jpg"><br><strong>German Buddhists during meditation</strong><br><br>Although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of German Buddhists in Germany, the German Buddhist Union (DBU) estimates there are about 130,000 practioners. And there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation's traditionally Christian population.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"We are definitely experiencing an upwards trend," said Helge Latenza of the DBU Head Office, "but it is a gentle curve."</span><br><br>Gentle or not, significantly more Germans are turning towards Buddhism than are converting to Islam, an issue which has been creating waves throughout Germany lately. Last month, according to the Federal Interior Ministry, there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to Islam living in Germany.<br><br>So what is the reason for this growing interest in Buddhism, which is not even recognized as a religious body under German public law? David Schneider, one of the senior teachers of the Shambala Buddhist tradition, says one factor is that Buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"There have never been any Buddhist wars," Schneider said. " I think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions.

Lama Yeshe Ling and Lamp on the Path are chartering a bus to make the trip in to Toronto - details here.<br><br>Awarded the third only honorary Canadian Citizenship in 2006, and among many other honors the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a strong advocate for non-violence, inter-religious understanding and universal responsibility. The Canadian Tibetan Association of Ontario (CTAO) has invited His Holiness the Dalai Lama on October 31, 2007 to address the people of Toronto in a talk called The Art of Happiness President of CTAO, Mr. Norbu Tsering states, Â“We are thrilled to host this visit by our spiritual and temporal leader His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama; he is admired and respected worldwide as a man of peace and compassion but we are also very proud that he will be returning here as a Canadian Citizen.Â”<br><br>A book about the Dalai Lama's philosophy called The Art of Happiness - a Handbook for Living, was on The New York Times bestseller list for almost two years. From Amazon.com:<br><br>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to sit down with the Dalai Lama and really press him about life's persistent questions? Why are so many people unhappy? How can I abjure loneliness? How can we reduce conflict? Is romantic love true love? Why do we suffer? How should we deal with unfairness and anger? How do you handle the death of a loved one? These are the conundrums that psychiatrist Howard Cutler poses to the Dalai Lama during an extended period of interviews in The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living.<br><br>At first, the Dalai Lama's answers seem simplistic, like a surface reading of Robert Fulghum: Ask yourself if you really need something; our enemies can be our teachers; compassion brings peace of mind. Cutler pushes: But some people do seem happy with lots of possessions; but "suffering is life" is so pessimistic; but going to extremes provides the zest in life; but what if I don't believe in karma? As the Dalai Lama's responses become more involved, a coherent philosophy takes shape. Cutler then develops the Dalai Lama's answers in the context of scientific studies and cases from his own practice, substantiating and elaborating on what he finds to be a revolutionary psychology. Like any art, the art of happiness requires study and practice--and the talent for it, the Dalai Lama assures us, is in our nature. --Brian Bruya<br><br></div>

A teacher, author, and peace activist, Nhat Hanh was born in central Vietnam on October 11, 1926. He joined a Zen monastery at the age of 16, studied Buddhism as a novice, and was fully ordained as a monk in 1949. Commonly referred to as Thich Nhat Hanh, the title ThÃ­ch is used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha) clan.[1] He coined the term Engaged Buddhism in his book Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire.[2]<br><br>In the early 1960s, he founded the School of Youth for Social Services (SYSS) in Saigon, a grassroots relief organization that rebuilt bombed villages, set up schools and medical centers, and resettled families left homeless during the Vietnam War.[3] He traveled to the U.S. a number of times to study and later teach at Columbia University, and to promote the cause of peace. He urged Martin Luther King, Jr. to oppose the Vietnam War publicly, and spoke with many people and groups about peace. In a January 25, 1967 letter to the Nobel Institute in Norway, King nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.[4] Nhat Hanh led the Buddhist delegation to the Paris Peace Talks. One of the best known Buddhist teachers in the West, Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings and practices appeal to people from various religious, spiritual, and political backgrounds. He offers a practice of mindfulness that is often adapted to Western sensibilities.[5]<br><br>He created the Order of Interbeing in 1966, and established monastic and practice centers around the world. His home is Plum Village Monastery in the Dordogne region in the South of France.[3] He travels internationally giving retreats and talks. Exiled from Vietnam for many years, he was allowed to return for a trip in 2005[6] and again in 2007.[7] He has published more than 100 books, including more than 40 in English. He also publishes a quarterly Dharma talk in the journal of the Order of Interbeing, the Mindfulness Bell. Nhat Hanh continues to be active in the peace movement. He has sponsored retreats for Israelis and Palestinians, encouraging them to listen and learn about each other; given speeches urging warring countries to stop fighting a<br></div>

We take refuge in the Sangha,  not any monk who happens to be regarded as a star by many.<br><br>I respect the Dalai Lama, but yet concerned about followers or non-followers looking upon any member of the Sangha as a celebrity or as their only true wise leader without being able to respect and open their minds to the teachings of other monks.<br><br>The Buddha has explained about taking refuge in the Triple Gems. Broadly speaking in terms of a human representative of the Sangha, all monks who follow diligently or otherwise are to be accorded high degree of respect by all; including lay people of any social status, who may or may not be Buddhists.<br><br>So all members of the Sangha are our teachers, let us all remember that clearly, especially for new Buddhist followers.<br><br></div>
