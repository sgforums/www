              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">At high school, I was of the only racial minorities. I
              was bullied for this, leaving me feeling disconnected and isolated. To cope, I
              became obsessed with sad music like The Smiths, who were one of my favourite
              bands. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">One Morrissey lyric became a mantra for me: “It's so
              easy to laugh. It's so easy to hate. It takes strength to be gentle and kind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">Through music, I found a framework in which to feel
              and hold my pain. I listened in a meditative way until the feelings of sadness
              and pain turned into connection, beauty, and ultimately joy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">I had a choice in how to respond to teasing. I could
              choose kindness and compassion, for myself and others. I could try to connect
              to the harassers in a genuine way rather than slinging words back, and I could
              comfort myself instead of repeating the cycle of shame and dehumanization.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">One word I used to label the space I had found was
              transformation, another word was compassion. Reading books on Buddhist
              philosophy, I learned compassion could be trained, that we could become more
              connected to others and that this would lead to greater well-being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">Compassion is an emotional response to someone's
              suffering that is caring and concerned. It leads to a desire to relieve that
              person's suffering. This is not always a natural response. People can have a
              variety of responses to others' suffering – avoidance, fear, discomfort,
              sometimes even enjoyment. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">But can compassion be learned through practice?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">As a graduate student I designed and conducted a study
              testing this exact hypothesis: that we can become more compassionate through
              practicing meditation, and that this will result in more kind acts towards
              others. I hypothesized this wouldn't take extreme amounts of practice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">As part of the study, people from the Madison,
              Wisconsin community practiced just 30 minutes a day for two weeks, like a new
              exercise regime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">Guided by an <a href="http://investigatinghealthyminds.org/compassion.html"><span style="color: #0061bf;">online
              meditation</span></a>, the participants practiced compassion for different
              kinds of people: a loved one, themselves, a stranger, and someone they actually
              had conflict with: the “difficult” person. They practiced imagining a time when
              each person had suffered, and noticed the emotions that arose and what it felt
              like in their bodies. They were instructed to “sit” with the feelings, and
              notice them non-judgmentally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">They then practiced wishing that the other person's
              suffering was relieved, and repeated compassion-generating phrases such as,
              “May you be free from suffering. May you have joy and ease.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">The control group learned a technique called cognitive
              reappraisal, where they practiced thinking about a stressful situation in a new
              way to decrease negative emotional responses. They used techniques such as
              thinking about the situation from a friend or family member's perspective,
              imagining a year had passed with everything going well, and coming up with a
              way to reinterpret the situation. This is one of the core skills of cognitive
              behavioral therapy, which is found to be effective with many types of mental health
              issues such as depression and anxiety. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">We tested our hypothesis – that practicing compassion
              through meditation would result in more helping behaviour in real life - by
              having participants consent to a separate study where they play an economic
              exchange game with strangers over the Internet. In the Redistribution Game,
              participants witnessed an unfair economic exchange between two players, and had
              the opportunity to spend their own money to redistribute money from the unfair
              player to the player with less money. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">After practicing compassion meditation for just two
              weeks, the participants ended up spending almost twice the amount of money
              compared to the control group (a statistically significant difference).
              Practicing compassion in their minds actually resulted in more altruistic
              behavior towards a stranger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">We wanted to see what emotional changes in the brain
              contributed to the changes in altruistic behavior. We scanned the participants’
              brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and had them view
              images of others suffering (physical injury, emotional pain) before and after
              the two weeks of training. The compassion group was asked to generate
              compassion towards the people in the images, and the reappraisal group was
              asked to reinterpret the meaning of the pictures to decrease negative emotions.
              We found that in the compassion group, the more they spent in the
              Redistribution Game, the more their brain activity had changed in response to
              people's suffering. Changing their minds internally had indeed changed the
              outside world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">We found changes in regions associated with empathy,
              emotion regulation and reward processing. One region that changed was the
              inferior parietal cortex, which is associated with the “mirror neuron network”,
              and activated in response to your own experiences as well as others'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">This suggests that through learning compassion, people
              became more sensitive to other people's suffering. The purpose is to not simply
              feel another's pain, but to transform your own response in order to help the
              other person. We also found changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
              nucleus accumbens, which are respectively involved in emotion regulation and
              positive emotions. This suggests that emotional habits can be transformed into
              something more positive – an emotional connection and caring.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">As Morrissey sang, “It takes strength to be gentle and
              kind.” It takes awareness, commitment, and practice to change habits of mind
              into something more beneficial for yourself and others. Learning any new skill
              requires attention, effort, and persistence, and this is often associated with
              activity in the prefrontal cortex. It takes strength to open yourself up to
              another's suffering, to hold it and understand it, and to have the desire to
              relieve it through appropriate means.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">Through my work as a clinical psychologist, I have
              witnessed first-hand the power of compassion. I learned to actively listen and
              respond to people’s stories in a way that allowed their authentic voices to
              arise. What emerged from empowering their voices was an experience of
              transformation that was no longer just a private moment of listening to sad
              music. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;" lang="EN">I transformed sadness into joy with other people, and
              this has changed me in turn.</span></p>
