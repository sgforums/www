              <div class="postentry">
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>1</p>
              <p>Everything that is taken as a self;<br> Everything that is taken as other:<br> These are simply changing forms of consciousness.</p>
              <p>2</p>
              <p>Pure consciousness transforms itself<br> Into three modes: Store consciousness,<br> Thought consciousness, and active consciousness.</p>
              <p>3</p>
              <p>The store consciousness holds the seeds of all past experience.<br> Within it are the forms of grasping<br> And the dwelling places of the unknown.<br> It always arises with touch, awareness, recognition, concept, and desire.</p>
              <p>4</p>
              <p>The store consciousness is clear and undefinable.<br> Like a great river, it is always changing.<br> Neither pleasant nor unpleasant, when one becomes fully realized, it ceases to exist.</p>
              <p>5</p>
              <p>The second transformation of consciousness is called thinking consciousness.<br> It evolves by taking the store consciousness as object and support.<br> Its essential nature is to generate thoughts.</p>
              <p>6</p>
              <p>The thinking consciousness<br> Is always obscured by four defilements:<br> Self-regard, self-delusion, self-pride, and self-love.</p>
              <p>7</p>
              <p>The thinking consciousness also arises with the mental factors<br> Of touch, awareness, recognition, concept, and desire.<br> This consciousness ceases when one becomes realized.<br> It also falls away when consciousness is impaired,<br> And when one is fully present.<br> 8</p>
              <p>The third transformation of consciousness<br> Is the active perception of sense objects.<br> These can be good, bad, or indifferent in character.</p>
              <p>9</p>
              <p>This active consciousness arises with three kinds of mental
              functions: Those that are universal, those that are specific, and those
              that are beneficial.<br> It is also associated with primary and secondary defilements<br> And the three kinds of feeling.</p>
              <p>10</p>
              <p>The universal factors are touch, awareness, recognition, concept, and desire.<br> The specific factors are intention, resolve, memory, concentration, and knowledge.<br> The beneficial factors are faith, modesty, respect, distance, courage, composure, equanimity, alertness, and compassion.<br> 11</p>
              <p>The primary defilements are:<br> Passion, aggression, ignorance,<br> Pride, intolerance, and doubt.</p>
              <p>12</p>
              <p>The secondary defilements are:<br> Anger, hatred, jealousy,<br> Envy, spite, hypocrisy, deceit…</p>
              <p>13</p>
              <p>Dishonesty, arrogance, harmfulness,<br> Immodesty, lack of integrity, sluggishness,<br> Restlessness, lack of faith, laziness, idleness,<br> Forgetfulness, carelessness, and distraction.</p>
              <p>14</p>
              <p>Remorse, sleepiness, reasoning, and analysis<br> Are factors which can be either defiled or undefiled.</p>
              <p>15</p>
              <p>The five sense consciousnesses arise in the store consciousness<br> Together or separately, depending on causes and conditions,<br> Just like waves arise in water.</p>
              <p>16</p>
              <p>Thought consciousness manifests at all times,<br> Except for those born in the realms of beings without thought,<br> Those in the formless trances, and those who are unconscious.</p>
              <p>17</p>
              <p>These three transformations of consciousness<br> Are just the distinction of subject and object, self and other–<br> They do not really exist.<br> All things are nothing but forms of consciousness.</p>
              <p>18</p>
              <p>Since the storehouse consciousness contains all seeds,<br> These transformations of consciousness arise<br> And proceed based upon mutual influence.<br> On account of this, discrimination of self and other arises,</p>
              <p>19</p>
              <p>All actions leave traces,<br> And because of grasping at self and other,<br> Once one seed has been exhausted, another arises.</p>
              <p>20</p>
              <p>That which is differentiated<br> In terms of self and other,<br> Or by whatever sort of discrimination,<br> That is just mental projection:<br> It does not exist at all</p>
              <p>21</p>
              <p>Appearances themselves<br> Which arise dependently through causes and conditions<br> Exist, but only in a partial and dependent way.</p>
              <p>22</p>
              <p>Ultimately, perfect nature, the fully real, arises<br> When there is an absence of mental projection onto appearances.<br> For that reason, the fully real is neither the same nor different from appearances.<br> If the perfected nature is not seen, the dependent nature is not seen either.</p>
              <p>23</p>
              <p>Corresponding to the threefold nature,<br> There is a threefold absence of self-nature.<br> This absence of self-nature of all dharmas<br> Is the secret essence of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>
              <p>24</p>
              <p>Projections are without self-nature by definition.<br> Appearances too are without self-nature because they are not<br> self-existent.<br> Perfect nature is without any differentiation whatsoever.</p>
              <p>25</p>
              <p>The true nature of consciousness only<br> Is the true nature of all dharmas.<br> Remaining as it is at all times, it is Suchness.</p>
              <p>26</p>
              <p>As long as consciousness does not see<br> That subject-object distinctions are simply forms of consciousness<br> Attachment to twofold grasping will never cease</p>
              <p>27</p>
              <p>By merely thinking<br> The objects one perceives are forms of consciousness<br> One does not realize consciousness only</p>
              <p>28</p>
              <p>One realizes consciousness only<br> When the mind no longer seizes on any object<br> When there is nothing to be grasped, there is no grasping<br> Then one knows - everything is consciousness only.</p>
              <p>29</p>
              <p>That is the supreme, world-transcending knowledge<br> Where one has no mind that knows<br> And no object that is known<br> Abandoning twofold grasping<br> The storehouse consciousness is emptied</p>
              <p>30</p>
              <p>That alone is the pure, primordial reality<br> Beyond thought, auspicious, unchanging<br> It is the blissful body of liberation<br> The dharmakaya nature of the enlightened ones</p>
              <p>Adapted from English translations of the Sanskrit original</p>
