              <p>My friend and I used to hear people said that this or that venerable is an enlightened monk. Just curious, what does one mean by saying the monk is enlightened and how does one know he is an enlightened monk ?</p>
              <p>Fully understand the meaning of Emptiness, is it called enlightened ?</p>

              <p>There are many levels of awakening, even in other religions. However to attain the Buddhist kind of awakening you need to realise anatta (no-self) and emptiness. At this point you are enlightened in the Buddhist sense. However even the initial realisation of emptiness is not the end of the path.</p>
              <p>See <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a> - stage 5 and 6 then is considered enlightenment in buddhism. Stages before that can be found in other religions contemplative tradition and does not have the realisation of the two fold emptinesses. Stage 5 is the empiness of self and stage 6 is the emptiness of dharmas. The experiential realisation (as contrasted to an intellectual understanding) of this is crucial to Buddhist enlightenment. Both Thusness and Longchen who are moderators in this forum have shared their experience of this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also here is an excerpt from a Buddhist glossary site on the definition of twofold Emptiness:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two emptinesses (äºŒç©º) include (1) emptiness of self, the Ä�tman, the soul, in a person composed of the five aggregates, constantly changing with causes and conditions; and (2) emptiness of selves in all dharmas—each of the five aggregates, each of the twelve fields, and each of the eighteen spheres, as well as everything else with no independent existence. No-self in any dharma implies no-self in a person, but the latter is separated out in the first category. Realization of the emptiness of self in a person will lead to attainment of Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood. Bodhisattvas who have realized both emptinesses ascend to the First Ground on their Way to Buddhahood.</p>

              <p>Yeah, Emptiness is the most profound truth in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Let me put my understanding simply :</p>
              <p>There is no one true fixed thing in this world, everything depends on one another to form a self.</p>
              <p>Example, a chair is a chair because there are woods, nails and the carpenter (å› ç¼˜ï¼‰ has to put them together to form a chair. So, is there really a chair when you remove the nails and the woods ? No, right ? Something like that.</p>
              <p>If you observe things around you, including human beings, you will notice everything depends on one another to form a self. å› ç¼˜å�ˆå’Œè€Œæˆ�ã€‚</p>
              <p>Hi AEN, please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

              <p>Enlightenment is realising the true nature of reality. It is not a conceptual understanding of life and its purpose.  It's realising what our true nature is. It comes with it liberation from the human condition of suffering as a result of apparent problems and limitations which are also derived from the false sense of being a separate self.</p>
              <p>When you wake up from the dream of being a separate self and realise the true nature of reality, that is called waking up.</p>

              <h3>"What is enlightenment, no, I mean 
              really, like what is it?"</h3>
              <h3>by Steven Norquist</h3>
              <p>Many friends and family have been after me for some time to write 
              about my experience and 
              understanding of this topic. I have hesitated to write about it not 
              because enlightenment 
              itself is so hard to describe, but because enlightenment tends to make 
              one quite lazy. Before 
              my change I was a busy beaver, reading and writing and playing music and
               sports and really 
              actively getting out there. But after “the change” as I call it, there 
              was a clear vision of 
              how silly all this activity was and how much incredible effort is 
              required to perform it.</p>
              <p>But before I get ahead of myself let me lay out one basic fact, I
               am awake. I woke up about 
              a year ago. I know what I am, what I have always been and what it is 
              impossible to stop being. 
              Some call this enlightenment or ultimate truth, unity consciousness, 
              infinite mind and so on. 
              But all those names don’t tell the non-awake what it is. Even I calling 
              it "the change” is not 
              really accurate because nothing really changed, yet paradoxically, huge 
              change took place. In 
              simple terms I was once Steve living his life but now I am the 
              experience of Steve living his 
              life. It is a shift in perspective. Before this perspective shift 
              occurred I had practiced 
              about three years of medium intensity meditation consisting of some 
              breath watching, a little 
              mantra repetition and some light self inquiry Ramana Maharshi style. 
              These techniques were 
              coupled with an intense desire to find and know the truth. I read 
              everything on enlightenment 
              I could get my hands on.</p>
              <p>After about three years of this I had my first experience of 
              “nonduality” as it is called. 
              I had just read a passage in Ken Wilber’s “The Spectrum of 
              Consciousness” where he points out 
              that ordinary awareness is ultimate awareness. This struck a chord in 
              me, I set the book down 
              and stared at a paper that was sitting on the table in front of me, 
              after about a minute or 
              two an exciting and frightening thing happened, I disappeared! By that I
               mean the middle fell 
              right out of the equation. Normally there would be Steve over here 
              looking at the paper on the 
              desk over there, now there was only the experience, "paper" but no Steve
               over here seeing it. 
              It was clear that the middle that normally separated the paper from 
              Steve did not really exist, 
              there was only the experience, "paper."</p>
              <p>Now let me try to make this more clear by giving an illustration.</p>
              <p>Imagine as clearly as you can that you enter a large house that 
              you have never been in 
              before. You feel strange and kind of scared, there is furniture and 
              drapes but no people. 
              You wander around feeling the creepiness of being alone in this big 
              house. You go from room to 
              room not knowing what you will find. You start to get nervous and a 
              little fearful being alone 
              in this big house. You wonder how long it has been empty like this. In 
              time the sense of the 
              bigness and emptiness of the house starts to weigh heavily on your 
              nerves. Finally, when you 
              can not stand it any longer a shocking realization occurs to you, your 
              not there either! Only 
              the experience, "house" exists.</p>
              <p>This is how nonduality feels and is the real truth of existence. 
              Remember the question, 
              "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Now you know the answer.</p>
              <p>You see, with enlightenment comes the knowledge that even though 
              there is much activity in 
              the world, there are no doers. The universe is in a sense, lifeless. 
              There is no one, only 
              happenings and the experience of happenings. Enlightenment reveals that 
              the universe emerges 
              spontaneously. It’s emergence and pattern are perfect in mathematics and
               symmetry and involve 
              no chance. Nothing is random, everything emerges exactly as it has to. 
              There is no random 
              chance, or evolution based on chance. The universe is perfect, nothing 
              is wrong or could be. 
              There seems to be chance or unpredictability from a human perspective 
              but that is only because 
              our time frame reference can not see the universe emerge through its 
              whole life span in a 
              matter of minutes. If we could see that, then we would clearly see how 
              every event was not only 
              perfect and necessary but even predictable.</p>
              <p>Now lets summarize so far, the universe is perfect, no one 
              exists, yet the experience 
              "universe" persists. How can this be? Consciousness. Consciousness is 
              aware. If it were not, 
              then there would be no universe. The very nature of existence implies 
              consciousness. One can 
              not exist without the other.</p>
              <p>There can never be a universe that does not involve 
              consciousness. There are no universes 
              or dimensions where there is no consciousness. Matter and form would 
              never arise without 
              consciousness. Universe/Consciousness, Mind/Matter, Wave/Particle, call 
              it what you will, the 
              reality is that the manifestation, the very appearance we call the 
              universe, is consciousness.</p>
              <p>Now don't mistake me here, there is no observer. There are no 
              persons in existence 
              experiencing the universe, but more than that there is no Ultimate 
              Person, God, Mind, or 
              anything else observing the universe. There is only the experience of 
              the universe being there 
              with no experiencer.</p>
              <p>This seems like a paradox but who cares, this is the way it is. 
              Experience "is," that is 
              all, that is the way the universe is, an experience by no one. The 
              universe spontaneously 
              arises out of consciousness yet at the same time is itself 
              consciousness. We must lose the 
              idea of matter being observed by something we call consciousness, that 
              is not true. Some 
              teachers talk of the Witness, the ultimate passive mind that observes 
              all things moment to 
              moment. This implies some level of separation, a witness over here 
              watching the universe over 
              there. It's not like this, there is only the experience, universe. There
               is no observer. Even 
              if there were no manifestation the feeling would be the same. Once again
               let me make this 
              clear: consciousness is not aware "of" the universe, consciousness is 
              aware "as" the universe.</p>
              <p>Now don't mistake that last sentence. Don't think, "Oh yeah 
              Steve, I get it now, 
              consciousness is not aware of the universe from a vantage point separate
               from it, like a 
              disembodied soul, consciousness is instead aware of the universe as one 
              of the billions of 
              beings in it, like man, or dog, or fish." No! Such thoughts are false. 
              When I say consciousness
               is aware "as" the universe I mean the very act of existence is 
              consciousness. A carrot is 
              itself consciousness, is itself awareness. There is not carrot aware of 
              itself as carrot nor 
              disembodied invisible consciousness aware of carrot as carrot, there is 
              only the experience 
              "carrot" and that is consciousness and that is enlightenment. There is 
              no observer.</p>
              <p>Let's talk now about how this fits in with human life. All people
               who do not know what's 
              going on believe that they are the people that they are, an individual 
              with thoughts and desires
               and hopes and dreams, a body and a house, a wife and a child. The list 
              goes on but you get it.</p>
              <p>Now the truth. Even though the above is happening, it is an 
              automatic machine like emergence 
              out of Universe/Consciousness and is following a strict nonchance 
              pattern. More importantly, no 
              one is performing any of the above and Universe/Consciousness is what is
               going on.</p>
              <p>To make it more clear, stuff is happening but no one is doing it.
               Emergence proceeds and 
              consciousness is aware. The unawake person, the person that doesn’t know
               what's going on believes
               that they are acting, that the human them exists. The reality is, the 
              body exists, the thoughts
               exist, the memories exist and that is consciousness and that is all.</p>
              <p>Someone might say consciousness has temporarily mistaken it’s 
              experience of the body and the 
              body’s memories as a person. But even though that answer may seem to 
              explain the why, really 
              there is no mistake at all. Universe/Consciousness has never been 
              confused. The person can fall 
              away at any moment restoring the original state of matter and 
              consciousness which has never 
              actually been obscured. This happened to me, but in that happening 
              nothing was lost because there
               never was a me to lose, only a confusion to correct that never existed.</p>
              <p>Knowing this, I mean really knowing this, not intellectually, but
               as a direct experience of 
              everyday life is enlightenment. Now once this is known it is impossible 
              to go back. Once you have
               drawn the curtain and seen who Oz really is you can’t cover him back up
               and pretend not to know
               the truth.</p>
              <p>So how do we proceed once we know? We let experience manifest 
              unmolested. As has been said, 
              “The universe is perfect, intervene at your peril.” The enlightened 
              person never acts. This is 
              the riddle of karma solved, there is no karma, never was, never could 
              be. There is no 
              reincarnation, how could there be? Who is there to reincarnate? There 
              are no persons, there is 
              no birth or death, there is ultimately nothing except 
              Manifestation/Awareness.</p>
              <p>99.999% of the spiritual books and teachers out there are 
              completely wrong. They are wrong 
              for one simple reason, they are not enlightened, they don’t know what's 
              going on. So in order 
              to keep the illusion of personality, of the idea that there is something
               or someone, they invent
               stories, or theories, or ideas, wear special clothes, perform certain 
              rituals and so on. They 
              teach this stuff. But the truth is so simple, it is laughable.</p>
              <p>Now let me make a clear distinction on one point, mystical 
              experience is not enlightenment. 
              You may have mystical experience, see God, get abducted by aliens, 
              receive messages from an 
              angel, contact your spirit guides, the list could go on. But always and 
              forever, no matter what
               is going on the truth is, every experience, mystical or ordinary is a 
              happening of 
              Universe/Consciousness.</p>
              <p>If I could teach the world a lesson it would be, no matter what 
              you experience always remind 
              yourself, “There is no experiencer, there is no observer.” If you do 
              this long enough and often 
              enough you will one day know what's going on. When that day comes you 
              will realize nothing has 
              changed, yet everything has changed. It is a feeling and a knowing. An 
              inescapable falling away 
              of untruth. If you think you know it then you don’t. When you know it, 
              you do. And when you do 
              know it, no one can take it away from you.</p>
              <p>Some points to clear up. When I said the enlightened person never
               acts I did not mean such 
              people sit in a cave and die of starvation and exposure. I mean the body
               can be quite active 
              and manifest all manner of good and bad behavior, the mind can be racing
               with thoughts and 
              feelings, but consciousness, now enlightened, knows no one is acting. It
               is only the universe 
              blossoming forth spontaneously and perfectly.</p>
              <p>As consciousness you are more aware of the feelings of the body, 
              physically and emotionally. 
              You don’t feel these things but you are aware of them because there is 
              no division between them 
              and consciousness. The Universe and Consciousness are equivalent, 
              remember the formula, U=C. 
              Also the thing we call personality or ego does not totally vanish. It 
              can remain intact along 
              with the body. It behaves and interacts and changes over time like any 
              person would but the 
              enlightened one knows they are not that ego.</p>
              <p>Some schools emphasize the destruction of the ego as the only 
              means of liberation. All that 
              is really required is the realization that you are not that ego. That 
              the ego really doesn’t 
              exist, is an illusion of sorts that can be left to it’s own designs. 
              It’s not really there, but 
              it appears to be there and that is just fine, don’t worry. If the ego 
              begins to fade that's ok. 
              Remember, there is no experiencer.</p>
              <p>Let me talk briefly about practice. Meditation and book study are
               useful and can ripen an 
              individual towards awakening, but the most important thing is to change 
              your perspective. You 
              must learn to see what is really going on. Understand, in reality 
              everyone is enlightened, but 
              not everyone knows how to perceive this. The reason is, enlightenment is
               so natural, so obvious,
               that from birth we have become accustomed to ignoring it in preference 
              to anything else that 
              manifests. Meditation can train you to still the mind and gain 
              concentration but it will not 
              give you enlightenment. A radical shift in perspective must occur, the 
              habitual focus of your 
              awareness and your way of perceiving must be changed.</p>
              <p>Study of books will not get you there, you need a shock. The 
              easiest way I know is for an 
              enlightened person to talk you into this perspective shift. The best 
              books I have read were the 
              ones that talked you into enlightenment. Feeling experiments such as the
               house scenario above 
              are good to help evoke the feeling of enlightenment. Feel what it is 
              like to not be there. The 
              real breakthrough will come when you “feel” the truth.</p>
              <p>It’s creepy, not blissful or ecstatic. It should scare you, the 
              body should react defensively,
               or there could be uncontrolled laughter at how stupid you have been for
               so long. It’s like one 
              of those 3D dot pictures, you stare and stare at those dots until bingo 
              the picture emerges! 
              After that, you can always see it, you can’t unlearn it. The same with 
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Basically any practice that can shock you into seeing what is 
              really going on is acceptable. 
              But understand, you want to know what's really going on, to feel it, to 
              contact reality. It 
              shouldn’t take long, a few years at most, less for some. If a practice 
              or a teacher tells you 
              it will take 10 or 20 years, find a new practice or teacher. Remember 
              you are your own 
              salvation, ultimately it is you who will wake you up. Any method that 
              can shock you into seeing
               what is really going on is acceptable but the perspective shift must 
              occur.</p>
              <p>Let me try to bring some clarity to the subject of enlightenment 
              and morality. It has been 
              said that enlightenment produces compassion and love and that many 
              enlightened ones forgo 
              release into Nirvana and reincarnate again and again until all souls 
              have obtained enlightenment,
               the Bodhisattva vow and such. None of this is enlightenment. 
              Enlightenment is not about 
              morality or vows, it is simply existence in the truth, that is all.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment carries no requirements and expects nothing, the 
              universe manifests and just 
              that is enlightenment. We don't seek enlightenment to be happy or to 
              give our lives meaning or 
              to feel bliss or ecstasy. Loyalty to a flag is not enlightenment, love 
              is not enlightenment, 
              hate is not enlightenment. If you see these as the fruit of 
              enlightenment then you are wrong. 
              Instead each of these are enlightenment themselves. Each of these are 
              spontaneous emergences 
              out of and as consciousness. Action, feeling, creation, performance, 
              love, hate, murder, 
              salvation, compassion, each is enlightenment itself. There is no doer, 
              no experiencer, only 
              manifestation. This is the truth, this is enlightenment.</p>
              <p>I want you to understand that while nothing ultimately changes, 
              in human terms much change 
              takes place. This happens because once you recognize what's going on the
               main motivations of 
              life begin to drop away. The level of dropping away is no doubt unique 
              to the individual but is 
              directly proportional to how much you desire to resolve into reality. 
              What I mean is that it is 
              possible to be enlightened and still try to retain a level of 
              unconsciousness in order to 
              interact in human affairs. As time passes this state will be harder to 
              maintain.</p>
              <p>It is similar to suspending your belief when watching a movie. 
              You pretend to believe the 
              reality of what is going on. You cry with the characters, you laugh with
               them, you hope with 
              them etc. You do this for the entertainment, to get your moneys worth. 
              This is the way real life
               is with enlightenment. You know there really is no one. You know that 
              it is just a display, a 
              machine like emergence out of and as consciousness. Yet you must believe
               it at some level or 
              you will simply lose the ability to interact in the world.</p>
              <p>I can see why some enlightened ones have isolated themselves or 
              become hermits. For the last
               year this has been an issue I personally have struggled with. How to 
              know the truth and 
              continue to interact with the world as if you believe it? You basically 
              have to employ a little
               Orwellian 1984 doublethink. You have to pretend to believe while always
               knowing the truth. 
              Some things are unavoidable of course, I was an avid reader but now can 
              barely open up a book. 
              I loved and played the guitar for years but now have zero interest in 
              picking one up. Even 
              writing these few words is a colossal effort. The reason is that 
              deliberate effort is an affront
               to reality where nothing is deliberate, everything is spontaneous, and 
              nothing at all is going 
              on.</p>
              <p>Don't mistake me here, I have not invented a rule of behavior 
              where I have decided I must act
               less because to do otherwise would be an affront to reality, rather the
               natural outcome of 
              enlightenment is less and less action, less and less thought. This is a 
              natural development 
              within the enlightened person. Eventually all action will be spontaneous
               and the person will not
               be acting.</p>
              <p>Of course to say this is not ultimately true, because in reality 
              no one ever acts. But from 
              the human vantage point this is how it plays out. Memory is also a 
              tricky thing, the memories of
               your life are still there and can be jogged into awareness but as time 
              progresses and 
              enlightenment begins to dissolve you, your access to them becomes more 
              difficult. Your awareness
               becomes centered in the events of the present as they manifest, this is
               natural since these are
               the only events that actually exist. The person and the ego are simply 
              dissolving. They don't
               really exist but the illusion that they do becomes less a part of 
              awareness. You don't remember
               and you don't care.</p>
              <p>Let me make a point about Zen breath watching. Most people just 
              don't get it and most Zen 
              schools don't make it any easier for students to get it. There are all 
              kinds of books on Zen 
              meditation, catalogs where you can buy all the cool silk clothes, 
              cushions, gongs, incense and 
              a host of other aids to Zen breath watching. But once you have all that 
              stuff and finally sit 
              your butt down, close your eyes and start watching your breath what 
              exactly are you doing? Why 
              are you doing that? I ask people this all the time and really piss them 
              off, "Why do you 
              meditate? What are you trying to accomplish? Why do you watch your 
              breath?" I have never met 
              anyone that has given me the correct answer.</p>
              <p>The reason they don't know is because they are not enlightened. 
              If they were, then they might
               not even meditate anymore, or they might, it would make no difference. 
              You see, the simple 
              truth that is missed by almost every meditator is this, the act of 
              sitting there watching your 
              breath is enlightenment. That is all. You are not doing something to 
              gain something, just sitting
               there is enlightenment. That still state with calmed mind, just that is
               enlightenment, yet that
               annoying gossip over there interrupting your meditation, just that is 
              enlightenment and that 
              guy flipping you off in commuter traffic, just that is enlightenment. 
              There is no doer, no 
              experiencer, no one who acts. Manifestation emerges, actless, mindless 
              and just that is 
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>People meditate today because it is popular or because they want 
              to have a mystical 
              experience or just relax. The latter reason may actually be the most 
              legitimate for the average 
              person. But no one I know says they meditate because they are 
              deliberately engaging in an 
              actless act, or attempting to resolve a false sense of being into a 
              beingless existence. And of 
              the many meditators out there, I suspect that the majority would be 
              shocked if I told them the 
              guy flipping them off in traffic is more enlightened than they.</p>
              <p>The point I'm trying to make and have been trying to make is that
               enlightenment is so 
              natural and so easy that any attempt at deliberate practice towards it 
              will get you farther 
              from it, yet paradoxically, you have never once not been enlightened and
               no matter how strained
               and deliberate your efforts towards it, you never once acted!</p>
              <p>So in closing, Enlightenment can be talked about, it can be 
              understood, it is not mysterious 
              nor does it need to be cloaked in a secret "Boy's Only" club language. 
              Enlightenment is the 
              feeling/knowing that no one exists including you and that everything 
              that happens does so 
              spontaneously and perfectly. Enlightenment is the feeling/knowing that 
              what exists is 
              Universe/Consciousness, they are the same, U=C. Existence is itself 
              consciousness and that is 
              why there is something rather than nothing. This is the real state of 
              things and because it is 
              so natural, so simple and so obvious, we miss it daily.</p>
