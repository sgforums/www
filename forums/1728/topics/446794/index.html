              Five years ago I had a dream when I was sleeping at night. I was sitting in a train and reading about Buddhism. At a certain stop, two young people (a young guy and a young girl) stepped on the train and came to sit in front and next to me. They were of Chinese origins. They asked me what I was reading, and I said Iâ€™m reading about Buddhism. When I asked them if they know about Buddhism, they started smiling. And then I said to the guy, â€œNamo Amito Fo, do you know Amitabha Buddhaâ€�? And he started smiling more and said â€œlook at my sisterâ€�. I looked at the young woman while she stood up next to me, she started spinning around. The whole environment in the train became transparent and filled with light from the young womanâ€™s body, and then I saw Guan Yin Pusa through her. I looked at the guy and he was also looking at her.  I realized my whole body was vibrating at a very fast a high resonance rate and woke up.
              
              Later on, a Buddhist practitioner told me that the young guy and lady I saw in my dream were most likely Golden Boy and Jade Girl, Guan Yinâ€™s two attendants. I never heard of them before (at least not in this lifetime).
              
              Whatâ€™s weird in fact, is that afterwards I became very ill and became hospitalized and stopped following a lot of the Buddhist precepts which I followed extremely strict for nearly a decade before I had the dream.  Now 5 years later I can almost say that Iâ€™m fully recovered from my illness.
              
              Does someone have some more info about Golden Boy and Jade Girl? I wonder what Chinese literature tells about them? Thanks in advance!
