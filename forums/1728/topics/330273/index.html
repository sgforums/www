              <p>Dear Buddhist Fellow</p>
              <p>I have come across an article posted (probably) by a Muslim in the ST (Strait Times) Discussion Board, which mocked and misrepresented Buddha and Maitreya on the basis of his DAMN STUPID interpretation and extrapolation of buddhist sutra.</p>
              <p>I am DEEPLY DISTURBED by it. I feel the urge and need to counter his claims, but is in no position to do it, as I have limited knowledge of the content of buddhist sutra.</p>
              <p>I hope that fellow buddhists would response with counter arguments here so that I can post it in the ST forum, or even better you are encourage to post directly in the ST forum.</p>
              <p>I have reproduced the entire article below. It may also be viewed in <a href="http://comment.straitstimes.com/showthread.php?t=13417&amp;page=32">http://comment.straitstimes.com/showthread.php?t=13417&amp;page=32</a></p>
              <p>The article is as follows</p>
              <div id="post_message_180927" class="vb_postbit">Careful research would prove that Buddha was probably a Prophet of God , that he actually believed in God and disbelieved in reincarnation. His quotations could be given where postulated the existence of a Being without Whom there can be no escape from suffering(Udana) A Bahai gave much materials to prove that Buddha predicted the coming of Bahaullah although Christians would say that he spoke about Jesus and Muslims would say that he spoke about Muhammad. There is one thing that makes me think that it was Muhammad .Firstly he said that Muhammad unlike himself would be the teacher of thousands , that he would wear a turban and be averse in making images or idols(Ref Jamshid Fozdar"The God of Buddha", Vidyarti "Muhammad in World Scriptures)<br><br>The Prophesy of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in Buddhist Scriptures<br><br>1. Buddha prophesised the advent of a Maitreya: <br><br>A) Almost all Buddhist books contain this prophecy. It is in Chakkavatti Sinhnad Suttanta D. III, 76:<br><br>"There will arise in the world a Buddha named Maitreya (the benevolent one) a holy one, a supreme one, an enlightened one, endowed with wisdom in conduct, auspicious, knowing the universe:<br><br>"What he has realized by his own supernatural knowledge he will publish to this universe. He will preach his religion, glorious in its origin, glorious at its climax, glorious at the goal, in the spirit and the letter. <br><br>He will proclaim a religious life, wholly perfect and thoroughly pure; even as I now preach my religion and a like life do proclaim. He will keep up the society of monks numbering many thousands, even as now I keep up a society of monks numbering many hundreds".<br><br><br>B) According to Sacred Books of the East volume 35 pg. 225: <br><br>"It is said that I am not an only Buddha upon whom the leadership and order is dependent. After me another Buddha maitreya of such and such virtues will come. I am now the leader of hundreds; he will be the leader of thousands ."<br><br><br>C) "According to the Gospel of Buddha by Carus pg. 217 and 218 (From Ceylon sources):[/color]<br><br>"Ananda said to the Blessed One, ‘Who shall teach us when thou art gone?' <br><br>And the Blessed one replied, 'I am not the first Buddha who came upon the earth nor shall I be the last. In due time another Buddha will arise in the world, a holy one, a supremely enlightened one, endowed with wisdom in conduct, auspicious, knowing the universe, an incomparable leader of men, a master of angels and mortals. He will reveal to you the same eternal truths, which I have taught you. He will preach his religion, glorious in its origin, glorious at the climax and glorious at the goal. He will proclaim a religious life, wholly perfect and pure such as I now proclaim. His disciples will number many thousands while mine number many hundreds.'<br>Ananda said, 'How shall we know him?' <br><br>The Blessed one replied, 'He will be known as Maitreya'."<br><br><br>(i) The Sanskrit word ‘Maitreya’ or its equivalent in Pali ‘Metteyya’ means loving, compassionate, merciful and benevolent. It also means kindness and friendliness, sympathy, etc. One Arabic word which is equivalent to all these words is ‘Rahmat’which means mercy. In Surah Al-Anbiya:<br><br>"We sent thee not, but as a mercy for all creatures." [Al-Qur’an 21:107]<br><br>"Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was called the merciful, which is ‘Maitri’.<br><br><br>(ii) The words Mercy and Merciful are mentioned in the Holy Qur’an no less than 409 times. <br><br>(iii) Every chapter of the Glorious Qur’an, except Chapter 9, i.e. Surah Taubah begins with the beautiful formula, 'Bismillah Hir-Rahman Nir-Rahim', which means 'In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful'. <br><br>(iv) The Word Muhammad is also spelt as ‘Mahamet’ or ‘Mahomet’ and in various other ways in different languages. The word ‘Maho’ or ‘Maha’ in Pali and Sanskrit mean Great and Illustrious and ‘Metta’ means mercy. Therefore ‘Mahomet’ means ‘Great Mercy’. <br><br>2. Buddha’s doctrine was Esoteric and Exoteric: [/color]<br><br>According to Sacred Books of the East, volume 11, pg. 36 Maha-Parinibbana Sutta chapter 2 verse 32:<br><br>"I have preached the truth without making any distinction between exoteric and esoteric doctrine, for in respect of truths, Ananda, the Tathagata has no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher, who keeps something back".<br><br>Muhammad (pbuh) on the commandment of Almighty God delivered the message and doctrine without making any distinction between esoteric and exoteric. The Qur'an was recited in public in the days of the Prophet and is being done so till date. The Prophet had strictly forbidden the Muslims from hiding the doctrine<br><br><br>3. Devoted Servitors of the Buddhas: [/color]<br><br>According to Sacred Books of the East volume 11 pg. 97 Maha-Parinibbana Sutta Chapter 5 verse 36:<br><br>"Then the Blessed one addressed the brethren, and said, ‘Whosoever, brethren have been Arahat-Buddhas through the long ages of the past, they were servitors just as devoted to those Blessed ones as Ananda has been to me. And whosoever brethren shall be the Arahat-Buddhas of the future, there shall be servitors as devoted to those Blessed ones as Ananda has been to me’."<br><br>The Servitor of Buddha was Ananda. Muhammad (pbuh) also had a servitor by the name Anas (r.a.) who was the son of Malik. Anas (r.a...) was presented to the Prophet by his parents. Anas (r.a...) relates: "My mother said to him, 'Oh Messenger of God, here is your little servant'." Further Anas relates, "I served him from the time I was 8 years old and the Prophet called me his son and his little beloved". Anas (r.a...) stayed by the Prophet in peace and in war, in safety as well as in danger till the end of his life.<br><br><br>i) Anas (r.a.), even though he was only 11 years old stayed beside the Prophet during the battle of Uhud where the Prophet’s life was in great danger. <br><br>ii) Even during the battle of Honain when the Prophet was surrounded by the enemies who were archers, Anas (r.a...) who was only 16 years old stood by the Prophet.<br><br>Anas (R) can surely be compared with Ananda who stood by Gautam Buddha when the mad elephant approached him.<br><br><br>4. Six Criteria for Identifying Buddha: [/color]<br><br>According to the Gospel of Buddha by Carus pg. 214:<br><br>"The Blessed one said, ‘There are two occasions on which a Tathagata’s appearance becomes clear and exceedingly bright. In the night Ananda, in which a Tathagata attains to the supreme and perfect insight, and in the night in which he passes finally away in that ultra passing which leaves nothing whatever of his earthly existence to remain.’ "<br>According to Gautam Buddha, following are the six criteria for identifying a Buddha.<br><br><br>i)A Buddha attains supreme and perfect insight at night-time. <br><br>ii) On the occasion of his complete enlightenment he looks exceedingly bright <br><br>iii) Buddha dies a natural death. <br><br>iv) He dies at night-time. <br><br>v) He looks exceedingly bright before his death. <br><br>vi) After his death a Buddha ceases to exist on earth.<br><br><br>i) Muhammad (pbuh) attained supreme insight and Prophethood at night-time.<br>According to Surah Dukhan:<br><br>"By the books that makes thing clear – We sent it down during a blessed night."[Al-Qur'an 44:2-3]<br><br>According to Surah Al-Qadar:<br>"We have indeed revealed this (message) in the night of power."[Al-Qur'an 97:1]<br><br><br>ii) Muhammad (pbuh) instantly felt his understanding illumined with celestial light. <br><br>iii) Muhammad (pbuh) died a natural death. <br><br>iv) According to Ayesha (r.a.), Muhammad (pbuh) expired at night-time. When he was dying there was no oil in the lamp and his wife Ayesha (r.a.) had to borrow oil for the lamp. <br><br>v) According to Anas (r.a.), Muhammad (pbuh) looked exceedingly bright in the night of his death. <br><br>vi) After the burial of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) he was never seen again in his bodily form on this earth. <br><br>5. Buddhas are only Preachers:<br><br>According to Dhammapada, Sacred Books of East volume 10 pg., 67:<br><br>"The Jathagatas (Buddhas) are only Preachers."<br><br>The Qur’an says in Surah Ghashiya:<br><br>"Therefore do thou give admonition, for thou art one to admonish. Thou art not one to manage (men's) affairs." [Al-Qur'an 88:21-22] <br><br><br>6. Identification of Maitreya by Buddha: <br><br>According to Dhammapada, Mattaya Sutta, 151:<br><br>"The promised one will be:<br>i) Compassionate for the whole creation<br>ii) A messenger of peace, a peace-maker<br>iii) The most successful in the world.<br><br><br>The Maitreya as a Preacher of morals will be:<br><br>i) Truthful<br>ii) Self-respecting<br>iii) Gentle and noble<br>iv) Not proud<br>v) As a king to creatures<br>vi) An example to others in deeds and in words".<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.drzakirnaik.com/Features/...3/Default.aspx"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #8297c8;">http://www.drzakirnaik.com/Features/...3/Default.aspx</span></a><br><br>Watch lecture of Dr.Zakir Naik:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?searc...ous+Scriptures"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #8297c8;">http://www.youtube.com/results?searc...ous+Scriptures</span></a><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Shall I not inform you of a better act than fasting, alms, and prayers?

              <p>Oh don't worry, these Muslims have made such claims a millionth times without ever actually looking into what the Buddha said regarding Maitreya. All their claims are a total misunderstanding and distortion of the scriptures. There has actually been past topics in this forum which dealt with this.</p>
              <p>First it said,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>His quotations could be given where postulated
                                                      the existence of a Being without Whom there can be no escape from
                                                      suffering(Udana)</em></span></p>
              <p>Where? I suppose it's refering to this passage:</p>
              <blockquote> <em><strong>There is, monks, an unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated. If
                              there were not that unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated, there
                              would not be the case that emancipation from the born -- become -- made
                              -- fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an
                              unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated, emancipation from the
                              born -- become -- made -- fabricated is discerned. </strong></em></blockquote>
              <p> But where exactly does it postulate the existence of an external Being? There has not been one single instance in every Buddhist scriptures that the Buddha postulated an external creator. Never. On the other hand, there has been several scriptures which the Buddha outrightly rejected the notion that there is an external creator.</p>
              <p>If the Buddha was refering the 'Unborn' to an external agent/creator, he would have said so. But he didn't. And even if someone made such a claim in Buddhism, that would be a false, fabricated view because this would be in complete opposition to the fundamental Buddhist tenets. And the Buddha is only concerned about our suffering and the end of our suffering. Speculations about creation, he said, does nothing to bring us closer to our spiritual goals.</p>
              <p>In fact that sutta says 'Unbecome', 'Unborn', so it definitely isn't a being. For all beings are merely conditioned phenomena. In Buddhism there is no 'Self' or 'Being' with inherent existence, each 'individual being' is only conditioned phenomena -- arising
                          and passing thoughts, sounds, sights, taste, etc, within or apart from
                          which no 'self' could be found. To claim that there is a existing
                          'Being' that is unconditioned is utterly in contradiction with the core
                          teachings of Anatta (No-Self), against a dharma seal, and thus in
                          fundamental contradiction to Buddhist tenets and teachings.</p>
              <p>Buddha has never taught an external creator, and he taught,</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world
                                                      entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why does he order such misfortune<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br> And he such inequity and injustice create?<br> If the creator of the world entire<br> They call God, of every being be the Lord<br> Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br> Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead what is being spoken here is the Deathless Element, the Unconditioned, it is not a Being (which will be utterly conditioned.).</p>
              <p>We can never find the Deathless outside us, it will never be found. We can only attend to the Deathless, and that attending to the deathless is called Supramundane Consciousness.</p>
              <p><a href="https://archives.deepspring.org/node/434">https://archives.deepspring.org/node/434</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q: I have a terminology question, also. Awareness—is that the same as the deathless? Deathless as in Small Boat, Big 
                              Mountain? The book by Ajahn Amaro on the natural great perfection.</p>
              <p>Aaron: The deathless is a way of speaking of the Unconditioned. The
                              Unborn, Undying, the Deathless. The deathless is an object, although
                              supramundane object. Every thing is an object whether it is a mundane
                              thing or a supramundane thing. That which perceives the object is
                              consciousness, mundane consciousness or supramundane consciousness. I
                              use awareness as a synonym for supramundane consciousness. This helps
                              people to understand it in terms of resting in awareness and dzogchen
                              practice. Supramundane consciousness and awareness are the same.</p>
              <p>Awareness is not a thing. Consciousness is not a thing. These are active and perceive. So awareness can take the deathless as 
                              an object. Mundane consciousness cannot take the deathless as an object.</p>
              <p>--------</p>
              <p>Another way to put it, as Ajahn Amaro explains,</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2003/winter/ajahnamaro.html">http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2003/winter/ajahnamaro.html</a></p>
              <p>In the Theravada teachings, the Buddha also talked about this quality
                              in terms of "unsupported consciousness." This means that there is
                              cognition, there is knowing, but it's not landing anyplace; it's not
                              abiding anywhere. "Attending to the deathless" and "unsupported
                              consciousness" are somewhat synonymous. They are like descriptions of
                              the same tree, from different angles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In describing unsupported consciousness, the Buddha taught:</p>
              <ul>
              Wherever there is something that is intended, something that is
                              acted upon or something that lies dormant, then that becomes the basis
                              for consciousness to land. And where consciousness lands, that then is
                              the cause for confusion, attachment, becoming and rebirth, and so on.<br><br> But if there is nothing intended, acted upon or lying latent, then
                              consciousness has no basis to land upon. And having no basis to land,
                              consciousness is released. One recognizes, 'Consciousness, thus
                              unestablished, is released.' Owing to its staying firm, the heart is
                              contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated. Not agitated,
                              such a one realizes complete, perfect nibbana within themselves.
                              (Samyutta Nikaya 12.38 and 22.53) 
              </ul>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>It's that simple. This is talking about Nirvana, it has nothing to do with an external creator.</p>
              <p>Will reply more later...</p>

              the General Theory I am discussing, infers a final cause, or source,
              either logically or temporally, or both, from which emerge all
              phenomena. If the General Theory does infer this, then rendering the
              General Theory with the term “dependent” would be accurate. I say this
              because in the monotheistic traditions, as well as in the platonic
              traditions, all things exist dependently; but what the monotheistic
              tradition means by this is that all things exist by the grace of an
              ultimate source, and that source is God.</h4>

              <h4>In addition, there exist very good historical reasons for rejecting the
                                                                  idea, in a Buddhist context, for an ultimate source interpretation of the

                                                                  story. Instead, Buddhism frequently refers to existence as beginningless

                                                                  derived from the central role of the General Theory.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The
              lack of a creation mythos in Buddhism reflects the General Theory’s
              focus on the appearance of things due to the existence of other things.
              Those other things, in turn, exist due to the appearance of other
              things, which are also existing due to other things, etc. This
              generates an infinite regress, which is logically self-referentially
              consistent, and has no beginning and no end. Notice also that the
              General Theory does not require the intercession of an ouside agency in
              order for this river of relationships to begin. Because the Buddha
              considered the General Theory as an elucidation of the very nature of
              things and existence as such, no special catalyst for this onward
              flowing is necessary. The location, therefore, of the source for the
              appearance of things is simply other things, spread out over all of
              existence, both in time and in space. In some of the ancient Indian
              exegeses they refer to this as “unlocated nirvana”; <em>unlocated</em> because this

                                                                  and its realization which brings about the peace of the cessation of all

              said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get
              enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas
              (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning --
              whether this teaching actually helps us. If it does, then we should put
              it to practice.</p>
              <p>When
              we truly realise the truth of Dependent Origination, the question of
              Creator/Creation will no longer arise, because we understood the
              principle in which everything arises and pass away -- which is by
              conditioned 'genesis'. By realising the nature of reality (empty of
              self and phenomena, dependent arising) we will also be liberated from
              all sufferings of samsara and the cycle of rebirth.</p>

              <p>Now the next thing, about all those who claimed that so and so is equivalent to the Buddhist Maitreya, obviously never ever looked into what the Buddha said about the Maitreya.</p>
              <p>You can look at the prophecy made by Buddha below, and see does which aspect does any of these so called 'Maitreyas' fulfill. Almost none. Are people now living till an age of 84000 years? Is the whole world now under the rule of a singer universal ruler that rules not only this planet but 3 other planets? Are the people now all completely freed from "<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Greed,

Are there no more four seasons? Did the 'Maitreya' teach more than 9 billion people at each of three different dharma sessions? (making up 28.2 Billion people -- our world population is currently just a small fraction of that) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Is there no more poverty and hunger today? </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Are there no more illnesses and diseases? Are there no more natural disasters today? Does palaces and houses miraculously appear and the grounds always remain filth-free? </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Do our grounds</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> produce
                                  different kinds of precious gems that can casually be handpicked by

              <p>Does the Maitreya have the 32 major physical characters and 80 minor physical characters of a Buddha? Does that Maitreya have a majestic golden skin colour? Did that Maitreya renounce worldly life to cultivate as a monk and eventually attain Enlightenment under a Bodhi Tree 7 days later?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the world today is totally different from what the Buddha prophecised when Maitreya would come. The Maitreya prophecised is also completely different from all the so called 'Maitreyas' we know today. Maitreya would come only after 5.67 billion years later according to Buddhist scriptures.</p>

                                                  This level precedes the attainment of Buddhahood. He is currently in Tusita

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'Maitreya' is his

                                                  there are people who know him as the 'Bodhisattva of Loving-Kindness'.

                                                  to his country take 'Ajita' to be his family name and Maitreya to be his 
                                                  given name, as is the way in the West, where it is customary to have the 
                                                  given name before the family name. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya Bodhisattva 
                                                  has been cultivating through aeons of kalpas. Distant kalpas ago, his 
                                                  name had been the 'Immortal of All Wisdom' (the Immortal Sarvajna). During 
                                                  the time of the 'Ancient Maitreya Buddha', he had been so deeply moved 
                                                  when he heard the discourse delivered by the Ancient Maitreya Buddha on 
                                                  the sutra of 'Compassionate Mind Samadhi', that he immediately vowed to 
                                                  learn to be like Maitreya, to become Maitreya, to emulate the predecessor 
                                                  Buddha, to practise the Bodhisattva Way, to enlighten all sentient beings, 
                                                  and even to become a Buddha in the future. For this reason, he has retained 
                                                  the name 'Maitreya' through all these aeons of kalpas past.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Just before Sakyamuni 
                                                  Buddha entered into Nirvana, Maitreya Bodhisattva returned to his own 
                                                  hometown, sat cross-legged at his birthplace and passed away. At that 
                                                  moment, his body radiated a splendidly brilliant purple golden aura rarely 
                                                  ever seen in this world. He was then reborn into Tusita Heaven. 'Tusita' 
                                                  means 'contented'. Where the five desires of pleasure are concerned, celestial 
                                                  beings born in this heaven are contented and satisfied. However, Maitreya 
                                                  Bodhisattva is not there to indulge himself in pleasure; rather, he is 
                                                  the Dharma Master in the celestial palace, and he guides and enlightens 
                                                  all the celestial beings living there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Tusita Heaven is of 
                                                  a different temporal dimension from that of our world. One day and night 
                                                  in this heaven is 400 years in our human world on Earth, and one year 
                                                  in Tusita Heaven is 140,000 Earth years. The celestial life span of Maitreya 
                                                  Bodhisattva is 4,000 years, which is equivalent to 5.67 billion years 
                                                  on Earth at that time. This length of time is going to pass before Maitreya 
                                                  Bodhisattva returns to this world to attain Buddhahood. This is the reason 
                                                  why all Buddhists now address Maitreya Bodhisattva as the 'To-be-born 
                                                  Honoured Maitreya Buddha'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'To-be' infers 'future'. 
                                                  It also implies that it will definitely be Maitreya who comes, and no 
                                                  other Buddha! It refers to a future event. But when exactly in the future 
                                                  and in which country will this great Maitreya Bodhisattva be born into 
                                                  this world to attain Buddhahood? Our Earth goes through four main stages 
                                                  of Formation, Existence, Destruction and Void. These four stages comprise 
                                                  80 normal kalpas which make one great kalpa. Each stage will take the period 
                                                  of one medium kalpa, which is equivalent to 20 normal kalpas. Starting 
                                                  from an average human life span of 84,000 years, the life expectancy is 
                                                  reduced at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average human 
                                                  life span is ten years. The process then reverses: the average human life 
                                                  span is increased at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average 
                                                  human life span returns to 84,000 years. This cycle of a decreasing and 
                                                  then increasing human life span constitutes one normal kalpa.</span></p>

                                                  the 20 normal kalpas of the Formation Stage, there were no Buddhas born. 
                                                  The arrival of Buddhas only started during the eighth normal kalpa of the 
                                                  Existence Stage. Sakyamuni Buddha came to this world during the ninth 
                                                  normal kalpa, and Maitreya will only arrive in the tenth normal kalpa when 
                                                  the human life span commences its descent from 84,000 years. When that 
                                                  happens, he will be honoured 'Maitreya' and will be the successor to Sakyamuni 
                                                  Buddha. At that time, the world will be a prosperous, peaceful and happy 
                                                  place. This is the reason people will address him as the 'Prosperous Buddha' 
                                                  or 'Happy Buddha'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya is a blessed 
                                                  Buddha. At the time when he arrives to be born, the earth will have gone 
                                                  through many changes. Mountains, rivers, cliffs and gorges will have disappeared, 
                                                  and most parts of the Earth will have become flat plains. The seas will 
                                                  be calm and the soil fertile, so there will be many natural recreational

                                                  seasons. Beautiful flowers will blossom everywhere and everything will

                                                  will be free from sickness. There will be no natural disasters. Everyone 
                                                  will be kind, good-natured, and free of evil thoughts and behaviour. Greed,

                                                  all will not exist. Everyone will realise the wonderful practice of cultivating 
                                                  the three pure karmas of body, speech and mind. They will exhibit equality 
                                                  in thinking and will not discriminate. They will distance from disputes 
                                                  and will be amicable and joyous with each another. They will utter good

                                                  for clothing, weaving will not be needed, since soft delicate garments 
                                                  of different styles will grow from celestial garment trees on earth. People 
                                                  can help themselves to these for clothing. Palaces and houses will miraculously 
                                                  appear, and the ground filth-free. As for latrines, whenever people need 
                                                  to relieve themselves, the ground will automatically open up to receive 
                                                  their waste and then close up afterward. The ground will produce different 
                                                  kinds of precious gems that can casually be handpicked by anyone. Admiring 
                                                  and playing with these gems, people will say, "I've heard that in past

                                                  over such gems and precious stones. They were imprisoned and suffered 
                                                  all sorts of distress. Now these gems and precious stones are like tiles 
                                                  and stones which no one needs to guard over. This really is a pure and 
                                                  peaceful world."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At that time, even 
                                                  though the world will consist of many normal countries, only one big country 
                                                  will be the common ruler. On the Earth will be a vast plain, covering

                                                  There will exist a big city named Ketumati City (é¸¡ å¤´ åŸŽ ), spanning 
                                                  500 Li from east to west, and 280 Li from north to south. The land is 
                                                  flat and expansive and well populated with people. The streets are neat 
                                                  and orderly. In the sky above, there will be a dragon king named 'Water 
                                                  Radiance', drizzling fragrant water at night and maintaining breezy sunny 
                                                  weather during the day. In the city, a Yaksa (ç½— æ�€ ä»Ž , Demon) by the 
                                                  name of 'Leaf-Flower', will appear in the middle of the night to serve 
                                                  the people; removing the filth from the city, sweeping and cleaning, and 
                                                  sprinkling the ground with perfumes so that the city will be very clean 
                                                  and fragrant. Dragons, deities and ghosts will work for the benefit of 
                                                  human beings. They neither need offerings to be made to them nor do they 
                                                  need to be worshipped, as such superstitious practices will no longer 
                                                  exist. The climate and environment will be favourable; the citizens gentle 
                                                  and amiable; and ghosts and deities will provide their support and protection. 
                                                  These conditions effect the birth of a 'Turning-Wheel Saint King' (è½¬

                                                  Buddha-dharma to govern and guide his subjects. He has the Golden Wheel

                                                  the Minister of Treasure. He will secure the city with these treasures, 
                                                  rather than with conventional swords and batons. The place will be carefree 
                                                  and joyous, and freedom, peace and equality will prevail.</span></p>

                                                  the treasures of the world are gathered and stored in four normal countries 
                                                  controlled by Saint King Rang-qu: the first location is the Yi-luo-bo 
                                                  (ä¼Š</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">ç½—é’µ</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                                                  great treasury of Qian-tuo-yue Country (ä¹¾é™€ è¶Š å›½ ), the second is the 
                                                  Ban-chou (èˆ¬ ç»¸ </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                                                  great treasury of Mi-ti-luo Country (å¼¥ æ�� ç½— å›½), the third is the great 
                                                  treasury of Xiang-lai-chi-da Country (é¡¹ èµ– å�± è¾¾ å›½ ), and the fourth 
                                                  is the Rang-qu great treasury of Bo-luo-na Country (æ³¢ ç½— æ�º å›½ ). The 
                                                  quantities of precious gems and exquisite items stored in these four treasuries 
                                                  are too numerous to be counted. All items stored in the Rang-qu Treasury 
                                                  at Bo-luo-na Country are treasures of tribute that King Rang-qu receives 
                                                  from all over the world. Hence, the treasury is named after the Saint 
                                                  King in commemoration. Nonetheless, everything in the four treasuries 
                                                  still belongs to the humanity of the world. The King does not consider 
                                                  them his personal possessions. The personnel managing the treasures are 
                                                  entrusted with the responsibility of helping and aiding others. Whenever 
                                                  they learn of poor people in the world, they report to the Saint King 
                                                  and then the treasure is generously used for aid. Any such act of generosity 
                                                  toward the people brings great joy to the Saint King's heart. At this 
                                                  time, people in the world have no worry regarding food, clothing, housing, 
                                                  transport, recreation, bearing and raising children and education. Those 
                                                  considered 'poor' are only but those living in the outskirts who do not 
                                                  have precious ornaments to adorn themselves with. ('poor' only to this 
                                                  extent) Whenever the Saint King sees men and women, young and old, regardless 
                                                  of racial skin colour, with dignified, healthy bodies, upright, bright 
                                                  and pleasant countenances, he will be very satisfied.</span></p>

                                                  virtuous Saint King has the best Prime Minister by the name of 'Subrahmana' 
                                                  (ä¿® æ¢µ æ‘© ), a good friend of the Saint King in his youth. He is very 
                                                  learned and outstanding in his talents, and more knowledgeable than anyone 
                                                  else. He has a transcending perspective and remarkable wisdom. And he 
                                                  is compassionate in helping others. Both the Saint King and Subrahmana 
                                                  possess upright countenance and healthy good-looking physiques. They are 
                                                  both young and capable. Among the world's women of virtue and beauty, 
                                                  Subrahmana's wife, Brahmavati (æ¢µ æ‘© è¶Š ), is the most intelligent, wise, 
                                                  virtuous, moral, knowledgeable and capable. She is deeply compassionate, 
                                                  dignified, and exquisite, unparalleled anywhere on Earth, just like the

                                                  scent of sandalwood. She has not any of the 84 types of pretentiousness 
                                                  of common womenfolk. In her entire life, she is never sick nor does she 
                                                  suffer any pain or tragedy. She is always free from any distracting and 
                                                  wild thoughts, distress and bitter melancholy. All of this is the consequence 
                                                  of her previous lives' cultivation of pure karma of body, speech and mind. 
                                                  In their previous lifetimes throughout aeons of past kalpas, everything 
                                                  of Subrahmana's and Brahmavati's thoughts, deeds and speech, comprise 
                                                  moral work, cultivating, practising giving and performing charity for 
                                                  the masses. This has resulted in their now being the prime ministerial 
                                                  family. Not only are they well honoured and respected by all the people, 
                                                  but even those living in heaven praise them highly and consider them quite 
                                                  rare and extraordinary.</span></p>

                                                  and he would be better off renouncing the world to cultivate as a monk. 
                                                  And so, at the outskirts of Ketumati City, in the exceptionally resplendent

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Throughout Maitreya 
                                                  Buddha's entire life of delivering discourses on the Dharma, he guides 
                                                  and enlightens infinite numbers of sentient beings. Among the various 
                                                  Dharma discourses, there are 3 great assemblies: The first assembly teaches 
                                                  and guides 9.6 billion people, the second assembly, 9.4 billion people, 
                                                  and the third assembly, 9.2 billion people. These assemblies are the highly 
                                                  renowned 'Dragon-Flower Triple Assemblies' of the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Thus during this period, 
                                                  the Saha world is transformed into the pure land of Maitreya Buddha. All 
                                                  who have been guided and enlightened attain Arahathood. The numbers of 
                                                  those who receive guidance and deliverance in assemblies in the heavens, 
                                                  human realm and elsewhere are infinitely many. It is not by chance that 
                                                  those who have been guided and delivered by the Buddha attain enlightenment 
                                                  instantly. Rather it is truly the result of their own cultivation of blessings, 
                                                  morality and wisdom through aeons of kalpas. During the Period of Pure 
                                                  Dharma, the Semblance Period, and the End of Dharma Period of the era 
                                                  of Sakyamuni Buddha, most of them had planted their virtuous roots, established 
                                                  extensive links with the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, learned and practised 
                                                  Buddhism, performed good deeds for many others, observed the precepts 
                                                  and recited the Buddha's name, and spread the Dharma and benefited sentient 
                                                  beings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When Maitreya Buddha 
                                                  has lived a full life of 84,000 years, he enters Nirvana. And the legacy 
                                                  of his Dharma continues for 84,000 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The above scenario 
                                                  is an overview of the future, when Maitreya Buddha arrives to be born 
                                                  in our human world and attains Buddhahood. Sakyamuni Buddha narrated this 
                                                  at Anathapindika Park in Jetavana Grove of Sravasti, to an assembly of 
                                                  1,500 disciples. Ananda, with a bare right shoulder, knelt upon his right 
                                                  knee, and asked with sincerity and deliberation, </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"Enlightened Tathagata 
                                                  of profoundly penetrating wisdom, there is nothing unknown to you. Of 
                                                  the past, present and the future, you understand clearly and entirely. 
                                                  You are well aware of the names and honourable titles of all the past 
                                                  Buddhas, and the numbers of followers, disciples and Bodhisattvas. Whether 
                                                  it be one kalpa, or a hundred, or innumerable kalpas, your observation 
                                                  is complete. Further, you know the kings, ministers and citizens, telling 
                                                  them apart by their individual names. As for today's world, you have full 
                                                  knowledge of the present numbers of territories and the extent of national 
                                                  boundaries. Disciples following you eagerly wish to hear about the distant 
                                                  future to come, about Maitreya's appearance and attainment of Buddhahood, 
                                                  all the changes that will occur, how bountiful and joyous the state of 
                                                  the Buddha world will be, and how much more time is to pass before then."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Time and again, Ananda 
                                                  humbly requested. And in response to this plea that Ananda made on behalf 
                                                  of all those present at the assembly, the compassionate Buddha spoke this 
                                                  prophetic sutra. The 'Sutra of the Coming of Maitreya' has been well documented 
                                                  and referenced in many other sutras.</span></p>

                                                  on the right path. We should extensively establish virtuous links with

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This quotation
                      begins the discourse in which the Buddha describes the coming of the
                      next Buddha, Metteyya.[45] The Buddha first describes the ideal
                      conditions that existed on earth long ago when there were a succession
                      of seven Wheel-turning Monarchs. Eventually, there was a king who
                      neglected to provide for the poor. As a consequence, theft arose in the
                      world. Gradually, people became more and more immoral and killed others.
                      Because of this, their life span declined from eighty thousand years to
                      forty thousand years. Then people began to tell lies, and the human life
                      span declined to twenty thousand years. Next, malicious speech became
                      prevalent, and the life span decreased to ten thousand years. Then
                      sexual misconduct became prevalent, with the result that people lived
                      for five thousand years. Harsh speech and frivolous talk became
                      prevalent, and people lived for two and a half thousand years and two
                      thousand years. With the advent of covetousness and ill will, the life
                      span declined to one thousand years. When people began to entertain
                      wrong beliefs, their life span decreased to five hundred years. Then
                      three things became rampant: incest, unnatural greed, and
                      homo-sexuality.[46] As a result, the human life span decreased to two
                      hundred and fifty years and two hundred years. Then there was a lack of
                      filial duty towards parents, failure to fulfil duties towards religious
                      leaders (samanas and brahmanas), and failure to respect community
                      leaders; and the life span decreased to one hundred years. This was the
                      human life span at the time of Buddha Gotama. When the life span is
                      shorter than a hundred years, there can be no Buddha in the world.[47]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddha explained that immorality
                      will continue to increase and the human life span will continue to
                      decrease until it is only ten years. Girls will be married at five years
                      of age. At that time, people who have no respect for their parents, for
                      religious leaders, or for community leaders will be honoured and
                      praised. Promiscuity will be so common, human beings will be like
                      animals. Animosity, ill will, and hatred will be so strong, people will
                      want to kill the members of their own family. There will be a seven-day
                      war with great slaughter. But some people will hide for the seven days,
                      and afterwards they will rejoice to see those who have survived. They
                      will determine to stop killing, and their life spans will increase to
                      twenty years. Seeing this, they will undertake to keep other moral
                      precepts, and gradually the human life span will increase again.</span><span> </span></p>

              As one muslim here, I've been receiving these type of chain e-mails for so long already. It is as interesting to read as how other famous historical figures were all secretly professing the muslim belief and so lend credence to the muslim faith. Goethe, Shakespeare.. and even Micheal Jackson.
              
              You really shouldn't worry about silly polemics like this.
