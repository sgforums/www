              <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/sjba-wesak.jpg"><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/sjba-wesak.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><em>How will you mark Wesak today?</em></div>
              <p><br> Today is Buddha Day, or, to give it its Pali name <em>Visakha Puja</em>, 
              also known as Wesak. This is the day when Buddhists across the globe 
              celebrate the birth, enlightenment, and death of the historical Buddha, 
              Shakyamuni. Not all Buddhist traditions celebrate Buddha Day today, but 
              many do, and here in Thailand it is the main Buddhist festival of the 
              year (and there are lots!). But why bother to commemorate the Buddha's 
              life and enlightenment in this way? Well, it is an occasion that we can 
              use skillfully to encourage reflection on his life and teachings in 
              relation to our own existence. And, what's more, it is an opportunity to
               consider the debt that we owe him for showing us the way to liberation 
              from suffering.<br> <br> The Buddha's birth is a special event, of course, as it is not often 
              that a fully-awakened one is born into the world. If Shakyamuni Buddha 
              was never born, then the Buddhadharma would never have been established 
              for us to use to awaken with.Similarly, if the Buddha had not realized 
              the cessation of suffering under the Bodhi Tree, then we too would not 
              know how to do the same. Furthermore, his apparent demise shows us that 
              rebirth and continual suffering of these separated selves can be 
              transcended, allowing the spacious awareness that we truly are to shine 
              forth. Homage to the Blessed, Noble, and Perfectly Awakened One, indeed!<br> <br> To mark this day of days, we need not go to a temple and take part in 
              rituals if we cannot or would rather not. It's up to us to find 
              appropriate ways to express our recognition and gratitude to the Buddha 
              for what he has done for us. Perhaps this might be a simple ceremony 
              conducted in front of a small shrine at home, or maybe a brief 
              reflection on his qualities and teachings coupled with meditation will 
              suffice. Of course, if we do decide to attend a full-blown public ritual
               with all the trimmings, then that can be wonderful too. As long as it's
               respectful and from the heart, go for it!<br> <br> Another way to mark Buddha Day is to recognize the Buddha within. This, 
              again, is best attempted with a modicum of decorum and a certain 
              sincerity. Quietly looking home at where you are looking from, you might
               notice that where others see your face, and where you feel it, there is
               also an awareness that although empty in itself, is nevertheless full 
              of all that you experience. This knowing is not your knowing as 
              so-and-so, nor does it belong to somebody else, such as a god. It is 
              what it is: clarity gazing upon the world. Staying with this 
              unconditioned wakefulness, every conditioned thing or process can be 
              observed to arise, exist, and end, including all these thoughts, 
              memories, emotions, and sensations that we normally take to be 'me.' 
              What better way than this, whether we take part in ceremonies or not, to
               acknowledge the Buddha. Happy Buddha Day!</p>
