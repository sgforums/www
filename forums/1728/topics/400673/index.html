              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm Louis and I'm Roman Catholic.</p>
              <p>It is sad that such a thing is happening in Christian churches.</p>
              <p>We don't dare to engage in such activities.</p>
              <p>Yes, we do make contributions to our church but it is our choice how much we want to contribute. We are not forced to bring a new friend every week. We are not required to dress so nice nice but of course to dress decently (no shorts, mini-skirts or slippers) But T-shirt and jeans.</p>
              <p>If our friends want to join the catholic church, they have to undergo a one year course for non-catholics. In that course, they will learnt about the bible, history of the Catholic church and how the catholic community lives.</p>
              <p>After that, they still have to confirm that they really want to join the faith. If they still want, then they will be baptised as a Catholic. After that, they will have to attend sunday service and go for further classes in preparation to be "confirmed" as a catholic. In this final ceremony, they will receive the seven gifts of the holy spirit making them full-fledged catholics.</p>
              <p>After that, they will continue to attend sunday service and participate in many of the holy celebrations.</p>
              <p>As a catholic, your rights as an individual are respected. You are not forced to join any of the church activities if you don't want. Of course, it would be better if you can join.</p>
              <p>As a catholic, you are not necesarily bind to one church. That means if you stay in Woodlands, it does not mean you must attend the service in that church. You are free to go to any of the catholic churches in Singapore to worship God.</p>
              <p>In church, you do not need to dress so nice nice but dress decently (so no sleeveless shirt, no mini-skirts, no slippers, no shorts).</p>
              <p>Everything is voluntary and comes from your desire to serve God.</p>

              <p>Seems it is true that for the sake and name of MONEY, they from
              City Harvest can simply ignore the verses (taken
              from thread by TS) below:   </p>
              <p>"<strong>You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the
              form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth
              beneath, or that is in the water under the earth</strong>."<br> "<strong>You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the
              Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity
              of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who
              reject me."</strong><br> "<strong>You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord
              your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his
              name</strong>."</p>

              <p>Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not 
              believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do 
              not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your 
              religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of 
              your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have
               been handed down for many generations. But after observation and 
              analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is 
              conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and 
              live up to it.</p>
