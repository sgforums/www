              <p><span style="color: black;">It is said in the prediction of Urgyen Dechen
              Lingpa, "in the future in Tibet, on the east of the Nine Peaked
              Mountain, in the sacred Buddhafield of the self-originated Vajravarahi,
              there will be an emanation of Drogben, of royal lineage, named Jnana.
              His beneficial activities are in accord with the Vajrayana although he
              conducts himself differently, unexpectedly, as a little boy with
              astonishing intelligence. He will either discover new Terma or preserve
              the old Terma. Whoever has connections with him will be taken to Ngayab
              Ling </span></p>

                        the Nyingma tradition. Thus from the Mindroling Vajracarya, Dorzim Namdrol 
                        Gyatso, he learned the rituals, mandalas, songs, dance and music of 
                        Terdak Lingpa, along with many other teachings. There were many other 
                        great teachers from whom Rinpoche had received all the teachings of 
                        the Nyingma School.  <br> <br> From Togden Tenpa, he received both the wang and lung of the "Dzogchen 
                        Nyingtig Yabshi", which was the lineage of the great Khenpo Nyoshul 
                        Lungtok Tenpai Nyima. From Jedrung Rinpoche of Riwoche, he received 
                        the "Kangyur" lung, "Dam Ngag Dzod", the seventeen 
                        "Sangchen Ngepai" tantras, "Nyingthig Yabshi", and 
                        so on, as well as all the teachings of Dzogpachenpo. He received them 
                        completely and was considered his teacher's heart son. From Tulku Kunzang 
                        Thekchog Tenpai Gyaltsan, he also received many deep and important teachings. 
                        From Ngagtsun Gendun Gyatso, Rinpoche received all the teachings of 
                        Pema Lingpa, the "Dzod Dun" (the Seven Treasures of Longchenpa, 
                        1308-1363), among many others. <br> Furthermore, from the great Khenpo Jamde, Pande Odzer (disciple of Mipham 
                        Rinpoche, 1848 - 1912), Rinpoche received the "Nyingma Kama", 
                        "<a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Kabgye.htm">Kagye</a>d" empowerments, <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/sangye_lingpa.htm">Sangye 
                        Lingpa</a>'s "<a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/sangye_lingpa.htm">Lama Gongdu</a>" 
                        and "Sangwa Nyingpo" according to the Zur tradition; as well 
                        as the cycle of the "Osel Sangwa Nyingthig". He also received 
                        many tantra commentaries like the great commentaries of Mipham himself, 
                        the "Nyingthig Yabshi", and so on. <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/chadral_rinpoche.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="160" align="right">Rinpoche 
                        considered Khenpo Jamde as his second kindest Lama and took many vows 
                        of Pratimoksha, of Bodhisattva, and of Vajrayana from him. He also received 
                        teachings from the great beings who were disciples of the great Khenpo 
                        Nyoshul Lungtok Tenpai Nyima: Khenpo Ngawang Palzang, Chatral Sangye 
                        Dorje, Lama Urgyen Rigdzin, Kathok Chagtsa Tulku, Pulung Sangye Tulku, 
                        and Gyurme Phendei Ozer, among others. He received teachings from them 
                        and he also gave teachings to them.</p>
              <p class="redtext">Rinpoche's Great Realizations</p>
              <p class="indextext">Taking his practice very seriously, Dudjom Rinpoche went 
                        to a secret place called Kenpa Jong (or Phuntsok Gatsel), and accomplished 
                        the Dorje Phurba of "Dudjom Namchag Pudri". At Buddha Tse 
                        Phuk, Rinpoche did Tse-Drup and his Tse-chang boiled. He further received 
                        the auspicious signs when he was practicing the gongter of Dudul Drollo. 
                        When in Paro Tak-Tshang (the Tiger's Nest), Dudjom Rinpoche rediscovered 
                        the "Pudri Rekpung", the "Tsokye Thugthig" and the 
                        "Khandro Thugthig", for which he wrote down the main parts. 
                        In short, in all these important holy places where he practiced, Rinpoche 
                        always experienced the signs of accomplishment.</p>
