              sociologist Michael Biggs, the history of self-immolation as a modern protest
              tactic begins on the 11 June 1963 in South Vietnam.</span></p>

              Quang Duc sat down in the lotus position, crossing his legs. Some other monks
              poured petrol over him and then he set himself on fire and burned to death
              while sitting in this position.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>It was an act of protest over
              discrimination towards Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government.
              Importantly, it was organised as a spectacle and was deliberately intended to
              attract the attention of the media. And many foreign journalists present because
              of the Vietnam War did witness the event.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'The regime was headed by
              Catholics—so the Catholic minority were discriminating against the Buddhist
              majority and that was the original reason for this movement. But of course his
              action, because it was so unexpected, because it was so dramatic, because it
              was so terrible, then got the attention of the world, particularly through the
              iconic image taken by Malcolm Browne,' Biggs says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>That image (above) won the

              of global attention, we find that this extraordinary tactic of burning yourself
              as an act of protest becomes taken up in other countries by other people.'</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>While a suicide bomber unequivocally
              intends to harm other people as well as taking his or her own life, the suicide
              protester is committing a more ambiguous act.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Simanti Lahiri, a political
              scientist at Villanova University in the USA, says that when people utilise
              this kind of protest they tend to talk about it in terms of non-violence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'They see themselves as part of
              a larger tradition of non-violent resistance, but that said, these are
              intensely violent acts they are perpetrating on their own bodies,' she says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'Suicide protest has the
              ability to harness both the morality of non-violent action with the visceral
              nature of violent action.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>According to Lahiri, suicide
              protest also treads a line between being regarded as committed or crazy, and
              this depends, to a large extent, on how social movements or organisations talk
              about the act afterwards.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'If they don't discuss why they
              were using it and talk about the individuals that did it, trying to create
              emotional narratives, it's very easy for these acts to be misunderstood or
              ignored or dismissed as simply somebody who was depressed or somebody who
              psychologically wanted to commit suicide, as opposed to a public act of
              protest,' she says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Religious and cultural
              traditions behind suicide protest</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Biggs says there is the
              Buddhist belief in renouncing the body and transcending its limitations when a
              stage of perfection is reached. There had been historical cases of monks
              setting themselves alight, but as a religious act, rather than a political one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In Hinduism there is also the
              notion of fire as a purifying means of disposing of a body, whereas Christians
              tend to regard death by fire as horrific and repugnant. In the Christian
              tradition fire is associated with hell. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Lahiri, whose study of suicide
              protest has focused on South Asia, had assumed that it was very much an Indian
              practice (in the 1990s there were waves of such protests in India). But she
              discovered examples from all over the world, showing there's more to
              self-immolation than cultural tradition.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In 1969, a 21-year-old student
              called Jan Palach set himself alight in Prague. By his side was a letter
              explaining that self-immolation was the only protest left now that both Czechs
              and Slovaks had reached the edge of hopelessness. Palach became a hero and
              martyr to the cause.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'Jan Palach's case had such
              resonance, despite the fact that it didn't come out of any strong cultural
              background,' Biggs says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>He attributes this to the
              widespread anti-Soviet sentiment of most Czechoslovakians at the time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'It was at a time when the
              repression of ordinary protest had meant that there were very little other
              forms of voice that people could use to express their dislike of the
              occupation,' he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Another, more recent act of
              self-immolation also had a powerful (though probably unintended) impact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In Tunisia, Mohamed Bouazizi
              set himself alight at the end of 2010 and died from his wounds early in 2011.
              He was an unlicensed vegetable seller whose cart and goods were confiscated by
              the local police.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>After his livelihood was taken
              away, he tried to appeal to the municipal government. When this failed, he set
              himself on fire outside the main government building in Sidi Bouzid.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'Bouazizi didn't seem to have,
              as far as we can tell, any broader cause for which he was sacrificing himself,'
              Biggs says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>'[It] seemed to catalyse
