It is quite amazing to read that there are reasons for what I am experiencing in my life. The environment I am born in and so on.<br><br>Let me go on to talk about how I started to slowly believe strongly in the Buddhist concept of Cause and Effect, even though there are many people out there now who still challenge the Buddhist concept of cause and effect and that every living being has gone through countless rebirths.<br><br>Since small, I have hardly been good at anything. For boys, this might be fatal. In school, either you have to be good at sports or studies or cool in character to have friends. Not only was I not good at any of those, I frankly suck at sports and outdoor games.<br><br>I found that I didn't have a group which I could go to. There was no one that would say 'hey, come here, join us for this, join us for that...'<br><br>Every first day of school of every academic level is something that I would dread attending. Almost everyone would have people approaching them to introduce themselves, but no one would ever come to me. By the time we were assigned to our own classes, most would have formed their own cliques. But not me. This would later become a common scenario throughout my life so far.<br><br>Most people by now would have at least one or two close friends in their lives. Most would at least be liked in some way by people, even though they have their own flaws. But this was, and is still, hardly true for me.<br><br>I think a lot, about what is that I have to do to be like those around me, to be surrounded by friends, surrounded by people who would like them to be in their sports group, study group and soon on. What is like to have friends who truly care about you, who truly accept you for who you are, I wonder a lot, a lot about such things every now and then.<br><br>I struggled a lot within, trying to correct my flaws like pettiness, stubbornness, sulkiness and so on. But soon I gave up cos my ego is too 'strong'. I didn't want to change, cos I was pretty scared that I would 'lose' myself in order to be liked.<br><br>The Buddhist teaching of Cause and Effect and karma, in a way, helped me to accept to some extent, that I may have done something bad in my past life to warrant this bad personality and lonely life. Well, it also irritates me at the same time in that it tells me to accept no matter what.<br><br>If anyone out there is experiencing a similar life like me, don't give up, okay? I'm with you. I may not be able to help you, but at least you know you are not alone. If no one can understand the pain you are going through, I can, at least more than others, I think...<br><br>One day, I believe, my bad karma will end. I believe I can change my flaws too. But maybe not in this life, cos my fears and insecurities are too deep-seated. Who knows what turn of future events would lead me to change and make those changes permanent.<br><br>As a buddhist, I should not have said the above ignorant and naive statements at all. But as a mere human, I have my dreams.<br><br>Maybe to end this post in a more positive tone, let me say this:<br><br>The Buddhist concept of karma is not fatalistic. So there is always hope for everyone of us. Help will come, even if you had not expected it to. Help comes when you continue to try, without giving up easily.<br><br>As living beings, we can give up everything, but we should never, ever give up HOPE. If you have given up hope, remember, Hope will still be there for you, waiting for you to open yourself to it again.<br><br>So don't give up, alright?<br><br>Amituofo!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div></blockquote>I guess i'm in the same plight as u, i hav 2 best friends onli n i dun like meeting new ppl kinda introvert. n worst i dunno y i'm always meeting nasty ppl.<br><br>I believe in cause n effect, and reincarnation but i find it unfair, i dun even know the person of my past life, y am i suffering for him or her. look at the animals, they are being killed n abused not knowing the reason y <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  &amp; where's the person of my past life now? is he/she in hell or?</div>
