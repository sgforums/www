            <div class='col-md body'>My first introduction to Buddhist concept of karma was the Cause and Effect sutra. It is quite amazing to read that there are reasons for what I am experiencing in my life. The environment I am born in and so on.<br><br>Let me go on to talk about how I started to slowly believe strongly in the Buddhist concept of Cause and Effect, even though there are many people out there now who still challenge the Buddhist concept of cause and effect and that every living being has gone through countless rebirths.<br><br>Since small, I have hardly been good at anything. For boys, this might be fatal. In school, either you have to be good at sports or studies or cool in character to have friends. Not only was I not good at any of those, I frankly suck at sports and outdoor games.<br><br>I found that I didn't have a group which I could go to. There was no one that would say 'hey, come here, join us for this, join us for that...'<br><br>Every first day of school of every academic level is something that I would dread attending. Almost everyone would have people approaching them to introduce themselves, but no one would ever come to me. By the time we were assigned to our own classes, most would have formed their own cliques. But not me. This would later become a common scenario throughout my life so far.<br><br>Most people by now would have at least one or two close friends in their lives. Most would at least be liked in some way by people, even though they have their own flaws. But this was, and is still, hardly true for me.<br><br>I think a lot, about what is that I have to do to be like those around me, to be surrounded by friends, surrounded by people who would like them to be in their sports group, study group and soon on. What is like to have friends who truly care about you, who truly accept you for who you are, I wonder a lot, a lot about such things every now and then.<br><br>I struggled a lot within, trying to correct my flaws like pettiness, stubbornness, sulkiness and so on. But soon I gave up cos my ego is too 'strong'. I didn't want to change, cos I was pretty scared that I would 'lose' myself in order to be liked.<br><br>The Buddhist teaching of Cause and Effect and karma, in a way, helped me to accept to some extent, that I may have done something bad in my past life to warrant this bad personality and lonely life. Well, it also irritates me at the same time in that it tells me to accept no matter what.<br><br>If anyone out there is experiencing a similar life like me, don't give up, okay? I'm with you. I may not be able to help you, but at least you know you are not alone. If no one can understand the pain you are going through, I can, at least more than others, I think...<br><br>One day, I believe, my bad karma will end. I believe I can change my flaws too. But maybe not in this life, cos my fears and insecurities are too deep-seated. Who knows what turn of future events would lead me to change and make those changes permanent.<br><br>As a buddhist, I should not have said the above ignorant and naive statements at all. But as a mere human, I have my dreams.<br><br>Maybe to end this post in a more positive tone, let me say this:<br><br>The Buddhist concept of karma is not fatalistic. So there is always hope for everyone of us. Help will come, even if you had not expected it to. Help comes when you continue to try, without giving up easily.<br><br>As living beings, we can give up everything, but we should never, ever give up HOPE. If you have given up hope, remember, Hope will still be there for you, waiting for you to open yourself to it again.<br><br>So don't give up, alright?<br><br>Amituofo!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, totally agree.<br>While accepting our suffering currently is due to th actions in the past, we must do something now for the future.<br>You may want to be more initiative in talking to people, although you are a nice person, but if you don't take the initiative, people may think you are "dao".<br>which dharma centre you frequent, btw.</div>

Nagarjuna, often referred to as "the second Buddha" by Tibetan and East Asian Mahayana (Great Vehicle) traditions of Buddhism, has a lot to say about "Cause and Effect".<br><br><blockquote>Nagarjuna posits four possible ways an effect can be produced by causes.<br>1. An effect produces itself (Samkhya)<br>2. An effect is produced by something other than itself (Nyaya)<br>3. An effect is both produced by itself and is produced by something other than itself.<br>4. An effect is produced without a cause.<br>Next, Nagarjuna proceeds to show that none of these alternatives are possible if causality is viewed as the production of an effect by a causal power that inheres in a self-existent cause.<br>Argument #1.<br>Suppose #1 is true. This means the cause that produces the effect is identical to the effect. To make this claim means there is only one thing involved here, not two. Because causality, so understood, is a relationship between two things, then no causal relationship is possible. If no causal relationship is possible, then it is absurd to claim an effect causes itself.<br>Argument #2.<br>Suppose #2 is true. This means that the cause is essentially different from the effect. But if cause and effect are essentially different, how can one be the effect of the other? This suggests that the cause transformed itself into the effect. If the cause and the effect are essentially different things, then it is absurd to claim there is a causal relationship between them. Only if the<br>cause and effect are not essentially different can we say that the cause (the bean) transforms into the effect (the bean sprout). If a causal relationship cannot obtain between two things that are essentially different, then it is absurd to claim that an effect is produced by something other than itself.<br>Argument #3.<br>Suppose #3 is true. This is merely a conjunction of #1 and #2. Since both conjuncts have been shown to be false, the conjunction is false. Hence, this is a no-starter.<br>Argument #4.<br>Suppose #4 is true. This amounts to the claim that there are no causes, which is to abandon the whole notion of causal relationships. Hence to call this an explanation of causality<br>is absurd.<br><br>Hence, the force of these arguments is intended to demonstrate that the notion of a cause as a self-existent thing with the power to produce some effect is empty.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe everything in our worldly system is linked to cause and effect - 'Cause' bring about 'Effect' and this 'Effect' becomes a new 'Cause' and bring about a new 'Effect' and this goes on and on like a ripple.... <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=145484" rel="nofollow">Read more</a><br><br>Quoted from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spnw07</span> and my reply in blue:<br><br>I think a lot, about what is that I have to do to be like those around me, to be surrounded by friends, surrounded by people who would like them to be in their sports group, study group and soon on. What is like to have friends who truly care about you, who truly accept you for who you are, I wonder a lot, a lot about such things every now and then..... <span style="color: blue;">Hmmm.... Don't think so much Pal... Just be yourself... I was like you before, thinking of how I could be surrounded by friends. But these thoughts are merely useless, you have to take the approach to reach out &amp; "be a good person" in order for people to accept you. </span><br><br>I struggled a lot within, trying to correct my flaws like pettiness, stubbornness, sulkiness and so on. But soon I gave up cos my ego is too 'strong'. I didn't want to change, cos I was pretty scared that I would 'lose' myself in order to be liked.....<span style="color: blue;">These are really flaws that you should change, don't let your ego overrun you. I do not like to live in the eyes of other people either but changing myself to become a better person is nothing to lose. Ego is really hard to overcome (this I can understand), personally I engage a method that I discovered myself - Whenever you discover that your ego is taking control of you, let go of it immediately, stop thinking about it and let it dwells away without attachment. Don't let it control your life. If you don't work on it now, it will be harder as time goes by.</span><br><br>The Buddhist teaching of Cause and Effect and karma, in a way, helped me to accept to some extent, that I may have done something bad in my past life to warrant this bad personality and lonely life. Well, it also irritates me at the same time in that it tells me to accept no matter what. <span style="color: blue;">Accepting is the beginning but to change is the future. Start changing now for your future - if not for others, at least do for yourself.</span><br><br>One day, I believe, my bad karma will end. I believe I can change my flaws too. But maybe not in this life, cos my fears and insecurities are too deep-seated. Who knows what turn of future events would lead me to change and make those changes permanent. <span style="color: blue;"> You can do it man and it's only a decision away and the ability to let go of your ego. Don't give up, ok? If you don't change now, later in your life (not to mention your next life), you may probably say the same thing again and again - there will be no change. If you seek to change for the better, then you should start doing something now- this I believe is the work of Karma, isn't it?  </span><br><br></div>

What is like to have friends who truly care about you, who truly accept you for who you are, I wonder a lot, a lot about such things every now and then..... <span style="color: blue;">Hmmm.... Don't think so much Pal... Just be yourself... I was like you before, thinking of how I could be surrounded by friends. But these thoughts are merely useless, you have to take the approach to reach out &amp; "be a good person" in order for people to accept you. </span><br><br>I struggled a lot within, trying to correct my flaws like pettiness, stubbornness, sulkiness and so on. But soon I gave up cos my ego is too 'strong'. I didn't want to change, cos I was pretty scared that I would 'lose' myself in order to be liked.....<span style="color: blue;">These are really flaws that you should change, don't let your ego overrun you. I do not like to live in the eyes of other people either but changing myself to become a better person is nothing to lose. Ego is really hard to overcome (this I can understand), personally I engage a method that I discovered myself - Whenever you discover that your ego is taking control of you, let go of it immediately, stop thinking about it and let it dwells away without attachment. Don't let it control your life. If you don't work on it now, it will be harder as time goes by.</span><br><br>The Buddhist teaching of Cause and Effect and karma, in a way, helped me to accept to some extent, that I may have done something bad in my past life to warrant this bad personality and lonely life. Well, it also irritates me at the same time in that it tells me to accept no matter what. <span style="color: blue;">Accepting is the beginning but to change is the future. Start changing now for your future - if not for others, at least do for yourself.</span><br><br>One day, I believe, my bad karma will end. I believe I can change my flaws too. But maybe not in this life, cos my fears and insecurities are too deep-seated. Who knows what turn of future events would lead me to change and make those changes permanent. <span style="color: blue;"> You can do it man and it's only a decision away and the ability to let go of your ego. Don't give up, ok? If you don't change now, later in your life (not to mention your next life), you may probably say the same thing again and again - there will be no change. If you seek to change for the better, then you should start doing something now- this I believe is the work of Karma, isn't it?  </span></div></blockquote> Thanks for taking the time to encourage me. This is probably what I would have said to others in a similar situation as me.<br><br>However, I somehow believe, ultimately, no one wants to a bad person from the start and there are deep inner issues to be resolved before that person can finally overcome his ego and thus start changing his/her own flaws.<br><br>If I have to be a good person in order to be accepted, then perhaps what they want is not a person with his/her unique or weird personality. Maybe what they want is how easy and good it would be for them to have such a good person around them.<br><br>I have been trying to work on my ego. However, it has also been very tiring. It is also because of this that I can learn to be more sensitive to the feelings of others and to be less judgemental.<br><br>Habits die hard and not all can change on their own. They need help. So don't wait for others to ask for help, approach them gently and let them know you are there to listen, not judge.<br><br>If you have friends like me, don't just expect them to change by words alone. Show them human warmth. Warmth before lessons. Just like watching and guiding a baby on his/her first step.<br><br>Take care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Something that acts as the cause in the present may become the effect in the future. Later that same effect may again become the cause. Such phenomenon continues ad infinitum. It is called the universal law of Anicca or impermanency.<br><br>With regard to the origin of the world itself, the Buddha did not claim it was the property of Buddhism or that existing world systems and living things were controlled according to the Buddhist Order, but by universal law or natural phenomenon. Man was simply to accept his position in the world and regard himself and all things, animate and inanimate, as a compound.</span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">There is a parallel statement in the Buddhist text, Visuddhimagga IVI, verse 90 (see http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/buddha2.htm):<br><br>"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found.<br>The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there.<br>Nibbana [Nirvana] is, but not the man that enters it.<br>The path is, but no traveller on it is seen,"<br><br>and further (see http://www.angelfire.com/indie/anna_jones1/fundamental.html):<br><br>"No doer of the deeds is found,<br>No one who ever reaps their fruits;<br>Empty phenomena roll on [unfold]:<br>This only is the correct view.<br></div><div class="quote_body">And while the deeds and their results<br>Roll on and on, conditioned all,<br>There is no first beginning found,<br>Just as it is with seed and tree. ...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No god, no Brahma, can be called<br>The maker of this wheel of life:<br>Empty phenomena roll on,<br>Dependent on conditions all."</span></div></blockquote>The idea that there must be an 'uncaused cause' that sets everything off is precisely what is 'being tied down by an idea' and not seeing reality as it is. It is a merely logical conclusion and a theory, not an experiential nor intuitive insight.<br><br>Buddha's teachings are not ideas or theories.. for the Buddha completely comprehends the world, he realised the truth of Dependent Origination, and hence the reality of Karma and other conditionality... and the realisation of this reality also leads to the unbinding, Nirvana, end of suffering, the highest bliss.<br><br><strong>The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.<br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</strong><br><br>All who practice the Buddhist teachings can attain enlightenment himself -- it is not just a belief, but something that everyone realise/attain for himself, and there have been countless, up till today, who have intuitively experienced/attain enlightenment.. even some in this forum.<br><br>"The world exists only when we think about it; creation stories are for children. In reality the world is created every moment." ~ Jean Klein<br><br>Finally, with regards to 'creation',<br><br>"Malunkhyaputta Sutta stresses that whether the universe was created or uncreated, finite or infinite, is irrelevant to our main spiritual concerns: the cause and cessation of suffering:<br><br>"Therefore Malunkhyaputta, bear the undeclared as undeclared. Malunkhyaputta, what are the not declared? The world is eternal, is not declared by me. The world is not eternal, is not declared by me. They are not essential for the principles of the holy life, they do not lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, what are the declared by me? This, is unpleasant, is declared. This, is its arising, is declared. This, is its cessation is declared. This is the path to its cessation, is declared. Malunkhyaputta, why are these declared by me?
