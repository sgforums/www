Virtue!<br><br>Thangthong Gyalpo (1361-1486). He was born in Wolka<br>Lhatse. That includes Angren County of Tibet now. He built<br>many temples and eighty-five iron bridges in Tibet. In his life,<br>he wrote many historical opera plays. We Tibetan say<br>traditional Tibetan opera was founded by him. In medicine, he<br>invented white saint pills and many other special pills. Later,<br>he died in Chung Riwo at the age of hundred and twenty-five.<br>He was a resourceful person for Tibet.<br><br>Thangtong Gyalpo lives on as a Drupthob, as well as through<br>the unbroken line of his incarnations. Moreover, he also lives<br>on in his works: i.e. lhakhags, chörten, iron chain bridges, his<br>philosophical writings up to the dances and songs that<br>accompany certain works. Unlike other masters who have<br>‘only’ left their philosophy, Thangtong Gyalpo is remembered<br>through physical structures like bridges and temples that<br>remain, which make Tibet and Bhutan more easily<br>‘conceivable’ to lamas, monks and laymen alike, which<br>according to him is a very popular media of his activity among<br>simple people.<br><br>Thangtong Gyalpo’s blessing is especially sought for the ‘long<br>life’ and protection from evil. In Tibet, people generally place a<br>figure of Thangtong Gyalpo on to the household altar. If one<br>moves to another place or another house, his statue is<br>brought before anything else. His popularity and admiration<br>in the present day Tibet is clear. Even in the holiest temple of<br>Tibet, the Tsuglakhang (gTsug lag khang) in Lhasa bears a<br>large statue of him in terracotta with offerings. At the Barkhor<br>(bar’khor), beside the Buddha statues, only statue of<br>Thangtong Gyalpo painted richly and sized approximately 15<br>to 20 centimetres are sold to pilgrims by the two shops.<br><br>http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache:-EFNDnKbLzsJ:www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/admin/pubFiles/Chakzampa.pdf+TanTong+Gyalpo+Tulku&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au</p></div>
