              to us when we die? It’s a question that has exercised humanity’s finest minds
              since those humans have been around to have them – and has been recently the
              subject of a number of groundbreaking scientific studies.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Now, a Reddit thread has posed the question specifically to those
              who have been clinically dead and then revived, and has received hundreds of
              responses.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Though the veracity of the answers has to be taken with a small
              pinch of salt, the answers from what essentially amounts to a large survey on
              the subject can be broken down into three categories.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>There are those who felt nothing at all; those who had an
              experience of light and some interaction with another person/being; and those
              who felt they could watch what was happening while they were “dead” without
              being able to do anything.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The first group corresponds closely with the answers of a single
              Redditor who officially died twice and recently invited questions on the topic
              from other users. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The latter group, meanwhile, appears to agree with the work of Dr
              Sam Parnia, who sought out cardiac arrest patients and found that almost 40 per
              cent described having some form of “awareness” at a time when they were
              clinically dead.</span></p>

              screen and talking to the doctor. Alarms started to go off and everyone became
              panicked. My world became soft and foggy and everything faded to black. Next
              thing I remember was opening my eyes and hearing a Dr say "we got him
              back". <strong>It was really a peaceful feeling
              more than anything</strong>."</span></p>

              breathing and blood circulation stopped. I felt as if I was plummeting down an
              endless hole while my peers cried for help. I was revived and <strong>still have no memory of the little bit of

              It could have been a dream, but <strong>I saw my own
              unconscious body, completely flatlined, in the ambulance</strong>. I
              remember the EMT who was in the ambulance with me (whom I did not see before I
              passed out) had mint green hair and I couldn't remember his name, but I asked
              for him when I regained consciousness about three days later."</span></p>

              that I couldn't go yet, that I have to keep trying</strong>, and if I

              definitely able to see things that were in no way visible from where my body
              was. I remember speaking and being angry because nobody would answer me. My

                  would assume that you are not here implying that there is a soul that is ‘going
                  to heaven’ and that it means one have attained to arahantship and there is no
                  more further rebirth. The historical Buddha never used the word ‘reincarnate’
                  as it implies the existence and transmigration of a soul even though we find it
                  used very often in the Tibetan form of Buddhism. Rebirth would be a more
                  appropriate term to use.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">One can find many Suttas on the subject of
                  rebirth. These are discourses mainly for village folks during the Buddha’s time
                  and used as powerful tools to teach moral values, ethical practices and also to
                  emphasize the acts of giving to accumulate merits for a better future rebirth. But
                  the ultimate goal of the Buddha’s teaching is to lead one to the attainment of enlightenment
                  and no about a better future rebirth, or as you put it above, to reincarnate.</span></p>
