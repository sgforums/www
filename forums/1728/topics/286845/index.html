            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Exodus 20:4-6<br><br>4 "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.<br><br>Exodus 20:22-23<br><br>22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: 23 Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.<br><br>Leviticus 26:1<br><br>1 " 'Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the LORD your God.<br><br>As I have mentioned, these were gifts in the past from relatives and friends. We did not worship the idols but somehow having them at home made me feel uneasy. And so, I made the decision to get these artifacts out of my house. After all, how does God become the Head and Lord of the house with this household (just like how can God touch a life for healing when it is defiled without repentence)? The Word of God says:<br><br>Deuteronomy 7:5<br><br>5 This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire.<br><br>Deuteronomy 12:3<br><br>3 Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.</blockquote>  A Christian friend of mine wrote in his latest blog post about how he decided to use a hammer to destroy all idols and related stuff in his house and discard them.<br><br>He mentioned that he believed in the 'sovereignty of God' and 'Word of God commanded that all idols be destroyed lest it causes others to stray from Him'.<br><br>Now I know more about why Christians are so opposed to anything that they consider as idols or idol-worshipping.<br><br>Without the above verses from the Bible, I would not have known more about the Christian view on other religions which have certain statues for worship. It so happens that Buddhism is viewed in the same way, that's all.<br><br>It is not their fault entirely for having believed the way they did. Once they believed in their innate logic of a Creator God, it becomes natural that they should submit to and obey unquestionably the commandments laid down by their God.<br><br>But considering it from both a Buddhist and a humanistic point of view, such views are a little regrettable. For idols do not lead people astray. Thoughts and actions do. This applies to all humans, with or without religious beliefs.<br><br>For example, viewing pornography is very unhealthy cos it causes you to view women as mere sexual toys to satisfy your curiosity and lust for adventurous sex and you end up being a slave to your own sexual obsession.<br><br>Is the camera in the wrong? Is the television in the wrong? They are but tools and symbols of our thoughts to transmit ideas.<br><br>You can destroy all things you view as idols in the world, just like what the Red Guards did during the Cultural Revolution, but still your efforts will not help fellow humans to realise that their own ignorance and anger are the only things that need to be disciplined.<br><br>You want to destroy things, sure. Destroy your own greed, anger and ignorance.<br><br>I remember one of Buddha's verses which mentioned that it is not a sin to 'kill' greed, anger and ignorance, for they are the thieves that rob us of the means to realise our Buddha nature.<br><br>I hope that one day, we will all realise our own Buddha nature and regain the ability to accept and contemplate all things with perfect wisdom.<br><br>Amituofo!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding idol worship, I just wrote recently in <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=286099&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">How to politely decline invitations to church?</a><br><br><blockquote>3) In the same logic just as people demand to see the tangible being of God, can you also ask if you can see the tangible being of the Gods of other religions? (Please do not count the wooden idols which are worshipped. Those are not tangible proofs too. ;-) )</blockquote>First of all, Buddhists do not worship any God or Gods. We only pay respects to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, who are not gods, but enlightened beings. All Buddhists aim to attain Enlightenment, Buddhahood, so the Buddha merely shows us the way -- he is just a teacher. We do not worship them, much less any wooden idols. Pls do not confuse Buddhism with the folk religion.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol7no4c.htm</a><br><br><strong>All forms are illusions<br>Buddhism is truly detached from idols</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">People who think that Buddhism is the worshipping of an image of the Buddha, or that the Buddha is somebody whom we can appeal to for favours, should know of two very profound verses from the Diamond Sutra that contradict these popular beliefs. To the intellectual, they can lay to rest the suspicion that Buddhism is superstition. To those who are used to praying for divine intervention, they can become self reliant through their own virtuous karma.</span><br><br>It is stated in the Diamond Sutra, Â“He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).Â” It further states that, Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the TathagataÂ”. It is only when we have attained a certain advanced level in the learning and practising of Buddhism that we will be able to understand the profound meaning of these verses. If you were to tell a person who has just started to learn Buddhism that learning Buddhism is like these verses, then he would find them too profound. He would not be able to make out what Buddha is like. Of course, he knows what human beings are like and quite naturally he will assume that only those who are similar in form to human beings are Buddhas. We can say that this is correct, but we can also say that this is wrong. For example, kindergarten teachers may use drawings of an old man and old woman when teaching the young children about grandfathers and grandmothers. Thereafter, when the children see other old folks in such resemblance they know that they are someone elseÂ’s grandparents. But, to university students it would be inappropriate for professors to use the same approach when talking about such blood relationships.<br><br>It is the same in learning Buddhism. When we encourage a new student of Buddhism to pay respect to the Buddha in the temple or monastery, he will not be frightened when he sees that the Buddha is the same as a human being. At the same time, when he sees that the Buddha and Bodhisattva images are so dignified and compassionate, it will give rise to a feeling of joy and reverence and lead him to learn Buddhism.<br><br>Often we come across people who have been learning Buddhism for a long time saying that they saw this Buddha or that Bodhisattva in their dreams. Initially, when we do not know about their level of understanding of Buddhism, we may praise them by saying, Â“Oh! You have such good affinity with Buddha and Bodhisattva that you can even see their images!Â” But it is wrong if we always praise them like this. If they report dreams like this for more then 3 times, you have to tell them, Â“The Mara is here, you have seen the Mara! All the Zen masters advise to obliterate the Buddha when the Buddha appears, and obliterate the Mara when the Mara appears [1].Â” We cannot praise them any more because they have already developed an attachment to forms.<br><br>In the same way, when we are dealing with people who are already advanced in Buddhism, we should use the method of the Diamond Sutra rather than the kindergarten method:<br><br>Â“He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).Â”<br>Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.Â”<br><br>At this level, people will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that eradicates superstition and attachment to all forms.<br><br>Critics often say that the Buddha image is an idol. They criticize that Buddhism worships idols. In reality, the cross, the Jesus Christ image and Mother Mary, they are also idols. In this sense, is there a religion that does not worship idols? Therefore, we cannot say that Buddhism is the only religion that worships idols. The fact is that only Buddhism does not worship idols. The Diamond Sutra states, Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.Â”!<br><br>The essence of the Buddha, the Buddha Nature is omnipresent in the space of the Dharma realm, and the Dharma Nature is omnipresent in the space.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>1. To ignore and not to be attached to such forms;. Mara is the Evil One, described as a murderer, hinderer, disturber, destroyer, etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We humans are so attached to a physical object, so sometimes it is more effecient to make use of this attachment in practice.<br><br>All physical object including our body and speech is just a tool to practice our mind. Since mind is so important, so the tool become important as well.<br><br>Why do we kneel down and bow to buddha statue or put our palms together? This is to cultivate our respect to the buddha, making us more humble and eventually get rid of the concept of self.<br>Why does offering fruit to buddha gives us good karma, not because buddha want to eat the fruit but because our mind generate good thoughts in the process of offering.<br>Having a buddha statue in front also help us to visualize the buddha and constantly remind us of the buddha's teaching.</div>

He is afraid or angry of us losing focus on Him. He is jealous because, like a wife jealous of her husband of not being faithful to her (and vice versa), we are looking for His creations for answers instead of the Creator.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Perhaps a practical example will help us to understand the difference. If a husband sees another man flirting with his wife, he is right to be jealous, for only he has the right to flirt with his wife. This type of jealousy is not sinful. Rather, it is entirely appropriate. Being jealous for something that belongs to you is good and appropriate. Jealousy is a sin when it is a desire for something that does not belong to you.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>My 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Sorry but I think this is exactly the kind of sufferings The Buddha says we humans creat for ourselves - Attachment.<br><br>Love without wisdom is narrow and dangerous. It leads to obsession, possession, which eventually leads to jeolousy and hatred. Your eg of using the hunband n wife precisely show why there are so  many cases of suidcides, killings or violents arising from love relationships problems( and the aggressors also almost always say their r not in the wrong).<br><br>Futhermore, if we justify ourselves for being jealous or angry over things /humans that "belong" to us, then everyone will start fighting n hurting each other over everything which one deems is his/hers.
