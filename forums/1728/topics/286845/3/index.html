He's in total  Non-obstruction and ease. hence it's misleading.<br><br><blockquote>not to simply mix up all and say that is harmony. To the best of my knowledge, the different religions in the world out there today are really different. There might be similarities (ie. Jainism, Buddhism Taoism; Christianity, Islam, Judaism), but they are never exactly the same. So I do not see the point in trying to include other people's religions into one's own belief system. That would be demanding and show real disrespectful to them. As much as I do not believe in christianity, I don't see the need in trying to include their idea of heaven into the buddhist cosmology. Because the definition may be very different. [/</blockquote>u might read my post earlier to justdoit77 on what to say and what not to say when among fellow buddhists and among other religions. yes i know got conventional different. hence the different between respecting and praising. respect does not mean u need to praise.<br><br>differences is just the surface-aspect of phenomena. sameness is in the inner-aspect of phenomena. both are non-dual.<br>i've come across ideas of Taoism, Christianity and Islamic that are out of conventional thinking that people commonly have. there are those that can really penetrate into the "mystic" part of their religion. but rare though.<br><br>moreover MCK is taking from the realm of Total Non-obstruction. unless we can catch up with that kind of standard, it's difficult to understand.<br><br><blockquote>As much as you claim you didn't put in negative remarks, I don't think I had too.

'hinayana' idea came up in many mahayana sutras itself, including LS. it does not need to mean the Southern buddhism. even within people who thinks they are studing mahayana also have hinayana minded people. who or what are they?<br>they are those that rely on the 'outside' be it word, person or ordinary consciousness, than on 'inside' definitive meaning.<br>they are those that cannot see or apply Dharma in worldly dharma or in the saying seeking horns on rabbit's head. they think that bodily action is more important than inner intention. all and all ...<br>u don't have to look at the texts, look around fellow buddhists, and the proof is there already.<br><br>btw, should visit esangha, international buddhism forum. it's been<br>Concluded that Mahayana and Hinayana are attitudes of mind or levels of consciousness, not sects or schools of Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote>Anyone who really understood LS would not label anyone as 'icchantika'. This is because such idea doesn't exist in the first place. It is only a matter of capacity that he/she would be receptive to the Dhamma. Such person does his/her best to put forth the Dhamma to 'icchantika' (not necessary preaching the LS).</blockquote>try extending that good will of thought to "bogus monk" too, then u really understand the meaning in LS. if one really can see 'icchantika' doesn't exist, then one should also be able to see that such idea of "bogus monk" or 'negativity' don't exist.

When Sakyamuni Buddha showed that this saha world is pureland using His thumb, at least to my interpretation, He was telling us that we are ALREADY in pureland and should seek practice and cultivation in the here and now rather than hoping to go elsewhere.</blockquote>correct. that's for people with strong theorical background. people with weak  theorical background, might need something more concreate and practical. that's when skillful Sakyamuni Buddha is able to cater for these people who are dull-minded and prefer to escape the suffering of samsara.<br><br><blockquote>And that to say Amitabha is the common name of all buddhas, I beg to differ, as this might be just a prejudice teachings from the pureland schools. Comparing this, in the LS itself, it states that all buddhas are just manifestations of Sakyamuni Himself.</blockquote>it's the original Sanskrit meaning. not solely PL. anyway there's nothing bias about the concept. Sakyamuni is Amitabha. Amitabha is Sakyamuni. what's there to argue?<br><br><blockquote>But to see from academic point view, these two ideas would have meant to have developed in a latter time line of the buddhist history. However I would much appreciate the latter idea because simply Sakyamuni was the one who lived on earth before.<br>I see that to introduce Amitabha to a modern, thinking person, it is of no difference of introduce any deities (both from buddhist tradtion or otherwise), as Amitabha had not appeared before and not proven.Amitabha is only proven by faith.</blockquote>then u are also rejecting LS itself.<br>btw above information is going to be out dated speculation in the international sangha. rely on the inner wisdom and virtue then on speculation.<br><br><blockquote>Having Buddhahood within doesn't make a person a Buddha and therefore I don't think that is the real way of interpreting the first two vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (my fav bodhisattva btw).</blockquote>nobody say it makes. respect doesn't mean praise his external (good or bad) behavior.<br><br><blockquote>There are other ways that a buddhist can advise other buddhists not to slander other religions, not necessary by trying to throw all religions into a blender and assume that they are the same.</blockquote>break through the surface-aspect. will do good than harm.<br><br>ps: i also thank you for the mind-training.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Jehovah's Witnesses believe he was the same divine created being as Michael the Archangel,[89] [90] and that God made him a perfect human by transferring his life to the womb of Mary.[91] During the time Jesus was on earth he was simply a man, not a god-man.[92] They also believe that he is "the word" of John 1:1. This is understood to mean that he is God's spokesman, likely the one speaking in God's name to Adam, and to the Israelites in the wilderness.[93] In line with this, they point out that the Bible presents him as the only way humans can approach God. They include words like 'in Jesus name' in every prayer.[94]They view the term "Son of God" as an indication of Jesus' importance to the creator and his status as God's "only-begotten (unique) Son,"[95] the "firstborn of all creation,"[96] the one "of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all things."[97] They believe that Jesus died on a single-piece torture stake, not a cross.[98] They believe that he is currently ruling in heaven as king of God's heavenly Kingdom, and will soon extend his rule to earth for a reign of peace. [99] They also believe he is now immortal[100] and can never die again.[101]"<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>In Singapore, Jehovah Witness is banned because they do not allow their members to participate in National Service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is rather off-topic but I wish to express my personal views on those who had mentioned about Master Chin Kung in this topic.<br><br>Official records: There is a scripture, I forgot its name in English or Pali; I think it is called Di4 zhang4 shi2 lun2 jing1. It is mentioned that regardless of whether a venerable is one who has observed perfectly all precepts or has broken all or has not sworn to observe any at all in the first place, we should refrain from expressing doubts about a venerable in a public arena. One should reflect any personal concerns about a venerable's character or knowledge in private with that particular venerable and most importantly, in a respectful manner and tone.<br><br>Personal views: I too have some doubts of my own when watching some of Master Chin Kung's vcds. But I have no doubt at all that he is indeed a learned master of Buddhism, and one who is working tirelessly to educate the public on traditional values like filial piety, mutual respect and compassion for all. I can only say that I am a person with average mental, emotional and spiritual intelligence, and therefore I cannot understand and thus accept some of the high-level Buddhist concepts that is explained by him in those audio-visual materials. It is my problem, not Master Chin Kung's.<br><br>I hope as mark of respect to a venerable, or any venerable, which is a live symbol of the Sangha Gem, it's best that we avoid using abbreviations or short forms to address the name of a Master.<br></div>
