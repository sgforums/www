            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Spnw07:</div><div class="quote_body">     A Christian friend of mine wrote in his latest blog post about how he decided to use a hammer to destroy all idols and related stuff in his house and discard them.<br><br>He mentioned that he believed in the 'sovereignty of God' and 'Word of God commanded that all idols be destroyed lest it causes others to stray from Him'.<br><br>Now I know more about why Christians are so opposed to anything that they consider as idols or idol-worshipping.<br><br>Without the above verses from the Bible, I would not have known more about the Christian view on other religions which have certain statues for worship. It so happens that Buddhism is viewed in the same way, that's all.<br><br>It is not their fault entirely for having believed the way they did. Once they believed in their innate logic of a Creator God, it becomes natural that they should submit to and obey unquestionably the commandments laid down by their God.<br><br>But considering it from both a Buddhist and a humanistic point of view, such views are a little regrettable. For idols do not lead people astray. Thoughts and actions do. This applies to all humans, with or without religious beliefs.<br><br>For example, viewing pornography is very unhealthy cos it causes you to view women as mere sexual toys to satisfy your curiosity and lust for adventurous sex and you end up being a slave to your own sexual obsession.<br><br>Is the camera in the wrong? Is the television in the wrong? They are but tools and symbols of our thoughts to transmit ideas.<br><br>You can destroy all things you view as idols in the world, just like what the Red Guards did during the Cultural Revolution, but still your efforts will not help fellow humans to realise that their own ignorance and anger are the only things that need to be disciplined.<br><br>You want to destroy things, sure. Destroy your own greed, anger and ignorance.<br><br>I remember one of Buddha's verses which mentioned that it is not a sin to 'kill' greed, anger and ignorance, for they are the thieves that rob us of the means to realise our Buddha nature.<br><br>I hope that one day, we will all realise our own Buddha nature and regain the ability to accept and contemplate all things with perfect wisdom.<br><br>Amituofo!<br><br></div></blockquote>How non-buddhists view on idols really differs greatly.<br><br>If everyone were to have more compassion and wisdom, the world would have already be a peaceful place to live in already.</div>

As in one of the vcd, he declared that he is sexually impotent and that is one of the condition that doesn't allow a layman to be ordained.<br><br>You think I'm conventional? Well that's you and I fully respect what you think. But I think you're conventional too, because as you were saying that I should have asked 'why do I think so', you have failed to do it yourself. This is common among buddhist who think they are right.<br><br>I think MCK is weird. His early writings are good, but as time gone by, something definitely had gone wrong somewhere. This is how I think.<br><br>We are buddhists, not monkists, we should not simply see some bald man wearing a grey robe and quickly throw respect for no good reason.<br><br>Respect the virtue and wisdom, not just the robe.<br><br>If MCK sincerely believes all religions from the same root (from another vcd) then he should probably try to tell non-buddhists than to confuse the already-confused buddhists.<br><br>Oh ya, to me, you're not true to your words. If you say I slander (which I assume you think I have mistaken), shouldn't you think it's time to live up to your sign-off message?<br><br>Hoho.<br><br>Talking about irony. And you call that 50 years of insight.<br><br>Remember, follow Buddha, not monk.<br><br>P/S: I didn't bother to reply the icchantika thread is because the impression I had about you is that you are insisting that LS is the cure as theorectical aspect, which to me, it's both theoritical and applicable. As for Pureland Sect, well, I think they are easier to attract people to believe in as people suffers in this Saha world and often yearn for an external paradise. While in Lotus Sutra, Sakyamuni Buddha revealed that this Saha world is the pureland, and this is what made me truly respect Buddha. And this is besides the academic and scholar point of view that all Mahayana Sutras are not preached by Buddha Himself. But LS's spirit is the spirit to live the here and now, even the yearning of after/future lives, one is to be coming back here for one's own cultivation and practice the bodhisattva path. Not running to somewhere else. But of course, few people would understand, lesser would believe in, and much lesser would people vow to undertake the Lotus Sutra.</div>

Go there to learn how to be a Real bodhisattva and come back to saha/samsara to really help deliver sentient beings. learn to swim before jumping into the water to save ppl per se.<br><br><blockquote>While in Lotus Sutra, Sakyamuni Buddha revealed that this Saha world is the pureland, and this is what made me truly respect Buddha. </blockquote>in LS, when Buddha use his thumb to press on the ground to display His saha Pureland for His disciple, the appearance is EXACTLY the same as Amitabha's PL. u need to know "Amituo" mean Infinity. Amituofo would mean Wu Liang Zhu Fo (Infinity Buddhas). Amituofo is in fact a common name for ALL Buddhas.

            <div class='col-md body'>sinweiy,<br><br>Really such thinking that all religion is the same is prevalent in the buddhist community. I would much be interested to see that MCK try to influence that to other religion and see where it goes.<br><br>My personal understanding in harmony is to agree to disagree, not to simply mix up all and say that is harmony. To the best of my knowledge, the different religions in the world out there today are really different. There might be similarities (ie. Jainism, Buddhism Taoism; Christianity, Islam, Judaism), but they are never exactly the same. So I do not see the point in trying to include other people's religions into one's own belief system. That would be demanding and show real disrespectful to them.<br><br>As much as I do not believe in christianity, I don't see the need in trying to include their idea of heaven into the buddhist cosmology. Because the definition may be very different.<br><br>As much as you claim you didn't put in negative remarks, I don't think I had too. I was just merely sharing what I know and the facts that were presented.<br><br>The word 'hinayana' itself is a degratory term in the buddhist history where the revolutionary mahayana buddhists used to put those who didn't agree with such a revolution of mahayana idea into an inferior positions.<br><br>And to think you're not putting negative remarks.<br><br>Anyone who really understood LS would not label anyone as 'icchantika'. This is because such idea doesn't exist in the first place. It is only a matter of capacity that he/she would be receptive to the Dhamma. Such person does his/her best to put forth the Dhamma to 'icchantika' (not necessary preaching the LS).<br><br>I am not against anyone who wished to go PL, just that I think the spirit of Sakyamuni is more inspiring and real. When Sakyamuni Buddha showed that this saha world is pureland using His thumb, at least to my interpretation, He was telling us that we are ALREADY in pureland and should seek practice and cultivation in the here and now rather than hoping to go elsewhere.<br><br>And that to say Amitabha is the common name of all buddhas, I beg to differ, as this might be just a prejudice teachings from the pureland schools. Comparing this, in the LS itself, it states that all buddhas are just manifestations of Sakyamuni Himself.<br><br>But to see from academic point view, these two ideas would have meant to have developed in a latter time line of the buddhist history. However I would much appreciate the latter idea because simply Sakyamuni was the one who lived on earth before.<br><br>I see that to introduce Amitabha to a modern, thinking person, it is of no difference of introduce any deities (both from buddhist tradtion or otherwise), as Amitabha had not appeared before and not proven.<br><br>Amitabha is only proven by faith.<br><br>Having Buddhahood within doesn't make a person a Buddha and therefore I don't think that is the real way of interpreting the first two vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (my fav bodhisattva btw).<br><br>There are other ways that a buddhist can advise other buddhists not to slander other religions, not necessary by trying to throw all religions into a blender and assume that they are the same.<br><br></div>

I can introduce to you some monk who womanize and keep boyfriend. Are you interested?<br><br>I pay and bow to monk when I know and trust that he has certain qualities and knowledge about the Dhamma. I don't see a monk just to bow, what if that is a bogus monk? Might end up boasting his ego you know? When I see a monk I just address him as normal venerable so-and-so and gasshos.  Need to bow meh?<br><br>To know a monk/nun works or not just speak to them more often. See what they are doing then you will notice.<br><br>But of course if you want to be on the 'safe side', you can bow all you want.<br><br>I think your reasoning of the keep precept part has nothing to do with doubting sangha. It is a different issue. And you sure sangha really keep all precepts?<br><br>Hoho.<br><br>And if you have read carefully, I merely <strong>bring up</strong> issues, I didn't <strong>criticise</strong>. If you can't tell the difference, then that's too bad.<br><br>I apologise that I had diverted from this thread.<br><br>And sinweiy, thank you for the sharing so far =)</div>
