                                      teaching of all Buddhism, but its true meaning is often misunderstood. If we
                                      are ever to embrace Buddhism properly into the West, we need to be clear about
                                      emptiness, since a wrong understanding of its meaning can be confusing, even
                                      harmful. The third century Indian Buddhist master </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna"><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #2ba6cb;">Nagarjuna</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #222222;"> taught, "Emptiness wrongly grasped is like picking
                                      up a poisonous snake by the wrong end." In other words, we will be bitten!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Emptiness is not complete
                                      nothingness; it doesn't mean that nothing exists at all. This would be a
                                      nihilistic view contrary to common sense. What it does mean is that things do
                                      not exist the way our grasping self supposes they do.

                                      "the true nature of things and events," but in the same passage he
                                      warns us "to avoid the misapprehension that emptiness is an absolute
                                      reality or an independent truth." In other words, emptiness is not some
                                      kind of heaven or separate realm apart from this world and its woes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">The Heart Sutra says, "all
                                      phenomena in their own-being are empty." It doesn't say "all
                                      phenomena are empty." This distinction is vital. "Own-being"
                                      means separate independent existence. The passage means that nothing we see or
                                      hear (or are) stands alone; everything is a tentative expression of one
                                      seamless, ever-changing landscape. So though no individual person or thing has
                                      any permanent, fixed identity, everything taken together is what </span><a href="http://www.plumvillage.org/thich-nhat-hanh.html"><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #2ba6cb;">Thich Nhat Hanh</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;"> calls "interbeing." This term embraces the
                                      positive aspect of emptiness as it is lived and acted by a person of wisdom --
                                      with its sense of connection, compassion and love. Think of the Dalai Lama
                                      himself and the kind of person he is -- generous, humble, smiling and laughing
                                      -- and we can see that a mere intellectual reading of emptiness fails to get at
                                      its practical joyous quality in spiritual life. So emptiness has two aspects,
                                      one negative and the other quite positive. </span></p>

                                      two aspects as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #6f6f6f;">The first meaning of emptiness is called "emptiness
                                      of essence," which means that phenomena [that we experience] have no
                                      inherent nature by themselves." The second is called "emptiness in
                                      the context of Buddha Nature," which sees emptiness as endowed with
                                      qualities of awakened mind like wisdom, bliss, compassion, clarity, and
                                      courage. Ultimate reality is the union of both emptinesses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">With all of this in
                                      mind, I would like to highlight three common misunderstandings of emptiness:
                                      emotional, ethical and meditative.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Emotional</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">When we say "I feel empty,"
                                      we mean we are feeling sad or depressed. Emotionally speaking,
                                      "emptiness" is not a happy word in English, and no matter how often
                                      we remind ourselves that Buddhist emptiness does not mean loneliness or
                                      separateness, that emotional undertow remains. At various times I have looked
                                      for a substitute translation for the Sanskrit <em>sunyata</em> -- I have tried
                                      "fullness," "spaciousness," "connectedness," and
                                      "boundlessness" -- but as Ari Goldfield points out,
                                      "emptiness" is the most exact translation. "Emptiness" is
                                      also the term that my own teacher </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunryu_Suzuki"><span style="font-size: 13pt; color: #2ba6cb;">Shunryu Suzuki</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;"> used, though he usually added context. Once, speaking of
                                      emptiness he said, "I do not mean voidness. There is something, but that
                                      something is something which is always prepared for taking some particular
                                      form." Another time, speaking of the feeling tone of emptiness, he said,
                                      "Emptiness is like being at your mother's bosom and she will take care of
                                      you." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Ethical</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Some Buddhist students rationalize or
                                      excuse bad behavior of their teacher by asserting that through his
                                      understanding of emptiness the teacher is exempt from the usual rules of
                                      conduct. One student said, "Roshi lives in the absolute so his behavior
                                      can't be judged by ordinary standards." While it is true that Buddhist
                                      teachers sometimes use unusual methods to awaken their students, their
                                      motivation must come from compassion, not selfishness. No behavior that causes
                                      harm is acceptable for a Buddhist practitioner, teacher or otherwise. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Meditative</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Some Buddhist students think that a
                                      meditative state without thought or activity is the realization of emptiness.
                                      While such a state is well described in Buddhist meditation texts, it is
                                      treated like all mental states -- temporary and not ultimately conducive to
                                      liberation. Actually emptiness is not a state of mind at all; it is, as the
                                      Dalai Lama says, simply "the true nature of things and events." This
                                      includes the mind. Whether the mind of the meditator is full of thoughts or
                                      empty of them, this true nature holds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 15.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;   color: #222222;">Finally, since emptiness seems so
                                      difficult to understand, why did the Buddha teach it at all? It is because of
                                      his profound insight into why we suffer. Ultimately we suffer because we grasp
                                      after things thinking they are fixed, substantial, real and capable of being
                                      possessed by ego. It is only when we can see through this illusion and open
                                      ourselves, in Ari Goldfield's words, "to the reality of flux and fluidity
                                      that is ultimately ungraspable and inconceivable" that we can relax into
                                      clarity, compassion and courage. That lofty goal is what makes the effort to
                                      understand emptiness so worthwhile.</span></p>
