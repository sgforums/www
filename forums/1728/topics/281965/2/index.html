The for or against any ideology, belief, governance will always be there. Political systems and ideologies are man-made.  Anything man-made is not perfect, can be used or misuse or abused.<br><br>You see things from only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one and narrow perspective </span>- that China will not let Taiwan go independent. But do you know Taiwan won't let China be independent too? The KMT claimed to be the govt of whole China and hope one day to return to the mainland and the Imperial Palace in Beijing? Didn't you know that KMT and CKS literaly emptied the Imperial Palace when they fled to Taiwan?</div>
