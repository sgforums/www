You should read modern Chinese history starting from the 1911 uprising again the Manchu Chin dynasty. Then the Japanese invasion of China. Then the beginning of Communist China and KMT.<br>Then you will know why China wants Taiwan. Do remember this: Taiwan is not a separate and different country from the old China before communism and KMT.  It is KMT who created ROC.  Actually another name for Taiwan is Formosa.</div>

Of course, he died before he could fulfill that.<br><br>Another fact is that the older generation of local Taiwanese (Ben Shen Ren) felt that the Japanese were better colonisers than when the KMT came in.

Formosa was like any island off the coast of mainland China. There was no question on territorial sovereignity. The KMT came to power but was challenged by CPC. The home base of KMT was Sichuan, not Taiwan!!!!<br>2) Civil wars ensued b/w KMT and CPC. It was pretty bloody. Chinese killing Chinese and Japanese killing Chinese! There was brief truce - cooperate to fight common enemy - Japanese. Then after, fight one another.<br>3) Mao's Red Army managed to rout KMT, and they fleed to Taiwan. Red Army did not cross the straits and KMT was spared. KMT still holds itself as the govt of all China. Therefore, it is a govt. in exile!!! It set up ROC - C stands for China!<br><br>I am actually quite appalled by your narration BUT I can understand - you are for 'democratic' Taiwan. You know, the Japanese never admit they massacred thousands of innocent Chinese in Nanjing. I hope you won't be like the Japanese. <strong>It is one thing to pledge your loyalty to whatever you believed, but it is wrong to twist the truth!!!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh, another part of history .....<br>1) The KMT never felt secured. It invited the Americans to Taiwan, buy American arms and buy American real estate. Families of CKS lived in US.<br>2) The Japanese sided KMT in Taiwan. Strange? Bcos KMT also fought the Japanese in mainland China but how come so nice to CKS and KMT? Isn't this obvious? First, Taiwan was occupied by Japan before. Second, CPC hated the Japanese (in fact, all Chinese should except maybe CKS and company). So, the Japs used this opportunity to cause further division.<br>3) China at the time was really really very very weak. It was in no position to prolong any war or fight any new war. It was a very devastated country - bombed by Japanese, occupied by German, British and Portuguese - east, south and west!<br>4) So, China was too busy rebuilding. This allowed KMT plenty of time and opportunity to build Taiwan as ROC.<br><br>Between the Hongkies and Taiwanese - I have greater respect for the Hongkies than the Taiwanese. I cannot see why many Silliporeans admire Taiwan. It may be democratic. So what? There are just as many democratic countries in the the world. None of the Taiwanese leaders are admirable.

Although chinese rule was suppressive in the 50s, much of tht has ease. Now is an economic boomtime for china's western area. There is no real support for independent from tibetians in tibet anyway..<br><br>As for xinjiang, its the muslim terrorist that wants independence. U want another Taliban?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is just a politician's diary.<br><br>Taiwan is always part of china, if anyone who don't like to be china citizen, he can always fill up the papers and migrate to other country. For example, if Ahmad who owned a landed property want to break out from singapore, the most he can do is migrate, he can't declare the land that he stay as independent. That is the universal law.<br><br>Many people don't favor the idea of reunification because China is a communism country. But the ideology of a country is not the one determine its territory. One can't assume if for example Singapore become constitutional monarchy, the territory must change due to that.<br><br>Chiang Kai-shek never in his lifetime think that Taiwan is not part of China, even now the KMT still regard the outer Mongolia as part of China.<br><br>228 incident is a tragedy, that was caused by a party if not a few people in and out of ROC who hold the power. But it has got nothing to do with whether Taiwan is part of China or not.<br><br>A lot of Taiwanese was brainwashed during the japanese occupation, one of them is the former KMT leader Lee Teng Hui that is also the one who secretly promote Taiwan independence when he was in power. He even openly mentioned that he is loyal to the Japan royal family. Many taiwan youngsters dislike China is due to his anti-china policy &amp; propaganda.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sanath:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br>in one of the books on Taiwan history, it quotes from the diary of the Prime Minister of the Qing Dynasty during Cixi's reign, Li Hongzhang who wrote, "The Taiwanese (Formosans) are neither with us nor of us" and so he ceded Taiwan (Formosa) to the Japanese in 1895.<br><br>Now i have Taiwanese friends at the University in Kyoto that i am studying at. And not anyone of them wants Taiwan to be reunited with communist china, and they also regard Taiwan as a separate country from china. One of them (a guy) even said to me factly, "if china and Taiwan were to have a war, even if i am in Japan i will go back and fight for Taiwan" In fact, Chiang Kai-shek did make a statement when ROC pulled out of the UN that, "now, the Republic of China is no longer in existence", only that he stopped short of calling Taiwan an independent country, probably because he still dreamt of recovering mainland china from the communists. Of course, he died before he could fulfill that.<br><br>Another fact is that the older generation of local Taiwanese (Ben Shen Ren) felt that the Japanese were better colonisers than when the KMT came in. Do not forget, who was responsible for the 228 incident.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

The Great Wall of China actually marked the boundary of ancient China - from north to south, and east to west. Tibet, Xinjiang and Manchuria were not Han China. Han China was invaded by the Mongols who set up the Yuan dynasty and made Beijing the capital. Manchuria also invaded Han China and set up the Qing dynasty.<br>That aside, personally, I think both Tibet and Xinjiang should be returned to its own people.  They have not been really part of China but was annexed or occupied by China. Together, Tibet and Xinjiang is about 1/3 the whole of present day China, so you can see why China will never return these two regions. That's why the insurgents and rebels for independence.
