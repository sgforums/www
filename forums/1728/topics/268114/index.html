            <div class='col-md body'>Is Buddha tooth here the real McCoy?<br>Some doubt authenticity of the relic housed at new Chinatown temple, with dental experts saying it could not have come from a human<br>By Tan Dawn Wei &amp; Mavis Toh<br><br>WHEN it comes to housing a relic as sacred as a Buddha tooth, devotees spare no expense - as was the case for the new Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown.<br>More than 60,000 donors poured $45 million and 270kg of gold into the four-storey building, where a tooth believed to be one of Buddha's molars now resides in a 3.6m-high stupa made out of worshippers' gold donations.<br><br>But now, doubts have been cast over whether this tooth belonged to Buddha - or even a human being. And they range from the historical and political to the anatomical.<br><br>Mr Yap Kok Feng, a paralegal executive, wrote to Lianhe Zaobao recently claiming that the relic looks nothing like a human tooth.<br><br>When contacted, he said that he had shown a picture of it to dentists who believe it to be a herbivore's.<br><br>One of them, Dr Pamela Craig, a senior lecturer at the School of Dental Science at the University of Melbourne, told The Sunday Times she had examined photographs and compared the tooth with teeth from various animal skulls in her comparative dental anatomy department.<br><br>What the temple says<br>THE Buddha Tooth Relic Temple said discoveries of several Buddha tooth relics in other countries and China have been documented in historical records.<br><br>One of them is Venerable Xuan Zang's Records of the Western Regions.<br>... more<br>History of relics<br>THE oldest Buddhist text, the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, gave an account of Buddha's cremation some 2,500 years ago.<br><br>His ashes were distributed equally among eight kings to avoid conflict. The kings took the holy ashes back to be enshrined in eight stupas in northern India.<br><br>'There's absolutely no possibility that it is a human tooth,' said Dr Craig, who specialises in human and animal oral anatomy.<br><br>'I'm almost certain that it belongs to a member of the Bos species, probably a cow or a water buffalo.'<br><br>Dr Craig said human teeth should be rounded with a short crown and a comparatively longer root, but the picture clearly shows a long crown and a shorter root.<br><br>'In this case, looking at a photo is clear enough because it's so obvious that it's not a human tooth. It's like comparing a pear and an apple.'<br><br>The Sunday Times also showed a picture of the tooth to four other dentists, including two forensic dental experts. All said the tooth could not have come from a human.<br><br>'This is an animal 'cheek tooth', that is, a molar at the back of the mouth,' said Professor David K. Whittaker, a forensic dental specialist at Cardiff University in Britain.<br><br>The seemingly uneven biting surface is indicative of grass-eating animals whose teeth have 'a very efficient grinding surface for breaking up coarse plant materials,' he said.<br><br>Dr Myra Elliott, a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon with a practice at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, said: 'Even if human teeth have been fossilised, there's still a pattern. And what is shown in the picture doesn't look like a primate's tooth at all.'<br><br>The size of the tooth - measuring 7.5cm - is also far too long for a human tooth, said Dr Anthony Goh, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon.<br><br>'There isn't enough space in the jaw.'<br><br>The tooth relic was supposed to have been discovered by a Myanmar monk, the late Venerable Cakkapala of Bandula Monastery, in 1980 while restoring a collapsed stupa at Bagan Hill in Mrauk-U, Myanmar.<br><br>He gave the relic to Venerable Shi Fazhao, the abbot of both the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Golden Pagoda Buddhist Temple in Tampines in 2002.<br><br>The public can see the tooth only twice a year - on Vesak Day and the first day of Chinese New Year.<br><br>When The Sunday Times asked Venerable Shi Fazhao about the tooth, he said in Mandarin: 'To me, it has always been real and I have never questioned its authenticity.'<br><br>As for the dental experts' assessment, he said: 'They can say all they want, I don't care what they say. If you believe it's real, then it's real.'<br><br>The curious dental structure is not the only bone of contention here.<br><br>In another Lianhe Zaobao commentary published on July 6, Chinese Buddhism studies researcher and lecturer Wan Bingyan cited religious and historical texts supporting the popular belief that only two of Buddha's teeth are left in this world.<br><br>They are now believed to be at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and the Ling Guang Monastery in Beijing, China.<br><br>When a third surfaced in 1998 after a Tibetan monk smuggled it out and handed it to Taiwan's Venerable Master Hsing Yun of Fo Guang Shan Temple, it was fingered by Chinese officials as a fake.<br><br>Buddha's relics are venerated by Buddhists worldwide and held up as national treasures in Sri Lanka and China.<br><br>China had allowed its Buddha tooth relic to go on tour to Thailand, Hong Kong and thrice to Myanmar at the government's invitation.<br><br>Two tooth relic pagodas were later built in Yangon and Mandalay, one housing an ivory replica tooth and the other, donated religious items.<br><br>Mr Kyaw Swe Tint, counsellor at the Myanmar Embassy here, said that as far as he knows, there has been no evidence of genuine tooth relics in his country.<br><br>'This (the one believed to be housed here) could very well be a fake,' he said.<br><br>But Venerable Shi Fazhao said Venerable Cakkapala had given him the tooth; it was a private matter between two people and not between two countries. 'Don't politicise it,' he said.<br><br>Would he let an expert examine the tooth in Singapore? He replied: 'It's mine, why should I let you examine it? Why don't you go examine what's in Sri Lanka and China first?'<br><br>Venerable B. Dhammaratana, religious adviser of the Buddhist Research Society, explains that different Buddhist societies would subscribe to different versions of Buddha's legends.<br><br>'You can't say which is right or which is wrong.'<br><br>dawntan@sph.com.sg<br><br>mavistoh@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Holy Relics</span><br><br>The Relics of The Buddha</strong><br><br>Relics ensured that the presence of the Buddha is perpetuated after the passing of the Buddha. They are generally fragments of cremated bones. However, some relics can even appear pearl-like, translucent and multi-coloured.<br><br>The Sanskrit term for relic "sarira" refers to the remains of a body part usually after cremation, especially the crystallization of solid remains from Sakyamuni Buddha after his cremation. Relics are classified as:<br><br>1. Dharmakaya sarira: The Buddha expounded illimitably. Dharma sarira signify his spirit in teaching and the inevitable persistence of truth. In the course of Buddhism�s history, the practice began of storing scriptures in pagodas. During the Ming Dynasty in Shaanxi province, for instance, a thirteen-storied pagoda was built at Fa Men Si, and in each story, collection of works from past learned and eminent monks were kept.<br><br>2. Physical Sarira: Such relics are also known as physical bone sarira. There are three different kinds: white bone sarira, black bone sarira and red bone sarira.<br><br>Relics were always kept in monasteries, where they were enshrined in stupas. For instance, the great stupa at Sanchi, which contains relics of the Buddha, is set in the middle of a large monastic complex. A similar arrangement is found in Sri Lanka, where some of the relics finally came to rest, the most celebrated being the tooth relic at Kandy. Myanmar is another country that's popularly known to enshrine Buddha tooth and body relics, alongside with relics of Buddha's disciples.<br><br>In China, finger bone of the Buddha was discovered in the 1980s in the forgotten crypt in the Famen temple (Fa Men Si) in Shaanxi province. Renowned as one of the four places in China with Buddha relics, the Famen temple enjoyed direct imperial patronage, especially in the ninth century.<br><br>Before the first century, relics were a key instrument in the spread of Buddhism in helping to establish new centres of religious significance. The practice of venerating relics and images has played a central role even in Buddhist traditions that strongly emphasize that Sakyamuni Buddha was a human being who died and is no longer able to aid his followers. Buddhists have always held in high regard the relics of enlightened beings. The relics embody those beings, and are also a powerful means by which their wondrous qualities may be recalled. As such, relics inspire great faith and devotion.<br><br>This is particularly true with regard to the relics of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni. Corporeal relics of Sakyamuni Buddha, which have been reasonably authenticated by archaeological and historical data, are understandably rare and especially treasured. Shrines, stupas and pagodas have been built to enshrine the bodily relics of the Buddha such as his bone, hair and teeth, as well as his belongings like his alms-bowl and robe, or else to commemorate the places he visited in his lifetime.<br><br>A sutra relates how the Buddha gave detailed instructions for the cremation of his body and the enshrinement of his relics. When Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha what should be done to the Buddha's body upon his passing away, Buddha replied that his remains should be given the same treatment as to a wheel-turning monarch (Cakravartin). The Buddha described the procedure for preparing the body for cremation, and asked for the construction of a stupa at the intersection of four main roads to enshrine his remains. According to the Buddha, a devotee who venerates the Buddha's remains with faith and joy will enjoy long-lasting happiness.<br><br><strong>The Cremation and Distribution of Relics</strong><br><br>The Buddha's final resting-place was in Kushinagara between the two sala trees, a town in the Malla country. At the Buddha's cremation ceremony, the funeral pyre could not be lit until Venerable Mahakashyapa, one of his most senior disciples, arrived to pay his last respects. Then the Buddha set Himself on samadhi fire and, in His great wisdom and compassion, provided thousands of relics, including tooth relics, found after His cremation.<br><br>King Ajatasattu of Magadha Kingdom and seven other kings rushed to Kusingnar in the hope of getting the Buddha's relics. After the cremation ceremony, Mallas, in whose territory the Buddha entered Parinirvana, initially sought to keep all the relics for themselves. When a terrible war was about to ensue, a Brahmin priest named Drona intervened, saying: "Our Buddha was a teacher of forbearance. Unfitting indeed is this clash of arms over the division of the (Buddha's) remains. May you all be united, sirs, reconciled; rejoicing together we shall make eight portions; relic monuments will be widespread in all directions."<br><br>In order to satisfy everyone who wished for the relics, Drona heaped them in many small but equal quantities so that each person will have the same share. But during this distribution process, Lord Sakra discovered an injustice. He noticed that while giving out the relics, the Brahmin had hid some of them in his hair. The gods in their turn stole the relics which had been hidden in his hair, and he was greatly surprised when he found out that the relics he had stolen when missing.<br><br>Eventually the relics were distributed to the eight cities of Rajagaha, Vesaki, Kapilavatthu, Allakappa, Ramagama, Bethadipa, Pava and Kushinagara by Lord Sakra (Indra) on behalf of the Devas and by the Naga kings - King Anavatapta, King Muchilinda and King Elapatra. In each place, a stupa was erected to house the remains for veneration and worship. Drona took the empty vase which had held the relics and likewise constructed a stupa. Prince Maurya, who arrived late, only received the ashes; he built a stupa for these just the same. The Buddha's relics were thus shared and worshipped in the ten directions.<br><br>This story provides a dramatic object lesson in both the great value accorded to the Buddha's remains and in dangers of selfish attachment. The resolution of the story suggests that the Buddha's relics are so precious that they should be widely distributed and thus made accessible to as many people as possible.<br><br>About one hundred years after Lord Buddha's Parinirvana, when King Asoka conquered the territories that enshrined Buddha's relics, he re-gathered all the relics and re-distributed them to 84,000 stupas spread over the following places: the whole of India, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, Mangala, Bhutan, China, Tibet, Myanmar and the rest of the world. King Asoka was able to spread the relics far with the help of Medicine Buddha's 12 yaksha chiefs.<br><br>Whatever the historical legitimacy of a particular relic, the practice of venerating holy relics has been critical to the spread and maintenance of the Buddhist tradition for more than two and a half millennia.<br><br><strong>Idenitfying Buddha Relics</strong><br><br>According to scriptures, the Buddha's relics have a miraculous quality, which enables them to increase in power, size and number, with time and veneration. Meiktila gave his account:<br><br>"I made a casket-like pendant for my 456 pieces of Buddha relics that are the size of mustard seeds. But the last time I counted, there were 75 more relics."<br><br>The Buddha is no longer in our physical world, but his miraculous powers exist as if He were still living.<br><br><strong>Size and Colour of Buddha Relics</strong><br><br>Generally, Buddha relics come in three sizes: like the kidney bean, broken rice, or mustard seed. Their colours show their bodily origin: golden relics come from flesh; pearly ones from bone; and red jasmine from blood. Sisa relics from the head of the Buddha may look like diamond, ruby, emerald or amber.<br><br>The biggest Buddha relics are golden and have a luminous brilliance. Medium relics are pearly and very white; and the small relics are red-jasmine coloured. Devotees often venerate Buddha's relics with palms raised and placed together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Sacred Buddha Tooth</strong><br><br>According to Pali canon, the Buddha left four wisdom tooth relics and 40 tooth relics to future generations for their veneration. The four wisdom tooth relics were given to Naga kings, King of Kalika (Kalinga) - Brahmadatta, Lord Indra of Trayastrimasasa Heaven and King of Kandra (Gandhara). The rest of the 40 tooth relics were given to Venerable Rahula for distribution to the human world.<br><br>However, according to Mahayana canon, it recorded that Lord Indra of Trayastrimasasa Heaven took one wisdom tooth from upper right side of the Buddha's jaw after the cremation ceremony. He built a stupa and housed the sacred Buddha tooth. Three wisdom tooth relics were remained in the human world and they were the ONLY tooth relics left in the human world.<br><br>One was taken to Sri Lanka and is now venerated at Malagawa Vihara (Dalada Maligawa) in Kandy. It is the original possession of King of Kalinga. The last king of Kalinga (4th century A.D.), King Guhasiva, decided to send the tooth relic to his friend, a Sinhalese king, King Mahasena. He knew that he would lose his final battle and it was the time to send the tooth relic for safe preservation. Besides, ancient Sri Lanka was a Buddhist kingdom, it is most appropriate for the king to keep this sacred relic. Wars were fought over this sacred relic over the years and the tooth relic has come to symbolize the very strength and independance of the Sinhalese nation, Sri Lanka.<br><br>A second, to China by Venerable Fa Hsien (337 A.D. - 422 A.D.) over 1,000 years ago, is now venerated at the Ling Guang Si Monastery, Beijing, China. It maybe originated from the possession of King of Gandhara, a small Buddhist kingdom in modern Pakistan. Some say that it is Uddiyana or Udayana. It was brought to Khotan, an ancient Buddhist kingdom in the present He Tian of Xinjiang Province of China. When was the tooth relic brought to Khotan from Gandhara secretly? Nobody seems to know the answer. We have leamt it from oral history that the tooth relic of the Buddha remained deposited in the vihara at Hazratbal site and the Buddhists of Kashmir used to visit this shrine and pay homage to the sacred relic. Venerable Fa Hsien and Venerable Hsuan Tsang (596 A.D. or 602 A.D. - 664 A.D.) had once visited this shrine. Anyway, we need the historians to figure out the reasons for the sacred tooth was sent to Khotan for safe keeping. Perhaps there are two major factors for the reasons: 1. Khotan, Turfan, Niya, Lou Lan and many oasis kingdoms of Tarim Basin and Central Asia were once having very close-ties with India, eg. Gandhara, and these kingdoms were once major Buddhist centres before Islam had replaced as the major faith of these people. 2. Buddhist influences were declined and Hinduism gained its popularity in that region - as mentioned in travelogues of Venerable Fa Hsien and Venerable Hsuan Tsang. Venerable Fa Hsien travelled to Khotan and brought the sacred tooth relic back to Nanjing, which was the capital city of Southern Qi. Following the reunification of ancient China under the Sui dynasty, the sacred tooth relic was sent to the new capital Chang'an, present Xi'an of Shaanxi Province of China. During the period of the Five Dynasties (Wu Tai - when Central China fell into a chaotic state), the tooth relic was moved from place to place until it reached Yenjing (present-day Beijing) of the Liao dynasty in the North. The "Chronicle of Emperor Dao-zong" in the History of the Liao Dynasty, Vol. XXII, contains a record relating the enshrinement of the Buddha tooth relic in the Zhao-xian Pagoda in the 8th month of the 7th year of Xian-yong (1071 A.D.). This is how the sacred Buddha tooth relic came to Beijing. Zhao-xian Pagoda is one of the pagodas in the monastic complex of Ling Guang Si Monastery. From its interment in the Zhao-xian Pagoda in 1071 up to its reappearance in 1900, this sacred tooth relic was preserved in that pagoda for almost 830 years.<br><br>The third lost for centuries was finally taken to Fo Guang Shan, Taiwan, on April 8, 2000 from India. According to the official spokeman from Fo Guan Shan, this tooth relic was smuggled out of Tibet to India by Tibetan monks during the Cultural Revolution. This sacred tooth relic was in custody with Very Venerable Kunga Dorje Rinpoche who is a great retreat master of Drigung Kagyu tradition and teacher of Drupon Samten Rimpoche. A statement from a group of Tibetan Buddhist masters, including Very Venerable Kunga Dorje Rinpoche, stated that Venerable Shi Hsingyun, Founder of Fo Guang Shan, was chosen to take over the most precious object in the Buddhist world because of his wisdom and compassion, as well as his great contribution to Buddhist activities worldwide and his promotion of exchanges between different sects of Buddhism.<br><br>In a classic Japanese travelogue text - "Nitto guho junreigyoki", written by Ennin (Jikaku Daishi) (794 A.D. - 864 A.D.), a Japanese Heian monk, who arrived in Chang'an in 840 A.D., mentioned that there were four tooth relics of the Buddha, three of them are respectively from India, Khotan and Tibet and the fourth from heaven. If this is understood, the holy relic from India is now housed in Malagawa Vihara (Dalada Maligawa), Kandy, Sri Lanka, the holy relic from Khotan is is now housed in Ling Guang Si Monastery, Beijing, China and the holy relic from Tibet should be the sacred tooth relic worshipped by Naga kings.<br><br>In the biographies of Drigung Kyopa Jigten Gonpo (Jigten Sumgon) (1143 A.D. - 1217 A.D.), the Founder of Drigung Kagyu tradition, they mentioned:<br><br>'One day, Jigten Sumgon told his disciple Gar Choling to go to the Soksum Bridge and offer torma to the nagas living in the water. "You will receive special wealth," he told him. A Naga king named Sokma Me offered Gar Choling a tooth relic of the Buddha and three special gems. Generally, it is said that this tooth relic had been taken by the Naga king Dradrok as an object of devotion. This was the same naga who usually lived in the area of Magadha, but had access to Soksum by way of an underground gate. Gar Choling offered the tooth relic and gems to Jigten Sumgon, who said, "It is good to return wealth to its owner," indicating that the tooth relic had once been his own. "As you are wealthy," he continued, "you should make an image of me and put the tooth in its heart." A skilled Chinese artisan was then invited to build the statue, and the tooth was enshrined as a relic. Jigten Sumgon consecrated this statue hundreds of times. It was kept in Serkhang and called Serkhang Choje (Dharma Lord of Serkhang). Its power of blessing was regarded as being equal to that of Jigten Sumgon himself. It spoke to many shrine-keepers, and to a lama named Dawa it taught the Six Yogas of Naropa. Later, when Drigung was destroyed by fire, it was buried in the sand for protection. When the Drigung Kyabgon returned to rebuild the monastery a search was made for the statue, which came out of the sand itself, saying, "I am here." Thus, this image possessed great power.' (Note: The present tulkus for Siddha Gar Choling are His Eminence 8th Garchen Truptrul Rinpoche (Body Manifestation), His Eminence 8th Mingyur Rinpoche (Mind Manifestation) and His Eminence 8th Namdrol Rinpoche (Speech Manifestation).)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And for the rest of 40 tooth relics mentioned in the Pali canon, many were founded in many parts of Myanmar, examples of these tooth relics as those displayed in the recent exhibition held by Golden Pagoda Buddhist Temple, Singapore. In a Burmese legend, it is said that there are about 33 tooth relics being buried or enshrined in the stupas of various sizes, scattered in various parts of Myanmar:<br><br>'When the Buddha was near His Parinirvana, He said to Venerable Gavampati, "Oh Gavampati after the cremation of My Sacred Body, the 33-teeth relics on the pile of sandalwood should be taken to Thaton of Ramanna division and be given to King Maha Sirimalasoka." The Arhant did as the Buddha instructed. King Maha Sirimalasoka dug two wells to wash the teeth relics. The two wells are fragrant till today. The king then enshrined the 33 relics in 33 stupas made of stone. In 236 Sasana Era, Cula Sirimalasoka reigned Thahton Suvannbhimi. An exceptionally pious devotee, he removed the 33 tooth relics from the stone stupas and put them in 33 golden caskets, which were then housed in 33 golden buildings. Afterwards, he made a firm resolution, "If these relics are genuine, may they travel in their golden caskets to wherever they can enhance the goodwill and welfare of all living creatures, until the end of the Buddha's teachings." Subsequently, all 33 golden caskets disappeared and reappeared in different parts of Ramanna Division. The king built a stupa each in those regions.'<br><br><strong>True or False</strong><br><br>It would almost be impossible to tell apart the difference between replicas of Buddha's sacred relics with real ones. Even scientific tests are refutable; there is really not a fool-proof method available at all. According to a sutra, it stated, "If there isn't any sarira available, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, glass and other precious materials can be used as sarira. Travellers without protection, can pick up pure stones from the shores of the great sea as sarira. Also one can use medical herbs, bamboos, sticks as sarira."<br><br>According to Ven. Shi Fazhao, Abbot of Golden Pagoda Buddhist Temple, one sure way is to follow the voice of your divine faith, and not merely rely on a checklist of qualities that a relic is supposed to have.<br><br>For instance, a relic that possesses diamond-like qualities can still shatter into a hundred equal pieces under the hammer of a skeptic. One wonders why. Wasn't the diamond-like relic supposed to have withstood the force of a hammer?<br><br>Ven. Shi Fazhao offers an explanation based on faith: The shattering result in fact is not indicative of the quality (or lack of) of the relic. It is due to the lack of faith, which will result in an anticipation of the shattering of the relic. Hence, the relic splits. However, instead of just breaking into irregular pieces, it breaks into 100 equal pieces to demonstrate the uniform, multiplying effect of relics. On the other hand, if one has faith in the relic, it would not have been put to the test in the first place. Therefore, the effect of an action imposed on a relic is really a function of one's faith.<br><br>Ven. Shi Hsingyun, Founder of Fo Guang Shan and President of Buddha's Light International Association, also said, "If you have faith with the Buddha tooth relic, it will be authentic and will bestow blessings to you, if you have doubt, I do not think that it will give you any blessings at all."<br><br>There is a famous story of the young peasant who went to Lhasa to trade, promising to bring his mother a relic from the Jowo statue of Sakyamuni Buddha. He had such a good time in Lhasa that he forgot all about it until he was a few miles from home. So ashamed was he that he picked up a tooth from a dead dog's skull lying in the ditch by the road, wrapped it in some elegant silk, put it in a gau box, and presented it to his mother. The old woman was delighted and prayed to it constantly. Soon she was regaling the neighbours with the tales of the blessings she was receiving from the fine relic her son had brought her. The son was embarrassed and also felt guilty about deceiving her.<br><br>One holiday he was washing down by a stream, and he decided to confess his trick and disabuse the old woman of her delusion. The moment he came to this resolve, he looked up and saw the precious Jowo statue standing before him. The Buddha statue said to the awestruck peasant, "Young man, do not think your mother does not have a real relic. You forgot, but I remembered, and the dog's jaw was my manifestation. If you don't believe me, go quietly home and observe your mother's prayers!" The son went home directly and quietly went in to his mother's shrine where she was praying. The reliquary was open and the silk unfolded. The tooth was shining with brilliant rainbow rays of light. When she died, she obtained rainbow body and attained enlightenment. This is a very good story. So it really happens that the dog's tooth was not Buddha's tooth; it was a dog's tooth, obviously, no way to mistake that. But somehow she was able to experience her own pure perception of faith in relation to her Buddha nature, by opening her heart, by having faith in that object as Buddha's tooth.<br><br><strong>Benefits of Buddha Relics</strong><br><br>One may ask if there is any benefits for the reappearances of these Buddha relics? The Buddha once said that by seeing His relics, it is like seeing the Buddha Himself. Thus, the Buddha relics are the symbols of qualities of the Buddhahood and the characteristics of enlightened body, so therefore it also represents that the Buddha is always turning the Wheel of Dharma unceasingly.<br><br>In Samsara, our minds are always deluded by ignorance, hatred and anger. If we see the Buddha relics in our own eyes, we will be reminded the qualities of purified mind (Buddhahood) and we will continue to walk on the path to Buddhahood. Whether the relic is true or false, this is no longer important, the question is, if the sarira is still living within your mind? If you have faith on these Buddha relics, it is like having realized that the Buddha is always living within your mind, it will help you to overcome many problems and obstacles. Finally, one will attain liberation, just like the old woman who strongly believed that the dog's tooth is none other than the Buddha's tooth.<br><br>Sarva Mangalam.</div>
