Can't blame you only, because it's not rare.<br><br>There are a lot of people who, when presented with facts and observable realities with scientific methods, simply refuse to accept it because it runs contrary to what he WANTS to believe.<br><br>Similarly when Buddha provided all these, there are those who are so appreciative of it and did all that the Buddha instructed to achieve the same enlightenment and realisations that countless others have done before.<br><br>There are also those who, unfortunately, didnt want to bother with finding out the truth because he felt comfortable with his old dogmatic thinking. An analogy is scientist tell you that the world is round, but you say 'aiya I think the world is flat lah, but who cares anyway, don't wanna bother finding out'. They are the 'bo chap' people who just want to continue living his own life in ignorance, not knowing that there is the possibility of the perfect bliss and liberation of all sufferings in our lives in the realisation of Nirvana, the possibility of fundamental ground shaking insights that shakes our perspective of reality and identity, and a radical transformation of each individual. They choose to continue their own samsaric habitual ways and thinking... and also going through the same old sufferings in cycles again and again.<br><br>And then, the worst type of people, are people like YOU. Those who not only did not bother about finding out the truth when facts and observable realities and scientific method is presented to them -- instead, chose to deny them and accuse them of fallacy. This is the worst kind of dogmatism, he's completely illogical, unscientific and going contrary to what is observed. That's like if scientists telling you the world is round, but not only do you not bother finding out, you go on refuting every single claim about it not bothering to find out the truth of the matter yourself.<br><br>This, to me, is simply pure dogmatism.<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467" rel="nofollow">Buddhism and Science</a> by Ajahn Brahmavamso.<br><br>...<strong>Come and See for Yourself<br><br>If you had just one person who had been confirmed as medically dead who could describe to the doctors, as soon as they were revived, what had been said, and done during that period of death, wouldn't that be pretty convincing? When I was doing elementary particle physics there was a theory that required for its proof the existence of what was called the 'W' particle. At the cyclotron in Geneva, CERN funded a huge research project, smashing atoms together with an enormous particle accelerator, to try and find one of these 'W' particles. They spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on this project. They found one, just one 'W' particle. I don't think they have found another since. But once they found one 'W' particle, the researchers involved in that project were given Nobel prizes for physics. They had proved the theory by just finding the one 'W' particle. That's good science. Just one is enough to prove the theory.<br><br>When it comes to things we don't like to believe, they call just one experience, one clear factual undeniable experience, an anomaly. Anomaly is a word in science for disconcerting evidence that we can put in the back of a filing cabinet and not look at again, because it's threatens our worldview. It undermines what we want to believe. It is threatening to our dogma. However, an essential part of the scientific method is that theories have to be abandoned in favour of the evidence, in respect of the facts. The point is that the evidence for a mind independent of the brain is there. But once we admit that evidence, and follow the scientific method, then many cherished theories, what we call 'sacred cows' will have to be abandoned.<br><br>When we see something that challenges any theory, in science or in religion, we should not ignore the evidence. We have to change the theory to fit the facts. That is what we do in Buddhism. All the Dhamma of the Buddha, everything that he taught, if it does not fit the experience, then we should not accept it. We should not accept the Buddha's words in contradiction of experience. That is clearly stated in the Kālāma Sutta. (AN III, 65) The Buddha said do not believe because it is written in the books, or even if I say it. Don't just believe because it is tradition, or because it sounds right, or because it's comforting to you. Make sure it fits your experience. The existence of mind, independent of the brain, fits experience. The facts are there.</strong><br><br>Sometimes, however, we cannot trust the experts. You cannot trust Ajahn Brahm. You cannot trust the scientific journals. Because people are often biased. Buddhism gives you a scientific method for your practice. Buddhism says, do the experiment and find out for your self if what the Buddha said is true or not. Check out your experience. For example, develop the method to test the truth of past lives, rebirth and reincarnation. Don't just believe it with faith, find out for yourself. The Buddha has given a scientific experiment that you can repeat.<br><br>Until you understand the law of kamma, which is part of Buddhism, kamma is just a theory. Do you believe that there is a God 'up there' who decides when you can be happy or unhappy? Or is everything that happens to you just chance? Your happiness and your suffering in life, your joy, your pain and disappointments, are they deserved? Are you responsible or is it someone else's fault? Is it mere chance that we are rich or poor? Is it bad luck when we are sick and die at a young age? Why? You can find the true answer for yourself. You can experience the law of kamma through deep meditation. When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, the two knowledge's he realized just before his Enlightenment were the knowledge from experience of the truth of rebirth, and the knowledge from experience of the Law of kamma. This was not theory, not just more thinking, not something worked out from discussions around the coffee table this was realization from deep experience of the nature of mind. You too can have that same experience.<br><br>All religions in the world except Buddhism maintain the existence of a soul. They affirm a real 'self', an 'essence of all being', a 'person', a 'me'. Buddhism says there is no self! Who is right? What is this 'ghost in the machine'? Is it a soul, is it a being, or is it a process? What is it? When the Buddha said that there is no one in here, he never meant that to be just believed, he meant that to be experienced. The Buddha said, as a scientific fact, that there is no 'self'. But like any scientific fact, it has to be experienced each one for themselves, paccattam veditabbo viÃ±Ã±ūhī. Many of you chant those Pāli words every day. It is basic scientific Buddhism. You have to keep an open mind. You don't believe there is 'no self', you don't believe there is a 'self' both beliefs are dogmatism. Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samādhi and paÃ±Ã±a, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice. Do the same experimental procedures that the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Repeat it and see if you get the same results. The result is called Enlightenment.<br><br>Men and women have repeated that experiment many times over the centuries. It is in the laboratory of Buddhist practice that the Enlightened Ones, the Arahants, arise. The Arahants are the ones who have done the experiment and found the result. That's why Buddhism always has been the scientific way. It is the way of finding out for your self the truth of Enlightenment....

Because they are the persons that can guide you closely along your path, being a living embodiment of enlightenment.<br><br>Similarly if you want to learn a subject and get a degree, you need to find a Ph.D or other highly qualified person to teach you. It doesn't make sense for you to learn yourself, because by learning yourself you can get wrong understanding, wrong concept with nobody correcting you, and you will progress much slower.<br><br><blockquote>I would advise that AEN refrain from using the word "cult" on religious groups that has been allowed to register with the Registrar of Societies and Associations unless the Ministry of Home Affairs has said otherwise.

There is generally no doubts that Buddha existed in India, lived a life as a prince (even had a wife and a son), and later renounced, sought enlightenment, attained enlightenment and started his 49 years of dharma teaching.<br><br>But not only that, the Buddha still exists right now. Buddha Nature is all pervading like space, it is in a blade of grass and a tree, and your dog, and everything you see and feel. Everything is an expression of buddha, our buddha nature, pure awareness. You can see, hear, smell, etc, your 6 sense faculty is functioning because of Buddha Nature, or pure awareness. Therefore everyone, every sentient being has Buddha Nature. To awaken to that pristine nature which has always been here but missed due to our ignorance, we have to practise Buddhism, to develope wisdom and purify our minds.<br><br>But it is not through seeking Buddha in his physical forms and appearances that we can attain Enlightenment, for the true Buddha Nature is Empty (not void, or non-existence, but empty as in dependently arisen, transient, ungraspable, empty of inherent existence) and luminous. It is said in the Diamond Sutra:<br><br>Â“He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).Â”<br><br>Â“All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.Â”<br><br>He also used to say: He who sees the Dharma sees the Buddha.<br><br>To awaken is to see the Buddha.</div>
