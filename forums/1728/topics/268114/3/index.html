Besides that,  most singaporeans r not actually true buddhists per se, but rather practioners of "min jian xin yang" as AEN has pted out. Many of them will be concerned over the authencity of the tooth relic. How many of them have donated mainly because they feel that the tooth relic is authentic? I feel that true buddhists will not be so worked up, as they see donating as a meritiorious act.<br><br>What I dun agree is with Ven Fazhao's comments. As a buddhist monk of high repute, he should take part in this healthy debate, instead of avoiding it.

Lord Buddha taught that Faith is a positive mental energy that allows a practitioner to sustain and persevere in both good and bad times.<br><br>However, I think earthling82's post has little relevance to this thread that was started by LinYu. LinYu posted the news report where 2 different people brought their concerns over the authencity of the tooth to the media. What earthling82 had said may be inspiring but has nothing to do with the news report.<br><br>LinYu is right. It is the spirit of Lord Buddha's Teachings that should be practice rather than venerating on statue or in this case, takes on another form, the tooth relic.<br><br>Personally I have 3 observations from this tooth saga:<br><br>1. For buddhists who have the right understanding and right view, in the very first place, they won't even be bothered by this tooth relic, even if it is real because they will understand that the true relic of Lord Buddha is His Teachings instead. To venerate Lord Buddha's relic would mean to live His Teachings day by day to the best of our abilities.<br><br>2. For 'ming jian xin yang' buddhists, if they were made to believe that donating money in the cause of building this Tooth Relic Temple will accumulate merits, then I think I am both happy and sad for them. Happy is because I honestly believe that these people donated the money <strong>believing</strong> it to be a good cause, this genuine intention itself is meritous; however, SGD 45million and 270kg of gold could have really really put into better usage. Sad is that the trust these people have would be considered as abused if it turns out the relic to be a fake one. But of course, if not making people to believe that the tooth relic is real in the very first place, I doubt this lot of money and gold would have been collected.<br><br>3. I feel that for the answers that Ven Fazhao had given in the article was an embarassment. The manner Ven Fazhao had answered seem to be best represent that of someone with blind faith. For Buddhism to be a realistic and practical religion, can in no way escape the verification from Science (as many of you would have discussed Science in other threads).<br><br>I was fortunate to have spoken to this Mr Zhou, an editor of Vaidurya this afternoon. I mentioned about having DNA test on the tooth relic, he brought up a good point and that is that it is impossible to know the DNA of the Buddha so there will be no way to verify in the end. But I was thinking to myself, well at least we can test whether or not does it belong to a human in the first place. Lord Buddha, was a man, it would be rather absurd to say that after His Enlightenment, His features would have suddenly have a tremendous transformation right? (Buddha not extreme makeover wor).<br><br>As Sanath had rightly pointed out that the alleged tooth relic should be seen as a property to the whole buddhist community. To say that the tooth relic belongs to Ven Fazhao himself and it was a private matter between himself and Venerable Cakkapala, then I think he would be in no position to have solicit money from the public in the first place.<br><br>"As for the dental experts' assessment, he (Ven Fazhao) said: 'They can say all they want, I don't care what they say. If you believe it's real, then it's real.' "  &lt;--- For a buddhist monk who is the 1st Vice Chairman of the Singapore Buddhist Federation and abbots for 2 temples, this would have really make people doubt the standard and credibility of the understanding of the Buddha's Teachings in Singapore. Didn't Buddha always teach that it is our duty to verify things that are in doubt?<br><br>"Would he let an expert examine the tooth in Singapore? He replied: 'It's mine, why should I let you examine it? Why don't you go examine what's in Sri Lanka and China first?' " &lt;--- I found someone mention that "in Venerable FazhaoÂ’s publication Â“New Discoveries On The Threshold of EnlightenmentÂ”, it is stated at page 83 that Â“This tooth relic has been inspected and authenticated by experts from Japan". If this would be true, then why not show the documents from the Japanese experts and can close case? Wait a minute, didn't Ven Fazhao just mention he won't allow the relic to be tested, then why it had apparently been tested by Japanese experts? Contradicting?<br><br>My conclusion is that this saga would be a typical of what I will term monkism, people simply believe what a monk says rather than to find out the truth for themselves. Now if I say I have Buddha's  and I <span style="font-style: italic;">believe</span> so, I think in no time I will get flammed simply because I am not a monk!<br><br>Of course some would quote the story about the son using dog's bone to say it's relic to his mother. Well that may seems to be a skillful mean but now let me ask you, if someone were to give you a rat poison and say it's panadol, will you take it?<br><br>Any buddhist who has regards that Buddhism to be the Truth surely won't be stooping into such low-class lie because Lord Buddha teach that the Truth shall prevail and this is what is happening now!<br><br>Compassion is how a buddhist would show his altruism towards others but never forget that Wisdom should be the fundamental quality that a buddhist should have not only to guide others but to protect oneself too.<br><br>I hope after this saga, buddhists, especially those with right understanding and right view would see it that it is also the laypeople's responsibility to uphold the purity of the flow of the Dhamma. Instead of getting disheartened, we should get inspired!<br><br>Apologies to all, getting a bit "brain-dead" due to work and studies. I shall end my post with two quotes:<br><br>"Ren Neng Hong Dao; Fei Dao Hong Ren" --- a taoist saying (which I like a lot, it literally means man can propogate the Path not the other way round)<br><br>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" -- Edmund Burke (January 12, 1729 Â– July 9, 1797) [/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Yamizi,<br>Would like to give my humble views to your personal observations:<br><br>" For buddhists who have the right understanding and right view, in the very first place, they won't even be bothered by this tooth relic, even if it is real because they will understand that the true relic of Lord Buddha is His Teachings instead. To venerate Lord Buddha's relic would mean to live His Teachings day by day to the best of our abilities."<br><br>- True. But I think we should be careful in saying that we buddhists "don't bother" at all. Cos it may turn into ideas like " don't bother" abt the Dharma, don't bother abt eating, sleeping, living, even existing. Before we talk abt emptiness of forms, we must know what is form first. Before we talk abt the profound, we must have first understood the profund. Be careful of becoming a nilhilist, or give others the ideas that Buddhists are such.<br><br>" For 'ming jian xin yang' buddhists, if they were made to believe that donating money in the cause of building this Tooth Relic Temple will accumulate merits, then I think I am both happy and sad for them. Happy is because I honestly believe that these people donated the money <strong>believing</strong> it to be a good cause, this genuine intention itself is meritous; however, SGD 45million and 270kg of gold could have really really put into better usage. Sad is that the trust these people have would be considered as abused if it turns out the relic to be a fake one. But of course, if not making people to believe that the tooth relic is real in the very first place, I doubt this lot of money and gold would have been collected."<br><br>- I think ppl donated for various reasons. Some may hv donated becos they support Ven. Fazhao, some wanted to believe the relics, some believed the venerable, some want to be part of this meaningful effort of building a Buddhist way place,some just want to donate to all temples regardless of there is relics or not, real or fake. Of cos there are also some that never donate anything in their whole life, not even $1.<br>So each to his own. No need to feel sad or happy for  the donors, or, donations. Unless we want to make use of the relics to create unrest for these donors now by forcing the temple to go to science labs, police, court etc. What is the ultimate motive of those mentioned in the ST? Want to "expose" something? What? Cheating of funds? Con job suspected? Criminal offence commited? Another NKF saga?<br><br>So what is the ultimate purpose of building this temple? This is one of the many important ways of spreading the Dharma--- building a way place.( pls don't talk abt emptiness again, almost all of us here haven't reach that level yet. we must know the basic first. eg; runing is fast, everyone can run; but we must know how to stand up first, how to crawl, how to walk first.) Ven. Fazhao asked for donations to build the temple to house the relics, to hold Dharma talks, to provide Buddhists and non- buddhists a place for learning and spiritual relaxation.

            <div class='col-md body'>cont fr above.<br><br>" I feel that for the answers that Ven Fazhao had given in the article was an embarassment. The manner Ven Fazhao had answered seem to be best represent that of someone with blind faith. For Buddhism to be a realistic and practical religion, can in no way escape the verification from Science (as many of you would have discussed Science in other threads). "<br><br>- What is blind faith? pls refer to the dog's bone story again. Unless if u see the behaviour of the mother in the story as blind faith, then maybe u can't grasp the concept yet. Yes, Science can actually proves many sutras to be relevant and that's why Buddhadhamma has become easier to understand becos of Morden Science, BUT, mordern science today is still way way way behind. To lay ppl like us, of cos any science is rocket science, but Buddhadharma is much more deeper than what science of tdy's level can proves. This I think only the relevant experts can discuss. AEN and the other Moderators had given many links regarding this aspect, can refer to them.<br><br>"I was fortunate to have spoken to this Mr Zhou, an editor of Vaidurya this afternoon. I mentioned about having DNA test on the tooth relic, he brought up a good point and that is that it is impossible to know the DNA of the Buddha so there will be no way to verify in the end. But I was thinking to myself, well at least we can test whether or not does it belong to a human in the first place. Lord Buddha, was a man, it would be rather absurd to say that after His Enlightenment, His features would have suddenly have a tremendous transformation right? (Buddha not extreme makeover wor)."<br><br>- As mentioned earlier, this is abt giving believers the faith so as to continue their Buddha path. PLs refer to Dog's bone story. Anyway, I thought u mentioned abt real Buddhists don't bother abt the relics authencity? If this is so, which can be absolutely true to enlighten beings, then why insist on DNA testing of an item valued so preciously by others? If we said Ven Fazhao doesn't owned it, then we are? OK, lets break it down this way: Ven Fazhao is the abbot of the temple, the temple housed the relics, the donors &amp; supporters built the temple, so by the law, we can't really said the relics belong to u or me, or all Buddhists; but to those who helped to presevred or housed it. So by the law, which now some try to use in this case, we hv no right to insist on any testing. If criminal offence is suspected, the police should be informed. Don't go around to creat unneccessary unrest ( in this case social harmony of different religions is also affected) among believers towads the Sangha. There are right routes when there are right cause, no need to make a scene.<br><br>"As Sanath had rightly pointed out that the alleged tooth relic should be seen as a property to the whole buddhist community. To say that the tooth relic belongs to Ven Fazhao himself and it was a private matter between himself and Venerable Cakkapala, then I think he would be in no position to have solicit money from the public in the first place."<br><br>- same as above. And just to add on: the money was solicited fr the public who believe, just as both the Venerables, in the tooth relic. Those who don't , don't give, no harm done. The Ven housed the relic in his temple, it is "his" in this sense. U mean I being a Buddhist, can also just go in there, take the relic and give to someone else? The reason being that the relic "belongs" to all Buddhists?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"As for the dental experts' assessment, he (Ven Fazhao) said: 'They can say all they want, I don't care what they say. If you believe it's real, then it's real.' "  &lt;--- For a buddhist monk who is the 1st Vice Chairman of the Singapore Buddhist Federation and abbots for 2 temples, this would have really make people doubt the standard and credibility of the understanding of the Buddha's Teachings in Singapore. Didn't Buddha always teach that it is our duty to verify things that are in doubt? "<br><br>- same as above. Add on: I seriously wonder many ppl are in doubt of what? In doubt of the Dharma, study more, practise more. In doubt of Buddha, research more, read more. In doubt of the sangha, first ask ourselves is egoism in play here? Are we thinking we are the only smart and wise ones here? Many ppl cannot even uphold the 5 precepts, so don't doubt the over hundred of precepts the sangha is abiding. Always respect our teachers( the sangha) first, just as we respect one's elders or seniors, kings, govt, states, country... and not immediately suspect the worst for the sake of doubting. Doubts that improve skillful mental qualities is good, doubts that creats unskilfull mental qualities, or unrest in the community, society, world, is not to be encouraged.<br><br>]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by cycle:<br>- True. But I think we should be careful in saying that we buddhists "don't bother" at all. Cos it may turn into ideas like " don't bother" abt the Dharma, don't bother abt eating, sleeping, living, even existing. Before we talk abt emptiness of forms, we must know what is form first. Before we talk abt the profound, we must have first understood the profund. Be careful of becoming a nilhilist, or give others the ideas that Buddhists are such. </blockquote>"Don't bother" at this context would refer to whether the tooth relic or not is real, I think I had mentioned it clearly and didn't mean anything else. I would appreciate that you would not have misinterpret my meaning.<br><br><blockquote><br>- I think ppl donated for various reasons. Some may hv donated becos they support Ven. Fazhao, some wanted to believe the relics, some believed the venerable, some want to be part of this meaningful effort of building a Buddhist way place,some just want to donate to all temples regardless of there is relics or not, real or fake. Of cos there are also some that never donate anything in their whole life, not even $1.<br>So each to his own. No need to feel sad or happy for  the donors, or, donations. Unless we want to make use of the relics to create unrest for these donors now by forcing the temple to go to science labs, police, court etc. What is the ultimate motive of those mentioned in the ST? Want to "expose" something? What? Cheating of funds? Con job suspected? Criminal offence commited? Another NKF saga?</blockquote>You seems to contradict yourself a little over here. As you had mentioned buddhists are not people who are not bothered with anything else, so in this manner, someone who advertise that the relic is of Sakyamuni Buddha's remain should be questioned. In fact any buddhists would be qualify in asking for the authencity. As you had mentioned, some people donate because they support Ven Fazhao, well I'm not judging him or what, but trust in sangha shouldn't be abused or misused. For the fact that Ven Fazhao claimed the tooth relic to be the remain of Sakyamuni Buddha, people would have taken his words for it. Now if Ven Fazhao had publicised otherwise say, this relic is a reprica and serve as a reminder and symbol of faith, that would be a totally different issue altogether.<br><br>Please don't misinterpret that I would want to create unrest, that would never be the thing in my mind. Rather as a buddhist, seeker of Truth, would like to clarify and verify the matter. I think the motive of ST would be the same as mine, to find out the Truth. Of course if you are not interested in the Truth so be it. But I believe many out there are interested. Time now is different, people are more educated, becoming more knowledgeable.<br><br>If the tooth relic turns out to be a fake one and because during the fund raising, they didn't mention that it is a fake one, then it really seems to be a fraud isn't it?<br><br><blockquote><br>So what is the ultimate purpose of building this temple? This is one of the many important ways of spreading the Dharma--- building a way place.( pls don't talk abt emptiness again, almost all of us here haven't reach that level yet. we must know the basic first. eg; runing is fast, everyone can run; but we must know how to stand up first, how to crawl, how to walk first.) Ven. Fazhao asked for donations to build the temple to house the relics, to hold Dharma talks, to provide Buddhists and non- buddhists a place for learning and spiritual relaxation. The relics, like the Christain cross, act as a form of faith to believers. AEN and Bohiruchi gave the story of the dog's bone to explain this. Many of us need  to first build faith.</blockquote>I never intended to talk about emptiness, apologies but I have no idea how you got there. Please don't misquote me. There are many ways to spread the Dhamma but if the tooth relic in question <span style="font-style: italic;">indeed</span> turns out to be a fake, how are we going to answer to buddhists and non-buddhists alike that such a high status monk resort in such deceiving manner?<br><br>Yes, basic is important, I totally agree with you but if the basic is built upon a lie, how much trust and credibility do we hold?<br><br>What is the 4th precept?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Musavada veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>Sacco mudu sanhavaco kalyanavakkarano bhavami</span><br><br>We take the precept to abstain from lying.<br>We will speak the <strong>truth</strong>, words mild, pleasant and <strong>noble</strong>.<br><br>The temple in question has been open for about 2 months? But the impression I had as I have been there 3 times myself, was nothing but merely performing some blessing rituals.<br><br>Yes, I agree with you that tooth relic can be a symbol. But is this tooth relic an authentic or replica? This would have to come clean first.<br><br>The story given by AEN and Bodhiruici, no doubt is inspiring but has its flaw. First is that it's the son to the mother who is seriously ill, so the son had little choices but to tell a <span style="font-style: italic;">white lie</span> to bring the mother to comfort. But how can you <span style="font-style: italic;">assume</span> all buddhists out there would want to be spiritually consoled in this manner? Of course I guess that you might say, well this is only meant to attract those who need such kind of comfort. But is this really what Lord Sakyamuni Buddha had taught? To pray to his remains?<br><br>There is a sutta that sort of address to this issue in the Pali Canon which I can't remember offhand. During Buddha's time, there was this monk, he always like to sit in the first row of the congregation looking at Buddha in awe. One day Buddha asked him a question which the monk ain't really paying attention. The Buddha then told this monk that, "My (Buddha's) body is nothing but a bag of filth that is not worthy of adoration but one should honour the Dhamma that I teach." (will find exact quote but it was meant to be somewhere along that line).<br><br><blockquote><br>Ven. Fazhao said firmly that he believed the tooth relic to be real, so I think it was up to the donors to believe him or not. Those did, donated.

Cycle, I am not a white-blower but how sure are you to know there is no hidden portion of donations? Nobody knows? And I'm not interested with that, I am only interested in knowing whether the relic tooth, say, belongs to human in the first place.<br><br>To others,<br><br>To the best of my knowledge, Buddha was not a herbivour. He was not a vegetarian to begin with. In fact, to the best of my knowledge (any bio student can verify?), human anatomy by birth is of omnivour?<br><br>Thank you</div>
