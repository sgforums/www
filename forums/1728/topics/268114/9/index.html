You post to irk and offend, not to clarify and discuss. Your so called "immutable" facts are often cryptic, unsupported one-liners that masks your ignorance.<br><br>Number 2: A lot of countries and people do not have the opportunity to hear of the dharma, let alone practise it.<br><br>Number 3: Not true.
