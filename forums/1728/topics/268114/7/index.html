Every second is a second closer to death anytime.

This thread is meant to discuss on the authencity of the relic in questioned, please do not divert the focus away.<br><br></blockquote>You dun have a past to hide , so I am also not bothered with you .<br>well I can dig out all the attack you made to Tibetan Buddhism on derogatory remarks like "tantric sex " "demonic religion "<br><br>If your mind is pure, so why do you see them as demonic ?I still going back to the Cheng Kuan Patriach on refuting all this views of Pheonomenon perceiving<br>wrathful deities and protector as Demons<br><br>so tell me ,Guan Gong is a protector of Buddhism ,do you think he should put on a smile ?<br><br><blockquote><br>Why would you need to dare me to set up a society? A buddhist society simply is an organisation that gathers like-minded buddhists. Keyword, like-minded. Which therefore, even though historically we have only one Buddha who appeared in the world, so many societies were established because I believe the various founders would have their different reasons, or to put it in more buddhistic term yin yuan, in setting up their respective societies.<br></blockquote>Historically yes one Buddha , but Buddha taught there are many other Buddha before us<br><br>Amitabha Budha<br>Medicine Buddha<br>Akshobhaya Buddha<br>and many many Buddha ,based on which sutra you say there is only one Buddha which have affinity with us ?<br>If you deny Amitabha Buddha ,then you are still denying Buddha's teaching in totality<br><br><blockquote><br>However, the only buddhist authority in the history of Buddhism itself would seems to be during the Buddha's time. However, the just and fair authority would have eventually disappear and in modern times we do not have a sole and single buddhist authority that suppose to control buddhists all round the world. I sincerely believe that Lord Buddha would encourage both ordain and laity to discuss and share the wonderful Dhamma.<br><br></blockquote>tell me why you need to CONTROL buddhist ?<br>and how is it wonderful in Buddhadharma ?<br><br><blockquote><br>On the contrary, I would like to remind of your remarks making against me for the various post. Using kammic fruition, death, "expose my past" (as if I don't know what are you doing behind) as methods in order to keep me quiet. I personally for one think that what you had commented are definitely uncoming from a buddhist.<br></blockquote>I still know the president and several people who were your junior , they are still my network of friend .<br>I wont expose you ,but you better mind your practice<br><br><blockquote><br>This seems to suggest that you are not in an objective mindset in enquiring the truth pertaining to the tooth relic saga. I would say if you can't make any constructive sharing then probably it will really be great merits for you to stop posting instead of using various threat-like means in an attempt to stop me and indirectly stoping others forummers.<br></blockquote>constructive sharing, I wont say it is constructive ,becos you use lying in your reply post to me<br><br>so I am trying to hoodwink other here .I think you forget ,its you who shoot the first arrow<br><br><blockquote><br>I believe forums, especially buddhist forum are meant to be healthy exchange of experience and observation for the benefit of everyone. As buddhists, we ought to be careful the way we present ourselves, be it agreeing or disagreeing with the points exchange. The impression that Lord Buddha gives me during my pursuit in the Dhamma for 10 years is that He definitely would encourage healthy exchange of ideas.<br></blockquote>if you can call Lord Buddha , the why do you slander Amitabha Buddha .<br>You are as good as denying Buddha powers to see beyond things<br><br>How do you know I do not have a pure mind? You mean you have pure mind? Having a pure mind would resort in the above means in attempting to keep me  and others quiet? And who are you to say I degrade the works of Kamma?<br><br>LOL<br><blockquote><br>I will like to conclude my posting by inviting the owner/moderator to keep a close watch on this thread, especially on bodhiruici's hostile and unfriendly remarks towards other forummers. I remembered bodhiruici used word like "Begone" to TheGoodEarth. I don't think that's warranted, especially bodhiruici is a senior member of this forum, I am concerned that this will create a negative impression to others or even caused potential good postings not to surfaced due to the fear of getting flamed. I hope the owner/moderator would take necessary actions against such unruly behaviour.<br></blockquote>so you are the policeman , i am the thief ah ?<br><br>Thank you</div></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>Many thanks ,may you start to realise your folly<br><br>may you be well and happy for 35 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 years</div>

Is the tooth relic in question belongs to human in the first place?<br><br>2. Should buddhists encourage scientific testing on the tooth relic in question?<br><br>3. Please be reminded that years back BTRT advertised that the tooth relic in question is the authentic remain from Lord Sakyamuni (caine tooth from lower left jaw), so if the tooth relic in question is a fake one, how should buddhists with the right faith, right understanding and right view response to this issue? ie. monk with high status negligent in checking on the authencity of tooth relic in question; common people losing faith and sees Buddhism as a lesser credible belief as the monk is not forthcoming when he was interviewed by the reporters; etc.<br><br>I will urge that forummers to contribute to a healthy discussion. This can only happen if everyone would be mindful and objective in their postings.<br><br>If anyone would like to discuss subjects that is irrelevant, I hope that they will be started in other threads.

Other than that I don't see how is it possible to know it if it is real or fake. </blockquote>The media has already reported it. Not just the experts they consulted said it's not human, but every dentist and doctor worth his salt will certify that it is not human. I have no issue if any person wishes to venerate any object as sacred...that's his prerogative. But the fact remains the tooth as shown in the newspapers is not human.</div>
