Faith will inspire us to acquire Understanding and through Understanding it strengthens our Faith.<br><br>Now before you say I slander anyone, I hope that you could read my posts carefully again. One of the issues I had raised in my posts is simply on the authencity of the questioned tooth relic.<br><br>Is that slandering? It is merely in the spirit of the Dhamma to encourage us to <strong>find out the Truth</strong>. How can that be considered as slandering?<br><br>Buddhism definitely teaches about Kamma. Is the kamma of inquiry unwholesome? Or is the kamma of lying unwholesome?<br><br>If you are not expert in relics, then read and learn more! Since you claim to have a "medium collection of sutra" definitely there would be sutras touching on the issue right?<br><br>I'm not an expert to begin with but years back since its first apperance it did spur me up a bit to understanding the issue rather than just go and pray.<br><br>I'm not sure whether will people see and understanding life is about suffering or not but I'm sure that I got feedback that there are people saying Buddhism is a big lie over this issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Yahoo!SG, Sunday 22 July<br><br><strong>Authenticity of Buddha Tooth Relic still subject of discussion</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Channel NewsAsia - Sunday, July 22SINGAPORE :</span><br>Some people are still continuing to question the authenticity of the Buddha Tooth Relic housed in the temple along South Bridge Road.<br><br>The Tooth Relic is stored on the fourth floor of the temple which usually does not allow any photography.<br><br>But given the current interest, it has made an exception.<br><br>No one is allowed to enter the chamber, but from the outside, you can see the stupor which contains the tooth relic.<br><br>The stupor was built using 420 kilograms of gold, donated by devotees who can only visit the tooth relic twice a year - the first day of the Lunar New Year and Vesak Day.<br><br>The only other way to see it is through brochures, which could be the reason why people are made more curious about its authenticity.<br><br>Some experts have also reportedly questioned whether the tooth is from the Buddha himself.<br><br>Liau Ming Ong, Donor, says: "The reverend Fa Zhou have to come out to speak the truth. You cannot simply brush it off and you think it's real, it's real. It's not correct. We have scholars from all over the world, come here to take a look and they look at the size of the tooth, then it's very ridiculous."<br><br>Ong Kim Dee, Donor, says: "Since we've donated the money, we need to know the truth, whether this is the truth from a Buddha or any animal, we have the right to know. Everyday we see a lot of local and foreign tourists visit the temple. If one day they find out it is not the truth, then I think it's a joke, it's not very good for Singapore."<br><br>Renowned artist Tan Swie Hian had done some research on Buddhism and believes it teaches the pursuit of truth.<br><br>He says: "I don't mind praying to a buffalo's tooth provided I'm told it is one. Let me get it right before my prayer. The Buddha's teaching is all about seeing things as they are and this is nothing to do with Buddhism or faith. It is a claim that can be easily, conclusively proven by science."<br><br><strong>The founder of a Buddhist Art Museum says he had received similar looking tooth relics when he visited Myanmar previously.</strong><br><br>Woon Wee Teng, Founder and Curator, Nei Xue Tang - Buddhist Art Museum, says: "Many monks gave them to me and they told me, of course these teeth are quite similar to the one in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and they told me please, bring them home to Singapore and put in the Museum to display. And of course, I'm very careful. I must do due diligence. What I did was to take them back, to check with the vet, forensic and also I checked with dentists, they're all forensics as well and they confirm that it's a non-human, herbivore's tooth. So I make a decision to not display."<br><br>Mr Woon says if the temple has the Buddha Tooth, then as a public institution it has the responsibility to show proof.<br><br>He adds that the responsibility is even greater if the temple is collecting public money.<br><br>Mr Woon says: "We mustn't be seen by the outside world, internationally that we can't tell the difference between a horse tooth and a human tooth. That would be a disaster, it's a lot of embarrassment. I think they should get it right and since it's so clear that it's a herbivore's tooth, then they must rectify it."<br><br>And verifying the authenticity of all displays is something the Asian Civilisations Museum takes seriously.<br><br>Tan Huism, Deputy Director - Curation and Collections, Asian Civilisation Museum, says: "A museum is a place where we'll display objects that are authentic to the cultures. We decide whether these objects are authentic to their cultures and their timing...through stylistic comparisons with similar objects found at that time and other museums.<br><br>"We would then look at the pieces and see how these pieces compare with similar pieces from other museums. Of course you could also do scientific testing."<br><br>Within the temple grounds, there are many notices explaining its position on the tooth relic.<br><br>It says the suggestion of DNA testing, whilst simplistic, is a practical challenge to conduct.<br><br>It adds DNA testing is also invasive and it is unlikely that any Buddhist Temple and their devotees would agree to such a test for what they believe to be the Buddha Tooth. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Faith in the Buddha Dharma is a very important thing, not faith in a well-known monk nor in a relic. Even in our Jodo Shin (Japanese Pure Land) tradition, though we frequently speak of Faith or Entrusting, it is NOT a type of blind faith or unquestioning faith in "something".<br><br>As stated in the Nirvana Sutra:<br><blockquote>Good sons! There are two kinds of shinjin (faith): one is trust and the other is searching. Such people, although they have trust, are incapable of searching. Therefore theirs is termed "imperfect realization of shinjin."<br><br>Again, there are two kinds of shinjin: one arises from hearing and the other from reflection. These people's shinjin has arisen from hearing but not from reflection. Therefore it is called "imperfect realization of shinjin."<br><br>Again, there are two kinds: one is to believe that there is enlightenment and the other, to believe that there are people who have attained it. These people's shinjin is belief only that enlightenment exists and not that there are people who have attained it. Therefore it is called "imperfect realization of shinjin."</blockquote>Gassho</div>

And if (yes, if again) this is proven to be a fraud, probably the Police may really come in, we won't know. To the best of my knowledge, there is no buddhist authority in Singapore so I doubt anyone would be able to "disrobe" Ven Fazhao. And if the tooth relic is proven to be a non-human remain, well then it will be up to Ven Fazhao to decide what to do with the temple. Definitely right and justice is a basic human rights for us to persevere and fight for. I had mentioned Faith is not the most important but I didn't say it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> important.

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree with bohiruci's usage of karmic fruition in this context, to stop the debate on the relic.<br><br>My family has donated around $10,000 to said temple. I consider them to be of said "min jian xin yang". I do not consider myself a true buddhist either, not taken refuge in the triple gems, but rather a learner of buddhism, though not qualified in any way nor attended formal classes. You can even say my buddhism background is dubious.<br>Their primary motive for donating was that they believed that the relic was authentic and wanted to accumulated merits for our family and the community at large. So far, they have faith in the relic. Having said this, being donors, I feel that I have a legitimate right to know the truth and to take part in any discussions, without slandering anyone.<br><br>I do not take any side regarding this controversy. But i feel entitled to hearing from both sides of the fence.  I resent your clamping down of the debate, but I welcome you to debate others who hold differing views from you.<br><br></div>

Looking at the natural world, you see creatures divided into carnivorous, herbivorous, etc. So a specie becomes part of the food chain. Big fish eats small fish. Small fish eats plankton. Frog eats flies. Cow eats grass. Squirrel eats nuts. Bird eats worms ..... so human beings eat? Everything he can lay hands on!!!!<br><br>Looking at human anatomy - the jaws, teeth, limbs and body mass - human cannot eat big game, deep seafood, birds that fly because human cannot outrun cheetah, swim deep, or fly high! Hence, leopards, sharks and hawks cannot be human's 'normal' staple. That leaves pigs, chicken, cows, frogs and small fishes that human can catch. Vegetables are within human reach and so are fruits that when ripen should fall to the ground. If not, then it is not for human consumption.<br><br>My view is simple. Whether meat or non-meat, the food we eat are living things. Some you have to 'kill' while others you cultivate or pluck.<br>When you see a tiger going for its prey, do you feel bad? </blockquote></div>
