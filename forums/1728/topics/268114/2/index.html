If the tooth is found to be fake, then the temple and Ven Fazhao would be in big trouble.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, interesting debate! I rejoice xprobe been zealous over Buddha. Quite true that modern people do not have the chance to see the Buddha's 32 major characteristics and 80 minor ones but I do know of a way of seeing the Buddha and I guess many of us here knows how to. To see the Buddha, one will just have to learn the Dharma, practise the Dharma and uphold the Dharma. One will definitely see him in his teachings.<br><br>The tooth whether it is real or fake dun really matters. Even if one had donated a huge amount and if the tooth turns out to be fake, the donor would have accumulated vast amount of merits (oops if he became angry on finding out it is fake). If it is real, even more merit is accumulated. Both are actually win-win situation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  It is the motivation that is really important.<br><br>Hmmm, funny thing for me is till now I still have not visited that place yet.

A Buddha's relic should never be seen as a personal collector items, like paintings etc.  I hope the community who donated to the monastary did it because they wanted to propagate the true dharma teachings, and not for the blessings and personal gains they hope to receive from the presence of the relic.  The reason why Buddha left these relic down through generation was because he wanted these items to remind us to practise Buddhadharma, just like the disciples did in his presence.  If buddhist failed to see this point, they are not true buddhist afterall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted in E-Sangha:<br><br>I have some questions to ask about this relic...<br><br>But first of all, are there pictures of the Sri Lanka's and Kandy's so we can do a little comparison with Singapore's tooth?<br><br><blockquote>As recorded in the sutras, the Buddha was indeed anatomically different from a  mortal human. How can we compare his tooth with a human tooth. His 32 main features and 80 subfeatures all recorded in the sutras. This can possibly explain it. Anyway, the Buddha also had 40 teeth, so this amy also explain the difference.<br><br>See this article below for more details of the 32 main features and 80 sub features<br><br><a href="http://www.onmarkproductions.com/Signs-of-Buddha-32-80.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.onmarkproductions.com/Signs-of-Buddha-32-80.htm</a></blockquote>Regarding this website, it says about Buddha's teeth:<br><br><strong># siihahanu: lion-like jaw (such a jaw is necessary to accommodate the 40 teeth of mark 23.)<br># cattaa.liisadanto: 40 teeth (most people have only 32 teeth and normally some are missing too. Such a set of forty teeth is permanent throughout life -- not like ours which change from milk teeth &gt; adult teeth &gt; false teeth!)<br># samadanto: evenly-spaced teeth<br># avira.ladanto: gapless teeth<br># sukkadanto: crystal canine teeth. Some people ask how when, as we sometimes find in the scriptures, the Buddha and Ananda are walking along, how Ananda could know that the Buddha has noticed something and is smiling about it. Normally, Ananda would walk directly behind the Buddha, but the reason he could know that the Buddha was smiling is because even just the parting of his lips, light would eminate from his canine teeth)</strong><br><br>Just wondering... it says Buddha had 'Canine teeth' and clearly Buddha's teeth looks different from ours, but what exactly is like? How does it look like? Can we do some comparisons with the tooth shown above.</div>

The difference is ashes are literally irreducible small particles in powder form, while sariras are solid relics that cannot be destroyed by any means like fire or pressure or etc, not even if you hit it hard with a metal stick.</div>

The tooth is not his own private property now. It belongs to the temple (of which he is the abbot, not the owner) and the larger community of Buddhists who donated Dana to its building.
