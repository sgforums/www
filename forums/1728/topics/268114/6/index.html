Then, practise accordingly.<br><br>I've also posted another extract of the same passage ( also prepared by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, <span style="font-style: italic;">Noble Conversation </span>) yesterday morning in Daily Buddhism Verses ( maybe easier to digest  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ):<br><br>[1] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he doesn't say them.<br><br>[2] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he doesn't says them.<br><br>[[3] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but unendearing &amp; disagreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time of saying them.<br><br>[4] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, but endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he doesn't says them.<br><br>[5] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, unbeneficial, but endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he doesn't says them.<br><br>[6] In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing &amp; agreeable to others, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings.<br><br>~ MN 58<br></div></blockquote>Hi to cycle and aloka,<br><br>Good quotation but however this discourse has little to do with the tooth relic issue. As the quote itself had mentioned that Lord Buddha will response differently in different circumstances.<br><br>Now we do not have any baby to be pinched by the prince to begin with, unless you are trying to equate that to Ven Fazhao (prince) and the relic in questioned (baby). However, I believe much of the buddhists would like to have the relic to be tested anyway.<br><br>If the both of you do study the Pali Canon, at many places in the Canon, Lord Buddha would always encourage people to "establish the truth and expound it". Lord Buddha also often mentioned that His Teachings is "open and with no hidden secrets". This would suggest that we can feel free to examine before we actually accepts it.<br><br>In this saga, the tooth relic isn't a "teaching" to begin with. It is suppose to be a symbol of faith but it was been publicized as the true tooth relic from Sakyamuni Buddha.<br><br>As tooth relic itself is not a teaching, now this matter will boils down to a factual question. In the most fundamental manner, is the tooth relic in questioned a human tooth to begin with.<br><br>I would like to comment on the 32 signs of great men, if you would to understand a bit more in ancient indian literature, that would probably be their ideal image of a Noble One and hence we should avoid to take it literally.<br><br>In the Pali Canon there seems to be 2 (if my memory didn't fail me) instances, when people didn't recognise who is Sakyamuni Buddha. There is one sutta which tells that there was a man who heard the Noble One's Teaching from bhinkkhu and he was impressed. He made his way to find the Buddha. On his journey he spent a night at a strawhouse (or horse shed). He then met one bhinkhu and given the time of the culture, both of them exchange salute in polite. They soon had a small chat and from the small chat became a conversation. The topic was about the Buddha that this man wanted to visit. As the conversation went on, the man started to realise that he is talking to none other than the Buddha Himself!<br><br>As I had mentioned in another earlier post of mine, if you <span style="font-style: italic;">believe</span> Siddhartha Gautama, upon His Enlightenment would suddenly and instantly change his human anatomy to something else, well then I have nothing to say because that is a personal belief. However, scriptures and scholars alike have been always attribute that Enlightenment is a fully mature state of mind which doesn't mean Lord Buddha's physical form would transform. Or to say when He was borned He just doesn't have human anatomy at all? That sounds scary.<br><br>However I think we should just focus in whether or not the relic in question is human to begin with. Or would anyone who had donated to the tooth relic temple like to share their opinions on this issue?<br><br>Thank you</div>
