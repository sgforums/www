            <div class='col-md body'>Hello oldkid,<br><br>Reply in <span style="color: darkblue;">dark blue </span>again hehe =P<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by oldkid:<br><strong><br><br>Yes, it's just a matter of different point of view.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Definitely!</span><br><br><strong>From this thread I had learnt alot from everyone. From the none-believers, to the neutrals to the absolute-believers, I had learnt valuable lessons.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Me too. In addition to observe how different 'types' of buddhists and non-buddhists responding differently.</span><br><br><strong>It is true that the answer is important sometimes, but then in this case for me, it really doesn't matter. Cos, this is not the way to see Buddha.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I think answers are always important but some answers are <span style="font-style: italic;">not relevant</span>. Some answers may not be relevant to us in a direct way but they can be helpful and come in handy in times. Understanding this issue allows me to explain whoever had gravely misunderstood Buddhism over this issue. Do you know this saga may possibly lead to Duan4 Zhong4 Sheng1 Hui4 Ming4 if people losing trust in Buddhism?<br><br>The way to see the Buddha is definitely to see the Dhamma. How does one sees the Dhamma? By practicing the Dhamma!</span><br><br><strong>I will not be surprised if this issue dies down and go away in another 2 weeks. It will be old news to the media if no more new discoveries are made.</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I have expected that this issue will eventually die down in the mainstream media. However during this more than 2 weeks of commotion, it has certainly caused a lot of feedbacks. Apparently, it suggests to me the "ming jian xin yang' buddhists (ie. the cabbies I have been asking during this period) are more than willing to feel that it is fair to have a scientific test done on the tooth unlike 'buddhists' whom I see online trying to use reasons like faith or some even more hilarious, saying Ven Fazhao had been cheated by the Myammar monk, etc. But no one dare to face the question and challenge squarely. In quite a few other forums, non-buddhistic forums included, there are a lot more sensible and rational reasoning. Even if mainstream media ceases reporting, we always have the alternative media and if the issue is still hot in here, sometimes the mainstream media will just pick up again.<br><br>Personally, even if the whole saga eventually died down in both mediums of media, at least I know that during this time whoever had came across these reports will probably stop to ponder before making contributions to any buddhist organisations. Not to ponder whether or not will the donor gain merits but whether the donation is <strong>genuinely</strong> going for a good cause for Dhamma propogation and charity. Buddhists should have compassion, however compassion alone is not enough, buddhists should be wise in making their decisions. Besides, earning a living in Singapore is not easy so please don't waste money in vain.<br><br>Buddhists should also adhere to relying on the Dhamma and not on the person. As I have mentioned, this issue is related to what I call 'monkism'. Followers of a particular religion just simply believes the words said by clergies of high status. This is definitely not what Lord Buddha would have encouraged. If Lord Buddha would to simply follow someone who has high regards in his belief system, probably He won't even become Enlightened in the first place, as He would have simply <span style="font-style: italic;">followed</span> and not have the will and determination to seek for the solutions to mankind's suffering already.</span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote></div>

The reluctance to face the issue squarely and instead project to so many 'conditions' - Faith, Dhamma, Liberation, etc.</blockquote>There is no need for you to tell me the Dhamma is a great gift. Why make this quotation that every Buddhist knows and OUT OF CONTEXT? You are like the many here who choose to avoid the issue by denial and <strong>projection</strong>. The tooth in the Relic Temple is a great falsehood! Does the Dhamma condone falsehood????<br><br><blockquote>If the tooth is real, its real. If it is not, it is not.</blockquote> This is a no brainer! What kind of logic is this?</div>

Also, as far as this issue is concerned, only humans made some comments here and there. We had forgotten about the Dharma Protectors and the Bodhisattvas who are working very hard right now to propagate Dharma. Although now is the Dharma ending age, things are still not that bad yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>What I'm not so optimistic about, is the amount of slanders that will be made.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>Hehe, I'm being a realist. Human comments, be it online or real life are very important. In the first place, probably many people hasn't get the correct idea of what Buddhism is.<br><br>There are certain things that are the duties of the Bodhisattvas and Dhamma Protectors, however we cannot take Them for granted. There are some responsibilities that as a human buddhists we have to shoulder too. You cannot expect Bodhisattvas and Dhamma Protectors to just appear out of nowhere to teach Dhamma right? They work in subtle way that compliments what we, as buddhists, do in the Saha World.<br><br>The so-called Dhamma ending age will indeed come when no one bothers to understand and practice the Dhamma.<br><br>Slander, again will be a deliberate intend to say something that is not true. Was Siddhartha Gautama consider to be slandering the ascetics and brahmins during His time when He is not convince that what they taught is the solution to mankind's suffering? Put it back in this tooth relic saga case, this tooth relic is in much contraversy and I certainly don't think that would amount to slandering for people who genuinely wanting to find out what is the Truth.<br><br>However, if there are anyone with a deliberate intend or a failure in his or her duty to justify his or her claim on any methodologies or artifacts in the name of Lord Sakyamuni, I think that is slandering.<br><br>Buddhism is not a religion that is build by myth, Buddha was once a human, He lived in ancient India before, we have to be fair to both Buddha and the history of Buddhism to seek clarification.<br><br>If you are worrying that people who calls Buddhism a lie due to this issue as slandering, no worries, their deliberate intend in this manner would have due to the disorientation that is given by someone who was supposed to exercise his obligated duty as a bhinkhu. Those "Xin Fo Da Zhong" is not out of a deliberate intend to attack the Noble Triplegem.<br><br>Few years back, when Ven Fazhao organised the tooth relic and (I think) some other relics exhibition. Touch your heart and imagine (or if you have experience this) if people would have come to ask your opinions on whether or not should a buddhist venerate relics, what is/are your answers?<br><br>1. Yes! Please venerate and donate as much as you can as it will accumulate immeasurable merits!<br><br>2. You must absolute believe in it as it is organised by a monk of high status! No questions ask!<br><br>3. Don't question it as the tooth relic may punish you! (I heard this from a cabbie recently, it was quite hilarious)<br><br>4. Well you can treat it as viewing buddhist artifacts, however you need not take it too seriously.<br><br>5. I wonder where on earth do these bunch of relics appear suddenly, no idea are they for real or not.<br><br>6. It has nothing to do with personal cultivation as the true relic of the Buddha is Dhamma itself.<br><br>7. I think it is a subject worth reading up for, the meaning of relics and history of relics in Buddhism. This will probably enhance my knowledge in the Buddhist culture and further appreciate the Dhamma.<br><br>My answers are point 4 to 7.<br><br>How about you or anyone else who are reading this?<br><br>=)</div>
