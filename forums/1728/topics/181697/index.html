            <div class='col-md body'>(Translated by A.F. Price &amp; Wong Mou-Lam)<br><br><strong>Section VI. Rare is True Faith</strong><br><br>Subhuti said to Buddha: World-honored One, will there always be men who will truly believe after coming to hear these teachings?<br><br>Buddha answered: Subhuti, do not utter such words! At the end of the last five-hundred-year period following the passing of the Tathagata, there will be self-controlled men, rooted in merit, coming to hear these teachings, who will be inspired with belief. But you should realize that such men have not strengthened their root of merit under just one Buddha, or two Buddhas, or three, or four, or five Buddhas, but under countless Buddhas; and their merit is of every kind. Such men, coming to hear these teachings, will have an immediate uprising of pure faith, Subhuti; and the Tathagata will recognize them. Yes, He will clearly perceive all these of pure heart, and the magnitude of their moral excellences.<br><br>Wherefore? It is because such men will not fall back to cherishing the idea of an ego-entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality. They will neither fall back to cherishing the idea of things as having intrinsic qualities, nor even of things as devoid of intrinsic qualities.<br><br>Wherefore? Because if such men allowed their minds to grasp and hold on to anything they would be cherishing the idea of an ego-entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality; and if they grasped and held on to the notion of things as having intrinsic qualities they would be cherishing the idea of an ego-entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality. Likewise, if they grasped and held on to the notion of things as devoid of intrinsic qualities they would be cherishing the idea of an ego-entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality. So you should not be attached to things as being possessed of, or devoid of, intrinsic qualities. This is the reason why the Tathagata always teaches this saying: My teaching of the Good Law is to be likened unto a raft. [Does a man who has safely crossed a flood upon a raft continue his journey carrying that raft upon his head?] The Buddha-teaching must be relinquished; how much more so mis-teaching!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section VII. Great Ones, Perfect Beyond Learning, Utter no Words of Teaching</strong><br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Has the Tathagata attained the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment? Has the Tathagata a teaching to enunciate?<br><br>Subhuti answered: As I understand Buddha's meaning there is no formulation of truth called Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment. Moreover, the Tathagata has no formulated teaching to enunciate. Wherefore? Because the Tathagata has said that truth is uncontainable and inexpressible. It neither is nor is it not. Thus it is that this unformulated Principle is the foundation of the different systems of all the sages.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section VIII. The Fruits of Meritorious Action</strong><br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? If anyone filled three thousand galaxies of worlds with the seven treasures and gave all away in gifts of alms, would he gain great merit?<br><br>Subhuti said: Great indeed, World-honored One! Wherefore? Because merit partakes of the character of no-merit, the Tathagata characterized the merit as great.<br><br>Then Buddha said: On the other hand, if anyone received and retained even only four lines of this Discourse and taught and explained them to others, his merit would be the greater. Wherefore? Because, Subhuti, from this Discourse issue forth all the Buddhas and the Consummation of Incomparable Enlightenment teachings of all the Buddhas. Subhuti, what is called "the Religion given by Buddha" is not, in fact Buddha-Religion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section IX. Real Designation is Undesignate</strong><br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Does a disciple who has entered the Stream of the Holy Life say within himself: I obtain the fruit of a Stream-entrant?<br><br>Subhuti said: No, World-honored One. Wherefore? Because 'Stream-entrant' is merely a name. There is no stream-entering. The disciple who pays no regard to form, sound, odor, taste, touch, or any quality, is called a Stream-entrant.<br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Does an adept who is subject to only one more rebirth say within himself: I obtain the fruit of a Once-to-be-reborn?<br><br>Subhuti said: No, World-honored One. Wherefore? Because 'Once-to-be-reborn' is merely a name. There is no passing away nor coming into existence. [The adept who realizes] this is called "Once-to-be-reborn."<br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Does a venerable one who will never more be reborn as a mortal say within himself: I obtain the fruit of a Non-returner?<br><br>Subhuti said: No, World-honored One. Wherefore? Because 'Non-returner' is merely a name. There is no non-returning; hence the designation 'Non-returner'.<br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Does a holy one say within himself: I have obtained Perfective Enlightenment?<br><br>Subhuti said: No, World-honored One. Wherefore? Because there is no such condition as that called 'Perfective Enlightenment'.  World-honored one, if a holy one of Perfective Enlightenment said to himself 'such am I', he would necessarily partake of the idea of an ego-entity, a personality, a being, or a separated individuality. World-honored One, when the Buddha declares that I excel amongst holy men in the Yoga of perfect quintessence, in dwelling in seclusion, and in freedom from passions, I do not say within myself: I am a holy one of Perfective Enlightenment, free from passions. World-honored One, if I said within myself: Such am I; you would not declare: Subhuti finds happiness abiding in peace, in seclusion in the midst of the forest. This is because Subhuti abides nowhere: therefore he is called, 'Subhuti, Joyful-Abider-in-Peace, Dweller-in-Seclusion-in-the-Forest'.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Section X. Setting Forth Pure Lands</strong><br><br>Buddha said: Subhuti, what do you think? In the remote past when the Tathagata was with Dipankara Buddha, did he have any degree of attainment in the Good Law?<br><br>No, World-honored One. When the Tathagata was with Dipankara Buddha he had no degree of attainment in the Good Law.<br><br>Subhuti, what do you think? Does a Bodhisattva set forth any majestic Buddha-lands?<br><br>No, World-honored One. Wherefore? Because setting forth majestic Buddha-lands is not a majestic setting forth; this is merely a name.<br><br>[Then Buddha continued:] Therefore, Subhuti, all Bodhisattvas, lesser and great, should develop a pure, lucid mind, not depending upon sound, flavor, touch, odor, or any quality. A Bodhisattva should develop a mind which alights upon no thing whatsoever; and so should he establish it. Subhuti, this may be likened to a human frame as large as the mighty Mount Sumeru. What do you think? Would such a body be great?<br><br>Subhuti replied: Great indeed, World-honored One. This is because Buddha has explained that no body is called a great body.<br><br></div>
