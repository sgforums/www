What hides behind this label is a vivid process of involvement, interplay between the causes, conditions giving rise to all appearances.  The activity is alive and vivid.  The flow of blood, the pulsating of the heart beats, the humming of the aircon, the cold air touches the skin, awareness is all these.  It is a mere knowingness without effort to recognize anything, it is one whole sensing.  All true knowledge must evolve from the mere Presence.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Without symbols and labels, the 'self' has no place to rest.  The experience loosen the karmic propensities that bond, you will experience the sudden breaking loose if the 'self' dissolved.<br><br>Also, in the intuitive mode, it will not be right to treat the message to be conveyed as a single bit of information.  It contains all information that are yet to be manifested.  That single bit may contain our entire past histories.  It is the intensity and concentrated penetration of that mode that makes the difference.  The Â“AMnessÂ” experience when intensified might lead us to another path without knowing our ultimate emptiness nature. It is most crucial to study thoroughly what the Buddha taught about the doctrine of no-self and Emptiness even if the teachings challenge the most profound transcendental experiences we have.
