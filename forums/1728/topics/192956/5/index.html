By nature, I am a loner... but not lonely. Being alone gets me peace... i don't like to talk much.<br><br>Are you a channeler?<br><br>About experiences... The following is one of my first expereince of mystical dream...<br><br>In the dream, I was on an unpaved track that is in some wooded area at dawn.<br><br>Two monks approached me... a skinny one, and a slightly plumber guy with very short hair.  Intuitively, I sensed that the plumber guy probably has some 'special psychic powers'. I asked him whether he had psychic powers'. Indeed he confirmed by saying 'Yes'.<br><br>The skinner guy then handed me a hard-covered book. I opened the book and started flipping through the pages. The book contains a lot of paintings that are drawn in the style of Van Gogh, which I think, looked quite cool. In one of the pages, there was a painting of the scene that we are in now. That is, several guys on the track, in the woods. Below the painting are some words. It says<br><br>'Certain events happening in the 3rd Dimension have 'synchronisations' or 'related associations' in any one of the upper dimensions.'<br><br>Then I scroll down the page again. There is another painting Van Gogh style also. It showed the same scenario but from a bigger bird-eye view. In the above account, certain higher dimensional perspectives and an overview of the dynamics behind spiritual and non-physical phenomenon have been clearly communicated to me.<br><br>However, this is not the end of the episode. One afternoon, 2 weeks after the lucid dream, through a series of events, I physically arrived at the spot where I met the 2 guys in the dream. It is during my reservist in-camp training. It was a track in Lim Chu Kang... I was doing 'topo.'<br><br>I had fear of death and suffering of war. And reservist training brings out my past life fears. However, at that moment, when i recognise that this was the place i went to in the dream... a transmission comes into me saying...<br><br>"look, you have died before... but look at yourself NOW!".<br><br>I realise that i am still alive and my fear of death was a waste of time. This was my first war-trauma healing.<br><br>I forget to add... I later found out that the book was my book-of-life or akashic record. It contains my entire history.<br><br></div></blockquote>hi longchen,<br><br>sorrie for the late reply, im busy lately.<br>very much appreciated for sharin ur experiences.<br><br>we r very much alike, in the sense tat our 'suffering' makes us aknowledge teres a linkage from the 'past'. this is not retribution nor reward but merely its the work of karma.<br>im puzzled too and i question myslf everytime,y my life was in 'chaos' till i received pointers frm some beings.<br><br>basically,<br><br>i hav affinity<br>i c wat a buddhist wan to c<br>i c wat a taoist wan to c<br>i c wat an enlighten person will c.<br>i touch my past n c the beyond.<br>i encounter funny funny person like u too, tokin to mi<br>i travel in realms<br>i experience obe<br><br>mine is a bit different where my past reveal like a viewer watchin tv ..playback of the previous lifetime.<br><br>physically im ok like the rest but i noe all along my body of 'low yang high yin'.<br>my body temp always low esp to my limbs. which is y i ned to exercise regurely. but ok lar i still get gold for my reservist ..haa.<br><br>a few months back, my other 'eyes' open out of the blue. which i discoveer when i merely do a short concentration.<br><br>by right i shld hav to reap my karma now ...<br>but i postpone all my karma coz i got to study..but i noe i cant run away.<br>i oso hav my 'eyes' closed.<br><br>how truth can my words be<br>depends on how true u c mi as a friend.<br><br>if its convience for u , i hope u can post moe of ur expereinces up . haa<br>i like readin.<br><br></div>
