            <div class='col-md body'>i can easily fall over to the dark side or the orthodox side. this for a long time i have been aware of....<br><br>its my affinity that i am able to continue to learn buddha's teaching and again take refuge in the three treasures.<br><br>i have an incident, many many years ago....<br>i knew a friend who has things better than me. it seemed that she can get her things her way around so easily without much efforts. but i have to work so hard to get what i least wanted. i was extremely angry about this and was very jealous.<br><br>i stood in the room alone, held my heart and cursed her so badly that one of her badges overnight was tarnished with black mark that could not be erased. the black mark was unknown of how it came to be.....<br><br>she was shocked as she left it in a place where only she could reach and was surprised how it became tarnished.<br><br>perhaps with my heart and mind, the strong will of hatred caused the scar. perhaps it saved her from the curses. yes i regretted doing that after knowing my mistakes.......<br><br>its a matter of fine line apart for me to be on the dark or bright side of practice. when i finally have the affinity to be with buddha, i wish only to learn and practice earnestly buddha's teaching....<br><br>its not anything about being crazy about buddhism, it is because that's how i will put my heart and mind into a practice i choose.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>perhaps this could be why i could see, sense sometimes disturbed by those things. maybe i have caused them their lives in my previous lives on the dark side too.....<br><br>but i vowed to learn the dharma with them to help them free from their suffering states. perhaps when i started to embrace buddhism and taken the refuge in three treasures, my evil karma has lessened. frankly, now i have a more stable calm and clear peaceful mind. its all up there in the head.<br><br>i know now still all the time they are around whenever i study buddha teachings. because i invited them. i don't mind at all. its the least i could do for them for now.<br><br></div>
