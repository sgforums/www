It's predicated on the recognition that we're all one. And the common ground of all beings is that we all want to be happy and well, and have our loved ones be protected and safe and happy and not harmed. We're all joined in that way, therefore we dedicate ourselves to the greater welfare of all, not just for our own selfish, temporary welfare in this short life. When we take the Bodhisattva vow, we make ourselves a spiritual servant, like a saintly or peaceful warrior working for peace, enlightenment and the betterment of all beings. And not just human beings, but all beings of all kinds throughout all lifetimes, in all possible worlds and universes. It's really a saintly, cosmic aspiration of service and dedication to the highest good for all (as opposed to the temporary gratification or the materialism of this life). That's really the basics of Tibetan Buddhism, the Mahayana Buddhism, the Great Vehicle or Great Boat. The vehicle intent on universal liberation, not just individual relief or individual enlightenment. It's realizing that as long as any being is suffering or is imprisoned, I too am not completely free. So we pray, "May we all together complete the spiritual path. We vow not to go to Nirvana or complete our spiritual work until all beings get there." So as long as there is any suffering in the world, there is still spiritual work to do. That's the Bodhisattva vow and the Bodhisattva aspiration and that's the heart of the Mahayana Buddhism. Buddhism really has three schools and Mahayana is probably the biggest.</div></blockquote></div>

But I will like to recount my expereince with the Boddhisatva vow.<br><br>I took the Boddhisatva vow lifetimes ago. Well, it has been continuous hell for me. When you take the vow, you agree to assist others in their liberation. Because of this, very difficult people will enter your life. You will encounter all kinds of difficult people and situation because you 'believe' you need to 'save' them.<br><br>Let me ask a question? Why do you want to take the vow. If it is for glory or a beautiful self-image... we will regret it. For my case, the reason for my taking the vow is less than altrustic.<br><br>You see, lifetimes before I took the vow, I have powerful but dark lives. I was involve in very harmful acts... and that caused me to be very guilty. Lifetimes forward, i try to appease my guilt by taking the boddhisatva vow.

But I will like to recount my expereince with the Boddhisatva vow.<br><br>I took the Boddhisatva vow lifetimes ago. Well, it has been continuous hell for me. When you take the vow, you agree to assist others in their liberation. Because of this, very difficult people will enter your life. You will encounter all kinds of difficult people and situation because you 'believe' you need to 'save' them.<br><br>Let me ask a question? Why do you want to take the vow. If it is for glory or a beautiful self-image... we will regret it. For my case, the reason for my taking the vow is less than altrustic.<br><br>You see, lifetimes before I took the vow, I have powerful but dark lives. I was involve in very harmful acts... and that caused me to be very guilty. Lifetimes forward, i try to appease my guilt by taking the boddhisatva vow. But, what could have been more important is to clear the karma of harmfulness rather than taking a vow to cover a guilt.<br><br>Dear friends, i ask of you to uncover the exact reason for taking the vow.<br><br>All the best...<br><br></div></blockquote>Heh this somehow reminds of me. I thought i can save someone but actually there someone need not to be saved by me.. sometime, i help too much which wasn't too good. Sometime i expect gratitude but hey why shld i expect ? it's not true giving.<br><br>I think one whom want to be a Bodhisattva, have to have the correct mindset, practise and cultivate necessary wisdom and compassion so as to help others. For eg, venerable undergoes some years of training before they are qualified to give dharma talks. Therefore, to be a bodhisattva is not easy.<br><br>If one is not enlightened, insteading of helping others, we might create more harms ourselves and to others when we feel vexed and angry.<br><br>On the other hand, Such situation where anger arised could also be a good opportunity to learn to control and get rid the seeds of anger. We can always learn along the way towards our aspiration to be a bodhisattva.<br><br>Just my 2 cents of worth<br><br>btw long chen, it's good that u feel gulity and want to help others to atone ur mistakes. isn't there consider repentence?<br><br>Maybe this act of helping others create affinity to buddhism for u?ur act of helping others might have lessen ur negative karma.. well u never know...<br><br>anyway good advice there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>May all be well and happy<br></div>
