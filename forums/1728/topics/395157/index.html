              <p><em>In “Ordinary People Can Get Enlightened” (BG 156) and 
                      “Unifying Developmental Enlightenment and Timeless Realization” (BG 
                      157), Kenneth Folk shared his spiritual journey and practical path to 
                      enlightenment with Buddhist Geeks listeners. In the interview below, the
                       long-time Theravada practitioner and meditation teacher introduces his 
                      “Yogi Toolbox”—a straightforward approach to satipatthana vipassana that
                       doubles as an effective way to chart progress on the path. Folk was 
                      interviewed by Atlanta-based freelance writer Joel Groover.</em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“As long as there is someone to suffer, they will.” 
                      –Joseph Goldstein</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>Kenneth Folk:</strong> I have been thinking it would be fun 
                      to talk about the yogi’s toolbox. The yogi’s toolbox is consistent with 
                      the idea that it is good to be dynamic in your practice. It is 
                      consistent with the <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/The+Three+Speed+Transmission">Three-Speed
                       Transmission</a> that you should do whatever practice is appropriate in
                       that particular moment. So one thing I tell people is that one of the 
                      techniques—there is kind of a meta-technique that you have to learn, and
                       that is to know what to do in any given moment.</p>
              <p>One of the metaphors I use is to imagine that there is a peanut in 
                      its shell floating on the surface of a bucket of water. And your task is
                       to touch the peanut with your finger to maintain contact with it. If 
                      you push too hard, your finger just rolls off and you lose contact. If 
                      you don’t apply enough effort, you may never contact the peanut in the 
                      first place.</p>
              <p>And to make it even more realistic, if you introduce some waves into 
                      the water, then you realize that this is a very dynamic process. It is 
                      constantly changing and if you are not allowing any flexibility of mind,
                       your mind does not make contact with the object.</p>
              <p>So one of the things we’re talking about is actually just making 
                      contact with the objects of perception.</p>
              <p>So for example if you are doing vipassana and following the rise and 
                      fall of the abdomen, there is a certain amount of effort required to 
                      make contact and to identify whatever is happening.  In this moment I 
                      can say there is pressure and there is tightness, softness, warmth.</p>
              <p>In order for me to know that, to be able to answer the question “what
                       is happening?” I have to apply the right amount of pressure of mind, as
                       it were. So all of this goes together with the idea of the yogi 
                      toolbox. You have a whole arsenal that you are going to use as 
                      appropriate, and the yogi toolbox also lines up with a way of 
                      diagnosing—it is a way for me to diagnose where a yogi is in their 
                      practice. And it is a way for a yogi to diagnose himself or herself, 
                      once they understand how to do this.</p>
              <p>So what I would like to do is model for you how this works, layer by 
                      layer, and ask you to give it back to me so we can find out what is 
                      going on with you, and then you will understand the process.</p>
              <p><strong>Joel Groover:</strong> OK.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> So the first thing I want to find out is whether
                       I’m embedded in the most basic level of mind, which is body sensation. 
                      This is the first foundation of mindfulness that the Buddha taught. So 
                      I’m going to find out if I’m embedded. I know that if I can objectify 
                      the object–if I can kind of stand apart from it and look at it and say, 
                      “Oh look, there is the object,” then I’m not embedded. By definition, if
                       I can look at it, it is not “I”.</p>
              <p>So I am looking at body sensations right now and I’m going to report 
                      to you in real time: tension… pressure… warmth… heat… coolness… release…
                       tension… release… coolness… pressure… pulsing… release. Notice that I’m
                       slowing down a bit as we go. I’m kind of sinking into this, finding a 
                      groove with it.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Are you looking at whatever bodily sensations 
                      are predominant, or is it like a full scan of all sensations?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> It is kind of both. I’m looking at the body as a
                       whole and whatever jumps out at me is what I’m noticing. Now, if I were
                       not quite sure what to look at then I would just look at the rise and 
                      fall of the abdomen and find sensations there. And some of the 
                      sensations I reported to you just now were from the abdomen.</p>
              <p>OK, so now can you give that back to me?</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Pressure… touching… warmth… pressure. [Pauses of
                       a few seconds between each label.] I have the sensations and I can have
                       a sense of objectifying them, but I’m struggling with how to label 
                      them…</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Sure, and that is part of the training–just 
                      developing that vocabulary of labeling. But we see that you’re able to 
                      identify pressure and warmth and so we know that you’re not embedded at 
                      that level of mind, at least not in the moment that you are doing that.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So it is that basic. It is, “Are you able to 
                      stand apart from physical sensations and see that sensate phenomena are 
                      not me?”</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> That’s right, and we already know the answer to,
                       “Are you able to see that it is not you?” That’s because it is not a 
                      conceptual thing. It is not like I’ve got to ponder whether it is “not 
                      me.” I know it is not me. Even if I do not understand the concept, if I 
                      can stand here and look at sensations “over there,” so to speak—-another
                       way of saying it is that if I can label it, then ipso facto it is not 
                      me.</p>
              <p>So it is not an intellectual exercise at all. If I were never 
                      introduced to the concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence">Three 
                      Characteristics</a>, or if I did not have any Buddhist theory at all, if
                       I could just say pressure, tightness, release, softness, warmth, I am 
                      dis-embedded in the moment of saying that. There is no way to label it 
                      without momentarily dis-embedding from it.</p>
              <p>So now that we know we’re not embedded at that first level of body 
                      sensations, we are going to try the next level and see if we are 
                      embedded there.</p>
              <p>So the next level is, in the Pali language, <em>vedana</em>, and it 
                      is usually translated as “feeling-tone.” This is pleasant, unpleasant or
                       neutral. So I’ll look at the sensations again but I will identify which
                       feeling tone goes along with the sensation. This could be a sensation 
                      anywhere in the body. It doesn’t matter which sensation I’m reporting 
                      on, and you won’t know as I report, but I will report. So here I go: 
                      Pleasant… unpleasant… pleasant… pleasant… unpleasant… neutral… 
                      unpleasant… pleasant.</p>
              <p>Now, we’re not trying to get to a time when everything is pleasant. 
                      That is completely impossible. We are taught by the Buddha that our 
                      birthright as humans is to have pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral 
                      experiences throughout our life—enlightened or not, buddha or not, that 
                      is just what it means to be human. So we are not trying to do anything 
                      with it. We are just trying to objectify it.</p>
              <p>If I am looking at it, it is not “I”, so I know I’m not embedded 
                      there. If you could give that back to me…</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Sure. Unpleasant… neutral… neutral… unpleasant… 
                      pleasant… pleasant… pleasant… neutral.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Good. Now you had no trouble with that.  That 
                      came trippingly off the tongue. That was easy.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes, because I was not trying to go the next 
                      step and figure out the right way to label it.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Good. So we know you’re not embedded at that 
                      layer. But if we ask ourselves, “Well, what happens each time I 
                      dis-embed and objectify one layer?” I’m actually being kicked upstairs 
                      to the next, presumably. And so my sense of “I”, this apparent sense of 
                      I, is probably just hiding in a more subtle level as we go up this… kind
                       of climb the ladder of the strata of mind to ever more subtle levels. 
                      So we are just going to keep on going up the ladder and checking at each
                       level until we find where it is difficult, if it does become difficult.</p>
              <p>Now this is similar to a kind of evaluation that we give to children 
                      at school who are trying to learn—these are kids who are not native 
                      speakers of English. If we want to see how much English they know, then 
                      we start out by asking them questions we are pretty sure they can answer
                       and we just ratchet up the difficulty each time. Eventually we get to a
                       point where the child cannot answer the question. Now we have learned 
                      something very valuable: we know what the level of English proficiency 
                      is: it is somewhere in between the last thing they were easily able to 
                      answer and the one that they cannot answer.</p>
              <p>So we get valuable information from this diagnostic tool.  So we are 
                      going to kick it up to the next level, the next stratum of mind, and we 
                      are going to look at mind states.  A mind state could be identified as 
                      the mental component of an emotion. <a href="http://www.shinzen.org/ShinzenYoung.htm">Shinzen Young</a> has 
                      pointed out that an emotion can be broken down into “something in the 
                      mind” along with “something in the body”—body sensations. One of the 
                      things going on in the mind is its ability to know what the emotion is.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> So just real quick. In that last situation 
                      there, I felt a little bit on the spot and nervous that I might not do 
                      it right. So one of the bodily sensations that I noticed was those 
                      nerves, which I labeled as unpleasant. Was that actually a mind state? 
                      Or I guess you’d say that was a physical…</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Well, all of that is happening at once. But we 
                      are just arbitrarily singling out one thing at a time to label just for 
                      the purposes of diagnosis. But as you say, you felt nervousness or 
                      anxiety. Well that is what we are going to look at now. And we will find
                       out that these things actually change quickly.</p>
              <p>So I will model this: curiosity, joy, investigation, confusion, 
                      amusement, dullness, sleepiness, amusement, joy, annoyance, dullness, 
                      investigation, curiosity, investigation, wonder, happiness, frustration,
                       happiness, dullness. [identifies emotion changes rapidly, with about 
                      one label per second]</p>
              <p>So we see how quickly these things change. What happens—usually if 
                      somebody asks you what your mind state is, if you’re not looking 
                      carefully you might say, “Oh, I’m sad.  I have been sad all day.”</p>
              <p>Well, actually that is not true. There might have been a lot of 
                      sadness, but there was probably almost the entire gamut or spectrum of 
                      emotions changing every few seconds.  You just didn’t notice it. So that
                       happens because we are embedded at that level. So give that back to me 
                      and see how easily that comes to you.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> OK. Let’s see. Interest… spaciousness… calm… 
                      nervousness… dullness… interest… investigation… investigation… 
                      spaciousness… [NOTE: pauses of a few seconds between each label, has 
                      trouble identifying and noting emotion changes]</p>
              <p>Should I try a little more of that?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Try a little more.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Investigation… calm… amusement… amusement… 
                      curiosity… anxious/nervousness. [labeling proceeds somewhat faster]</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> OK, so you have got quite a range there. You 
                      have got the anxiety, the nervousness, the happiness and curiosity.  
                      Good. We know that you’re not embedded there. What we do not know is 
                      exactly what level of competence you have there. And so let me introduce
                       a concept for understanding competence. This is a concept from teaching
                       and learning theory.</p>
              <p>We can divide this up into four levels of competence.  It begins with
                       unconscious incompetence: “I’m doing it wrong but I don’t even know 
                      that I am doing it wrong.” That is the first level. The second level is 
                      conscious incompetence: “I know I’m doing it wrong, but I can’t do 
                      anything about it.” The third level is conscious competence: “If I 
                      really focus on it, I can do it right.” The fourth level is unconscious 
                      competence: “It is such a habit to do it right that I don’t even have to
                       think about it; it just automatically happens.”</p>
              <p>So if you think about this in terms of being embedded in your 
                      experience, the ideal is that it is just a habit to not be embedded—you 
                      automatically objectify everything that arises in the field of 
                      experience and therefore you are free all the time. Below that is the 
                      level of conscious competence—if you work at it and you pay attention 
                      and you keep reminding yourself to do it, you can.</p>
              <p>That is a lot of what goes on in practice. So most of your days and 
                      months and years and decades of practice will be spent cultivating at 
                      that level—“I can be awake if I remember to be awake.” Now we saw that 
                      with you. You are able to… we know that you are at, at least, that level
                       [of conscious competence].  When you pay attention and make the effort,
                       you’re able to not be embedded in those three layers that we looked at 
                      so far.</p>
              <p>So let’s look at the next layer, which is subtle mind objects. For 
                      example, thoughts. This is a very interesting layer, a very important 
                      layer because it is absolutely routine for us to be embedded in the 
                      layer of thoughts. Of course we think we are our thoughts. We spend the 
                      entire day being our thoughts and so it turns out to be this remarkable,
                       precious vacation anytime you can dis-embed from your thoughts.</p>
              <p>And there are a couple of ways to check for this. One of them is to 
                      kind of challenge your thoughts, as though you were talking to someone 
                      else. So you say, “Speak! I’m listening.” And you just watch. “What do 
                      you have to say, thoughts? I’m listening.”</p>
              <p>A remarkable thing often happens. Your thoughts might not have much 
                      to say in that moment because you have objectified them and then there 
                      is this sense of “here I am looking at my thoughts, looking for my 
                      thoughts and they are not arising,” which in itself may be a thought. So
                       you’re going to want to objectify that, too.</p>
              <p>There is another variation on that theme, which is to say, “I wonder 
                      what my next thought will be?” And then you watch your mind the way a 
                      cat watches a mouse hole. Just to see if you can catch the moment that 
                      the mouse pops its head out of the hole-—the moment that the thought 
                      appears. “I wonder what my next thought will be?”</p>
              <p>Now when you do that, what happens?</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Well, it is just as you say.  The thoughts are 
                      wispier. They probably are there, but there is not a big vocalization 
                      because the paying attention seems to make thought fade somehow.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> It does often seem that way. Now it is also 
                      possible to watch thoughts come and go and let them continue to do 
                      whatever they do. There might even be a story going on and it continues,
                       but you can still watch it. As long as those thoughts are objectified, 
                      you are not embedded. You’re good to go.</p>
              <p>So there is another way that we can verify this in real time, and 
                      that is using a noting technique, which can be somewhat challenging just
                       because you might not have the vocabulary to do it yet. But it goes 
                      like this. I will model it: Planning thoughts … remembering thoughts… 
                      thoughts of imagery… remembering thoughts… worrying thoughts… imagery… 
                      investigating thoughts… remembering thoughts… storytelling thoughts… 
                      remembering thoughts… coaching thoughts.</p>
              <p>OK, Joel. Try that.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> [long pause]: Performance thoughts… performance 
                      thoughts… noticing thoughts… investigating thoughts… performance 
                      thoughts… investigating thoughts. [Does technique haltingly]</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Is there any planning or remembering or imagery?
                       Any future-izing or past-izing?</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> There are a tornado sirens going off in my 
                      neighborhood, so I guess hearing thoughts, noticing thoughts.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> You are probably visualizing what it looks like.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Visual thoughts, yeah.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Now as a diagnostic tool, that particular 
                      exercise is best when you’re not doing it for the first time because it 
                      does takes learning the vocabulary of objectifying thoughts. It is not 
                      entirely clear from what we have just heard whether you are embedded in 
                      that layer or not. Use your judgment on that.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> My sense was maybe I am embedded there because 
                      there … well, what I would say is I was having trouble finding the 
                      thoughts. It seemed to be very spacious and quiet, like I could not find
                       planning or remembering thoughts, for example. But when you said 
                      “Image, what about image thoughts?” I realized, yes, there had been—I 
                      had actually pictured the sirens, but I had not noticed that. Is that 
                      evidence of being embedded, I guess?</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yeah. That is a useful data point for us. OK. 
                      Now, let’s go up to the next level and do an exercise meant to dis-embed
                       ourselves from the next level. This is an exercise that I have been 
                      calling, “See how it walks.” Just because when I first discovered it, I 
                      would mostly do it during walking meditation. This is an exercise where 
                      you look at all of the things that we have looked at so far and label 
                      them with a little bit of an added twist. We are going to pull back just
                       one bit more and dis-identify from our experience with this phrase “See
                       how it…”</p>
              <p>I will model it now: “See how it sits. See how it feels pressure. See
                       how it feels warmth. See how it thinks. See how it listens. See how it 
                      hears. See how it feels coolness. See how it feels joy. See how it feels
                       excitement. See how it feels coolness. See how it sits. See how it 
                      feels pressure.”</p>
              <p>So that is incorporating everything we have done so far, plus that 
                      extra little bit of pulling back—as though you’re looking down from on 
                      high at this odd creature that I would habitually think of as myself. 
                      But from that point of view, from the point of view of that exercise, it
                       is not me. It is “it.” Ha ha. Look at it over there doing what it does.</p>
              <p>Now, one of my dharma friends, AugustLeo, has dubbed this practice 
                      “the bystander,” which I think is a wonderful term. So I have begun 
                      using that terminology as well.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> I’m thinking of, there is a point in <a href="http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/Case+Study:+Monica">Monica’s
                       case study</a> where there seemed to be three things present: space, 
                      Monica, and then this bystander. So I’m familiar with that sense. I’ve 
                      had that at times.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Let’s have you do “the bystander”: “See how it…”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> See how it feels pressure. See how it feels 
                      interest. See how it is looking. See how it is investigating. See how it
                       feels self-conscious…</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Make sure you have your posture. It is similar 
                      to one of the suttas of the Pali canon where the Buddha says, “When the 
                      yogi is taking a deep breath or a long breath, he knows he is taking a 
                      deep breath or a long breath. When he is standing, he knows he is 
                      standing. When he is sitting, he knows he is sitting.”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> See how it sits. See how it feels pressure. See 
                      how it breathes. See how talks. See how it investigates.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Good. Now see if you can cycle through all of 
                      those things that we have done so far. So we’ve got body sensations, 
                      feeling tone, mind states, subtle mind objects like thoughts, and then 
                      posture, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> See how it feels pressure. See how it feels 
                      neutral.  See how it feels interest. See how it investigates. See how it
                       sits. See how it feels pressure. See how it feels unpleasant 
                      sensations.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> OK, this is great. So we are systematically 
                      dis-embedding. This is all part of the yogi toolbox. Once the yogi knows
                       these techniques, he or she can apply them all day long and stay 
                      dis-embedded. Because of the nature of the exercise, you know that you 
                      are at least at the level of conscious competence, the third of the four
                       levels of competence, anytime you’re doing it. You are proving it.  
                      This is real-time feedback that you are doing it right. And this is so 
                      important because yogis are constantly second-guessing themselves. “Am I
                       doing it right? Am I making the most efficient use of my practice 
                      time?”</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> That was the next thing I was going to say, was 
                      about this inauthenticity that I felt at times. It was this combination 
                      of being on the spot and wanting to do it well and show that I was doing
                       it well, but there was also this concern that I was not doing it well. 
                      So “just note it,” I guess. [laughs]</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Well, exactly. You see—and you just said 
                      it—those are all objects to be objectified. You just take them and put 
                      them in the grinder and grind them up. So if you feel the inauthenticity
                       and recognize it as such, in that moment you’re absolutely 
                      dis-embedded.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yes. You see the unpleasant feeling tone of the 
                      inauthenticity thought, right? And the body sensation is there as well.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> What this makes me think of is that device on 
                      the back of the professor’s DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>. It 
                      was like a food processor. You could put anything in it and it would 
                      become nuclear fuel to power this car. Well, this practice is the same. 
                      It does not matter what you put into it. It all becomes fuel for 
                      awakening. Every time you notice anything, it goes in the blender and 
                      comes out awake.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> Even really subtle stuff that seems somehow 
                      undermining you can just dis-embed from that.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Absolutely. Every little thing, no matter how 
                      subtle. If you can see it, just turn it into fuel.</p>
              <p><strong>JG:</strong> This to me just sounds like true vipassana. This
                       is what interested me in vipassana.</p>
              <p><strong>KF:</strong> Yes, this is vipassana. Everything we have done 
                      so far is looking at objects of the mind. We have actually taken the 
                      whole spectrum of objects from gross to subtle and right up through the 
                      level of “the bystander.” We are doing what I call First Gear. This is 
                      all vipassana, looking at objects.</p>

              <p>Incidentally, I have to mention.. I was discussing with Longchen on the phone yesterday just before I read this article and this article is very relevant to what I'm talking about.</p>
              <p>However I don't think I'm practicing what Kenneth calls 1st gear - more like 2nd gear with a mix of 1st gear as an aid.</p>
              <p>I wrote to Longchen yesterday (before seeing this article):</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think the noting is very important... for me 
              it's like a shift
                                  from being identified with the stories of the mind, 
              to objectifying
                                  the thought as simply a thought. Like within the 
              story everything
                                  seem so real 'out there', but through noting we 
              notice the present
                                  reality... it is actually just a presently arising 
              thought occuring
                                  in awareness. This brings me back into presence... 
              and from the
                                  perspective of presence/witnessing everything is 
              just seen as it is
                                  but nothing 'sticks' because there is no 
              identification with them
                                  or commenting on them, they just come and go, like 
              dream images
                                  popping in and out of vast presence but without any 
              thread of
                                  continuity (probably due to little or no 
              identification in the
                                  state of presence).. I do experience this even while
               lying on bed
                                  though I am not able to sustain presence in 
              dream/deep sleep where
                                  any sense of presence completely disappears (and 
              anyway Thusness
                                  told me not to try that before). I think in this 
              state of presence
                                  whether thoughts occur or not is fine... a thought 
              is just a
                                  thought and the witnessing is not 'disturbed'.. the 
              key is whether
                                  or not there is identification/attachment to those
                                  concepts/thinking or whether it is simply left as it
               is, seen as
                                  simply an arising thought and nothing more. However I
               have a
                                  habitual tendency to get lost in thoughts. I still 
              spend a large
                                  part of daily life being identified with thoughts.. 
              haha.</em></p>
              <p><em>I also notice that as for Presence itself... 
              nothing really can
                                  be done to 'experience it'... since it is what is 
              always already
                                  present in This Moment, any attempts, anything we 
              'do' is extra and
                                  secondary and 'over-complication' and overlooking 
              something
                                  fundamental... it becomes clearer when we relax all 
              our desires and
                                  just rest.</em></p>
