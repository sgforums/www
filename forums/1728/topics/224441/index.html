The majority of Buddhists here belong to the Mahayana tradition, which originated in India and spread to China.<br><br>Ms Monksfield described her 2,000-member Buddhist Fellowship as Â“mainstream and non-sectarianÂ”.<br><br>She said believers should decide for themselves if they wanted to go to the event, adding: Â“Personally, I wouldnÂ’t go because just looking at relics doesnÂ’t add any value to my spiritual development.Â”<br><br>A Straits Times check confirmed that a statement was issued by the Dalai LamaÂ’s Office. It expressed Â“deep concernÂ” about the exhibition, and that the Gelugpa Buddhist Association Â“actively opposes (the Dalai LamaÂ’s) advice and teachingsÂ”.<br><br>It said that any person associated with the sect Â“effectively becomes non-BuddhistÂ”.<br><br>Fliers of the statement have been distributed in some Waterloo Street shops and restaurants by anonymous parties. The area is popular with Buddhists.<br><br>The exhibition is free. The association will hold a 500-table charity vegetarian banquet on its last day. The most expensive table costs $3,800 for 10 people, and tables are nearly sold out.<br><br>Ms Jenny Chow, secretary-general of the Gelugpa Buddhist Association, said money raised from the dinner and alms will go to building a Buddhist relic museum in Singapore.<br><br></div>

Therefore, labelling of itself as a "Gelugpa" centre is inaccurate and misleading.<br><br>The Dalai Lama's office further clarifies that its position is clear and consistent with regard to the worship of "dolgyal-shugden" which it strongly considers as "worship of the unenlightened evil spirit".<br><br>The statement further elaborates that students of the Dharma who continue to rely upon a worldly spirit such as dolgyal-shugden actually contradicts the Buddha's own advice against taking refuge in samsaric spirits.<br><br>By participating in events related to the practice of this worldly spirit, one effectively "breaks" one's Refuge Vows and will effectively become a Non-Buddhist, negating the source and root of all Dharmic practices, the statement continues.<br><br>In a separate announcement, the Charitable Assistance Society (CAS) of Thousand-Arm Chenrezig have on behalf of the Tibetan Buddhist community in Singapore urged all to adhere to the HH Dalai Lama's office advisory.<br><br>The CAS statement further urged Tibetan Buddhist practitioners to "....inform all other unknowing Buddhists, that, according to the Buddha's holy Teachings as preserved in every tradition and lineage as well as His Holiness the Dalai Lama's advice, taking refuge in wordly-spirit, in this context, this programme's uncompromising stand of practising and taking refuge in dulgyal-shugden, effectively contravenes one's Refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha."<br><br>The CAS also said the organizing party have failed to clarify or justify the authenticity of the source of their claimed "relics", most of which, presented as plasticine-looking coloured balls. "The organization too claimed many of their "relics" as being originated from Lord Buddha's blood, bones, saliva and other bodily parts," the statement concluded.</div>

I do not agree that he meant that viewing the relics means non-buddhist, but rather, participating in things related to worshipping the spirit, or perhaps things that offer financial support for the worship of the spirit, is non-buddhist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Hopefully the Dalai Lama will issue a clarification on that.</div>

Thereafter they will ask you to do chanting of mantra while you view the relics with every steps you made in the premise &amp; issue you with a count clocker to click, the moment you are there, you are participating, its not about viewing only. Every few steps there will be a donation box. There are many Thai Monks &amp; Lamas to give you blessings with donation boxes beside them. Alot of stalls selling various items from treligious products to food, Thai Amulets aplenty there. Very big scale even bigger than Holistic Fair, I am not suprise if there is also MLM there. These are the feedbacks i got. BWB not in support of this event right? To my knowledge some forums are promoting this event. To be frank in my point of view when HH Dalai Lama speak, he will not change his words, words are power &amp; integrity, he only made such speech because he feel a need to. I do feel its abit too harsh but i shalt not comment on that, do not think i have any right to comment also. HH Dalai Lama's short commentary tells a thousand words. Of coz those who are interested can go view, its very individual.

He further expresses his highest recognition and support to the RelicsÂ’ Exhibition and blesses him with success in advance.<br><br>http://www.gelugpa.com/images/Gelugpa/IndexPage/rin1.gif<br>http://www.gelugpa.com/images/Gelugpa/IndexPage/rin2.gif<br>http://www.gelugpa.com/images/Gelugpa/IndexPage/rin3.gif<br>http://www.gelugpa.com/images/Gelugpa/IndexPage/rin4.gif<br>http://www.gelugpa.com/images/Gelugpa/IndexPage/rin10.gif<br><br>what do you guys think of it?
