            <div class='col-md body'>What they say on their web:<br><br>Gelugpa Buddhist Association (Singapore) is legally incorporated under the Laws of Singapore as a non-profit making Buddhist organization, having its registration number as ROS:132/95REL. Its objectives are to promote the BuddhaÂ’s compassion and wisdom in order to purify everyoneÂ’s mind.<br><br>In order to establish blissful connections with all sentient beings to provide a mean of refuge for all, we cordially brought in the relics of the Buddha and His disciples, and have organized this Â“Buddha and His DisciplesÂ’ Relics Grand Cultural World ExhibitionÂ”. This has received recognitions from various relicsÂ’ collectors; abbots of ancient monasteries as well as curators of relicÂ’s museums, and these organizations have issued certificates of the relics. Sri Lanka has also sent their Minister of Cultural Affairs and National Heritage to represent their President in providing a Buddha ShakyamuniÂ’s relic for this Exhibition, and to grace the Grand Opening.  All these confirm the authenticity of the relics being exhibited.<br><br>Regarding the confusion surrounding the Dharma Protector Dorje Shugden, one should trace back to the more than one hundred different discourses by the Lord Buddha regarding Tsong Khapa. As stipulated in the Buddhist Sutra of ManjusriÂ’s lineage it says that : Â“When I (the Lord Buddha) reached nirvana, the earth will be a void, you (Tsong Khapa) shall appear and continue with the BuddhasÂ’ and BudhisattvasÂ’ practices; by then in the snow mountains (meaning Tibet), joyful Gaden (means GelugÂ’s Gaden Monastery) will be found.Â” Thus planned by the Lord Buddha, Tsong Khapa was a manifestation of Manjusri, and his teachings are all pristine, complete and flawless. As Dorje Shugden was realized by Tsong Khapa as a manifestation of Manjusri, thus it is not a demon as some people thought. Thus the authenticity of the protector should be based on the direct teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha rather than hear says from this degenerated age.<br><br>In the biography of the 5th Dalai Lama the same history was being recorded. The then Dalai Lama also published praises in writing about this protector. In the Gelug history, most of the reincarnated buddhas and senior monks had praised this protector, including the current Dalai LamaÂ’s ultimate lineage guru Pabongka Rinpoche, his ordination guru Rachen Rinpoche, personal instructor Tacha Rinpoche and his immediate guru Ling Rinpoche and Song Rinpoche and all his lineage gurus practiced the worship of Dorje Shugden.  Generally all Buddhism practices uphold their succession and tradition the most. If the practitioners who uphold these values are being labeled as non-buddhist, then how should we classify those who breach these values? Although the Gelugpa Buddhist Association (Singapore) has not insisted on this practice, how can we defame and turn against our predecessors when there are traditions and teachings already laid down?<br><br>The current stance of our Association is neither objecting nor actively practicing Dorje Shugden. Our basic principle is not to turn against our predecessorsÂ’ and becoming sinful successors, and we believe this should be our spirit and attitude. If we follow the others to turn against our lineage, then we would breach our precepts which are the most serious sins. Thus we take a neutral stand, believing that one could use the BuddhaÂ’s teachings to define rights and wrongs, and then it could avoid further misguidance and damages to all sentient beings, and comply with the BuddhaÂ’s principle in being compassionate to all. This will also enable future dedicated practitioners and persons of wisdom a base to think and analyze the truth.<br><br>The Â“Buddha and His DisciplesÂ’ Relics Grand Cultural World ExhibitionÂ” is a Buddhist activity with substantial meaning. Its influence is deep and wide. Any intentional defamatory and destructive act against this event will only have negative impact on the harmonious relationship of all religions and religious organizations, and also is being disrespectful to the Dharma. We, the Gelugpa Buddhist Association (Singapore) only propagate Buddhism and do not mix with nor involve in any political activity. All our activities are transparent and righteous. We welcome and are willing to discuss with anyone who wishes to understand more.<br><br>As stipulated in the Maha-Parametta, seeing the BuddhaÂ’s relics is equivalent to seeing the Buddha. Lord Buddha left behind His relics to stimulate sentient beings to follow His practice and ultimately reach enlightenment. So everyone, particular Buddhists, should treat these relics with respect. If one were to classify this act of respect as worshipping of evil spirit, just because of a difference in view point on ways of practice, one is being disrespectful to Buddha, and also shows ignorance towards the Dharma. How can evil spirits have such relics? Moreover, the Lord Buddha left His relics to help subsequent practitioners to improve their practice. If one does not understand this motive one would not be able to benefit from the BuddhaÂ’s blessing.<br><br>This Â“Relics ExhibitionÂ” is able to open on schedule on 9th December 2006 despite all constraints. There are non-stop visits by worshippers and the numbers have exceeded tens of thousands. This confirms the publicÂ’s trust and faith in Gelugpa Buddhist Association and also absolved all unnecessary obstructions. With compassion we pity upon those ignorant beings, and with our cultivation of good karma, we pray for the BuddhasÂ’s forgiveness and blessing upon them.<br><br>We hereby solemnly declare that any form of notices, circular or any other forms of communication, without the proper approval of our Association, do not represent our views whatsoever. Any of such unapproved circulations will only cause damages towards religious harmony, and create negative impact on the societyÂ’s justice, peace and harmony.<br><br>Our principle is very clear and transparent. For the sake of upholding religious harmony, we are open to dialogues with any religious organization, to reach a harmonious and peaceful world together.<br><br>We wish all sentient beings speedy enlightenment, and Â“Tashi DelekÂ”!<br><br>For and on behalf of<br><br>GELUGPA BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION (SINGAPORE)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dorje Shugden is definitely not Manjusri, and is a worldly spirit.<br><br>As far as I am aware, Shugden practises were not taught by Tsongkhapa other than being a worldly protector under oath. In history, Shugden was never ever worshipped, they bound him as a servant-- huge difference. As a matter of fact Pabhongka, a fervent supporter of Shugden which lived about a century ago, was the one who allevated the status of shugden to that of 'Manjusri' and propogated Shugden practises as a main practise.<br><br>For more details, I believe other forummers will provide them.</div>

I e-mailed CAS to confirm that the email was indeed sent by them and also to requesnt His Eminence DENMA LOCHOE RINPOCHE's public statement.<br><br>---------------------------<br><br>bb tan (sc23jul@singnet.com.sg) +Add contact<br>To:<br><br>Cc: jinpa (jinpa@cneholidays.com)<br><br>Subject: Re: Locho Rinpoche<br><br>Dear Friend in the holy Dharma,<br><br>The message you received is from CASonline --<br><br>We knew Denma Locho Rinpoche personally and we are assured of His staunch conformity to HH's advice with regard to shugden --<br><br>We have checked with HH's Private Office via our friend in Singapore and we were informed that Locho Rinpoche's publicized meeting with the shugden association took place years back in Taiwan --<br><br>Denma Locho Rinpoche has subsequently clarified His stand and expressed His regret that the quoted statements attributed to Him had been fabricated --<br><br>His clarifications in in writing should be available from HH's Private Office --<br><br>I have also highlighted Locho Rinpoche's official declaration below as quoted from www.tibet.com, the official website of the Tibetan-Govt-in-Exile --<br><br>With our regards,<br><br>bb @ CAS of Thousand-Arm Chenrezig<br><br>__________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/abbots-resolution.html<br><br>Abbots' Resolution on the practice and propitiation of protector-deities<br><br>On 1 January 1998 Jangtse Choeje Rinpoche, the abbots and ex-abbots of Drepung, Sera, Gaden (the three main seats of learning), the abbots and ex-abbots of Gyume and Gyuto Monastery, Gyume Lama U-zed, the abbots and ex-abbots of Namgyal Monastery, the abbots of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and Tawang Monastery met at the office of Sera Lachi, Sera Thekchenling Monastery under the chairmanship of the Gaden Throne Holder and unanimously passed the following resolution on the practice and propitiation of protector-deities.<br>Far from listening to the repeated advice that His Holiness the Dalai Lama has given until now on the worship of protector-deities, keeping in view Tibet?s spiritual and political interests, a handful of Shugden protagonists have turned a deaf ear. Because they dislike His Holiness?s advice, they have misapprehended his advice as being interpretative and (asserted) that everyone has religious freedom etc. Sometimes, they have directly criticised His Holiness the Dalai Lama, making many unworthy and derogatory remarks, while at other times they pretend to be criticising Tara la, secretary to His Holiness, and have cast insupportable aspersions against His Holiness to hurt His feelings. So, directly and indirectly, they have used an aggressive flood of harsh speech exaggerating and denying reality. They have presumptuously put it about that right from the Gaden Throne Holder down, many abbots and ex-abbots, lamas, tulkus and geshes are all one in being wordshippers of Dolgyal and have even issued a list of their names. Thus, they have attempted to give an impression that all the Gelugpas taken the same stand not to give up the worship of Dolgyal. They have thus issued many such whimsical documents, mixing up fish and turnips as if they were one and the same thing, and still they continue to distribute such false materials<br><br>As a result, the general public are saying that Gelugpa leaders will remain smiling even when the wind snuffs out the butter lamp or a dog eats the ritual cake offerings. What they mean is that our inactivity and failure to give the proper guidance that our seniority and position in the hierarchy behoves us to do,raises doubts in their minds. Therefore, it is quite possible that today our rightful leader, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and the general Tibetan public might suspect that all Gelugpas have joined hands and implicitly or explicitly take a unanimous view (supporting) the worship of Dolgyal.<br><br>Therefore, it is important that it should be known that many of us here ?abbots and ex-abbots, lamas, tulkus and geshes ?have never been Dolgyal worshippers. Those who did worship Dolgyal in the past have relinquished the practice in accordance with His Holiness?s advice and are now opposing such worship directly and indirectly, in line with the unanimous stand of the people of the three provinces of Tibet. Even if Dolgyal activists create documents sufficient to load down a dzo (a cross between a yak and a cow), with an intention to create far reaching disturbances and misunderstandings, until they run out of ink and paper we will not believe or trust them. Moreover from now on, we will completely give up ties with those who worship Dolgyal and will have nothing more to do with them, as the Tibetan saying goes: distinguish the mouth from the moustache, drink different water and live in a different place.<br><br>We therefore take an oath that we will unhesitatingly follow the advice given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama for the long and short-term well-being of the Tibetan people. We will ensure that none of us makes the slightest attempt, even so much as the buzz of a fly to misinterpret His Holiness?s advice on grounds of what may be suitable or unsuitable and pass this resolution with our signatures attached:<br><br>Losang Nyima, Gaden Throne Holder,<br>Thubten Nyima, Jangtse Choeje<br>Tenpa Tenzin, ex-abbot of Gomang Monastery<br>Ngawang Thekchok, ex-abbot of Sera Mey Monastery<br>Ngawang Legden, ex-abbot of Sera Je Monastery<br>Jhampa Dhonyo, ex-abbot of Sera Mey Monastery<br>Losang Thubten, ex-abbot of Sera Je Monastery<br>Jhampa Yeshe, ex-abbot of Gaden Shartse Monastery<br>Thubten Wangchuk, ex-abbot of Gaden Shartse Monastery<br>Losang Tsering, ex-abbot of Sera Je Monastery<br>Losang Tenpa, ex-abbot of Gomang Monastery<br>Ogyen Tsetan, ex-abbot of Gyume Monastery<br>Losang Tenzin, ex-abbot of Gyume Monastery<br>Dorjee Tashi, ex-abbot of Gyume Monastery<br>Losang Tenzin, ex-abbot of Gyuto Monastery<br>Locho Rinpoche, ex-abbot of Namgyal Monastery<br>Jhampa Thekchok, Abbot of Sera Jey Monastery<br>Losang Chojor, Abbot of Gaden Jangtse Monastery<br>Tsultrim Phuntsog, Abbot of Gomang Monastery<br>Konchok Paksam, Abbot of Drepung Loseling Monastery<br>Konchok Tsering, Abbot of Gaden Shartse Monastery<br>Losang Rabga, representative of the abbot of Sera Mey Monastery<br>Jado Tulku, abbot of Namgyal Monastery<br>Thrinley Topgyal, abbot of Gyume Monastery<br>Kachen Losang Tsultrim, abbot of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery<br>Tengye Tulku, abbot of Tawang Monastery<br><br>[ Homepage ] [ Dholgyal ]</div>
