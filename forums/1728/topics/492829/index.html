              Think (blog)‎ October 13, 2016 <span><em> </em></span><span class="author"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://bigthink.com/experts/derek-beres"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 0.875rem;"><span style="color: windowtext;">DEREK BERES</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">How
              did it happen? No question has been uttered more often in regards to cults.
              Throughout recorded history (and probably much longer) humans have been
              susceptible to charismatic leaders that have, either by nature or training,
              understood the psychology of acquiring followers. Even though we’re aware of
              the dangerous mechanisms of cult machinery, people continue to fall, again and
              again.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">How does it happen?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">The immediate hurdle is recognizing you’ve been indoctrinated.
              Cults appeal to our in-group mentality. If that group has some, to borrow a
              term from Alan Watts, “inside dope,” then in your mind it’s not a cult at all.
              You’re part of a group that’s special, destined, blessed—you feel<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">complete</em>.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">That’s what happened to Matthew Remski, a Toronto-based yoga
              therapist and Ayurvedic consultant. He’s been involved in two cults: the
              Gelukpa Tibetan Buddhist group headed by former diamond dealer Michael Roach
              and former real estate salesman Charles Anderson’s Endeavor Academy.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Discussing the documentary film,<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">Holy Hell</em>—Will Allen’s harrowing inside look at the
              West Hollywood Buddhafield cult led by actor and hypnotist Michel (still active
              in Hawaii)—Remski<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="https://soundcloud.com/derekberes/earthrise-podcast-17-cult-indoctrination-wmatthew-remski"><span style="color: #d85819;">told me</span></a><span> </span>there’s
              no easy answer regarding indoctrination. He did, however, relate this process
              to the current American electoral cycle.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #757575;">It’s similar to the multiple factors and perspectives that
              people come through in developing their adulation for Donald Trump. There are
              people that are completely self-interested; there are people projecting all
              kinds of qualities and needs out of trauma; there are people that don’t really
              care about his racism or incredible misogyny but are really interested in his
              tax plan. There’s a riot of motivations.</span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Some are drawn in by the leader; others for social support.
              Seeking a sense of purpose or a substitute family factor in. Many, Remski says,
              are simply looking for room and board, an example featured in the Hulu series,<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">The Path</em>, about an ayahuasca-drinking cult in upstate
              New York.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">All religions begin as cults. Christianity was once a cult, as
              was Islam. Judaism, Buddhism, the countless local faiths now lumped under the
              term Hinduism—all cults. There are cults within cults, like the two thousand or
              so accepted faiths that borrow from Christian doctrine: Mormonism, Eastern
              Orthodox, Catholicism, Protestantism, Lutheranism, Scientology, Christian
              Science. Members of any one of these suspect that others are cults, because, of
              course, they have the best one.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">To be clear, the term ‘cult’ was initially used for a ritual act—<em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">cultus</em><span> </span>comes from Latin, meaning ‘worship.’
              Throughout the world the word is still used to cite a religious group.
              Americans, perpetually paranoid about foreign ideas, began using ‘cult’ to describe
              faith healers about a century ago. Since then it has taken on a negative
              meaning, essentially reserved for “any ideology I don’t subscribe to.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Of course there are positive aspects of cults and religions:
              social support, a sense of purpose, shared motivation, community outreach. This
              happens in groups of ten or ten million. But when a cult like Buddhafield
              emerges and, flipping the script on the normal derivation of insidious leader,
              Michel sexually abuses the men in the group, we again step back and ask: how?
              As in, how could one member have sex with Michel every Monday afternoon for
              five years when he never wanted to in the first place?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Remski does not like the question as it focuses on the potential
              psychological flaws or moral failures of the initiate. He can only answer
              anecdotally, which offers insight into the indoctrination process:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #757575;">My attraction toward Michael Roach was primal. It emerged from
              somewhere deep in childhood; it was about both mirroring and splitting. I felt
              that he was like me, but fifteen or twenty years older. He looked like me. I
              felt his body in my body, the same gangly awkwardness, the same hiked-up
              shoulder, the same thoracic kyphosis when he sat in meditation. It was like he
              was me, but perfected in this way that I imagined.</span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Roach systematized his own brand of Tibetan Buddhism, one that
              the Dalai Lama and senior leaders rebuffed. His<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/sex-and-death-on-the-road-to-nirvana-20130606"><span style="color: #d85819;">tale</span></a>, briefly, included being no more than
              fifteen feet away from his spiritual wife, Lama Christie, who he claimed to
              never have sex with; later, when they spiritually divorced (consciously
              uncoupled, I suppose), Christie found a new boyfriend that died in the desert
              after being kicked out of the group. Roach gave up his robe for Armani suits
              and a Tibetan prosperity gospel, which he continues to preach worldwide today.
              (Remski documents Roach’s journey exceptionally<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://www.elephantjournal.com/2012/06/the-michael-roach-bubble/"><span style="color: #d85819;">here</span></a>.)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Those robes were also part of what drew Remski in. They reminded
              him of his Catholic upbringing, one filled with violence and abuse, yet, as he
              says of Roach, “represented a demilitarized, more feminine version of the robes
              of my childhood.” Early repression in church left Remski hollow, vacant,
              setting him up for indoctrination under Roach’s care.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #757575;">I couldn’t see what is true of all human beings: that he has an
              unconscious, and he doesn’t know why he’s doing what he’s doing, and that some
              very deep, difficult stuff is likely beneath the surface. I just thought that
              he had perfected himself. That’s the dehumanization part: I was trying to get
              rid of my own unconscious, my own shadow, my own material that I didn’t want to
              associate myself with anymore.</span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Remski created an alternate universe to deal with the actual
              reality he couldn’t deal with. This is where trauma enters. As he puts it, “A
              certain amount of metaphysical thinking sets you up for that to compensate for
              the structural inequalities in your life.” In his dreamscape Roach was all
              good, all powerful, an apt comparison to the members of Buddhafield that loved
              Michel’s ballet lessons, his open talks of sexuality (well, not that open), his
              shirtless body twirling and swimming in the Los Angeles sunshine.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">What drew the Buddhafield members in, what drew Remski in, what
              continues to draw in Scientologists and Creationists and all other cults, is
              this ‘other’ existence. But, Remski continues,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #757575;">The thing we’re not talking about in cult life is living a
              normal, ambivalent, adjusted life, where you realize you will be happy and sad,
              things will die, relationships will end, you will get sick and well again,
              things will continue. Most cult ideologies have a profound loathing for that description
              of the human condition.</span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Remski admits to his intense drive for “crisis-type experiences
              of love” that left him feeling manic. Only after leaving Roach and, later,
              Anderson’s group, could he understand that he had been starving even though
              food was right in front of him. He couldn’t understand the everyday was
              nutritious—the mundane and banal provide all that we need. There were so many
              scars to heal, too many insecurities to face. Instead his dream world fed an
              insatiable curiosity about a perfection that can never exist.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #757575;">There’s something about the peak experience and the drive
              towards it that is a sign of something broken—the simplicity of daily rhythm is
              not enough because you were just not able to enjoy it. You couldn’t relax
              somehow. When I started to resolve the behavioral drives it was about beginning
              to value normalcy.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1.25rem; font-size: 1.0625rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #263238;">Remski has, fortunately, come to terms with the fear and
              instability that lied dormant at the foundation of his discontent. There is no
              single path to a cult, but there are patterns, and by recognizing his own,
              Remski was able to understand what Joseph Campbell famously stated regarding
              Arthurian tales, among other mythologies: freedom is in the wound.</span></p>
