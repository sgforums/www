Remember a time when you were very angry. How did "I" appear then? It seems very solid - as if there is a real me that someone is insulting. That "I" feels real, as if it were independent, yet still somewhere inside our body and Mind. We get angry in order to defend that "I" that seems so real. If that solid, independent "I" exists as it appears to us, we should be able to find it, either among our body and Mind or separate from them. There is no other place such an "I" could be. Let's see.</span></span> <strong>Are you your body? </strong><br><br><strong>Aud</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Yes.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Ven</span>: <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Which part of your body are you? Are you your arm? Your chest? Your little toe? your brain? It's clear that we aren't any of the parts of our body. Let's try again.</span> </span><strong>Are you your Mind?</strong><br><br><strong>Aud</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">I must be.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Ven:</span> <strong>Which Mind are you?</strong><span style="color: blue;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Are you your visual consciousness? Your auditory consciousness? Your mental consciousness? Are you one particular characteristic? If you were your angry self, you would always be angry!</span></span><br><br><strong>Aud:</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">"I" am what goes from one life to the next.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Ven:</span><span style="color: blue;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">But what goes from one life to the next is constantly changing. Can you point to one moment of your Mind that always has been and always will be you?</span></span> <strong>Are you yesterday's Mind? Today's Mind? Tomorrow's Mind?</strong><br><br><strong>Aud:</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm all of them together.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Ven:</span><span style="color: blue;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">But that's a collection of parts, none of which are "I". To say that is "I" is like saying a group of grasshoppers are a butterfly</span>.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe you're completely separate from your body and Mind. That is, can you take away your body and Mind and you ("I" ) still remain independently? If the "I" is separate from the body and Mind, my body and Mind could be here and I could be across the room. Is that possible?</span></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large">The "I" or self doesn't exist independently of the body and Mind. It is not the body and it is not the Mind. Neither is it the body and Mind together. In other words, the solid "I" that we felt when we're angry doesn't exist at all. What we are negating is its independent or inherent existence. There a conventionally existent "I" that is angry and that "I" does not exists independently.<br><br>The "I" depends on causes and conditions the coming together of the sperm and egg of our parents, our consciousness from a precious life and so on. The "I" also depends on the parts, which compose it: our body and Mind. The "I" also depends on concept and label. That is, on the basis of our body and Mind being together, we conceive of a person and label it "I". We exist by being merely labeled on a suitable basis - our body and Mind.</span></span></strong><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large"><span style="color: indigo;">I am looking for me.<br>I look and look.<br>Who am I?<br>I can't find.<br>I can't define.<br>I can't see.<br><br>Who am I?<br>I AM looking.<br><br>There is no looker and nothing looked.<br>There is only the looking.<br>The looker and the looked are one.</span></span></span><br><img src="http://mud.mm-a6.yimg.com/image/2342015282"><br><br></div>
