              <p class="byline">3 Talks by Toni Packer</p>
              <p>Toni Packer is author of <em>The Wonder of Presence</em> (Shambhala) and is resident teacher of Springwater Center, in Springwater, New York.</p>
              <h2>Finding a New Way to Listen</h2>
              <p>Before inquiring into a new way of listening, let me just share the
                  joy of walking through the fields and woods on this extraordinary land.
                  Just stepping out of the reception area, closing the door behind me,
                  walking away from the overhang that shields one from the sun and rain,
                  there isn't any enclosure left—not even a body! All I am is the birds
                  singing and fluttering, bare branches swaying in the breeze, the ground
                  partly frozen yet melting, the pond covered with a thin layer of ice,
                  and the blue hills, sky and wandering clouds within close reach. There
                  is also a throbbing heart and the people walking on the path. Even
                  those who are not here—aren't we all together this one moment—beholding
                  everything out of stillness?</p>
              <p>It is the stillness of not being identified with <em>me</em>—the endless stories of the past and the various images that have represented <em>me</em> to myself and others. Identification with <em>me</em> is a living prison. In it we constantly want to be accepted, feel
                  important, be listened to, be encouraged, supported and comforted in
                  this separate life of ours. But now, here, in the fresh air under the
                  open sky there is the freedom of not needing anything, not needing to <em>be</em> anything—just being this open listening space where people walk, crows caw and ice cracks underfoot.</p>
              <p>Why do I feel that listening is so immensely important in living
                  alone or together? It is because listening quietly, passionately, now,
                  without expectation or effort, is the gateway to living in wholeness,
                  without the separation of <em>you</em> and <em>me</em>.</p>
              <p>This is our main question: Can we listen in a deep way in a moment
                  of silence and stillness? Or is the mind preoccupied with the 10,000
                  worries of this world, of our life, of our family? Can we realize right
                  now that a mind that is occupied with itself cannot listen freely? This
                  is not said in judgment—it is a fact. It's impossible for me to hear
                  someone else while I'm worrying about myself. Birdcalls and the songs
                  of the breeze do not exist when the mind is full of itself. This is
                  within the experience of all of us. So, can the mind put its problems
                  aside for one moment and listen freshly? This moment! Are we listening
                  together? The caw of the crows, the quiet hum of a plane, a dog's
                  barking, or whatever sounds are alive where you are listening right now.</p>
              <p>It is relatively easy to listen happily in nature—the leaves,
                  grasses, flowers, trees, lakes and hills do not think and worry like we
                  do, and therefore do not provoke thinking. Maybe for deer and birds
                  there is some rudimentary thinking going on but that need not engage us
                  in thought (unless we are avid birdwatchers or we worry about the
                  plight of too many deer and too many hunters next season). Thought can
                  make a problem out of everything, but most of us find the beauty of
                  unselfconscious listening much easier to come upon in nature than among
                  people.</p>
              <p>Why is it so inordinately difficult to listen to each other? When I
                  am present with the abundant energy of listening, I do not find it
                  difficult to hear what you are saying. Instead of being busy with
                  self-concern, the space is open to hearing, seeing, and understanding
                  the meaning of your words. If I don't understand, then there is the
                  freedom to ask you for clarification.</p>
              <p>Without this open space of presence—energy, the inner tapes of human
                  conditioning press hard to be heard—they do not want to make way for
                  listening to others. How can I possibly hear you when I am dying to say
                  something myself? How can I take the time and care to understand you
                  when I think that I am right and you are wrong? When I'm sure that I
                  know better? When I sorely need attention and resent anyone else
                  getting it?</p>
              <p>Can I hear you when I have fixed images about how you have been in
                  the past, how you have criticized or flattered me? Can I listen freely
                  when I would like you to be different from the way you are? Do I have
                  the patience to listen to you when I think I already know what you are
                  going to say? Am I open to listening to you when I am judging you?
                  Judgments and prejudices lie deeply hidden in the recesses of the mind
                  and require curiosity and inner transparency in order to be discovered.
                  Only what is discovered can end.</p>
              <p>Do I really hear what you are saying when I take you to be holy, to
                  be worshipped, adored and surrendered to? Will I expect every word you
                  say to be infallible wisdom? Or the opposite: Can I hear what you are
                  saying when I am convinced that you are stupid? Am I listening to you
                  in the same way that I listen to someone else?</p>
              <p>We can add more and more to this list, but the important thing is to
                  start fundamentally questioning our listening. The point is not to ask,
                  "How can I achieve pure listening?" but rather, "Where is my listening
                  coming from this moment, in light of all these questions?" Is it
                  hampered by different ideas and attitudes or does it arise from a
                  moment of being truly present?</p>
              <p>Many of us sincerely desire to become better listeners and may think that it will only happen once we are free of the <em>me</em> sometime in the future. This is an erroneous assumption. Even though the <em>me</em> circuit is deeply ingrained within brain and body, a genuine desire and interest to understand <em>you</em> allows energy to gather in listening attentively to what you are
                  saying. This attentive listening may empty out the preoccupation with
                  myself. Through listening to your words and truly wishing to understand
                  what you mean to convey, I enter you—your question, your condition, the
                  whole <em>you</em>.</p>
              <p>When I'm not really interested in what you are saying, can I pause
                  and listen within? Can I take a glance at what is going on inside? Is
                  it resistance? Boredom? The passing by of words that are not really
                  heard? When there is clear seeing, that in itself is a shift.</p>
              <p>Listening purifies itself. It's not that there is necessarily a new
                  interest in what you are saying. I may prefer to dialogue deeply while
                  you want to relate your story or get my attention. When listening comes
                  out of wholeness, an appropriate response happens. That is the wisdom
                  of listening.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, when I'm talking in a meeting and a flock of crows flies by—<em>caw, caw, caw, caw, caw—</em>I
                  raise my hand a bit and ask: "Do you hear that?" The person may shake
                  her head—the listening space was filled up with other things. Are we
                  here right now?</p>
              <p>When you hear that question, what happens? Is it simply <em>caw, caw, caw,</em> or are you thinking, "Am I doing it right?" or, "What does she want me
                  to say?" Hear those thoughts like you hear the wind in the trees. It's
                  the same listening. It's different things—the sound of wind and trees
                  and birds is different from the sound of thoughts—but it's the same
                  listening. One whole listening!</p>
              <p>For marvelous unknown reasons, once in a while we are completely
                  here. For a moment we hear, see and feel all one. Then the mind comes
                  in to explain it, know it, compare it and store it. This is not an
                  intentional process—it's habit. No one is doing it. The naming, liking
                  and disliking, wanting to keep something and fearing the loss of
                  it—these are all ingrained mind processes rolling off on their own. If
                  we get a glimpse of that, get a feel for what is purely habitual, then
                  we will be much more tolerant and patient with the so-called others and
                  with ourselves.</p>
              <p>When I talk about listening, I don't mean just listening with the ear. <em>Listening</em> here includes the totality of perception—all senses open and alive, and
                  still much more than that. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind
                  are receptive, open, not controlled. A Zen saying describes it as
                  "hearing with one's eyes and seeing with one's ears." It refers to this
                  wholeness of perception. The wholeness of being!</p>
              <p>Another Zen saying demands: "Hear the bell before it rings!" Ah, it
                  doesn't make any sense rationally, does it? But there is a moment when
                  that bell is ringing before you know it! You may never know it! Your
                  entire being is ringing! There's no division in that—everything is
                  ringing.</p>
              <p>So can we learn more and more about ourselves, not by studying in
                  order to increase our store of information, but through asking in
                  wonderment what keeps us from hearing the bell before it rings?</p>
              <h1>Not Going Elsewhere in this Mind</h1>
              <p>This moment of being here, what does it mean? It means not resisting
                  whatever is here: anxiety, discomfort, pain or disturbance. That's much
                  easier said than done. By <em>not resisting </em>I mean resistance
                  melting away in the awareness of being here—not giving way to fantasy,
                  rather seeing fantasy as fantasy, as a veil hiding what is here in
                  utter simplicity. To see that! That's not just saying, "Okay, all of
                  this is just thoughts and fantasy." This is more thinking and it
                  doesn't help, as we all have found out. It may even arouse anger
                  because things have not changed in spite of all this work of being with
                  them.</p>
              <p>Have you ever experienced the difference between saying, "This is all thought," and <em>directly seeing</em> the appearance of thoughts and their effects on the body? Please hold
                  it for a moment; don't just say "yes" or "no" and go on reading without
                  stopping for a moment and wondering. Sitting quietly with energy
                  gathering can be of immense help in detecting what is thought and what
                  isn't. It allows one to experience directly how a thought generates
                  emotion—pleasure or pain, sorrow or fear, and the credence given to it
                  all—without acting on it. We assume that thinking tells us the truth
                  about ourselves and the world. In thinking without seeing, everything
                  seems so real, so true; there's no space here for questioning. Can
                  there be seeing without thinking?</p>
              <p>Wondering comes out of a moment of not going anywhere in thought, a
                  moment of stopping—taking a deep breath and exhaling. It is a moment of
                  not knowing where to go, because there is no place to go. It's
                  realizing that all of the places thought can go to are fantasy. In our
                  daily predicament of pain, of work fatigue or boredom, there seems to
                  be incessant thought activity, with its restlessness, dissatisfaction,
                  lack of fulfillment and searching for something different. There is the
                  strong desire to alleviate what we don't like, to get rid of it. Can
                  there be momentary freedom from our consuming restlessness? From
                  thinking, "Where could I go next to be free?"</p>
              <p>People frequently ask me, "Why is my mind and life so terribly
                  restless?" I can't answer this for you. Of course I can give answers,
                  but we need to realize for ourselves that the nervous impulse to search
                  for explanations and relief, and the impatient thrashing about to be
                  free, is just more brain activity. Can there be a humble moment of
                  being here without knowing? Can we let pain, discomfort and uncertainty
                  be here without knowing?</p>
              <p>When people come to Springwater they say, "Here it's relatively easy
                  to be with problems. But it isn't easy at home, in the office, with the
                  family or in a relationship." Actually it isn't difficult anywhere when
                  it dawns what it truly
                  means <em>to be in this moment</em>. It may be a moment of quietly
                  listening to a spouse, to a partner or a boss, or carefully holding the
                  steering wheel and letting the landscape go by, feeling the foot on the
                  pedal, the touch of the upholstery and the different sounds of the
                  motor. Or sitting at the desk, suddenly attending to the feel of the
                  pen in the hand that is holding it, writing a check, experiencing the
                  touch of the paper, the sound of the moving pen, the amazing appearance
                  of ink patterns on the check, then tearing it off, the perforations
                  giving way to the pull, one by one. Writing the check with loving
                  attention is the only thing happening right now! There's no need to
                  slur over it, thinking of what else has to be done. There's just full
                  attention to what is happening right now. When this takes place it
                  feels like a new discovery.<em> </em>Everything is taking care of itself.
                  Not dutifully—it's not a duty to work attentively, but rather turns out
                  to be a delight when it happens without force. It's freedom from the
                  burden of the future.</p>
              <p>Can you catch yourself as you're speeding along? Listen to the sound
                  of speeding? Constitutionally some of us are speedier than others. We
                  are different characters and body types. But both speedy and slow body
                  types are burdened with the thought of all that has to be done in the
                  future. So as we find ourselves racing with thoughts and sensations of
                  restlessness, can we become aware of it as it is happening and wonder
                  whether it has to be that way?</p>
              <p>You don't know the answer, but the question is already a break in
                  the current. See if it is possible to slow down in thinking, walking,
                  arranging things, writing, talking to someone. This means simply
                  watching the speedy body-mind—just watching it!—not saying, "I mustn't
                  speed, I must slow down, this is no good, Toni says so." Just watch
                  what you're doing right now; watch it carefully, attentively, and
                  witness the amazing slowing down in the simple presence of attention.</p>
              <p>When we're here together we affect each other. Somebody walking or
                  doing things attentively affects us if we really see it. It is sort of
                  contagious, as is the speeding. This doesn't mean we have to do things
                  in slow motion. Just see what happens when you become aware. How is it
                  when there is close attention to the hands washing a dish under the
                  running water, scratching off the egg that has caked on, soaking it
                  some more and seeing it disappear in the dishpan, lifting it
                  out, shaking the drops off and putting it on the drain rack, with
                  attention? It's wonderful, and it's amazing to realize how little
                  attention we usually give because we're driven by thoughts about the
                  past or future. This is not said blamefully. It's the natural task of
                  the brain to anticipate the future, to solve problems. The more
                  problems we have, the busier the brain gets in trying to solve them.
                  But right now it's just giving attention to this moment of not going
                  anywhere other than where we are, gently, not prescribing anything.
                  Attention has everything in it to illuminate everything that's here,
                  like a moment of clouds parting and the light coming through—and what a
                  different world it is! Different and yet the same.</p>
              <p>Are we together on this? Are we looking at all this together? It's
                  easy to just follow words, but to look directly, that's not so easy. I
                  was reprimanded the other day by someone who said, "I don't want you to
                  teach me. I've tuned out the last ten minutes because I don't want to
                  be taught by you." I don't want to teach you either. I'm looking
                  myself, because all of these things I have described are things I have
                  observed in myself. I'm looking and conveying in words what is
                  discovered. If we all begin to look then we're not teaching each other,
                  we're exploring together, discovering alone and together the incredible
                  presence of this moment of not going elsewhere in this mind.</p>
              <h2>A Quiet Space</h2>
              <p><em>Comments Toni Packer made to students following the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11.</em></p>
              <p>Someone asked for a few words of advice for dealing with the torrent
                  of emotions and confusion that is coming up in the wake of the
                  horrendous explosions that shook many of us to the roots.</p>
              <p>If possible, can we find a quiet moment in a quiet space in the
                  midst of all the noise, agitation and confusion, a quiet spot in the
                  eye of sadness and grief, pain, anger, and rage, the urge for revenge,
                  and the longing for security to end all suffering? Can we listen
                  silently to the contractions of fear, anger and the throbbing of
                  longing for safety?</p>
              <p>Can we listen ever more silently to the constant, agitated reactions
                  to what we are witnessing on television or, live, in front of our eyes,
                  thinking frantically about what could have happened, should have
                  happened or ought to happen in response to it all? Can moments of calm
                  presence reveal the turmoil of thinking and emoting, staying with it
                  all without being completely taken over by it?</p>
              <p>Can we come back time and time again, with infinite patience, to what is actually taking place <em>right now</em>,
                  this very moment—the sadness and grief paining heart and mind, fear
                  knotting the stomach and guts, anger making the heart pound faster,
                  driving the blood to the head, and also hear the sound of rain and
                  motor noises around us, see the brightness and darkness of the room,
                  the sky, the smell in the air? Can we come back not just to the
                  reactions to all of this, but simply perceive sounds and sights and the
                  feel of what is actually taking place?</p>
              <p>This stillness has room for everything happening on this earth—the
                  good and the evil, the wounding, the helping and the healing, the dying
                  and living, the hating, the killing and the inexhaustible love that
                  transcends it all in a way too
                  marvelous to comprehend.</p>
