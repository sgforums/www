              <p>Many like to talk about the Natural State and direct path. I am a non-sectarian and I do not believe in monopoly over truth but still I see Buddhism's Dependent Origination most profound. Over the years, I have enough conversations, discussions and mail correspondences. It has come to a point that I retract from all these and resort to being a “”PasserBy” :-). My advice to those attempting to engage in the direct path is not to take it as a short cut as in one of my reply to AEN:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Hi AEN,<br><br>I do not usually reply people about spiritual stuff but I sense the confusion in Mikael's mail to you.</p>
              <p>It is advisable to correctly point out to him that there is no short cut to direct path. <br><br> In the most direct path, Awareness is already and always at rest.  In the most direct path, whatever manifests is Awareness; there is no "in Awareness" and there is no such thing as going deeper in Awareness or resting in Awareness.  Anything "going deeper" or "resting"  is nothing direct.  Nothing more than the illusionary appearances of 'hierarchy' caused by the inherent and dualistic tendency of understanding things.  It is more 'gradual' than 'direct'.  Therefore have the right view first before we talk too much about the direct path so that we do not fall into such views.   Next clearly understand the cause that blinds us then have direct authentication of our pristine nature so that we will not be misled.</p>
              <p>By the way, non-discrimination does not deny us from clear discernment.  An enlightenment person is not one that cannot differentiate 'left' from 'right'. :-)<br></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> When we say 'rest in the natural state', we must not postulate
              as if there is 'state' where the mind can access and rest. There is no
              such state. There is no entry and exit point nor is there a behind
              background for us to rest our mind. We are talking about a direct
              realization of our luminous yet empty nature. It defies all
              subject-object and inherent view. If we want to bypass 'this step of
              firm establishment of right view', just make sure we are able to
              correctly understand our pristine nature when glimpses of our nature
              dawn; it is easily distorted and misinterpreted and that is why
              dependent origination is taught.<br><br>Dependent Origination
              demolishes hierarchy; brings the absolute to the same level as the
              transience. See the absolute as nothing more special than an arising
              thought ,a subsiding sound, a passing scent. It opens up all sense doors and see all
              moments, any time and anywhere as entry point to our Buddha Nature.
              It flattens the 3 states of waking, sleeping and dreaming and see movement
              and stillness as one.<br><br>And<br><br>That is what 'Natural
              State', 'No Mind' and 'One Taste' are about. We do not on one hand talk
              about natural state, naked awareness and on the other hand talk about a
              resting state or access to a higher samadhi. There is no resting place
              and no deeper samadhi to access. All states are equally pure, pristine
              and empty, therefore no preference, no movement and nothing gain. Such
              is the direct path, anything other than that is 'gradual'. :-)<br></p>

              <p>Hmmm....it is often said that there is sudden realisation then gradual practice. Sudden realisation of what? Of awareness, truth, god, or whatever you might call it.

              <p><br> Yes Emanrohe,</p>
              <p>That is precisely the question asked by Dogen that “if our Buddha Nature is already perfect, why practice?”  This question continues to bother him even after the initial glimpse and that led him to China in search for the answer that eventually awaken his wisdom into the non-dual nature of Awareness. </p>
              <p>Therefore we must understand in Zen tradition, different koans were meant for different purposes. The experience derived from the koan “before birth who are you?” only allows an initial glimpse of our nature.    It is not the same as the Hakuin’s koan of “what is the sound of one hand clapping?” The five categories of koan in Zen ranges from hosshin that give practitioner the first glimpse of ultimate reality to five-ranks that aims to awaken practitioner the spontaneous unity of relative and absolute (non-duality).
                          
                          Only through thorough realization of the non-dual nature (spontaneous unity of relative and absolute) of Awareness can we then understand why there is no split between subject and object as well as seeing the oneness of realization and development.   Therefore the practice of natural state is for those that  have already awaken to their non-dual nature, not just an initial glimpse of Awareness.  The difference must be clearly understood.  It is not for anyone and it is advisable that we refrain from talking too much about the natural state.  The 'natural' way is in fact the most challenging path, there is no short cut.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the gradual path of practice is a systematic way of taking us step by step until we eventually experienced the full non-dual and non-local nature of pristine awareness.  One way is by first firmly establishing the right view of anatta (non-dual) and dependent origination and practice vipassana or bare attention to authenticate our experience with the right view.   The gradual paths are equally precious, that is the point I want to convey.</p>
              <p>Lastly there is a difference between understanding Buddha Nature and God.  Not to let our initial glimpse of pristine awareness overwhelmed us.   :-)</p>

              <div class="post-content">
              <p>One
              hears among people involved with different awareness teachings and
              practices, the oftentimes frustrating and painful story of having
              recognized the presence of awareness and then feeling like that
              recognition has somehow slipped away. There then begins the search to
              get that recognition back, to have the sense of awareness being more
              stable, more enduring, more abiding. This can become one of the most
              painful searches in life, in large part because the recognition of
              oneself as awareness is such a liberating, and deeply satisfying
              experience. It is the true coming home. And we know it. We’ve glimpsed
              the heaven we always longed for, the peace, the relief, we always
              craved. And now it is (apparently) gone. So the pain of that, the pain
              of leaving heaven can be quite intense.</p>
              <p>One answer we hear to such questions is that awareness is always
              present, otherwise there could be no perceptions. We are invited to
              examine our own experience and see if awareness isn’t always right here
              as the basis of each and every experience, each and every perceptual
              appearance. This is a powerful and very true pointer, to see that no
              matter what the perceptual objects are that appear in the sky of
              awareness, awareness is present to them all, to see that whether clear
              or stormy weather is arising, the sky remains the sky.</p>
              <p>But true as this is, what frequently happens is that when
              particularly disturbing states appear, it seems as if the peace of this
              ever-present awareness is difficult to access, that it is somehow far,
              far away, if present at all. And so, one then (understandably) seeks to
              return to it, find once again, the presence of awareness. But in this
              whole process, awareness is really being applied as a kind of antidote
              to suffering. That is, should some disturbing or painful state appear,
              one attempts to return to awareness, notice that it never left, feel
              the peace of it, the freedom of it, the ease of it. I’m sure you know
              the drill. While it brings some relief, at a certain point, the sense
              of back and forth becomes quite tiresome, frustrating and painful.</p>
              <p>But there is another way, another way to have one’s recognition of
              awareness grow more stable, more enduring, more abiding. And that is,
              to simply recognize that <em>every</em> perception, whether described as desirable or undesirable, pleasurable or painful, IS none other <em>than</em> awareness. Awareness is not some thing watching some other thing, not a
              “subject” observing happy or sad, peaceful or disturbing “objects.”
              Perceptions are ultimately inseparable from awareness. Awareness
              doesn’t simply watch or witness what appears to it. The sky doesn’t
              merely watch the clouds passing by. The sky pervades the clouds.
              Awareness permeates experience, it saturates perception. It IS
              perception. That which perceives is inseparable from what it perceives.
              They are not two.</p>
              <p>There is not disturbance or discomfort on the one hand and the
              ever-present peace of awareness on the other. Awareness is inseparable
              from disturbing mind states. If you want to know what awareness, it is
              quite simple. It is whatever is being perceived, just now. That makes
              it rather simple, doesn’t it? And as this begins to dawn in our direct
              experience, we see that the stability of awareness is to be found by
              recognizing it is present in and as each perception. Then, there is
              indeed, no possibility of ever losing it. Awareness appears as the
              perception we call “recognizing awareness”. And it appears as the
              perception we call “non-recognition.”</p>
              <p>Awareness is the seamless flow of perception for really there are
              not any discrete perceptions. There is no perceivable boundary line
              between one perception and the next, even though our descriptions of
              phenomena would suggest otherwise. There is just a seamless,
              uninterrupted flow of perception, the river of ever-present awareness,
              impossible to stop, impossible to locate, impossible to contain,
              impossible to describe, and impossible to be apart from for “we” are
              simply another perception, the river of awareness flowing as us.</p>

                                      that is, to <strong>simply recognize that <em>every</em> perception,
                                      whether described as desirable or undesirable, pleasurable or
                                      painful, IS none other <em>than</em> awareness</strong>. Awareness is not
                                      some thing watching some other thing, not a “subject” observing
                                      happy or sad, peaceful or disturbing “objects.” <strong>Perceptions are
                                      ultimately inseparable from awareness. Awareness doesn’t simply
                                      watch or witness what appears to it. The sky doesn’t merely watch
                                      the clouds passing by. The sky pervades the clouds. Awareness
                                      permeates experience, it saturates perception. It IS perception.
                                      That which perceives is inseparable from what it perceives. They
                                      are not two.</strong></p>

              <p>I really like this quote because it shows that all is One, when one sees it as the One.</p>
              <p>Mind is always cutting up reality into little pieces so it can understand and grasp these pieces or concepts.</p>
              <p>But when the understanding dawns that the mind is just being the mind and this can be seen, then it can be accepted for what it is.  But in my own experience, it has to be seen for what it is.</p>
              <p>Mind has to be recognized for what it is, for what it does, but I'm talking about the thinking mind of course.</p>
              <p>Well above and beyond and within this thinking mind is Mind, or universal mind, which is our true nature. </p>
              <p>Thinking mind exists within the vastness of Mind, which is can be pointed to as "all that is".</p>
              <p>Awareness is a funny word.</p>
              <p>It's so easy to see awareness since this is what I am and what is present now allowing this post to be known, to be seen, to be understood.</p>
              <p>And yet awareness is a total mystery to me, i have no idea whatsoever what it is.  It almost appears to be a miracle.</p>
              <p>I am a miracle.</p>
              <p>You are a miracle.</p>
              <p>An unknowable miracle which is an unknowable person in an unknowable universe.</p>

              <p><em>Far from seeing the exotic, the
                  marvelous, as the Way, Zen says that even something as mundane as
                  washing the dishes is the Way: the direction to go in practice, the way
                  to practice, and even the goal of practice itself. A monk came to
                  Joshu’s temple and asked, “I am new here, could you please tell me what
                  the essence of your teaching might be?” “Have you eaten?” asked Joshu.
                  “Yes.” replied the monk. “Then go and wash your dishes.” <br></em></p>
              <p><em>Why
                  is this? Why does Zen repudiate the magical and extol the mundane,
                  everyday life? A clue to the answer to this question lies in another
                  saying, this time by a famous Zen layman, P’ang, who lived more or less
                  at the same time as Joshu. He said, “My miraculous power and magical
                  ability: drawing water and chopping wood.” In other words the mundane
                  world is already miraculous and magical. The wonder is not that people
                  walk on water, it is that we walk at all. Speaking in tongues is not
                  marvelous; saying “Good morning!” and “Good afternoon!” is wherein the
                  miracle lies.</em></p>

              <p><em>It is liberating to recognize that, whatever this non-conceptual,
                  timeless awareness is, that is what you are. But once it is recognized
                  fully and completely that this space is what you are, and that this is
                  what the word “spirit” is pointing to, there is no need to continuously
                  return to a contentless sense of being.  To return again and again to
                  it is to treat it as a temporary experience, something to get to,
                  return to, or rest in.  Again, although that may be helpful in
                  recognizing this contentless awareness, don’t get caught in the
                  repetitious trap of trying to reach or maintain or recognize or know
                  yourself as this contentless space. By making it into an experience or
                  continuously recognizing it, the mind creates a pattern of wanting to
                  return to it and to avoid content. That’s a trap. Don’t fall for the
                  trap that contentless awareness is non-duality. It isn’t. Don’t deny
                  content. In the spiritual search, the desire to recognize pure
                  awareness (i.e., spirit) comes from an identity crisis. You don't know
                  who or what you are. In not knowing what you are, the storm of
                  phenomena (thoughts, feelings, states, and experiences) torture and
                  overwhelm you. In recognizing that you are this vast, spacious
                  awareness, phenomena no longer torture you. Phenomena are seen to be
                  the spontaneous and dynamic energy of awareness itself.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Once there is a knowing that what you are, in the deepest sense, is
              this contentless awareness, the content is enjoyed. It flows
              naturally. Once you know that your true identity is the ocean, let the
              waves play. Let them tumble over each other.  Get soaking wet in the
              play of life. Enjoy the difference between the waves.  Each one is
              unique. You, the individual body, mind, and personality, are none other
              than the awareness. Enjoy your uniqueness. I'm not referring to ego. 
              Ego is that contracted energy, that time-bound, thought-based story
              that fixates in self-centered thinking. Once awareness is recognized as
              your real identity, the ego is seen as a phantom. What I'm referring to
              here is the vast freedom inherent in awareness and the fact that every
              form is a perfect, inseparable, unique expression of that
              awareness. That means every form, including the individual life
              form that appears in that body. The unique you that is inseparable from
              the source. Enjoy it all!  </em></p>

                                  to tell us and make us do and decide everything in our lives. our
                                  fav color, food, what is right/wrong, what to do next, i'm so bored
                                  now what's the next exciting thing to do.. etc.  they may not
                                  be substantial voices we hear but still its something (we call
                                  habits, inclinations.. etc) that we totally "believe" and so
                                  letting them control all our actions in life that goes on and on
                                  which feels like being swept along helplessly by the wave of
                                  karma.  a person life can just be controlled by
                                  unquestioningly accepting and believing these "voices in our head"
                                  without wisdom, which can of course ends up in good or bad
                                  circumstances, depending on the situations.</em></p>
              <p><em>the more subtle "voices" are like our instincts and habits that
                                  we probably don't even notice like habitual shaking of legs,
                                  disgusted by uncleaniness/2nd hand smoke, afinity to fav colors..
                                  etc. the more coarse "voices" are our intellectual/conceptual
                                  thoughts that goes on in our head - should i do this or that, right
                                  or wrong, how-to, why-this-not-that, problem-solving during work..
                                  etc.</em></p>
              <p><em>only difference between "normal" and "insane" ppl is that
                                  "normal" ppl do have ability to discern whether these "voices" are
                                  socially appropriate, whereas "insane" ppl's life are totally
                                  dominated by these "voices". like when anger arises, "normal" ppl
                                  like us can have a little space to discern should we "believe" the
                                  anger and carry out the resultant actions or "disbelieve" the anger
                                  and let its energy liberate by itself but "insane" ppl will just
                                  helplessly carry out the anger into physical actions
                                  unquestioningly - like outburst, causing physical hurt, murder..
                                  etc.  but still "normal" ppl can still momentarily falls into
                                  "insanity" by believing in that anger and ends up doing so-called
                                  "stupid things that will be regretted later". so how much space we
                                  have to discern these and not to be drowned out is really our
                                  practice of mindfulness and the little wisdom we gain from the
                                  practice that enables us to ride these karmic waves instead of
                                  being drowned. i'm still "trapping water" trying to stay afloat on
                                  a daily basis :-)</em></p>
              <p><em>and while all these "voices" are going on in our immediate
                                  experience, "believing" in them fully and carrying out the
                                  resultant actions is like believing in their inherent existence and
                                  being swept away helplessly by the karmic waves, while "seeing
                                  through" them is like realizing their empty but luminous nature and
                                  hence can experience but not be affected by them. and the paradox
                                  is through analysis, there is no solid self that experiences all
                                  these. but due to ignorance, our deluded belief in a self sort of
                                  creates this energy that solidify this self and the various
                                  experiences, hence causing all the sufferings that follows. and
                                  while all these empty luminous experiences are going on, empty
                                  basic awareness are experiencing all these impartially. but
                                  ignorance prevents recognising the empty awareness that is not a
                                  "thing" or "self", and results in solidifying the experiecning
                                  awareness (subject) as a "self" and the experiences (object) as
                                  "others".</em></p>

              discerns 'the voice' and hence prevents us from being lost in them...

              <p>my appreciation AEN for sharing our discussions.</p>
              <p>i came across this article today that i thought was quite interesting to share for all.  it talks about the fresh child-like quality of the mind that should be cultivated. especially intriguing was the scientific observation of zen awareness meditation as compared to some other states of mind.  my takeaway from the article was appreciating the importance of the dynamics of a fresh, mindful, fully aware and non-discriminating mind, as compared to some mis-conceptions people sometimes has on Buddhist meditation as being so-called "emptiness" spaced-out trance kinda state.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Question</strong></em>: What are some of the positive qualities of a childlike mind?</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 85%;"> 
              </span></p><p><em><strong>Tenzin Palmo</strong></em>:
                              An example of a childlike quality is when children are in the midst of
                              intense grief and then someone gives them a lollipop. The tears
                              disappear and they giggle and smile. They have completely forgotten
                              that a few minutes ago they had been grief-stricken. A childlike
                              quality of the mind really means a mind which is fresh, which sees
                              things as if for the first time.</p>
              <p>Once someone did a test on
                              meditators'...brainwaves. They tested someone who was doing a formal
                              Hindu style meditation and a Zen master. This was to find out what the
                              difference was, because they both said they were meditating, but each
                              was doing a very different kind of meditation. They also tested a
                              non-meditator. Every three minutes, they made a sudden loud noise. It
                              was regular. The first person they tested was the one who didn't know
                              how to meditate. The first time this person heard the loud noise, he
                              became very agitated. The second time he was less agitated. The third
                              time there was some vague agitation, and then the fourth time he more
                              or less ignored it. The person doing the Hindu meditation didn't react
                              to the noise at all. He didn't hear it. When the person doing the Zen
                              meditation heard the noise, the mind went outwards, noted the noise and
                              then went back in. The next time, the mind noted the noise and went
                              back in. His reaction was unchanged. Each time, the mind noted the
                              noise and went back in.</p>
              <p>That tells us a lot about the quality
                              of mind we are talking about. This is a mind which responds to
                              something with attention and then returns to its own natural state. It
                              doesn't elaborate on it, doesn't get caught up in it, doesn't get
                              excited about it. It just notes that this is what is happening. Every
                              time it happens, it notes it. It doesn't get blasé. It doesn't become
                              conditioned. In this way, it is like a child's mind. When something
                              interesting happens, it will note it and then let it go and move onto
                              the next thing. This is what is meant by a childlike mind. It sees
                              everything as if for the first time. It doesn't have this whole backlog
                              of preconditioned ideas about things. You see a glass and you see it as
                              it is, rather than seeing all the other glasses you have seen in your
                              life, together with your ideas and theories about glasses and whether
                              you like glasses in this or that shape, or the kind of glass you drank
                              out of yesterday. We are talking about a mind which sees the thing
                              freshly in the moment. That's the quality we are aiming for. We lose
                              this as we become adults. We are trying to reproduce this fresh mind,
                              which sees things without all this conditioning. But we do not want a
                              mind which is swept away by its emotions.</p>
