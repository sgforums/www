              <p><strong>This page</strong> criticizes the religious aspect of Buddhism but 
              praises the worldwide social work done in its name. A great force for

               Buddhism is unfortunately another example of a religion of historical 
              mistake and confusion, having little merit in its obfuscation and 
              mysticism. It supports a wonderful intelligence, but fails to justify

              <h2>1. Development of Buddhism</h2>
              <p>All elements of Buddhism were borrowed and taken from already 
              existing ideas in India. Just like <a href="http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/christianity.html">Christianity</a>,
               <a title="Pages on Islam by Vexen" href="http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/islam.html">Islam</a>, and all 
              other religions, it was formed from the beliefs of the present culture, a
               mixture of various trends of the time. It was not a sudden, new, unique
               revelation. It grew slowly. The teachings of its founder were not 
              written down by the founder himself but written down by many people many
               years later (four centuries or so) exactly the same as Christianity 
              (60-200 years) and Islam (one generation), and then argued over due to 
              the differences. It shows all the hallmarks of a mythical set of 
              stories, happening into a religion as a mistake.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>What doctrines, it must now be 
              asked, were special to Buddhism? Not Karma, that was common property 
              which Buddhism shared. Not in asserting that a right mind was superior 
              to sacrifice, that was a primary doctrine of the Jains, and 
              pre-Buddhistic, both within and without the pale of Brahmanism. Not in 
              seeking a way to salvation independently of the Vedas, that had been 
              done by many teachers in various sects. Not in the doctrine that 
              defilement comes not from unclean meats but from evil deeds and words 
              and thoughts; Buddhist writers themselves say that is derived from 
              previous Buddhas. Not in the search for peace through self-control and 
              renunciation; that was the quest of a myriad recluses and all previous 
              Buddhas. Not in the view that there is a higher wisdom than that 
              attained by austerities; that, too, is pre-Buddhistic. Not in the 
              doctrine that non-Brahmans could join an Order and attain religious 
              blessedness; other orders were open to men of low social status and even
               to slaves. Indeed, the rigid separation of caste was not yet 
              established in the early days of Buddhism.
              <p>The admission of women was not an innovation as it was practiced by 
              the Jains, and even the tradition makes the Buddha accept it reluctantly
               in the twenty-fifth year of his preaching.<span style="font-size: medium;">"</span></p>

              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>The historicity of Buddha is accepted
               by all. But there is no unanimity of the date. In Sri Lanka, 483 BC is 
              accepted as the date of his nirvana while in Burma 544 BC is accepted. 
              In Tibet it is believed to be 835 BC, while in China, 11th century BC is
               the accepted date. Buddha was an Indian and the Indian Puranic 
              tradition believes that the nirvana took place in 1793 or 1807 BC<span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Stories of "The Buddha" are compiled stories from multiple people and
               multiple events, canonized and amalgamated, there was no singular 
              "Buddha" as is traditionally taught in Buddhism, and no aspect of 
              Buddhism is other than that you'd expect to find in early India. In 
              short, it is entirely possible that there was no Buddha and that the 
              stories of the Buddha's life were merely the same stories of similar 
              lives of other sages, given a new catchy name. Such is the way religions
               are developed! Some modern Buddhist apologists have acknowledged this 
              and said that Buddhism is the revival of the stories of the <em>last</em> Buddha, thousands of years beforehand, therefore claiming that Buddhism 
              pre-emptively informed Indian beliefs. This is similar to the Christians
               saying that Satan planted on the Earth many religious beliefs similar 
              to Christianity in the first century, so as to discredit Christianity 
              when it emerged. Such explanations seem to be rather paranoid and rash! 
              The truth is, Buddhism and Christianity were copies of earlier beliefs 
              developed in the same way as other religions developed from culture and 
              history.

              <h2>3. Western Buddhism</h2>
              <p>According to the 2001 National Census, in England there are 152 000 
              Buddhists, 0.3% of the population.</p>
              <p>What we think of as "Buddhism" is too limited by the Pali 
              scriptures and too influenced by self-help mysticism, whereas Buddhism 
              contains much more in the way of superstition, ritual and dogma than 
              we'd like to see.</p>
              <p>Western Buddhism is simplified, compartmentalized and has its 
              real heart removed. The community (sangha) of Buddhism in the West is 
              completely missing[Jones, p275-6], Buddhism is a social religion, not a 
              solitary one, yet in the West Buddhism is practiced completely 
              solitarily. What most Westerners think of as Buddhism is hardly any more
               than New Age mysticism with a more respectable name.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is not suited to specialized cultures where life, work, 
              pleasure, relationships, entertainment, spirituality, are all in 
              different boxes. Buddhism is too dogmatically holistic, whereas New Age 
              is the opposite: Dogmatically individualistic. What many Westerners 
              consider Buddhism is merely the more respectable elements of Westernized
               Indian New Age.
              <a name="Consciousness"></a></p>
              <h2>5. Nirvana and the Self</h2>
              <p>In Buddhism, ultimate transcendental reality is nirvana, complete 
              abolition of the self. The same dilemma faces Buddhists as faces 
              theists: Why is it that there are any beings at all that are not in this
               perfect state?</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In Christianity, why did God create evil? If God is all-loving and 
              all-powerful, why isn't everyone in Heaven? </li>
              <li>In Buddhism, why is there a false reality at all? If there is 
              no self, by what mechanism do "drops" of the ocean come to think of 
              themselves as being individual? </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The common defence is that it is somehow better if little bits of 
              consciousness are deluded for a while before returning to Nirvana... but
               how can anything be "better" at all, when compared to Nirvana? How can 
              Nirvana be bettered? If it can be "bettered", how is it different from 
              the real world? The questions have remained unanswered by Christians and
               Buddhists for two thousand years. The answer is that there is no God to
               <em>put</em> people into Heaven, and also there is no Heaven or Nirvana 
              for the forces that be to usher us in to. 
              <a name="World"></a></p>
              <h2>4. World Buddhist Morality</h2>
              <p>Buddhism has the greatest record for peace and morality. Considering 
              its size it has a wonderfully surprising record, Christianity, Islam and
               other religions' more peaceful elements only come equal to Buddhist 
              movements. War, intolerant killing, torture, ignorance, monopolisation 
              and coercion are hardly present in Buddhist societies. Compared with 
              other powerful religions, Buddhism is saintly.</p>
              <p>But nonetheless, various forms of Buddhism in various times <em>have</em> been instruments of war and violence. Buddhist sects have argued and 
              fought over doctrine, over populations and methods, over pride and 
              national independence.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>Conze has argued [...] that 'some
               of the success of the [Tibetan Buddhist] Gelug-pa [sect] was due to the
               military support of the Mongols, who, during the seventeenth century, 
              frequently devastated the monasteries of the rival Red sects. The long 
              association of Japanese Zen Buddhism with military prowess and 
              aggressive imperialism has already been noted... [...] and Trevor Ling 
              has argued that South-East Asian Buddhist kingdoms were as militarily 
              aggressive and self-seeking as any others. Walpola Rahula [describes] a 
              war of national independence in Sri Lanka in the second century BC 
              conducted under the slogan 'Not for kingdom, but for Buddhism'<span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Buddhism has integrated itself with governments and found itself 
              manipulating the populace just as many other religions have done.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>After the Meiji Restoration 
              feudalism was replaced by a State dedicated to overseas expansion, and 
              the Zen establishment found a new role in nurturing absolute obedience 
              to it and supporting imperial wars of conquest. In the 1930s Zen Masters
               occupied themselves more and more with giving military men Zen training
               [...]. The events of this military epoch in the history of Zen have 
              been chronicled by Ichikawa Hakugen, a Zen priest and professor at 
              Kyoto's Hanazono University, who in books like <em>The War Responsibility
               of Buddhists</em>, condemned Zen's (and his own) collaboration with 
              Japanese fascism.<span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Buddhism in Japan and the USA has seen the emergence of "training" 
              for corporate employees designed to quell dissatisfaction and discord, 
              in short, of covering up the symptoms of illness and bad practice rather
               than tackling the problems of social malaise and industry work 
              standards. Buddhism, despite its highly socially-centered morality 
              frequently slips into individual remedies when in order to be consistent
               and true to its own teachings it should be engaging in wider social 
              work.
              <a name="Theodicy"></a></p>
              <h2>6. Inhumane Dismissal of Suffering</h2>
              <p>There is a lot of suffering in the world. This fact leads Buddhists 
              to look to Buddha for an answer, and leads Christians to look to Christ 
              for an answer. Both claim that ultimately a blissful state can be 
              attained with no suffering, that eventually everything will be alright. 
              The psychological attraction of such beliefs is one of the greatest 
              factors behind the success of religions that explain away suffering.</p>
              <p>But, Christianity and Buddhism have both dehumanized suffering in
               history and have both led people to accept suffering when they should 
              not. In Christianity, especially historically and within conservative 
              Christianity, suffering is a test from God, a result of the sins of us 
              and our ancestors. In Buddhism, suffering is the status-quo of life and 
              in popular Buddhism a person suffers now for their transgressions in 
              previous lives. Both Christianity and Buddhism explain away present evil
               as an unavoidable circumstance that we are better to accept than to 
              combat.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>The poor, the powerless and the 
              diseased are therefore assumed to owe their misfortune to moral 
              transgressions in past lives, no matter how virtuously they may strive 
              to improve their condition in this life. This mystification is applied 
              also to whole peoples and nations. [...] "This retributive view of kamma
               is quite alien to canonical Buddhism, as Buddhist scholars and teachers
               have made clear on many occasions.<span style="font-size: medium;">"</span>

              <p>The result is a depressive acceptance of social ills, taken as they 
              are to be endured rather than cured. Anti-progressionist, such views 
              have led the world into its darkest years. As with Christianity, when 
              popular Buddhism informs, for example, a painfully disabled person that 
              their present torture is a result of <em>their own</em> past actions or 
              sins, the result is a harmful negativity and horrifies any compassionate
               person that such doctrines ever came to be. Karmic resolution and 
              Christian sin are both harmful concepts with negative affects on 
              society, especially on the weak and unfortunate.
              <a name="Psychology"></a></p>
              <h2>7. Buddhist Psychology is too idealistic</h2>
              <p>You can spot Buddhist psycho-babble from quite a while off, there is a
               distinctive feel and look about Buddhist therapists and 
              self-development. The truth is that Buddhist psychology is like 
              Communist ideology or Christian guilt methodology: It only suits a 
              particular type of person. Buddhist practices are not a universal 
              solution to social ills or spiritual problems, but a certain type of 
              solution catering for only certain types of person.</p>
              <p>For a religion that makes universalist claims about the 
              enlightenment of all beings, it is stuck with a mythology about Indian, 
              Chinese and Eastern-style sages, teachers and students; when it is only a
               certain portion of humanity that can exist in those roles. The rest do 
              not fit into the Buddhist mould, and Buddhist advise and counsel is 
              counterproductive.</p>
              <p>Ken Jones notes the real dangers that Buddhist ego training 
              presents to certain types of people, producing neurotics and psychotics 
              at worst, and mental imbalance at best. He notes the difficulty of 
              adapting traditional Buddhist methods to swathes of society who do not 
              conform to the model of the ego that Buddhist psychology requires of 
              students.</p>
              <p>Buddhist unfortunately, for a religion with so much social 
              potential, falls over its own dogma and mythology when it comes to 
              individual, personal development of people in general. It operates best 
              as a peace movement, as a mediator, as an intelligent social commenter 
              rather than a personal religion.</p>
              <p>Those who do take earnestly and naturally to the methods of 
              Buddhist self-development are those who are already more developed and 
              already more intelligent Humans. Lower Buddhism, of the masses, is 
              dumbed down and mostly useless as a unique tool, functioning as a 
              smotherer just like popular religions do in all countries. Higher 
              Buddhism caters for those who are already on a higher level, just like 
              scholarly Christianity suits the intelligent and elitist Satanism suits 
              the naturally strong and mature, Buddhism doesn't offer much insight 
              into how the masses may improve themselves beyond offering the same 
              social programs that socially aware governments offer.
              <a name="Conclusion"></a></p>
              <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Buddhism is a wonderful religion socially, participating as a 
              principle player in all forms of global peace &amp; stability movements,
               very environmentally aware and an intelligent force for good in world 
              politics. Historically it has contributed much less inhumanity to the 
              world than have all other religions of similar stature. But its 
              greatness is limited by its own dogma and mythology, its psychology is 
              too idealistic and assumptive and its self-development aspects are too 
              specific. In the West Buddhism has become no more than the respectable 
              elements of New Age, merely called "Buddhism" and missing all of its 
              main elements, replacing them with commercialist and popularist 
              gimmicks. The London Buddhist Society and other high-brow Buddhist 
              institutions in the West are inactive, elitist gatherings of intelligent
               pseudo-Buddhists, genuine Buddhists in the West are very hard to find.</p>
              <p>In an age where the UN and many secular multinational 
              organisations have more strength and much willpower, social Buddhism has
               passed its hey-day as a useful tool of humanitarianism and global 
              welfare. Although still instrumental in many peace movements across the 
              world, Buddhist groups could be replaced with secular organisations with
               little real change.</p>
              <p>Either overly mystical, overly monastic, idealistic or secular, 
              only the world-wide social elements of Buddhism have genuine merit, the 
              rest is yet-another self-fulfilling religion of superstition, 
              assumptions and psuedopsychology. Despite this, Buddhist mentality and 
              intelligence is bettered by no other religion, and Buddhism is not a 
              danger to anyone, an aid to many, and given its history it will always 
              remain a force for long term social good.</p>

              <p>Here's my take on some issues, I welcome others to discuss and add their own points.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All elements of Buddhism were borrowed and 
                                  taken from already
                                                          existing ideas in India.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not true. All other religions talk about God, and an Atman (Self/Soul).</p>
              <p>This is what sets Buddhism different from them.</p>
              <p>We don't talk about an Ultimate Source, we talk about Interdependent Origination.</p>
              <p>We don't talk about a Soul, we talk about Anatta, No Soul.</p>
              <p>This is why Buddhism is unique.</p>
              <p>As Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rinpoche says:</p>
              <p> </p>

                                   Buddhism, any system or paradigm which propagates such an unproven and 
                                  improvable dream as an eternal substance or ultimate reality, be it 
                                  Hinduism or any other ‘ism’, is propagating spiritual materialism and 
                                  not true spirituality. To Hinduism such a Brahma is the summum bonum of 
                                  its search goal, the peak of the Hindu thesis. The Hindu paradigm would 
                                  collapse without it. Since Buddhism denies thus, it cannot be said 
                                  honestly that the Buddha merely meant to reform Hinduism. As I have 
                                  said, it is a totally different paradigm. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam,
                                   Jainism are all variations of the same paradigm. So truly speaking, you
                                   could speak of them as reformations of each other. But Buddhism has a 
                                  totally different paradigm from any of these, not merely from Vedic- 
                                  Hinduism.</em></span></p>

              <p>No. Human affliction and defilements are not caused by evil deeds and words and thoughts: rather, evil deeds and words and thoughts are the results of latent human afflictions and defilements caused by ignorance and grasping and craving.</p>

              <p>Not that it is 'derived', but that the previous Buddhas taught in this way as well.</p>
              <p>Buddhas that are long forgotten through the passage of time and not found in those days. In fact nobody would have even knew that there were past Buddhas had Buddha not mentioned it, since it was so long ago that it was entirely forgotten in history.</p>

                      simply

                                              liberation. As I said... other religions talk 
                      about that aspect as
                                              well and not just Buddhism, but when its empty 
                      nature is not known,
                                              it becomes a metaphysical essence, and all 
                      phenomena becomes like
                                              dust on the mirror. And then there is a mirror 
                      reflecting external
                                              conditions. That becomes dualistic and 
                      'inherent'. The cause of
                                              samsara is still not uprooted, and one of the 
                      fundamental causes as
                                              Thrangu Rinpoche* stated is the attachment to 
                      luminosity due to not
                                              perceiving its empty nature. If you read <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">my 
                      friend's experience</a> you
                                              see that there must be further insights into the
                       anatta and sunyata
                                              nature of awareness.<br> <br> But emptiness is also not just empty, so you 
                      must realise the union
                                              and inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. 
                      Having conviction
                                              in our luminous nature as everpresent, never 
                      lost, is important,
                                              but having glimpses of that pure luminosity is 
                      just the beginning
                                              and we are still far from perceiving its nature.</em></p>

              <p>But, Christianity and Buddhism have both dehumanized suffering
                  in history and have both led people to accept suffering when they
                  should not. In Christianity, especially historically and within
                  conservative Christianity, suffering is a test from God, a result
                  of the sins of us and our ancestors. In Buddhism, suffering is the
                  status-quo of life and in popular Buddhism a person suffers now for
                  their transgressions in previous lives. Both Christianity and
                  Buddhism explain away present evil as an unavoidable circumstance
                  that we are better to accept than to combat.</p>
              <p>The result is a depressive acceptance of social ills, taken as
                  they are to be endured rather than cured. Anti-progressionist, such
                  views have led the world into its darkest years. As with
                  Christianity, when popular Buddhism informs, for example, a
                  painfully disabled person that their present torture is a result of
                  <em>their own</em> past actions or sins, the result is a harmful
                  negativity and horrifies any compassionate person that such
                  doctrines ever came to be. Karmic resolution and Christian sin are
                  both harmful concepts with negative affects on society, especially
                  on the weak and unfortunate. <a id="Psychology" rel="nofollow" name="Psychology"></a></p>

                                          a smotherer just like popular religions do in 
                  all countries. Higher
                                          Buddhism caters for those who are already on a 
                  higher level, just
                                          like scholarly Christianity suits the 
                  intelligent and elitist
                                          Satanism suits the naturally strong and mature, 
                  Buddhism doesn't
                                          offer much insight into how the masses may 
                  improve themselves
                                          beyond offering the same social programs that

                   Surya Das</em> - Sustaining Present Awareness</a>:</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think the genius of Buddhadharma is that it really provides a 
                  workable path to do
                  this inquiry through. Anybody can do it. Even if you can't memorize 
                  anything. It is a
                  do-it-yourself, liberating Dharma. </em></p>
              <p><em>One of my favorite stories is about the Arhat Chunda. He was quite 
                  stupid. When his
                  brother became a monk, Chunda just wanted to do what his brother did. So
                   he went to
                  Ananda, Buddha's attendant. But holy Ananda said, "Sorry. You're too 
                  stupid."
                  Ananda thought this kid was too stupid to become a monk because he 
                  couldn't remember the
                  rules, the chants, the teachings. So the elder brother and his stupid 
                  little brother went
                  to the Buddha, for the Buddha was extremely wise, kind, and 
                  compassionate. He scanned the
                  past lives of this young, stupid boy, Chunda. He saw in there one tiny 
                  root of merit that
                  could help him get enlightened. He said it didn't matter how dull-minded
                   he was. It didn't
                  matter that he couldn't memorize anything. It didn't matter if he could 
                  remember even one
                  rule. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Ananda, you're not the Buddha, so you 
                  couldn't see
                  that this kid can get enlightened. But I'm the Buddha and I'm going to 
                  ordain him because
                  he can get enlightened. He has one good root of merit from a past life. 
                  He can do it, too.
                  Watch over this little child." (This story always brings tears to my 
                  eyes.) </em></p>
              <p><em>So Buddha ordained the kid. The kid couldn't remember even one rule, 
                  or how to wear his
                  robes. You know, it's complicated to be a monk. All the monks were 
                  studying and
                  memorizing. There were a lot of teachings. There were 253 rules of 
                  monastic ordination.
                  But the stupid, youthful Chunda couldn't remember anything. </em></p>
              <p><em>Finally, the brethren gave him the job of cleaning off the sandals of
                   the monks. Chunda
                  cleaned the sandals while the other monks were getting teachings. Since 
                  there weren't any
                  books in those days, 2500 years ago in India, nothing was written down; 
                  the monks had to
                  memorize the teachings. Chunda wanted to practice like the other monks, 
                  and get this
                  enlightenment thing he heard about every day. So he asked the Buddha how
                   he could get this
                  enlightenment thing. The Buddha said, "When you're scraping mud and 
                  sweeping the
                  floors, just think, 'Now I am purifying all the obscurations of the 
                  mind.'" So he
                  gave him a little two-line verse. "With each cleaning of the sandals, I 
                  am cleaning
                  off the obscurations of the shining, perfect mind." The Buddha asked him
                   to repeat
                  it. He repeated it. The Buddha said, "Can you remember that?" He said,
                  "Yes." </em></p>
              <p><em>Then dumb Chunda went out and tried to repeat the verse. "With each 
                  scraping of
                  the dirt, I am cleaning..." And he couldn't remember it. But he had good
                   karma and
                  had gentle Ananda around to remind him of the verse. Still, Chunda 
                  forgot again. Then
                  Sariputra the learned came out, and Chunda asked him to remind him. 
                  Finally, the Buddha
                  came back and said to Chunda, "Are you cleaning the sandals?" He said,
                  "Yes." Buddha asked, "Are you cleaning the dust off the floor?" Chunda
                  said, "Yes." And Buddha asked, "Have you cleaned the obscurations off 
                  the
                  shining, perfect mind?" Suddenly Chunda was enlightened! He realized 
                  that the sandals
                  with the dirt are still the sandals. The floor even with the dust is 
                  still the floor.
                  Everything is just as it is. He became an arhat, a fully liberated sage. </em></p>
              <p><em>In those days, wherever the Buddha went, the people would always try 
                  to serve lunch,
                  the main meal of the day, to him and the arhats. They thought if they 
                  gave Buddha lunch
                  they would get the most merit, and if they gave the arhats lunch they 
                  would get almost as
                  much merit. But if they couldn't catch any arhats, they would feed the 
                  ordinary monks and
                  get a little less merit. Everyone knew how stupid Chunda was, and they 
                  didn't believe he
                  was an enlightened arhat. But wherever Buddha went, he saved a seat for 
                  Chunda, because he
                  said he was the purest-minded, least proud arhat. Purest-minded because 
                  he didn't know
                  anything. And least proud because he was so simple, so humble, so 
                  undemanding and easy to
                  be with. </em></p>
              <p><em>Unfortunately, </em><em>we are not that stupid. We know too much. Or 
                  should I say, we
                  think so much, we know so little. If we could just be ourselves, and 
                  take the path that is
                  genuinely for us, it would be so easy. Imagine if Chunda was trying to 
                  become a Buddhist
                  scholar, he never would have gotten enlightened. But he was content to 
                  clean the monks'
                  shoes because he loved his brother and Buddha and the other monks. And 
                  it had to be done,
                  so he did it. And he had a little teaching, a little verse that fit into
                   that. That's why
                  Thich Nhat Hanh gives everybody a little verse. He has a little verse 
                  for eating, for
                  waking up, for toilet, for going to sleep, because one little verse can 
                  be enough to fully
                  awaken you to the fullness and richness of the present moment. </em></p>
              <p><em>Spiritual life has nothing to do with how smart you are. In fact, 
                  being smart can be an

              <p>woah.. nice thread...</p>
              <p>actually it helps us in our critical thinking, don't u agree?</p>
              <p>blindly follow the teaching is unhealthy as everybody knows (I assumed!)</p>
              <p>but sometimes if you cast doubts, people may find u either u are here to create trouble or to sow discord whatever, or worse, creating schism? (yeah down to Avici Hell LOL)</p>
              <p>but, if we do not apply critical thinking and be skeptical, we are not improving right?</p>
              <p>The balance.... is what I am looking for.</p>
              <p>Like why I ask myself in Tibetan Buddhism is esoteric and involve sexual contents.... but Buddha himself recommended us to take the precepts that involve no sexual misconduct.... i still thinking of other possibilities and contradictions.</p>

              <p>I agree. Santanists are usually anti-anything traditional and promotes individualism. It may sound hip to young people. But most people at some stage of their life pick up a religion.</p>

              <p>what an idiot you are , i bet you are not a buddhist , because</p>
              <p>you simply lack the brain to think  to become a Buddhist.</p>
              <p>1] how do you know that those buying the food is a buddhist and not a toaist or just someone who  do not want to eat meat ?</p>
              <p>2] it is not that the buddhist specifically ask for the Zai to look like meat , it is the</p>
              <p>   seller who make it this way to make it more attractive.</p>
              <p>3] you look at something superficially from the outside and think you know very well</p>
              <p> what is Buddhism about , and start to make stupid remarks.</p>

              <p>No again, like what the above has said. From a business point of view, do the customers want to buy if they see a sea of vege ? I doubt so.</p>
