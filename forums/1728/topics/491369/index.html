              says “faith in God” better than the Pope’s bullet-proof car, goes the joke.
              It’s a smart, satirical statement, but Christians defend the papal protection
              by using the “Just in case” argument. Evil is powerful and always at work, they
              will point out, so a little caution can’t hurt.</span></h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 18.25pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>It's a lot trickier for Buddhists to defend a senior monk's
              possession of a Mercedes Benz. For one thing, "evil" in Buddhism
              doesn't refer to those who might try to attack the luxury vehicle but
              apparently to the vehicle itself. The "Just in case" or "A
              little caution" argument might still work, but it has to be used
              intricately.<br> <br> So, if you were a lawyer hired to defend the senior monk against charges of
              violating the key principles of Buddhism, what would you say? This question has
              haunted me for the past few days, until I came up with the following. Lord
              Buddha might disagree with it, of course, but everyone deserves a chance to
              defend his actions.<br> <br> Here's what the lawyer in me would say to a Buddhist court (if such a thing
              existed):<br> <br> "Show me one senior monk, Your Honour, who doesn't have a car, who has to
              walk for miles to give sermons to his followers. Or better still, show me any
              part of the Buddhist canon that says riding in a thing with four wheels and
              running on a special liquid sucked up from the ground is a sin.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18.25pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #222222;'>"No? How about I show you
              photos of some of the world's most revered Buddhist monks on aeroplanes? Surely
              that's a bigger crime than travelling in a Mercedes Benz, don't you think?<br> <br> "That Lord Buddha never banned air-conditioned vehicles from his
              disciples' lives means they can own them. He only said Buddhist monks should
              limit their possessions to 'necessities'. Take my word for it, Your Honour,
              cars are a must in today's world. You need them to reach the sorry souls living
              in areas where monks could never travel otherwise.<br> <br> "So why can't it be a cheap Toyota, Mazda, Suzuki or Honda? That's your
              question, isn't it? It's trendy to say you can't 'Mercedes' your way to
              nirvana, but please hear me out. My question is, which car is safer? This is
              Buddhist economy, Your Honour. Thanks to its superior safety record, a Mercedes
              Benz gives you better insurance - or assurance - that you will reach nirvana in
              this life.<br> <br> "You don't want to spend hundreds of lives trying to reach nirvana, Your
              Honour. You would be a waste of precious resources, which goes against Buddhist
              frugality. You are a lot less likely to be killed in a road accident if you own
              a Mercedes, so it's safe to say it's a fast vehicle to nirvana.<br> <br> "I sense you still have doubts, Your Honour. You remain suspicious that my
              client possesses the car not because he wants to reach nirvana as fast as
              possible, but because he is, well, a big-time materialist. If you don't buy my
              argument that a Mercedes is a nirvana insurance policy, I have this question,
              sir: Who can preach "detachment" better - someone who has never owned
              a thing, or someone who has everything? A wise man once said that you can never
              really understand sin until you become a sinner yourself.<br> <br> "Even Prince Siddhartha once had everything. If there had been luxury
              German cars during his time, I'm certain his palace garage would have boasted a
              few. Buddhism is a process of learning, Your Honour. And when you come to think
              of it, the word "detachment" needs an object. You can't detach
              yourself from anything if you have nothing to begin with. To understand
              Buddhism, you need something to detach yourself from. See?<br> <br> "And on that point I rest my case, Your Honour."<br> <br> There you have it, my imaginary defence of the under-fire monk. On a more
              serious note, though, if possessing a Mercedes is wrong then much else is also
              morally dubious in the Thai Buddhist Sangha. Senior monks owning luxury cars
              might seem outrageous, but it's just a symptom of a sickness so pervasive and
              deep-rooted that we don't know exactly who to blame. We can't change things by
              adding "Mercedes Benz" to the list of banned items. Buddhism doesn't
              work that way.<br> <br> We aren't talking about a set of rules here. Buddhist enlightenment is not something
              that can be reached by finding loopholes. In other words, you can't comb
              greed's hair, dress up your un-Buddhist actions and expect to access nirvana.
              The road to the destination is so simple and complicated at the same time,
              depending on your choice of vehicle.</span></p>
