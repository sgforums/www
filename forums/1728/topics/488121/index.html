              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">By now it
                  is an open secret the degree to which respect for the Dalai Lama is growing
                  in China within the leadership and business circles and amongst the
                  ordinary people. The BBC's exclusive report on China's super-rich communist
                  Buddhists is the latest proof.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">An aspect of the Tibetan leader little noted by scholars is the extensive
                  contacts he had with the revolutionary leaders who created modern China.
                  The Dalai Lama was in China for almost a year from 1954 to 1955. During
                  this period he learnt Chinese and the ideals of socialism as explained to
                  him by his Chinese hosts. More importantly, the Tibetan spiritual and
                  political leader met with the top echelon of the Chinese communist
                  leadership, including Chairman Mao Zedong, who, according to the Tibetan
                  leader, treated him as a "father would treat a son." His Chinese
                  hosts took the Dalai Lama in a grand tour of new China to bring home to the
                  Tibetan leader the benefits of socialism. He witnessed the effective
                  governance these leaders provided to turn their vast and impoverished
                  country into a modern and egalitarian society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">How did the new socialist China affect the views and shape the thinking of
                  the Dalai Lama? Did this experience later resurface in his worldview and
                  the governance he provided in exile?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> At the time for the Dalai Lama and for China the world was fresh and new.
                  He was 19, in the prime of youth and open to the new world he saw being
                  re-created in China. For China the period was a fresh start, after a
                  century of humiliation under Western imperialism, enervating warlordism,
                  civil war, Japanese invasion and pervasive and crippling corruption. The
                  Dalai Lama visited China at a time when the country's revolutionary zeal
                  was at its height, when its collective determination to create a just and
                  equal society was unsullied by the ideological madness and physical carnage
                  that followed. It was a time when new China showed the Tibetan leader its
                  better side.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">New China
                  in the person of Mao Zedong also showed Tibet's political leader and its
                  foremost spiritual master its ambivalence to Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai
                  Lama recounts this episode in his autobiography, My Land and My People: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">A few days
                  later I had a message from Mao Tse-tung to say that he was coming to see me
                  in an hour's time. When he arrived he said he had merely come to call. Then
                  something made him say that Buddhism was quite a good religion, and Lord
                  Buddha, although he was a prince, had given a good deal of thought to the
                  question of improving the conditions of the people. He also observed that
                  the Goddess Tara was a kind-hearted woman. After a very few minutes, he
                  left. I was quite bewildered by these remarks and did not know what to make
                  of them.</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><br> <br> The comments Mao made during their last meeting shocked the Dalai Lama
                  beyond belief. My final interview with this remarkable man was toward the
                  end of my visit to China. I was at a meeting of the Standing Committee of
                  the National Assembly when I received a message asking me to go to see him
                  at this house. By then, I had been able to complete a tour of the Chinese
                  provinces, and I was able to tell him truthfully that I had been greatly
                  impressed and interested by all the development projects I had seen. Then
                  he started to give me a long lecture about the true form of democracy, and
                  advised me how to become a leader of the people and how to take heed of
                  their suggestions. And then he edged closer to me on his chair and
                  whispered:<br> <br> <em>I understand you very well. But of course, religion is poison. It has
                  two great defects: It undermines the race, and secondly it retards the
                  progress of the country. Tibet and Mongolia have both been poisoned by it.</em> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Marx's
                  dictum that religion was the opiate of the people rode roughshod over
                  whatever personal regard or sensitivity Mao might have had towards
                  Buddhism. Before and during the Cultural Revolution religion was the target
                  of communist wrath. Monasteries were reduced to ruins, temples were
                  destroyed and monks were disrobed. This was an attempt by new China to
                  prevent the fumes of opiate from sullying socialism. In Tibet the
                  destruction of Tibetan Buddhism had an overwhelmingly political overtone.
                  There could not be two suns in the same sky. Buddhism must melt under the
                  rays of the socialist sun. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Despite
                  these, the ideas of socialism the Dalai Lama learnt in China stayed with
                  him. One is his articulation of the concept of universal responsibility, of
                  acting locally but thinking globally. As he says,<br> <br> <em>In Buddhist practice we get so used to this idea of nonviolence and the
                  ending of all suffering that we become accustomed to not harming or
                  destroying anything indiscriminately. Although we do not believe that trees
                  or flowers have minds, we treat them also with respect. Thus we share a
                  sense of universal responsibility for both mankind and nature.</em> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Anyone
                  would think this kind of thinking comes entirely from his Buddhist
                  background, from the Buddhist concept of the interdependence of everything.
                  No, the Dalai Lama said in 2007 during a visit to Australia. The idea also
                  came from communist international, from the toiling workers and peasants of
                  the world expressing their solidarity with other suffering workers and
                  peasants.<br> <br> In 1979 the Dalai Lama blessed the founding of a Tibetan Communist Party
                  (TCP) in exile by a group of young educated refugees. He hoped that the
                  Tibetan Communist Party in exile would serve as a bridge to those Tibetans
                  in Tibet who shared the ideas and ideals of a socialist Tibet. But this
                  ideological bridge between the Tibetan exiles and their compatriots in
                  Tibet collapsed when the TCP decided to close its communist shop. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">But the
                  most far-reaching of the China experience which stayed with the Dalai Lama
                  was his ability and willingness to reach to the Chinese people. The need to
                  reach out to the Chinese became especially acute when in the wake of the
                  peaceful uprisings that erupted throughout Tibet in 2008, the Chinese
                  authorities used its awesome media firepower to stoke ethnic hostility
                  between Tibetans and Chinese. The Chinese authorities, as a part of the
                  state repression, were literally using the enormous public anger of the
                  Chinese on the hapless minority Tibetans. In view of this, the Tibetan leader
                  found it necessary to go out of his way to explain to Chinese scholars and
                  students the nature of the Tibetan people's struggle. The Middle-Way Policy
                  did not seek independence for Tibet. It sough real autonomy under a single
                  administration within the scope of the constitution of the People's
                  Republic of China. His efforts to reach out to the Chinese paid off. He was
                  able to win the trust and respect of a growing number of Chinese netizens.
                  In fact, there are some Chinese who are amplifying the Dalai Lama's voice
                  in China. Beyond the radar of China's censors and whispered in the din of
                  China's Internet chatter are expressions of Chinese support and sympathy. A
                  film, The Dialogue, posted on YouTube and premiered in Hong Kong late this
                  March, reveals that an increasing number of young Chinese on the mainland
                  are embracing the Dalai Lama's message of reconciliation and mutual
                  respect. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
                  Dialogue is made by Wang Lixiong, a writer who is based in Beijing and
                  married to Tsering Woeser, a tireless blogger for Tibet. The film grew out
                  of the two conversations that Wang Lixiong organized between the Dalai Lama
                  and netizens on the Mainland in 2010. Later, he organized a videoconference
                  between the Dalai Lama and two Chinese human rights lawyers,Teng Biao in
                  Shenzhen and Jiang Tianyong in Beijing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
                  questions the two Chinese human rights lawyers and their compatriots put
                  before the Dalai Lama are the concerns and anxieties of Tibetans on both
                  sides of the Himalayas grapple with. The Tibetan leader answered questions
                  on his likely spiritual successor, whether Tibetans would be faithful to
                  non-violence after his passing away, how the issue of Tibet could be
                  resolved, the nature of Tibetan autonomy and relations between Tibetans and
                  Chinese. 1,543 Chinese submitted more than 300 questions. 12,771 Chinese
                  voted for the 10 best questions before the censors moved in. </span></p>

No matter what sort of difficulties, <br><br>how painful experience is, if we lose our hope, that's our real disaster. â€• Dalai Lama <br><br>XIV<br><br>If you can cultivate the right attitude, your enemies are your best spiritual teachers <br><br>because their presence provides you with the opportunity to enhance and develop <br><br>tolerance, patience and understanding. â€• Dalai Lama XIV<br><br>Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive. <br><br>â€• Dalai Lama XIV<br><br>Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least <br><br>don't hurt them. â€• Dalai Lama XIV<br><br>If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice <br><br>compassion. â€• Dalai Lama XIV<br><br>( Retrieved Ancient Wisdom, Modern World By Dalai Lama XIV <br><br>http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ancient-Wisdom-Modern-World-Millennium/dp/0349112541)<br><br>    "...our capacity for empathy is the source of that most precious of all qualities, <br><br>which in Tibetan we call nying-je. Now whilst generally translated simply as compassion, <br><br>the term nying-je has a wealth of meaning that is difficult to convey succinctly, though <br><br>the ideas it contains are universally understood. It connotes love, affection, kindness, <br><br>gentleness, generosity of spirit and warm-heartednes. It is also used as a term of both <br><br>sympathy and of endearment. But most importantly, nying-je denotes a feeling of <br><br>connection with others, reflecting its origins in empathy...<br><br>    ...Although it is clear from this description that nying-je, or love and compassion, <br><br>is understood as an emotion, it belongs to that category of emotions which have a more <br><br>developed cognitive component. Some emotions, such as the revulsion we feel at the sight <br><br>of blood are basically instinctual. Others, such as fear of poverty, have this more <br><br>developed cognitive component.<br><br>    We can understand nying-je in terms of a combination of empathy and reason. Empathy <br><br>we can think of as a very honest person; reason as someone who is very practical. When <br><br>the two are put together, the combination is highly effective. As such, nying-je is quite <br><br>different from those random feelings like anger and lust which, far from bringing us <br><br>happiness, only trouble us and destroy our peace of mind. This fact that we can enhance <br><br>our feelings of concern for others is of supreme importance because the more we develop <br><br>compassion, the more genuinely ethical our conduct will be. As we have seen, when we act <br><br>out of concern for others, our behaviour towards them is automatically positive. This is <br><br>because we have no room for suspicion when our hearts are filled with love. It is as if <br><br>an inner door is opened, allowing us to reach out. Having concern for others breaks down <br><br>the impediment which inhibits healthy interaction with others...<br><br>    ...Thus if I may give an example from my own experience, I find that whenever I meet <br><br>new people and have this positive disposition, there is no barrier between us. No matter <br><br>who or what they are, whether they have blonde hair or black hair, or hair that is dyed <br><br>green, I feel that I am simply encountering a fellow human being with the same desire to <br><br>be happy and to avoid suffering as myself. And I find that I can speak to them as if they <br><br>were old friends, even at our first meeting. By keeping in mind that ultimately, we are <br><br>all brother and sisters, that there is no substantial difference between us, that all <br><br>others share my desire to be happy and to avoid suffering, I can express my feelings as <br><br>readily as to someone I have known intimately for years. And not just with a few nice <br><br>words or gestures, but really heart to heart, no matter what the language barrier."</p></div>
