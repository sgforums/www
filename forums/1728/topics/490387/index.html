              	By one who is skilled in goodness,
              And who knows the path of peace:
              	Let them be able and upright,
              Straightforward and gentle in speech,
              	Humble and not conceited,
              Contented and easily satisfied,
              	Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.
              Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful,
              	Not proud or demanding in nature.
              Let them not do the slightest thing
              	That the wise would later reprove.
              Wishing: In gladness and in safety,
              	May all beings be at ease.
              Whatever living beings there may be;
              	Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none,
              The great or the mighty, medium, short or small,
              	The seen and the unseen,
              Those living near and far away,
              	Those born and to-be-born —
              May all beings be at ease!
              Let none deceive another,
              	Or despise any being in any state.
              Let none through anger or ill-will
              	Wish harm upon another.
              Even as a mother protects with her life
              	Her child, her only child,
              So with a boundless heart
              	Should one cherish all living beings;
              Radiating kindness over the entire world:
              	Spreading upwards to the skies,
              And downwards to the depths;
              	Outwards and unbounded,
              Freed from hatred and ill-will.
              	Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down
              Free from drowsiness,
              	One should sustain this recollection.
              This is said to be the sublime abiding.
              	By not holding to fixed views,
              The pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision,
              	Being freed from all sense desires,
              Is not born again into this world.</div>

              <p>Weychin,</p>
              <p>You say my words in other posts are irrelevant, now what is this that is being posted above? Come on, if Ajahn Brahm is visiting Singapore he will say in the Buddhist Society of Western Australia we chant the metta sutra, we are anybody but Christians, alright, even if we chant mantras or sutras or suttas they hail from a sanskrit and pali dialect that has got its written equivalents. Our chanting conveys innumerable meanings, so while we barely fly into the skies these days with supernatural powers like Devadatta once craved to impress others with amidst his amassed wealth, we are sane people that takes aeroplanes with visas, that take buses with ezlink cards. Look at Minister Khaw the most famous buddhist, He takes an MRT when He has to take one.</p>
              <p>The Karmapas are both younger than me, given their hectic schedules do they have time to post such jibberish on your forum. So now that Kong Hee's visa are being confiscated, which Karmapa is visiting this year or next?</p>
              <p>Now, the Amaravati translation says that sentient beings can finally be excused from being born in this world, if you go into another translation, it says 'womb' instead of 'world'. In the Republic of Singapore we have multiple courts at the City Hall area because they serve a different purpose and hear a different trial. What if I prefer Thanissaro's translation?</p>
              <p>=) We are going to have improved 'business' in the coming few days, now if I bring in the Lotus Dharma Flower teaching even Devadatta has his pureland sooner or later, are you listening to me or do you think I should listen to you instead?</p>
              <p>Oh yes oh yes let's not forget about Vairocana Buddha.</p>
              <p>Gautama Buddha lived till 80, 'cftyu' are meant for those that believe in religious candidates that die at 33 and left barely 100 books, for Buddhists that believe in religious candidates that die at 80, we will never need to resort to 'ftdtghkmdfxk ghfd' because we never run out of words in Asia.</p>
              <p>*If anybody hold Jewish views, I will post a Nazi Swastika soon*</p>
              <p>I can also share more about what Goebbels felt about the Aryan emblem.</p>
              <p>Because Buddhists do Om Mani Padme Hum instead of '''''''''''''' or 'dkfogjxjk', get it clear please if anybody is changing religion this week.</p>

              <p>Karaniya Metta Sutta is both a paritta, a protection prayer and also a contemplative cultivation.</p>
              <p>I personally chant this prayer and allow me to cultivate loving kindness.</p>
              <p>I consider this paritta to be simple and yet powerful. When one is mindful and have loving kindness within one heart, one has a natural fearlessness.</p>
              <p>There are article relating to Karaniya Metta Suttanta. I will post and provide links when it concurs with my viewpoint.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Unless my memory fails me, I believe this paritta was taught to monks who were meditating when they were being disturbed by some forest spirits.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">It is told that five hundred monks received instructions from the Buddha in the particular techniques of meditation suitable to their individual temperaments. They then went to the foothills of the Himalayas to spend the four months of the rains' retreat by living a life of withdrawal and intensive meditation. In those days, a month or two before the rains' retreat started, monks from all parts of the country would assemble wherever the Buddha lived in order to receive direct instruction from the Supreme Master. Then they would go back to their monasteries, forest dwellings or hermitages to make a vigorous attempt at spiritual liberation. This was how these five hundred monks went to the Buddha, who was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove in the monastery built by Anathapindika.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">After receiving instructions they went in search of a suitable place, and in the course of their wandering they soon found a beautiful hillock at the foothills of the Himalayas. This, according to the commentary, "appeared like a glittering blue quartz crystal: it was embellished with a cool, dense, green forest grove and a stretch of ground strewn with sand, resembling a pearl net or a silver sheet, and was furnished with a clean spring of cool water." The bhikkhus were captivated by the sight. There were a few villages nearby, and also a small market-town ideal as alms-resort. The monks spent a night in that idyllic grove and the next morning went to the market-town for alms.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">The residents there were overjoyed to see the monks, since rarely did a community of monks come to spend the retreat in that part of the Himalayas. These pious devotees fed the monks and begged them to stay on as their guests, promising to build each a hut near the grove on the sandy stretch so that they could spend their days and nights plunged in meditation under the ancient boughs of the majestic trees. The bhikkhus agreed and the devotees of the area soon built little huts in the fringe of the forest and provided each hut with a wooden cot, a stool and pots of water for drinking and washing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">After the monks had settled down contentedly in these huts, each one selected a tree to meditate under, by day and by night. Now it is said that these great trees were inhabited by tree-deities who had a celestial mansion built, appropriately using the trees as the base. These deities, out of reverence for the meditating monks, stood aside with their families. Virtue was revered by all, particularly so by deities, and when the monks sat under the trees, the deities, who were householders, did not like to remain above them. The deities had thought that the monks would remain only for a night or two, and gladly bore the inconvenience. But when day after day passed and the monks still kept occupying the bases of the trees, the deities wondered when they would go away. They were like dispossessed villagers whose houses had been commandeered by the officials of visiting royalty and they kept watching anxiously from a distance, wondering when they would get their houses back.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">These dispossessed deities discussed the situation among themselves and decided to frighten the monks away by showing them terrifying objects, by making dreadful noises and by creating a sickening stench. Accordingly, they materialized all these terrifying conditions and afflicted the monks. The monks soon grew pale and could no longer concentrate on their subjects of meditation. As the deities continued to harass them, they lost even their basic mindfulness, and their brains seemed to become smothered by the oppressing visions, noise and stench. When the monks assembled to wait upon the seniormost Elder of the group, each one recounted his experiences. The Elder suggested: "Let us go, brethren, to the Blessed One and place our problem before him. There are two kinds of rains' retreat — the early and the late. Though we will be breaking the early one by leaving this place, we can always take upon ourselves the late one after meeting the Lord." The monks agreed and they set out at once, it is said, without even informing the devotees.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">By stages they arrived at Savatthi, went to the Blessed One, prostrated at his feet, and related their frightful experiences, pathetically requesting another place. The Buddha, through his supernormal power, scanned the whole of India, but finding no place except the same spot where they could achieve spiritual liberation, told them: "Monks, go back to the same spot! It is only by striving there that you will effect the destruction of inner taints. Fear not! If you want to be free from the harassment caused by the deities, learn this sutta. It will be a theme for meditation as well as a formula for protection (paritta).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">Then the Master recited the <em>Karaniya Metta Sutta</em> — the Hymn of Universal Love — which the monks learned by rote in the presence of the Lord. Then they went back to the same place.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">As the monks neared their forest dwellings reciting the <em>Metta Sutta,</em> thinking and meditating on the underlying meaning, the hearts of the deities became so charged with warm feelings of goodwill that they materialized themselves in human form and received the monks with great piety. They took their bowls, conducted them to their rooms, caused water and food to be supplied, and then, resuming their normal form, invited them to occupy the bases of the trees and meditate without any hesitation or fear.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.33em; margin-bottom: 1.33em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14.4px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #111111; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">Further, during the three months of the rains' residence, the deities not only looked after the monks in every way but made sure that the place was completely free from any noise. Enjoying perfect silence, by the end of the rainy season all the monks attained to the pinnacle of spiritual perfection. Every one of the five hundred monks had become an arahant.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">Indeed, such is the power intrinsic in the</span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;"> </span><em style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 18.72px;">Metta Sutta.</em><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;"> </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 18.72px; background-color: #fffeff;">Whoever with firm faith will recite the sutta, invoking the protection of the deities and meditating on metta, will not only safeguard himself in every way but will also protect all those around him, and will make spiritual progress that can be actually verified. No harm can ever befall a person who follows the path of metta.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For further reading:-</span></p>

              <p>Weychin,</p>
              <p>You say my words in other posts are irrelevant, now what is
                  this that is being posted above? Come on, if Ajahn Brahm is
                  visiting Singapore he will say in the Buddhist Society of
                  Western Australia we chant the metta sutra, we are anybody but
                  Christians, alright, even if we chant mantras or sutras or suttas
                  they hail from a sanskrit and pali dialect that has got its
                  written equivalents. Our chanting conveys innumerable meanings, so
                  while we barely fly into the skies these days with supernatural
                  powers like Devadatta once craved to impress others with amidst
                  his amassed wealth, we are sane people that takes aeroplanes
                  with visas, that take buses with ezlink cards. Look at Minister
                  Khaw the most famous buddhist, He takes an MRT when He has to take
                  one.</p>
              <p>The Karmapas are both younger than me, given their hectic
                  schedules do they have time to post such jibberish on your forum.
                  So now that Kong Hee's visa are being confiscated, which Karmapa is
                  visiting this year or next?</p>
              <p>Now, the Amaravati translation says that sentient beings can
                  finally be excused from being born in this world, if you go into
                  another translation, it says 'womb' instead of 'world'. In the
                  Republic of Singapore we have multiple courts at the City Hall area
                  because they serve a different purpose and hear a different trial.
                  What if I prefer Thanissaro's translation?</p>
              <p>=) We are going to have improved 'business' in the coming few
                  days, now if I bring in the Lotus Dharma Flower teaching even
                  Devadatta has his pureland sooner or later, are you listening to me
                  or do you think I should listen to you instead?</p>
              <p>Oh yes oh yes let's not forget about Vairocana Buddha.</p>
              <p>Gautama Buddha lived till 80, 'cftyu' are meant for those that
                  believe in religious candidates that die at 33 and left barely 100
                  books, for Buddhists that believe in religious candidates that die
                  at 80, we will never need to resort to 'ftdtghkmdfxk ghfd' because
                  we never run out of words in Asia.</p>
              <p>*If anybody hold Jewish views, I will post a Nazi Swastika
                  soon*</p>
              <p>I can also share more about what Goebbels felt about the Aryan
                  emblem.</p>
              <p>Because Buddhists do Om Mani Padme Hum instead of ''''''''''''''
                  or 'dkfogjxjk', get it clear please if anybody is

              <p>I am unable to determine whether your post are relevant or irrelevant, but rather I find them incoherent. Perhaps you would care to be more concise and to the point?!</p>
              <p>Interestingly, your style of writing reminds me of a bored protagonist in a japanese anime. Sort of like events screenshots occurring in the mean time while the character idling away.</p>
              <p>Also, as I am unwilling to impose my prejudice on your different events, I am unable to come to a conclusion with what you mean to express.</p>
