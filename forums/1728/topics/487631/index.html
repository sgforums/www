                                  life begins.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">--Amelia Barr, All the Days of My Life</p>
              <h1 style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: windowtext; font-weight: normal; '> </span></h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Where compassion is the wish that others not suffer,
                                  renunciation is the wish that I not suffer. What causes me to suffer? Wanting.
                                  Renunciation, then, means not so much giving up things, desires, or a way of
                                  life, but giving up desiring itself. But to do so is not so easy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">One way is to live with few wants or needs. When the pattern of wanting
                                  is not constantly stimulated by life circumstances, the mind becomes calm and
                                  clear, and in that clarity you find freedom from wanting. Such, in essence, is
                                  the monastic way: external renunciation creates an internal environment that
                                  leads to freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Most of us, however, live in circumstances that constantly stimulate
                                  desire: desire for security, desire for emotional fulfillment, and desire for
                                  identity. We need an internal approach to renunciation, and for that we need to
                                  understand the nature of these desires.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">One way we seek to satisfy the desire for security is by having—having a
                                  job, a bank account, a house, good looks, and so on. Yet a violent storm, a car
                                  accident, or an upheaval in the financial markets can eliminate in a moment
                                  what we regard as "mine." The fact of death shows us that even our
                                  life isn't ours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">As for emotional fulfillment, who hasn't felt a sense of disappointment,
                                  perhaps betrayal, in a close relationship when we see that our partner does not
                                  (and cannot) give us what we yearn for so deeply? The themes of love and
                                  disappointment that have inspired art, from Greek tragedies to modern pop
                                  songs, give eloquent testimony to the difficulty of satisfying emotional needs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Identity, too, is an ephemeral goal. Our star-studded culture pushes
                                  each of us to find out who we are and to take pride in being a unique entity.
                                  The sense of self, however, is a shaky ship. The more solid the identity, the
                                  more we feel a need to defend it. Even at the height of success, many of us
                                  experience a restlessness, a dissatisfaction, a need to do more, earn more, own
                                  more, or receive more recognition. It's as if a small voice still whispers,
                                  "I don't know who I am," and drives us relentlessly on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Why do we pursue these desires if they cannot be satisfied? The
                                  mechanism of desire is based on a belief: I am incomplete as I am now. Desire
                                  is misdirected yearning that tries to correct the imbalance created by that
                                  belief. The belief, in turn, is based on a misperception: I am separate from
                                  what I experience. We reach out to the world of experience, identify objects
                                  that sing the siren song of completion, and strive to get them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Renunciation begins with the recognition that these ventures cannot
                                  succeed: we are going to die, our emotional needs will never be met, and being
                                  "somebody" separates us from the world. Such recognition may be
                                  painful initially, yet it contains three keys that open the doors to freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The first key is to stop seeking security. Time and again I have seen
                                  students relax and open to the fullness of life when they understand and accept
                                  that there is no security and that they are going to die. They stop being
                                  obsessed with the look and feel of their bodies, the size of their bank
                                  accounts, or how they are going to survive. They let go of accepted criteria
                                  for success and failure and do what really interests them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Everything in life comes and goes like apparitions in a dream. Right
                                  now, take any object you "own": a flower, a book, a jacket, or a car.
                                  Look at it and know that you will experience this object for only a limited
                                  time, for a few hours, days, months, or years. Either it or you will fade,
                                  crumble, or die. When you forget this and take the object as something that is
                                  yours, you can't enjoy it for what it is. When you remember that you don't
                                  really own it, you are free to enjoy it while it is part of your life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The second key is to let go of expectations for emotional fulfillment.
                                  Personal relationships are always a challenge, and I have consistently found
                                  that when I stop wanting other people—friends, family members, or colleagues—to
                                  be who I want them to be for me, and accept them for who they are, things just
                                  go more easily, and relationships are clearer and richer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">For most of us, emotional needs are laid down early in life. They are
                                  solidified reactions to the disappointments encountered in growing up. And as
                                  adults, we spend our lives trying to get what we never got as children. But the
                                  past is past. You cannot go back. When you accept the resonance of these
                                  disappointments moment by moment and don't try to avoid them, you discover a
                                  freedom to enjoy love, affection, and companionship, even though it doesn't
                                  correspond precisely to what you (mistakenly) feel you need.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The third key is to know the groundlessness of experience itself: no one
                                  to be, nowhere to go. One student, who manages the legal department in a
                                  company, was concerned with how his employees perceived him and whether they
                                  were loyal to him. When he let go of those concerns and directed his energy
                                  into providing them with the resources they needed to work effectively, his
                                  department became a happier place to work, for everyone. Instead of trying to
                                  be someone, whether in your own eyes or in the eyes of another, recognize that
                                  you are not a thing, not an entity. What you are is a field of open, empty
                                  awareness and experience, like the sky and rainbows that appear in it. Without
                                  the burden of identity, you are free to respond naturally and appropriately to
                                  any situation you encounter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">"Well. That's all fine," you may say, "but how do I
                                  actually move from desire to renunciation?" You practice internal
                                  renunciation by moving into the experience of desire, instead of trying to
                                  fulfill or suppress it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Pick something you want: a physical object, a relationship, or some form
                                  of recognition. Let the feeling of desire arise. Experience how it arises in
                                  your body, feel all the emotions it triggers, and let all the stories it tells
                                  just be there. Don't be distracted. Don't try to control the experience. Don't
                                  work at anything. If you discover another level of yearning, move into that.
                                  When you move into the desire completely, a shift takes place and you know it
                                  as just an arising in experience. Now look at the object of your desire again.
                                  What has changed?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">By going into the experience of desire itself, rather than acting on it,
                                  you let go of the belief that you are incomplete. The energy of desire ceases
                                  to dictate behavior and, instead, fuels presence: being completely in the
                                  experience of what is, internally and externally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The chains of desire pull us into a life of frustration and suffering,
                                  while renunciation cuts those chains. Renunciation, though often understood to
                                  mean "giving up," is, more accurately, the willingness to experience
                                  things as they are, not as we want them to be. Here you discover true freedom,
                                  the deep, quiet joy that has always been present in you.</span></p>

              <p>As i understand do what you have to do,but without attachment as they say in Hinduism. Citing family or kids as impediments ain't good, they have their own Kar a and you as a caretaker probably has a few years to play in their lives ,much as your parents did. All the best.</p>
