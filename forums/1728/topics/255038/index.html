            <div class='col-md body'>wouldnt consider this as "dirt", rather it is a "fixation" how you react to the karma that is unraveling before you, whether this feels good or bad is irrelevant because both are considered as a form of suffering because you are unliberated</div>

Does this thought count as a "dirt" in my mind? </div></blockquote>Dear Beyond Religion ,<br><br>I thinking over the question that you imposed , would like to give my views (personal views) on this .<br><br>As a father of a child, we naturally want our children to grow up happily and live successful life .Thats the goal of every parents.But being a good parents also not a easy one .How not to get angry after a hard day's work and see children fighting each other angrily over toys.<br><br>the Buddhist teaching of equanmity is importance .<br>If we know our children have a certain kind of behaviour , we can counsel him ,but we do not use the cane , for this is negative education and using fear will never work .<br><br>We can tell him right and wrong .but we know the law of karma and countless rebirth in work .we just try our best .<br><br>I not here to condemn homosexuality ,but I hope as Parents ,one must put themselves in the heart of a timid children .the more harsh treatment ,the more the children will rebel, we may fail in our approach of "bring them to a happy life "<br><br>eventually our life is limited in this world .we shouldnt be  attached to force him down to an unhappy career path or even love life he should take .Because by forcing him , we are only giving him more unhappiness<br><br>My Shifu told me this , when u cane a child angrily , do you do it for his own good , and you will resume back to your usual loving character to your children ?<br><br>most of us get too carried away punishing children ,end up they become resentful and seek rebellion<br><br>I have no right to interfere in anyone family affairs ,but I sincerely would like to ask everyone , be it you are now father or u are still a child , to have a forgiving heart for things that happen .Life is always never rosy throughout ,<br>prick and thorns on the path make us grow stronger and setback matures us<br><br>for everyone info , I was not born in a happy family , since young I have alot of unhappiness<br><br>Buddhism taught me to forgive my parents for their harsh education of love<br><br>I hope that answer your question<br><br>Frankly this is the first time I talking abt family matters in a Buddhism forum<br>I must say this will be an imprint in my mind for years to come<br><br></div>
