              <p>Hi Pure Emptiness</p>
              <p>In the early, Buddhist context Buddha statue was used to represent Buddhism instead buddhism art was used such as Wheel, lotus, footprint, stupa and etc to symbolise  Buddha and its teaching. Of course, we understand <strong>Symbol</strong> as something such as an <a title="Entity" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Entity"><span style="color: #0645ad;">object</span></a>, <a title="Image" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Image"><span style="color: #0645ad;">picture</span></a>, written <a title="Word" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Word"><span style="color: #0645ad;">word</span></a>, <a title="Sound" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Sound"><span style="color: #0645ad;">sound</span></a>, or particular mark that represents something else by association, resemblance, or convention.</p>
              <p>Hence, to a Buddhist when one see a Buddha statue, it remind him about the goodness of the teacher and the quality of its teaching. However, to a non Buddhist it is just a piece of art made of procelain or some materials. In today context, a lot of Buddha statue, head or painting has been used in modern home even bar for decoration. I remember there used to a bar in Clark Quay with Big Buddha Statue in the entrance if I am not wrong it is called Buddha bar. </p>
              <p>Frankly, to me it is a nice piece of art, it look mystic under the lighting ambience. Well, did the people create bad karma by dancing in front of it. No one know. Because it might plant a potential Buddha seed in their life.</p>
              <p> However, when a statue is blessed then One need to treat its with respect. That's why in my Buddhist tradition, we had a Butsudan ä½›å£‡, where we kept the Buddha statue and ancestor tablet for our daily practice. When one has the luxury of space, we will keep the Butsudan door open. However, due to space contraint especially in our HDB, some people can only put the butsudan in the bedroom, out of respect we will keep the door shut, open it during our recitation practice. As the bedroom is an inconvenience place due to the tonne of personal activities that is carried out.  </p>
              <p>As for your relatives' statue, my view is one needs not worried about it since they are non Buddhist. Even if you mentioned to them that my Buddhist understanding say this and that. They will find your comment as weird. Beside, it is not your home, therefore one should not interferce with their deco affair for the sake of harmony. Perhaps, one can practice hard in our own life to show them the grace of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha through our thougthful action, words and deeds. Just as one can used the knife to kill a person, one also can use it to prepare lovely dishes for the love ones. You never know that the image of the statue seed imprinted in their mind might bloom someday to become something good perhaps this life or the future to come.</p>

              <p>It's said that even looking at a buddha painting with anger, It still plant a positive imprint in the mind.</p>
              <p>Even slandering buddha, burn sutra, break statues all plant good seeds. But still gt very bad karma lah but still plant seed.</p>
              <p>Maybe future can be buddhsit or gain enlightenment due to a seed.</p>
              <p>In unlimited life sutra, an old man said Namo Buddha when he met a tiger.</p>
              <p>He met buddha many many lifetimes after saying it. He later become an arhat due to the seed.</p>
