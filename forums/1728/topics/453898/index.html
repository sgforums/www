              <p>"Well, this is all great, but in VajrayÄ�na students are disempowered in 
                          all kinds of direct and indirect fashions which makes examining teachers
                           for proper qualities damn near impossible. Students are put in the 
                          catch-22 of comitting to lamas they do not know or missing out entirely 
                          because they do not trust the situation. For the most part, the cultural
                           hierarchies that Tibetan Buddhism is embedded within make it virtually 
                          impossible to for students, especially beginning students to have a 
                          clear picture of their teachers. These memes and hierarchies are also 
                          exploited by western teachers. And this is not merely a problem in 
                          VajrayÄ�na, this is also a problem in Zen. (In Theravada it is a little 
                          more clear since lay teachers are compartively rare and monastic 
                          precepts are highly valued.) The of course there is the <strong class="bbc">taboo again criticizing any lama from whom one has received transmission no matter how egregious their behavior has been</strong>.

                           there is enormous peer pressure within dysfunctional groups to regard

              <p>My comments:</p>
              <p>NOBODY, including lamas, gurus, rinpoches, zen masters, roshis, any 
                          funny-sounding-titles, beings you considered 'enlightened' etc, should 
                          be placed above scrutiny.<br> <br> I suspect Buddha would have been very disappointed if he were around, at
                           some of those posing as teachers while behaving in ways contrary to 
                          dharma, actions which clearly show that they have not abandoned 
                          afflictions.<br> <br> <br> No, merely having an enlightenment experience does not mean one has 
                          eliminated all afflictions. There are degrees of enlightenment, and 
                          degrees of liberation. And if a teacher claims (or hints) to have an 
                          enlightenment experience and continues to fuel his afflictions in mind, 
                          speech and action, that should not be defended merely because "he is 
                          enlightened and therefore all his actions are enlightened wisdom, his 
                          wanton womanizing is for tantric sex practice, his drinking is 
                          enlightened action, whatever" (what utter nonsense) as it is neither 
                          good for himself nor his/her students.<br> <br> To those who think "oh that enlightened dude is so freakin enlightened 
                          that he so transcends [insert vice]/[insert affliction] but continues to
                           do it coz its some crazy wisdom enlightened action tantric whatever", 
                          here is what the Buddha has to say:<br> <br> MN22: <span class="bbc_underline"><strong class="bbc">“Bhikkhus, that 
                          one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires, without 
                          perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire – that
                           is impossible.”</strong></span><br> <br> In other words, it is impossible for a person fully liberated from afflictions to continue indulging in sensual pleasures. Sometimes you just have to realize that so called "masters" may be just human like the others, with greed for $$$, sex, etc.<br> <br> <br> p.s. I still drink a little on rare occasions (maybe 1/10 of what I used
                           to drink, as I no longer do binge drinking like in the past), eat junk 
                          food sometimes, etc, but I do not defend my action as some noble acts, 
                          and do openly admit that this is something contrary to dharma. However I
                           have noticed that afflictions have generally decreased to a minimal 
                          through dharma practice, and this is something even my family members 
                          has noticed and told me (e.g. no longer have a temper, etc).</p>

              <p>However sometimes we can make a mistake... for example, sometimes a monk who talks to a female person intimately may sound very suspicious.</p>
              <p>Rather than thinking "that monk must have lust" or "that monk must be horny", its best to keep observing. Maybe the monk is just treating a newcomer nicely and explaining dharma. Maybe we are just misunderstanding.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>In looking for a root guru, as in  both Varjayana and modern context, it is difficult, unless it is a full time endeavour! The total offering of body, speech and mind, I feel, it taken now as on in an abstract manner. Such a true commitment  usually takes a lot of observation on the Guru before one take the leap of faith! The story of Milarepa and Marpa should provide some insight of this relatioship entails! The Root Guru is literally by the disciple to be taken as an embodiment of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha!</div>

              The difference I,ve noticed between the Chinese and Tibetan monks, is that most chinese monks show reserve, and a lot tibetan monks has a child like quality.

              <p>Assess the teacher properly first, take as much time as you wish. However, once you have received the kindness of his teachings/initiations/transmissions etc (esp in Vajrayana context), you should NEVER criticise and you should maintain respect for him/her.  Any negativities committed towards the Guru will only harm yourself greatly and will definitely land you in the lower realms.</p>
              <p>Gampopa said: If the Dharma is not practised properly, it will lead you to the lower realms.  </p>
              <p>We practise the Dharma to gain liberation and bliss.  It is not for the sake of creating sufferings. So don't use the Dharma to create negativities.</p>

There are degrees of enlightenment, and degrees of liberation. And if a teacher claims (or hints) to have an enlightenment experience and continues to fuel his afflictions in mind, speech and action, that should not be defended merely because "he is enlightened and therefore all his actions are enlightened wisdom, his wanton womanizing is for tantric sex practice, his drinking is enlightened action, whatever" (what utter nonsense) as it is neither good for himself nor his/her students.</span></em></span></p>

The Suttas as the earliest of the Buddha teachings are certainly the best references one can get, and in doubt one should always referred to them. </span></span></p>

To me the best original information can be found in the Pali Suttas. There are also structured courses available, such as that recently listed by AEN on this thread: </span><cite><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #666666; font-size: 14pt;    ' lang="EN-SG"><em>sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/259510</em></span></cite><span class="vshid1"><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 14pt;  " lang="EN-SG"><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aKmPhTqQq5AJ:sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/259510+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cached</span></a></span></span><span class="vshid1"><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 14pt;   " lang="EN-SG">.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; "></span></p>

              For example, samaya represents a contract between two people, a teacher 
              and a student. <strong>But the salient point is that it is a two way contract

              <p>But if you need to warn someone to prevent them from harm (e.g. sexual abuse, or whatever), keeping your mouth shut and letting the harm continue is also a bad thing. There must be right motivation and awareness of the consequences.</p>

              <p>I remember very clearly reading from Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, Namdrol's guru, that it is VERY BAD to criticise your Guru.   It stayed in my mind because Rinpoche emphasized it very strongly. Due to the many books there are, i can't locate the exact quote right now.  But this is very emphasized in the Vajrayana.  You will break your samaya if you criticise.  There are very severe karmic consequences.   Students who break their samayas also hurt their Gurus' life and activities.  </p>
              <p>Oh yes, i don't think samaya is just a social construct or contract. Haha... it is quite strange that people can think this way.</p>

There is no greater obstacle than this.</p>
              <p>If we don’t practice guru devotion, our minds will become like a rock, it can’t be moved or easily changed. Nothing we meditate on affects our mind…</p>

              <p>Disrespecting him is thus disrespecting all the Victorious Ones.</p>
              <p>What could have a heavier ripened aspect result than that?”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kalachakra Tantra states:</p>
              <p>“One destroys the merit accumulated over eons equal to the number of moments one feels angry at the virtuous friend / guru and for the same number of eons one experiences intense suffering in the hells and so on…”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Tantric Text Self-Arisen and Self-Manifested explains,</p>
              <p>“One should not go against the good advice; if one does, one will fall into a hell state. Criticizing the virtuous friend/guru or fabricating his faults is like having killed a hundred thousand ordained beings. It is only the cause of the Inexhaustible Suffering hell. Even if one thinks that the vajra master is bad-tempered, one has to suffer for sixty eons in Inexhaustible Suffering”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guhyasamaja Root Tantra states:</p>
              <p>“Those who have committed heavy negative karma</p>
              <p>Such as the five uninterrupted actions and so on,</p>
              <p>Can achieve the great ocean of Vajrayana, the sublime vehicle.</p>
              <p>But those who have scorned their guru from the heart</p>
              <p>Will achieve no success in their practice.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the root tantra Ornament of the Vajra Essence</p>
              <p>“For those who have criticized their master,</p>
              <p>Even if they practice tantra for thousands of eons</p>
              <p>By avoiding all sleep and distractions,</p>
              <p>It will be like attaining hell.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lama TsongKhapa, the second buddha said,</p>
              <p>“Without being careful at all in regard to despising your guru, if you then try very hard to do listening, reflecting and meditating, it will be like opening the door to the lower realms.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Essence of Nectar says,</p>
              <p>“If one is devoid of devotion for the sublime object, the guru,</p>
              <p>Qualities are not generated and those generated already will degenerate.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Fifty Verses of Guru Devotion,</p>
              <p>“The great fool who criticizes the vajra master will die from an epidemic, cold disease, a demon, a fever or poison. That person may be killed by a king, fire, poisonous snake, water, wrathful dakinis, thieves, spirits or malignant fiends. After being killed in one of these ways, he then goes to hell.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Vajrapani Empowerment Tantra states:</p>
              <p>Vajrapani once asked Guru Shakyamuni Buddha, “Bhagavan, what is the ripened aspect result of despising the guru?” This refers to criticizing or renouncing the guru.  Buddha replied, “Don’t ask me that Vajrapani. If i explained the shortcomings of having made mistakes in devotion to the virtuous friend/guru, all the devas and other worldly beings will be terrified. The bodhisattvas, who have great compassion for sentient beings, would vomit blood. But steel yourself, and i will tell you a little, O Lord of Secrets. The person who has made mistakes in devotion to the guru by having criticized him, renounced him and so forth will be born after this life in the hell realm that i have described for the person who has committed the five uninterrupted negative karmas.  He will abide there for infinite eons. Therefore , one should never belittle, criticize or give up the vajra master.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thirteenth Dalai Lama explained,</p>
              <p>“Even eating or drinking with someone who has broken samaya with one of your gurus causes you to go to the lower realms. The pollution degenerates your mind and causes you to be reborn in the lower realms.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Serkong Dorje Chang said,</p>
              <p>“Even drinking water from the same valley where there is a fellow disciple who has scorned your own guru causes you to be born in the hells.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The result of disrespecting the virtuous teacher is that in all future lifetimes we will not find a virtuous teacher, so we will not hear the holy Dharma. Not meeting a virtuous friend in the future is experiencing the result similar to the cause of having disrespected or made mistakes in relation to the virtuous friend. In life after life, we will be born in places where there is no freedom to practice Dharma, where we will not meet a virtuous friend. As we don’t meet a virtuous friend, we don’t meet the Dharma.</p>

              <p>6. Sixth Major Precept</p>
              <p>On Broadcasting the Faults of the Assembly<br>A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the offenses of the assembly.</p>
              <p>As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana.</p>
              <p><strong>If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly, he commits a Parajika offense</strong>. (31)</p>

              <p> remember very clearly reading from Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche,
                                  Namdrol's guru, that it is VERY BAD to criticise your Guru.  
                                  It stayed in my mind because Rinpoche emphasized it very strongly.
                                  Due to the many books there are, i can't locate the exact quote
                                  right now.  But this is very emphasized in the Vajrayana.
                                   You will break your samaya if you criticise.  There are
                                  very severe karmic consequences.   Students who break their
                                  samayas also hurt their Gurus' life and activities.  </p>
              <p>Oh yes, i don't think samaya is just a social construct or
                                  contract. Haha... it is quite strange that people can think this

              <p>Of course, it is very bad to criticize your guru in normal circumstances. But if the "Guru" is sexually abusing people etc, what do you do? If you need to criticize him *for the right motivation: to protect others*, I say do it. As stated, <em><br>"Guru" is a role, not a person. The role as certain obligations, 
              just as the role "student" has certain obligations. The sooner people 
              sort this out, the better. </em></p>
              <p>Of course, this does not give us license to criticize the "guru"'s every perceived mistake etc. Most of the time, for all those minor stuff, we are better to mind our own business. But every now and then, if some so called "guru" comes to bring great harm to others, then something must be done to stop the harm from continuing unchecked.</p>

              <p>I think this is a key point. And it illustrates a huge problem with how Tibetan Buddhist structures function in the west.<br><br>We
               are often treated at best as placeholders for the teachings until the 
              next generation of Tibetans come of age and at worst we are expected to 
              be serfs with American dollars and a good exchange rate.<br><br>When 
              Tibetan teachers are busted sexually abusing or ripping off their 
              American students its called crazy wisdom or they just get a free pass. 
              When an American teacher does this kind of thing they are excommunicated
               and publicly ruined and turned into an example of how "we arent ready" 
              to be real holders of the lineage. <br>Its feudalism and racism, nothing more.</p>

              <p>Here is what The Dalai Lama has to say:</p>
              <p><strong><em>‘Criticize openly,’</em> His Holiness declared. <em>‘That’s  the only 
              way. If there is incontrovertible evidence of wrongdoing,  teachers 
              should be confronted with it. They should be allowed to admit  their 
              wrongs, make amends, and undergo a rehabilitation process. If a  teacher
               won’t respond, students should publish the situation in a  newspaper, 
              not omitting the teacher’s name,”</em> His Holiness said. <em>“The fact that the teacher may have done many other good things should not keep us silent.” </em>Again, in 2001, when answering a similar question, he advised potential converts to check a guru’s qualifications carefully; <em>‘The best thing is,</em>‘ the Dalai Lama said, <em>‘whenever exploitation, sexual abuse or money abuse happen, make them public.’</em></strong></p>

              <p>By the way, like in ANY scenarios... one must never give rise to a mind of hate or negativity. I.e. even to the lama who abused you etc. This goes to anyone, not just to a lama. A person who has this hatred will likely go to lower realms regardless of who he is dealing with - whether with a true vajra master, fake vajra master or just an ordinary person like your boss or your friend.</p>
              <p>So if you want to criticize or whatever it must be done out of right circumstance, right motivation and compassion, never a negative mind.</p>
              <p>This is what the Buddha said in the suttas:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Even were bandits savagely to sever you limb from limb with a 
                  two-handled saw, he who entertaineth hate on that account in his heart 
                  would not be one who carried out my teaching.</em></p>

              Through the interesting discussions, there are points I come to have realised. 
              1) The word "criticism", negativity which comes with disillusionment with the Guru, the institution of teacher/student relationship and Tibetan Buddhism and Buddhism in general.The venom which have you may observed in a particular monotheistic religion, where former believers carry their anger and negativity continually which they are not able to get out off!
              2) If you've made a report against a misconduct of your teacher, you've made an accusation which may or may not be found true until thoroughly investigated. The issue can dealt as a matter of factedly, without additional fanfare! An accusation without undue criticism!
              However, it is not easy be disillusioned if you're the victim, wallowing both in guilt and anger of allowing yourself to be exploited, viewing Buddhism in negativity, effectively ending one's positive affinity with Buddhism and may end slandering  or badmouthing whenever the opportunity arises!
