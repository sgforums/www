              <p class="bodytext">In general when we practice the dharma and we commit ourselves to accomplishing positive actions we encounter obstacles and difficulties. This is due to the fact that our minds are laden with emotions. Of these negative emotions, the main one is pride which leads us to feel contempt for others (due to an over-estimation of oneself: I am the best, the strongest, etc). The existence of pride automatically gives rise to jealousy, hatred, or anger. With pride as its underlying cause, the emotion of anger creates the most powerful effects. This is because it leads us to carry out all kinds of seriously negative actions that will bring about future rebirths in the lower realms.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">In Western societies, the distinction between pride and firmness of mind is often confused. A lack of pride is construed to be a weakness. Pride is a built-up and concentrated form of ego grasping. So in this respect, it is a weakness. A person can have great strength of character, and a strong resolve to achieve a goal, such as enlightenment, for example, without pride ever manifesting.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">We need to dissociate pride -- the affirmation of our own supremacy over others which suggests a certain blindness -- from firmness of mind that is a quality free of all the negative aspects of pride. In the same way we often have a distorted view which equates humility with a weakness of character. What we really need is courage and strength of character, without developing pride.</p>
              <h2>Mental calm and stability</h2>
              <p class="bodytext">The meditation on love and compassion goes hand in hand with the cultivation of mental stability. Indeed, with respect to pride and anger, it is difficult for the beginner to give up these emotions straight away. Until we are able to do this we need to practice mental calm in conjunction with the meditation on love and compassion. This is the very essence of <em>Shi'nay</em> meditation.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">For example we can examine the mental image or concept of anger. Think of a person who appears unpleasant to you, someone whom you regard as your enemy. If you do not have an enemy, try to think of a person who can make you angry. Once you actually feel the anger, do not act it out, as you may end up hurting someone. Instead, try to relate to the anger as a type of thought and try to see what it looks like and where it comes from? Does it come from the person or from yourself? If you think it comes from the mind, where does it arise from, how does it remain, and where does it go when it disappears? In this way one takes the anger itself as the object of meditation and reflection.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">From time to time, you can practice a method of exchanging roles. Once you feel really angry with someone, you can put yourself in that person's place. For example, I am Shamar Rimpoche. I am angry with you. Then I imagine that I am you. In this way, I adopt a different viewpoint, your viewpoint. The same exchange can be applied to the emotions of jealousy and pride. This is a form of <em>Shi'nay</em> (the pacification of the mind). By observing the strong emotional state of anger and then a peaceful state of mind, you will come to observe the nature of mind itself. This is the superior form of insight which we call <em>Lhaktong</em>. If you can apply this method for all of the disturbing emotions, then it will be extremely beneficial for you.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">If there are many thoughts in the mind and you manage to pacify them with this method, this is excellent. However when the emotions are so strong that we cannot control them, we need to stabilize the mind by focusing on our breathing. Concentrating on the in-and- out breaths in this case is more effective.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Many people often take this meditation to be a breathing exercise. In fact, the important point here is not in the breathing but in composing the mind, through being constantly aware of the in-and-out breaths without being distracted. The main point is really this concentration itself, this mental stability. Some people think that the physical aspect of the practice is significant, but this is not the case. What is essential is our familiarity with the practice. The success of meditations such as <em>Shi'nay</em> and <em>Lhaktong</em> does not depend on the conceptualization of these meditative states. Rather, the essence of these practices is in our becoming accustomed to the meditation process itself. We have to differentiate between <em>Gompa</em> which means to conceive and <em>Sgompa</em> which means to meditate, to train oneself or to become familiar.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">The correct conception and understanding arises from meditation and familiarization with the practice. Therefore, the meditation itself must be established on very precise foundations. In order to obtain the state of a Buddha, we have to turn away radically from becoming, in other words from all the forms of worldly happiness associated with the different realms. One might, for example, aim to achieve a relative happiness in a higher state of existence, or to be free from the sufferings of the lower realms. One might aspire to acquire the peaceful state of the Shravakas where there is no possibility of benefiting others. However it is only in the ultimate state of enlightenment that the real power and capacity to act for the benefit of others can be found.</p>
              <h2>Love and compassion - Relative level</h2>
              <p class="bodytext">The remedy for an attachment to the happiness of becoming is to reflect on impermanence and the "four fundamental thoughts which turn the mind away from the cycle of existences." As our attachments start to weaken, we may experience a certain peace in our mind. Grasping, or clinging to this mental state of calm may then arise. The remedy for grasping on to this peaceful state is to meditate on altruistic love and compassion. We should develop love and compassion within us until they have become completely natural attitudes for us. Love and compassion are qualities that will accompany us throughout our entire spiritual progression: from the moment we first give rise to the enlightened attitude right up until we achieve Buddhahood itself. This enlightenment will then be endowed with the body, speech, mind and qualities of a Buddha.<br>Through the power of love and compassion, all unfavourable conditions, the disturbing emotions, <em>samsara</em> and its causes will be destroyed and completely annihilated. Without love and compassion, we simply do not have enough energy. Even while we remain trapped in this prison of <em>samsara</em>, subjected to the influences of the emotions and karma, the qualities of love and compassion allow us to be guided in the right direction.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">This love and compassion has an object which is all beings. By beings, we do not simply mean those who are around us -- humans. Anything that possesses a mind is a being. And where there is a being, there is suffering. Just as we have a mind and through this we experience suffering, the same goes for all other types of beings. Here, we must distinguish between that which is living and that which has a mind. A living thing does not necessarily have a mind. But where there is mind, there is consciousness, and there is life. There are all kinds of beings, some which are very small like the insects. A common misconception is to attribute consciousness only to beings of a certain size. We often associate the existence of consciousness first with a certain degree of intelligence and then to a certain size. In this way, scientists and certain schools of philosophical thought are reluctant to acknowledge that smaller animals, insects, or tiny marine life possess a consciousness similar to ours even though they recognize that some larger sea dwellers such as dolphins do have consciousness.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">In fact, even the tiniest and most miniscule of insects seeks pleasure and fears suffering. If we try to touch the fin of a small fish, its initial reaction is to move away. If it is tamed, then it may recognize the hand that feeds it to be a source of satisfaction. It will then approach the hand quite simply because, in the same way as humans, it seeks a state of well being and flees suffering.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Beings have various sizes, but the mind is not proportional to the physical appearance. The degree of suffering or happiness depends on individual karma. The same mind can reincarnate in a tiny feeble body, or in the body of a whale, or as a king endowed with a higher faculty of mind than that of an animal. However, size does not have any bearing on the quality or power of the mind. <br>Therefore, all beings, without any exception, should be the object of our love and compassion. Cultivate the same attitude for all beings as you would feel for your father, mother, or those whom you love the most. In traditional cultures, particularly in the East, family ties are extremely strong. The father and the mother are the people whom one reveres the most, and the idea of any harm coming to them is unbearable. For this reason, when we meditate on the enlightened attitude, we take this example considering all beings as our parents.<br>In the West, esteem for parents does not have the same intensity. But this difference does not matter for the meditation. Simply use someone whom you love the most and consider all beings as that person.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Of course, it is not possible for us to develop this love and compassion for each being individually. But we can regard all beings collectively as one entity and meditate on the fact that they, too, wish to have happiness with the same fervor as we do. We develop this intense wish for their happiness by putting ourselves in their place. However, be careful not to make the wish into a fixation or attachment. Rather, concentrate on what beings have to go through. We must then continue to maintain the mind in this aspiration for their happiness while applying the same contemplation of its essence as was previously mentioned for the emotions such as anger, pride and jealousy.</p>
              <h2>Love and compassion - Ultimate level</h2>
              <p class="bodytext">This love for all beings is, in the beginning, an artificial and fabricated attitude. We do not really feel it automatically. By training ourselves, it will develop gradually, and sooner or later this impartial love towards all beings will become a natural feeling. Right now, when we feel love for one or several beings, very often, this love is partial because it is selective, and it comes from our attachment. When we talk of spiritual love, this is not a partial and exclusive attitude, but it is founded in the nature of mind which is emptiness. It is from emptiness that everything manifests.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">We meditate on love; its nature is emptiness, non-existence. The object of this love (i.e. beings) is also empty in nature from the ultimate point of view. However, its relative nature does exist; it arises without contradicting its essence. If it were different and the existence of an intrinsic ultimate reality were enough in itself; it would not enable relative phenomena to manifest. If a dream were real, it could not take place in the space of the mind. If the dream’s essence does not have an empty mirror-like quality, images cannot be reflected in it. Thus, the nature of beings’ confusion is emptiness. Otherwise, how could it appear, if it was exclusively solid, and material?</p>
              <p class="bodytext">Although this contemplation of Bodhicitta’s ultimate nature is something that one must realize; this comes later on. In the beginning, it is advisable to cultivate mainly the relative aspect of love and compassion, in order to progress afterwards into a recognition of emptiness or ultimate Bodhicitta. Parallel to this meditation on ultimate Bodhicitta, a profound understanding will develop. If one meditates on love by means of emptiness, it becomes a superior love. Not only that, but at the same time, while meditating on the nature of love, we will achieve a stable pacification of mind (<em>Shi'nay</em>), and simultaneously the force of our positivity will increase. By constantly recollecting the enlightened attitude, we will be able to create a source of considerable benefit for others. Through the <em>samadhi</em> (complete absorption) of love, we will penetrate the ultimate and authentic benefit. Our mind will be united with the unchanging ultimate reality so that our consciousness will no longer be inhabited by anything other than love for all beings. It will never be separated from this.</p>
              <p class="bodytext">By the force of our meditation, our love for beings will be like the mother hen's love for her chicks. This process will develop itself by its own nature, until it embraces all beings in the state of enlightenment. Gradually we will gain the capacity to be beneficial towards an increasing number of beings. This has nothing to do with telepathy or any particular intention, as if we were sending energy waves to help those who are inferior to us. But spontaneously, beneficial and positive activities will arise through the force of virtue. The power of this meditation is so strong that it has the ability to spread to others. This love extends outwards and radiates, and is born in the minds of other beings, particularly in small animals such as birds.</p>

              <p> </p>No actually, meditating on love and compassion doesn't lead to liberation from 6 realms. It is part of the 4 brahma viharas, which creates good karma and leads to rebirth in higher realms. All religions teach these 4 brahma viharas which include love and compassion, but they do not teach how to gain liberation from 6 realms.
              
              To be liberated you have to practice insight meditation.

              <p><br>Hi Amitayus48,</p>
              <p>Actually i think u already know this, but just sharing...</p>
              <p>All dharmas end up in egolessness, even ultimate compassion becomes egolessness... when one has egolessness, there will also be love and compassion.  Liberation from samsara depends on realisation of egolessness.</p>
              <p>While on the path, it is very important to work on cultivating compassion as it is the main cause to help sentient beings in future. It is said in the Mahayana path that bodhichitta is the main cause of Buddhahood. You can't have Bodhichitta without compassion.  Which shows that in order to attain complete liberation of Buddhahood, compassion is indispensable.</p>
              <p>In short, one has to make effort on both compassion and the wisdom of emptiness.  If one is lopsided in one's efforts, tending towards only one side, it has been said by past masters that it is like a bird trying to fly with just one wing... In the Tibetan tradition, which has produced countless realised beings in the past, like 100,000 masters who accomplished rainbow bodies in Kathog etc, and countless others,  there has always been great emphasis placed on compassion as a path. </p>
              <p>Compassion is also a great enhancing factor for one's cultivation of insight meditation because of the openness of mind state it induces etc.</p>

              i heard, of the 6 or 10 paramitas that the bodhisattvas practice, some could be better in Generosity, some in Morality, some in Patience, some in Effort, some in Concentration, some in Insight. 
              
              
              
              Each of the six paramitas is an enlightened quality of the heart, a glorious virtue or attribute the innate seed of perfect realization within us. 
              
              http://www.naljorprisondharmaservice.org/pdf/SixParamitas.htm
              
              They can be better in one/some of them, like Guan Yin which is better in Unconditional Compassion, while Majushiri is better in Insight etc. though this does not mean they do not have the rest of the paramitas. i got friends also like that, some are more affinity toward Effort, some toward Generosity, some toward morality. i'm more toward Insight. but don't worry, continue on what you are best at. As in the end when you are Awaken to that one you practice very Well, you'll be Awaken to all the paramitas. It's like our hand, the fingers are link back to the palm. All the paramitas are one all together in the root. that's also why i think how the dull Culapanthaka practice Concentration/Effort and finally become Awaken to everything including Insight. if one is not Awaken to all, that mean he/she did not practice "deep" or good enough.

              <p>i heard, of the 6 or 10 paramitas that the bodhisattvas practice, some could be better in Generosity, some in Morality, some in Patience, some in Effort, some in Concentration, some in Insight.</p>
              <p>Each of the six paramitas is an enlightened quality of the heart, a glorious virtue or attribute the innate seed of perfect realization within us.</p>

              <p>They can be better in one/some of them, like Guan Yin which is better in Unconditional Compassion, while Majushiri is better in Insight etc. though this does not mean they do not have the rest of the paramitas. i got friends also like that, some are more affinity toward Effort, some toward Generosity, some toward morality. i’m more toward Insight. but don’t worry, continue on what you are best at. As in the end when you are Awaken to that one you practice very Well, you’ll be Awaken to all the paramitas. It’s like our hand, the fingers are link back to the palm. All the paramitas are one all together in the root. that’s also why i think how the dull Culapanthaka practice Concentration/Effort and finally become Awaken to everything including Insight. if one is not Awaken to all, that mean he/she did not practice “deep” or good enough.</p>

              <p>Hi Sinweiy,</p>
              <p>Yes u r right. I have also heard from a master that some bodhisattva concentrate on compassion first, some on insight first.  Personally, i think very impt to first stabilise the mind using Shamatha meditation...</p>
              <p>Compassion helps your insight practice. And it is the motivation for insight practice. You want to get realisation for what?... so that you can reach a state of being able to liberate other beings too.  If just for yourself, then it is the Arhat path.  But already the Arhats are so filled with compassion and love that sometimes, i can't really imagine the extent of compassion a Bodhisattva possesses.</p>
              <p>In the Vajrayana, there are techniques for actualising very high realisations very quickly. However, in the time of Lama Atisha, there was a yogi who was practising a technique that could have given him at least realisations on the bodhisattva bhumis, if not Buddhahood, but then Lama Atisha (himself a great Indian master) said that due to his lack of bodhichitta, this yogi ended up attaining the fruit of stream-entry only which was quite sad... from the POV of what he could have achieved.</p>
              <p>Note that this is not to say that stream-entry is not a worthy attainment.... it is a great attainment too!  But this story goes to show the importance of Bodhichitta motivation.</p>

              <p>Thanks wisdomeye for your info. btw i jus heard from MCK explaining a stanza from Infinity Life Sutra saying that all path include Shamatha in some way, those path that do not have Shamatha is not Buddha's path.

              <p>I agree having insight doesn't mean you have samadhi.</p>
              <p>Btw, the insight I'm talking about is the experiential (non conceptual) insight into one's true nature... a direct touch of one's buddha nature. It is not very difficult to have a direct glimpse through meditation or other practice, but to be able to abide 24/7 in one's true nature is not so easy.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Beautiful951,</p>
              <p>The meditation of love and compassion is based on concepts. There is still the notion of you and others and the act of love /compassion.  It is a way to transform thoughts into a positive force and to eradicate the grosser levels of mental defilements like anger and desire/attachment... because at the beginning, it is not possible to just be thought-free, or see into the nature of thoughts...</p>
              <p>The insight meditation goes beyond concepts.  It is about a unconditional state that is not affected by thoughts whether positve or negative. One could say one is going into the nature of thoughts instead of just dwelling on the contents of thoughts.</p>
              <p>In general, meditation on love/compassion makes the mind conducive for insight meditation. It is much needed (my observation) for people nowadays because it is the fastest way to do away with the grosser defilements, before one goes into insight meditation to remove the more subtle defilements.</p>
              <p>It is ultimately insight meditation that brings liberation.  The ultimate aim is egolessness and emptiness realisation.  But compassion/love meditation is vital in that it produces the merits/positive causes that help one to achieve the rupa/form kayas of the ultimate state of liberation in Buddhahood, while the insight meditation brings one to a realisation of the dharmakaya. </p>
              <p>The aspects of Buddha are the Dharmakaya and the Rupakayas.. it is necessary to develop the causes for all these resultant states and both insight and compassion training are therefore complementary and much needed on the path.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Thanks AnEternalNow and WisdomEye.</p>
              <p>I have always been a rather private person and I hope to know if I could learn insight meditation without a teacher, is it possible?</p>

              <p><br>I think the privacy issue can be overcome quite easily if you really wish to learn. You can arrange for private visits with a teacher. Doesn't have to be in front of a crowd of people. Learning from a live person is much more advisable. I don't recommend that people meditate without guidance.</p>
              <p>You could start with chanting as a practice first.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion...</p>
