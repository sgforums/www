              years and is most widely known, perhaps, for his famous introductory ten-day
              intensive courses, which are held free of charge in centers all around the
              world, supported by student donations. </em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Born in Mandalay, Burma in 1924, he was trained by the renowned
              Vipassana teacher Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899-1971). After fourteen years of
              training, he retired from his life as a successful businessman to devote
              himself to teaching meditation. Today he oversees an organization of more than
              eighty meditation centers worldwide and has had remarkable success in bringing
              meditation into prisons, first in India, and then in numerous other countries.
              The organization estimates that as many as 10,000 prisoners, as well as many
              members of the police and military, have attended the ten-day courses. </span></em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>

              Summit at the United Nations. He was interviewed there by </span></em><strong><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Helen Tworkov</span></em></strong><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>.</span></em><em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '><br> <br> </span></em><strong><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>According to some people, Vipassana is a particular meditation practice
              of the Theravada School; for others, it is a lineage of its own. How do you use
              the term?</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This is a lineage, but it is a lineage that has nothing to do with any
              sect. To me, Buddha never established a sect. When I met my teacher, Sayagyi U
              Ba Khin, he simply asked me a few questions. He asked me if, as a Hindu leader,
              I had any objection towards sila, that is, morality. How can there be any
              objection? But how can you practice sila unless you have control of the mind?
              He said, I will teach you to practice sila with controlled mind. I will teach
              you samadhi, concentration. Any objection? What can be objected to in samadhi?
              Then he said, that alone will not help—that will purify your mind at the
              surface level. Deep inside there are complexes, there are habit patterns, which
              are not broken by samadhi. I will teach you prajna, wisdom, insight, which will
              take you to the depth of the mind. I will teach you to go to the depth of the
              mind, the source where the impurities start and they get multiplied and they
              get stored so that you can clear them out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So when my teacher told me: I will teach you only these three—sila,
              samadhi and prajna—and nothing else, I was affected. I said, let me try.<br> <br> <strong>How
              is sila generated by watching the mind?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When I began to learn Vipassana meditation, I became convinced that
              Buddha was a not a founder of religion, he was a super-scientist. A spiritual
              super-scientist. When he teaches morality, the point is, of course, there that
              we are human beings, living in human society, and we should not do anything
              which would harm the society. It’s quite true. But then—and it’s as a scientist
              he’s talking here—he says that when you harm anybody, when you perform any
              unwholesome action, you are the first victim. You first harm yourself and then
              you harm others. As soon as a defilement arises in the mind, your nature is
              such that you feel miserable. That is what Vipassana teaches me.<br> <br> <strong>So
              if you can see that mental defilement is causing anxiety and pain for yourself,
              that is the beginning of sila and of compassion?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If you can change that to compassion, then another reality becomes so
              clear. If instead of generating anger or hatred or passion or fear or ego, I
              generate love, compassion, goodwill, then nature starts rewarding me. I feel so
              peaceful, so much harmony within me. It is such that when I defile my mind I
              get punishment then and there, and when I purify my mind I get a reward then
              and there.<br> <br> <strong>What
              happens during a ten-day Vipassana course?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The whole process is one of total realization, the process of self-realization,
              truth pertaining to oneself, by oneself, within oneself. It is not an
              intellectual game. It is not an emotional or devotional game: “Oh, Buddha said
              such and such . . . so wonderful . . . I must accept.” It is pure science. I
              must understand what’s happening within me, what’s the truth within me. We
              start with breath. It looks like a physical concept, the breath moving in and
              moving out. It is true. But on the deeper level the breath is strongly
              connected to mind, to mental impurities. While we’re meditating, and we’re
              observing the breath, the mind starts wandering—some memory of the past, some
              thoughts of the future—immediately what we notice is that the breath has lost
              its normality: it might be slightly hard, slightly fast. And as soon as that
              impurity is gone away it is normal again. That means the breath is strongly
              connected to the mind, and not only mind but mental impurities. So we are here
              to experiment, to explore what is happening within us. At a deeper level, one
              finds that mind is affecting the body at the sensation level.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This causes another big discovery—that you are not reacting to an
              outside object. Say I hear a sound and I find that it is some kind of praise
              for me; or I find someone abusing me, I get angry. You are reacting to the
              words at the apparent level, yes, true. You are reacting. But Buddha says you
              are actually reacting to the sensations, body sensations. That when you feel
              body sensation and you are ignorant, then you keep on defiling your mind by
              craving or by aversion, by greed or by hatred or anger. Because you don’t know
              what’s happening.<br> <br> <strong>When
              you hear praise or abuse, is the response filtered through the psychological
              mind to the bodily sensations, or is it simultaneous?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is one after the other, but so quick that you can’t separate them. So
              quick! At some point automatically you can start realizing, “Look what’s
              happening! I have generated anger.” And the Vipassana meditator will
              immediately say, “Oh, a lot of hate! There is a lot of hate in the body,
              palpitation is increased Oh, miserable. I feel miserable.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If you are not working with the body sensations, then you are working
              only at the intellectual level. You might say, “Anger is not good,” or “Lust is
              not good,” or “Fear is not—.” All of this is intellectual, moral teachings
              heard in childhood. Wonderful. They help.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>But when you practice, you understand why they’re not good. Not only do
              I harm others by generating these defilements of anger or passion or fear or
              evil, I harm myself also, simultaneously.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Vipassana is observing the truth. With the breath I am observing the
              truth at the surface level, at the crust level. This takes me to the subtler,
              subtler, subtler levels. Within three days the mind becomes so sharp, because
              you are observing the truth. It’s not imagination. Not philosophy or thinking.
              Truth, breath, truth as breath, deep or shallow. The mind becomes so sharp that
              in the area around the nostrils, you start feeling some biochemical reaction
              that means some physical sensation. This is always there throughout the body,
              but the mind was so gross it was feeling only very gross sensations like pain
              or such. But otherwise there are so many sensations which the mind is not
              capable to feel.<br> <br> <strong>Can
              you say something about the generation of wisdom? Is insight the same as
              wisdom?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Same same same! Insight is not trying to understand the reality within
              myself merely at the intellectual level, but I understand it now at the
              experiential level. For anybody who admires Buddha’s teaching—that everything
              is impermanent, changing—this is at the intellectual level. Yes, everything’s
              changing. Nothing is permanent. Quite true. But that doesn’t help. When I
              practice Vipassana, I start with sensation: Look, sensation arises, seems to
              stay for some time but passes, is not eternal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And after four, five, six days, the sensations get dissolved. There is
              no more solidity in the entire body. Mere vibration, very subtle vibration. So
              this impermanence is now experience. What is the purpose of reacting to
              something when it is changing so quickly? What is the purpose of reacting with
              craving or clinging? It passes away. Or hatred: it passes away. People who are
              very angry, or are full of lust, full of fear or full of depression or full of
              ego—when they keep on observing their sensations, the whole habit pattern
              changes.<br> <br> <strong>Does
              the object of awareness ever disappear so that there’s only awareness of
              awareness itself?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Exactly. But when I say I am aware of this object, and “I” is there, “I”
              am aware of this. This is a duality. Slowly as you proceed, “I” goes away.
              Things are just happening, and the knowing part knows. That’s all.<br> <br> <strong>Is
              that the same as what some teachers call “bare attention”?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Yes, this is bare attention.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When there’s no object.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The object keeps on changing. What is the object this moment may not be
              the object the next moment. So whatever manifests itself from moment to moment,
              there is clarity. And there awareness means you are not reacting to it. Say the
              object, the sensation, is very pleasant. The old habit pattern was that when we
              feel this sensation we react with, “Ah, Wonderful! I must continue—this must be
              retained.” Then this is not bare awareness. But if you keep on, just awareness,
              let me see what happens, it changes. You are just observing the changing nature
              of the sensations. This sensation or that sensation, makes no difference.<br> <br> <strong>Do
              you move to a place where there’s absolutely no self-consciousness of the
              awareness?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>That is a very high stage, the nirvanic stage. As long as we are in the
              field of mind and matter, sensation is bound to be there. But sensations will
              become subtler and subtler.<br> <br> <strong>Is
              it possible to transcend awareness itself?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Certainly. But that takes time. If you keep on thinking about this, it
              will be imagination. No imagination is allowed in the whole technique. Be with
              the present moment as it is. Otherwise you will be thinking: Nirvana, nirvana
              is like this, I must—You haven’t experienced nirvana. You’ve heard about
              nirvana, you’ve intellectualized about nirvana, you’ve emotionalized about
              nirvana. You don’t know what nirvana is. So let it come. Every moment is
              nirvana for you. Whatever is arising you are observing it—now it is passing
              away, now it arises. Bare awareness. That will take you to the stage where
              there is no more sensation, that is beyond mind and matter. Sensations come
              where there is mind and matter. And where there is no mind and matter there is
              no horizon, no passing, no sensation. But we can’t imagine it. The moment you
              start imagining, then it becomes a philosophy.<br> <br> <strong>Do
              you understand this practice to be the essence of Buddha’s teaching?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Yes. If proper attention is not given to the sensations, then we are not
              going to the deepest levels of the mind. The deepest level of the mind,
              according to Buddha, is constantly in contact with body sensations. And you
              find this by experience.<br> <br> <strong>What
              is your role as the teacher?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A teacher, out of compassion and love, seeing that somebody is
              suffering, gives a path. But each individual has to walk on the path. There is
              no magical miracle with the teacher. Totally out of the question. He only shows
              the path. That is the only role of the teacher, nothing else.<br> <br> <strong>You’ve
              built this worldwide organization, and it seems that you don’t have a
              successor.</strong> So many are coming up, and to appoint somebody a
              successor will disturb the purity. Buddha never appointed anybody as a
              successor. Who am I to appoint? All these five hundred or six hundred teachers
              whom I have trained, they will carry on. If I am not there they will still
              carry on. Not because they have faith in the teacher—they have faith in the
              technique, which gives them results. That’s all that will remain. Otherwise
              they think so long as guru is there you get all of the benefits—guru is no
              more, it is gone: That is a personality cult. The technique is so great. It
              will survive. Don’t worry [laughs]. I am very confident. It will survive.<br> <br> <strong>I
              wanted to ask you about criticisms in this country, specifically about your
              organization’s reported refusal to allow homosexuals to participate in advanced
              retreats.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I don’t know how somebody started this talk, which is, I can say very
              confidently, totally wrong. We have no discrimination of any kind with anybody.
              It is totally out of the question. But of course when you go for deeper
              courses—twenty-day course, thirty-day course, forty-day course—it is a really
              deep operation of the mind, surgical operation of the mind. Deep-rooted
              complexes start coming to the surface, so every student must have the facility
              of privacy, a place to be without getting attracted to the object of passion.
              If somebody has got passion, and the object of passion is all the time there,
              then it might create a few difficulties. It has created difficulties sometimes
              even in ten-day courses. You have to be very careful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I don’t know how this wrong thing started. There are teachers who are
              lesbians and homosexuals in this country and in Europe. Where there are
              facilities I teach them. When they go to a center where there’s not much
              facility and they say, I was refused there, so they write letters and say something
              bad about the teaching. They can’t understand. What about the facilities we are
              giving them? Just because one or two started complaining because they were
              refused—and there are other reasons also for refusing. I have refused those who
              are not homosexuals, who are not lesbians. Because at present this person is
              not fit for such deep operation. Even multi-millionaires, even there is one
              billionaire who is pressing hard to take a long course. I don’t give it to him.
              I say, No, you are not fit yet.<br> <br> <strong>There
              has been some concern that the idea of not allowing these people into long
              courses is that they would act inappropriately.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>No, no, no! Anybody can act in a wrong way. If we separate people it is
              for their good, not for segregation, or denouncing them, saying: “Oh you’re not
              good, so I keep you separate.” It is for everyone!<br> <br> <strong>Is
              it true that homosexuals have to renounce their sexual orientation in order to
              take the longer courses?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Totally wrong. Of course we examine every person whether lesbian or
              not-lesbian, homosexual or not. If you are still a bundle of lust and you can’t
              control yourself so you can’t do a deeper operation of the mind, wait a little,
              take a few more courses. That is what we tell everybody. Not because someone is
              a homosexual.<br> <br> <strong>In
              this country now, traditional practices—like segregating men and women, or
              variations on that theme—are becoming part of a mix, a melting pot. Some
              teachers welcome this challenge, but others are quite concerned about
              maintaining the purity of the various traditions. You are somewhat renowned for
              taking a strict view of maintaining the integrity of each lineage.</strong></span></p>

              places. Some day you must be sure I will get water here, then dig, come to that
              stage. I don’t say only remain with me. You try, and whichever path seems more
              compatible to your ideology, your thinking, go ahead. I don’t condemn.<br> <br> <strong>In
              another example of traditions coming together, the peace summit that you’re
              attending at the U.N. this week is bringing world religious leaders together to
              make a declaration committing themselves to global peace. What’s your outlook?</strong> Any cause for optimism? When we look at Asia, we look at Burma, Sri Lanka, such
              violence and suffering in these Buddhist countries—how can we use our practice
              for peace? In centuries of Buddha’s teaching there is not a single incident
              where the followers of Buddha were involved in any kind of bloodshed in the
              name of propagating Buddha’s teachings. Wherever Buddha’s teaching went, it
              went with love and compassion. So that tradition says that here is a path which
              does not support violence or bloodshed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Now you come to this millennium conference that is going on. Again,
              according to Buddha’s teaching and according to science, human science and the
              reality that we face, we want peace in human society. Certainly everybody,
              Buddhist or non-Buddhist, wants this. But how can there be peace in society
              unless there is peace in the individual? If the individual is boiling, agitated
              all the time, there is no peace. And you expect the entire society to be
              peaceful? To me it is unsound. Doesn’t sound logical.<br> <br> <strong>Is
              it helpful to not use the word “Buddhism,” so it can become something for
              everyone?</strong> These are two words I have avoided in the last
              thirty-one years. In the thirty-one years since I started teaching I avoid
              using the word “Buddhism.” I never use the word “religion,” so far as Buddha’s
              teaching is concerned. For me Buddha never established a religion. Buddha never
              taught Buddhism. Buddha never made a single person a Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Everybody will agree that every religion of the world has got these
              common factors, which I call the inner core of religion—morality, mastery of
              the mind, purification of mind. So I say this is the core, the wholesome core
              of every religion. And then there’s the outer shell. The outer shell differs
              from one to the other. Let everyone be happy with their rites, rituals—but they
              should not forget this inner core.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If they forget this and say, I am a religious person because I have done
              this rite, they are deluding themselves, they are deluding others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In terms of this sense of interior peace: There’s a fear in this culture
              that if you are very peaceful that you’re a little dead. We want to be peaceful
              but cannot imagine how we can save the world, in terms of ecology, without
              being angry. We want to engage in life with those kinds of passions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I recognize that. I am not against that. People have not understood the
              Buddha’s teaching properly. Say a person comes to harm me, and I say, “I am a
              Vipassana meditator, like a vegetable, come and cut me”—that is not Buddha’s
              teaching. We will take strongest action wherever necessary, strongest physical
              and vocal action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>But before doing that we must examine ourselves at the physical level,
              at the sensation level, and the mental level. If I find my mind is very
              equanimous, I’ve got no anger towards this person. I’ve got love towards this
              person. But because this person does not understand soft language, I’ve got to
              use hard language. He does not understand soft action, I will take hard action.
              In his interest, in her interest. Love is there. Compassion is there. If there
              is anger, then I’m miserable. How can a miserable person help another miserable
              person?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This question requires a lot of clarification, because this question
              keeps coming up. That if you are not angry, how will we be able to defend
              ourselves? If we are not angry, how will be able to be successful in this way
              or that way? That is because people have not lived a life where they are
              detached and yet very strong. People feel that only with attachment I can gain
              my goal. But when they understand and they practice, a detached person is more
              successful to reach their goal. Because the mind is so calm, so clear. And
              whatever problem comes you can make a quick decision, a right decision.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And the government is introducing Vipassana into the police academy.
              Even prisoners change. Hard criminals. And every government wants a prisoner to
              be reformed when he comes to the prison. Instead of that it is a house of
              crime, where you discuss what kind of crime, and how you did it. They learn
              much more, and come out as bigger criminals. Now with Vipassana there is a big
              change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And that is not by giving discourses, giving praises of Buddha. It is by
              technique, when they start observing. Living in the prison, most of the
              students have anger: So-and-so gave witness against me, when I get out I’ll
              kill him. Revenge. When they start observing, “Oh, what am I doing? I’m burning
              myself,” it goes away. With the other way this person will create more and more
              violence. Now he can’t do that. He’s full of love, full of compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>And the person becomes so active. A number of hard criminals when they
              come out, they get jobs here and there and they don’t return.<br> <br> <strong>Do
              you think in the Buddhist societies today, where violence is being carried out,

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If somebody says they are a Buddhist and that is all they do, then I say
              you are a devotee of Buddha, you are not a follower of Buddha. It’s a real
              difference. You have great devotion towards Buddha, you say, “Lord Buddha, Lord
              Buddha, how wonderful!” But you don’t practice. Whether we keep calling
              ourselves Christian or Hindu or Muslim, it makes no difference. A follower of
              the Buddha follows the teachings: sila, samadhi, prajna. Those people who
              simply call themselves Buddhists are not living the life of Buddha. That is why
              I don’t use the word “Buddhist” or “Buddhism.” Buddha never taught any isms. In
              all his words, and the commentaries, which number thousands of pages, the word
              “Buddhism” is not there. So this all started much later, when Buddha’s teaching
              began to settle. I don’t know when it started, how it started, calling it
              Buddhism, but the day it happened it devalued the teaching of Buddha. It was a
              universal teaching, and that made it sectarian, as if to say that Buddhism is
              only for Buddhists, like Hinduism is for Hindus, Islam is for Muslims. Dharma
              is for all.</span></p>
