            <div class='col-md body'>Elaboration: We also need to be clear that the 'mind' used in the conventional sense is not refering to the True Mind, the Mind in the ultimate sense (luminous emptiness). The 'mind' in conventional sense is talking about discrimination, consciousness, and thinking. Consciousness is also another term we need to be clear. Consciousness strictly speaking in Buddhism refers to dualistic knowing. Means subject-object relationship is assumed.<br><br>Let's say you see a red flower, later you form an impression of a red flower, that is consciousness. So consciousness is also not awareness (although consciousness can be <strong>transformed</strong> to awareness and wisdom). Although 'consciousness' is sometimes used to mean 'awareness', thus causing some confusion. So bear in mind whenever the terms 'consciousness' or 'mind' is used, know the context it is spoken, whether it is in terms of relative or ultimate truth.<br><br>Also a good read is Shurangama's searching for mind in all direction and also how 2nd Patriarch became enlightened by Bodhidharma.</div>

Also the Truth, the "Meaning" of dharma is not in thinking as well. It is through insights and realisation of our true nature that we can know.<br><br><blockquote>When Transcendental Intelligence is considered, four things must be kept in mind: words, meanings, teachings and Noble Wisdom (Arya-Prajna). Words are employed to express meanings but they are dependent upon discriminations and memory as cause, and upon the employment of sounds or letters by which a mutual transference of meaning is possible. Words are only symbols and may or may not clearly and fully express the meaning intended and, moreover, words may be understood quite differently from what was intended by the speaker. Words are neither different nor not different from meaning and meaning stands in the same relation to words.<br><br>If meaning is different from words it could not be made manifest by means of words; but meaning is illumined by words as things are by a lamp. Words are just like a man carrying a lamp to look for his property, by which he can say: this is my property. <strong>Just so, by means of words and speech originating in discrimination, the Bodhisattva can enter into the meaning of the teachings of the TathÃ¡gatas and through the meaning he can enter the exalted state of self-realization of Noble Wisdom, which, in itself, is free from word discrimination. But if a man becomes attached to the literal meaning of words and holds fast to the illusion that words and meaning are in agreement, especially in such things as Nirvana which is un-born and un-dying, or as to distinctions of the Vehicles, the five Dharmas, the three self-natures, then he will fail to understand the true meaning and will become entangled in assertions and refutations.</strong> Just as varieties of objects are seen and discriminated in dreams and in visions, so ideas and statements are discriminated erroneously and error goes on multiplying.<br><br>The ignorant and simple-minded declare that meaning is not otherwise than words that as words are, so is meaning. They think that as meaning has no body of its own that it cannot be different from words and, therefore, declare meaning to be identical to words. In this they are ignorant of the nature of words, which are subject to birth and death, whereas meaning is not; words are dependent upon letters and meaning is not; meaning is apart from existence and non-existence, it has no substratum, it is un-born. The TathÃ¡gatas do not teach a Dharma that is dependent upon letters. Anyone who teaches a doctrine that is dependent upon letters and words is a mere prattler, because Truth is beyond letters and words and books.<br><br><strong>This does not mean that letters and books never declare what is in conformity with meaning and truth, but it means that words and books are dependent upon discriminations, while meaning and truth are not; moreover, words and books are subject to the interpretation of individual minds, while meaning and truth are not. But if Truth were not expressed in words and books, the scriptures, which contain the meaning of Truth, would disappear, and when the scriptures disappear there will be no more disciples and masters and Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, and there will nothing to teach. But no one must become attached to the words of the scriptures because even the canonical texts sometimes deviate from their straightforward course owing to the imperfect functioning of sentient minds.</strong> Religious discourses are given by myself and other TathÃ¡gatas in response to the varying needs and faiths of all manner of being, in order to free them from dependence upon the thinking function of the mind-system, but they are not given to take the place of the self-realization of Noble Wisdom. When there is recognition that there is nothing in the world but what is seen of the mind itself, all dualistic discriminations will be discarded and the truth of image-less-ness will be understood, and will be seen to be in conformity with the meaning rather than with words and letters.<br><br>~ Lankavatara Sutra</blockquote></div>
