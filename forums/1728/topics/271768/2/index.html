It is true that one must be wary during this Dharma-Ending Age. However, this is more applicable for laypeople who wished to seek a Guru and to be trained/taught by this Guru. Wisdom must be used here (not intelligence but wisdom). A layperson must be able to identify the 10 good characteristics of a Guru before asking the Guru to be his/her spiritual guide.<br><br>IMHO, a simple form of respect to a monk (even if you know that the monk is a fake or is non-virtuous in his deeds) should exist for any Buddhists. This respect is very basic and simple, just put your palms together and smile or just a simple smile will do. This is because you are respecting the Sangha community as the saffron robes don by the monk represent the Sangha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>But it's already said by Buddha the saffron robes <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't</span> represent the Sangha community!

As what you had said, many lay Buddhist will have no way to identify a good Guru.

Our perceptions on things are quite opposite but we still managed to reach the same conclusion everytime! IMHO:<br><br>Outlook is not everything so don't be deceived. In mundane world, the formal wear we put on such uniforms, suits, robes, tunics and etc. allow us to efficiently distinguish one's profession, vocation and even to display hierarchy, rank and position.<br><strong>While we respect the vocation and position, there is no need to be overtly awed for those we are not familar with for we have yet to discover the true characters of the person behind those attires!
