              <h1>The Theory of Two Truths in India</h1>
              <div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 17, 2011</em></div>
              <div id="preamble">
              <p>The theory of the two truths has a twenty-five century long history
              behind it. It has its origin in the sixth century
               BCE<sup>[<a name="note-1" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#1">1</a>]</sup> India with the emergence of the
              SiddhÄ�rtha Gautama. It is said, according to the
              <em>PitÄ�pÅ«trasamÄ�gama-sÅ«tra</em>, SiddhÄ�rtha
              became a buddha “awakened one” because he fully understood
              the meaning of the two truths—conventional truth
              (saá¹�vá¹›ti-satya) and ultimate truth
              (paramÄ�rtha-satya)—and that the reality of all the objects
              of knowledge, the text says, is exhaustively comprised of the two
              truths (Sde Dge,
              <em>dkon brtsegs nga</em>, 60b). The theory of the two
              truths, according to the <em>SamÄ�dhirÄ�ja-sÅ«tra</em>, is
              a unique contribution made by the Buddha towards Indian philosophy.
              This text states: “the knower of the world, without hearing it
              from others, taught that there are the two truths” (Sde dge,
              mdo-sde da 174b–210b). NÄ�gÄ�rjuna, in his
              <em>MÅ«lamadhyamakakÄ�rikÄ�</em>, (<em>MMK</em>) attributes the two
              truths to the Buddha as follows: “the Dharma taught by the
              buddhas is precisely based on the two truths: a truth of mundane
              conventions and a truth of the ultimate” (<em>MMK</em> 24:8).</p>
              <p>The theory of the two truths is the heart of the Buddha's
              philosophy. It serves as the mirror reflecting the core message of the
              Buddha's teachings and the massive philosophical literature it
              inspired. At the heart of the theory of the two truths is the
              Buddha's ever poignant existential and soteriological concerns
              about the reality of things and of life. NirvÄ�á¹‡a,
              ultimate freedom from the suffering conditioned by desires, is only
              ever achieved, according to the theory of the two truths, from a
              correct understanding of two truths. Knowledge of the
              conventional truth informs us how things are conventionally, and thus
              grounds our epistemic practice in its proper linguistic and conceptual
              framework. Knowledge of the ultimate truth informs us of how things
              really are ultimately, and so takes our minds beyond the bounds of
              conceptual and linguistic coventions.</p>
              <p>In India the theory of the two truths the Buddha had explained, of
              course without much elaboration, stimulated rich philosophical
              exchanges amongst the Buddhist philosophers and practitioners, not to
              mention the exchanges with traditional Hindu thinkers. The exchange of
              different ideas and views of the two truths between the early
              Buddhists, among other factors, gave birth to Buddhism as the
              philosophy we know today. The transformation of the two truths theory
              from a simple to a complex system of thought with highly sophisticated
              concepts is perhaps the most significant contribution resulting from
              the schisms the Buddhism experienced after the Buddha passed away (ca.
              380 BCE). Various schools with varying interpretations of the
              Buddha's words soon appeared in Buddhism, which resulted in rich
              and vibrant philosophical and hermeutic atmosphere.</p>
              <p>In later years, SarvÄ�stivÄ�din (VaibhÄ�á¹£ika) and
              SautrÄ�ntika, Madhyamaka (from the first century CE onwards) and
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra (ca. sixth century CE onwards) became the dominant
              schools. Our investigation of the theory of the two truths will
              briefly focus on how these schools have received, interpreted and
              understood it. Although all these schools regard the theory of two
              truths as the centrepiece of the Buddha's philosophy, all have
              nevertheless adopted very different approaches to the theory. As we
              shall see each understood and interpreted the two truths in different
              ways, and are often fundamentaly and radically opposed to each
              other.</p>

              <h2><a name="AabSarVai">1. Ä€bhidharmikas / SarvÄ�stivÄ�da (VaibhÄ�á¹£ika)</a></h2>
              <p>In the fourth century, Vasubandhu undertook a comprehensive survey
              of the SarvÄ�stivÄ�da School's thought, and wrote a
              compendium, <em>Treasury of Knowledge</em>,
              (<em>AbhidharmakoÅ›akÄ�rikÄ�</em> Abhi<em>DK</em>;
              <em>Mngon pa</em> ku 1b–25a) with his own <em>Commentary on the
              Treasury of Knowledge</em> (<em>AbhidharmakoÅ›abhÄ�á¹£ya</em> Abhi<em>DKB</em>, <em>Mngon pa</em> ku 26b–258a). This commentary
              not only offers an excellent account of the SarvÄ�stivÄ�din
              views, including the theory of the two truths, but also offers a sharp
              critique of many views held by the SarvÄ�stivÄ�dins. Vasubandhu
              based his commentary on the
              <em>MahÄ�vibhÄ�á¹£Ä�</em> (<em>The Great
              Commentary</em>), as the SarvÄ�stivÄ�dins held their
              philosophical positions according to the teachings of the
              <em>MahÄ�vibhÄ�á¹£Ä�</em>.
              Consequently, SarvÄ�stivÄ�dins are often known as
              VaibhÄ�á¹£ikas.</p>
              <p>The SarvÄ�stivÄ�din's
               ontology<sup>[<a name="note-2" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#2">2</a>]</sup> or the theory of the two truths
              makes two fundamental claims.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>the claim that the ultimate truth consists of irreducible
              spatial units (e.g., atoms of the material category) and irreducible
              temporal units (e.g., point-instant consciousnesses) of the five basic
              categories, and</li>
              <li> the claim that the conventional truth consists of reducible
              spatial wholes or temporal continua.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>To put the matter straightforwardly, for the
              SarvÄ�stivÄ�dins, wholes and continua are only conventionally
              real, whereas the atoms and point-instant consciousness are only
              ultimately real.</p>
              <h3><a name="AbhConTru">1.1 Conventional truth</a></h3>
              <p>To see how the SarvÄ�stivÄ�dins defend these two claims, we
              shall have a close look at their definitions of the two truths. We will
              examine conventional truth first. This will provide the argument in
              support of the second claim. In the <em>AbhidharmakoÅ›a</em> Vasubandu defines conventional truth/reality as follows: “An
              entity, the cognition of which does not arise when it is destroyed and,
              mentally divided, is conventionally existent like a pot and water.
              Ultimate existence is otherwise.” (Abhi<em>DK</em> 6.4, <em>Mngon
              pa</em> khu 7ab) Whatever is, on this definition, designated as
              “conventionally existent” is taken to be
              “conventionally real” or conventional truth when the idea
              or concept of which ceases to arise when it is physically destroyed, by
              means of a hammer for instance. Or its properties such as shape are
              stripped away from it by means of subjecting it under analysis, thereby
              conceptually excluding them. A pot and water are designated as
              conventionally existent therefore conventionally real for the concept
              “pot” ceases to exist when it is destroyed physically, and
              the concept “water” no longer arises when we conceptually
              exclude from it its shape, colour etc.</p>
              <p>On the  SarvÄ�stivÄ�din definition, for an entity to
              be real, it does not need to be ultimate truth or ultimately real,
              exclusively. For a thing to be ultimately real is for that thing to be
              “foundationally existent” (dravya-sat / rdzas
               yod)<sup>[<a name="note-3" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#3">3</a>]</sup> in contrast with
              being “compositely existent” (avayavidravya / rdzas grub).
              By “foundationally existent” the SarvÄ�stivÄ�din
              refer to the entity which is fundamentally real, the concept or the
              cognition of which is not dependent on conceptual construction, hence
              not conceptually existent (prajñaptisat) nor a composition of
              the aggregative phenomena. In the case of foundational existent there
              always remains something irreducible to which the concept of the thing
              applies, hence it is ultimate truth. A simple entity is not reducible
              to conceptual forms, or conventional designations, nor is it
              compositely existent entity. We will have lot more to say on this
              point shortly.</p>
              <p>Pot and water are not the foundational entities. They are rather
              composite entities (avayavi-dravya / rdzas grub). By composite entity,
              we mean an entity or existent which is not fundamental, primary or
              simple, but is rather a conceptually constructed (prajñaptisat),
              composition of various properties, and is thus reducible both
              physically and logically.</p>
              <p>Hence for the SarvÄ�stivÄ�din, conventional truth
              (samvá¹›tisatya), composite-existence (avayavi-dravya / rdzas
              grub), and the lack of intrinsic reality (niá¸¥svabhÄ�va) are
              all equivalents. A conventional truth is therefore characterised as a
              reducible conventional entity on three grounds: (i) conventional truth
              is both physically and logically reducible, as it disintegrates when it
              is subjected to physical destruction and disappears from our minds when
              its parts are separated from it by logical analysis; (ii) conventional
              truth borrows its identity from other things including its parts,
              concepts etc., it does not exist independently in virtue of its
              intrinsic reality (niá¸¥svabhÄ�va), the exclusion of its parts
              and concepts thus affects and reduces its inherent nature; and (iii)
              conventional truth is a product of mental constructions, like that of
              conventionally real wholes, causation, continuum etc, and it does not
              exists intrinsically.</p>
              <h3><a name="AbhUltTru">1.2 Ultimate truth</a></h3>
              <p>The definition of the ultimate truth, as we shall see, offers the
              SarvÄ�stivÄ�din response to the claim that ultimate
              truth consists of irreducible atoms and point-instant moments. In
              glossing the Abhi<em>DK</em> 6.4 verse his commentary explains that
              utimate truth is regarded as ultimately existent, one that is both
              physically and logically irreducible. Vasubandhu supplies three
              arguments to support this: (i) ultimate truth is both physically and
              logically irreducible, as it does not disintegrate when it is subjected
              to physical destruction and that its identity does not disappear when
              its parts are separated from it under logical analysis; and (ii)
              ultimate truth does not borrow its nature from other things including
              its parts. Rather it exists independently in virtue of its intrinsic
              reality <em>(svabhÄ�va)</em>, the exclusion of its parts thus does
              not affect its inherent nature; and (iii) it is not a product of mental
              constructions, like that of conventionally real wholes, causation,
              continuum etc. It exists intrinsically (AbhiDKB 6.4, <em>Mngon
              pa</em> khu 214a).</p>
              <p>Ultimate truth is of two types: the compounded (saá¹�ská¹›ta)
              ultimate, and the uncompounded (asaá¹�ská¹›ta) ultimate. The
              uncompounded ultimate consists of (a) space (akÄ�Å›a), and (b)
              nirvÄ�á¹‡a—analytical cessation
              (pratisaá¹�kyÄ�-nirodha) and non-analytical cessation
              (apratisaá¹�khyÄ�-nirodha). These three ultimates are
              uncompounded as each is seen as being causally unconditioned. They are
              nonspatial concepts. These concepts do not have any physical referent
              whatsoever. Space is a mere absence of entity. Analytical and
              nonanalytical cessations are the two forms of nirvÄ�á¹‡a,
              which is simply freedom from afflictive suffering, or the elimination
              of afflictive suffering. These concepts are not associated in positing
              any thing that can be described as remotely physical. They are thus
              the concepts that are irreducible physically and logically.</p>
              <p>The compounded ultimate consists of the five aggregates—material
              aggregate (rÅ«pa), feeling aggregate (vedanÄ�),
              perception-aggregate (saá¹�jñÄ�), dispositional
              aggregate (saá¹�skÄ�ra), and consciousness-aggregate
              (vijñÄ�na)—since they are causally produced, and the
              ideas of each aggregate are conceived individually rather than
              collectively. If the aggregates, the ideas of which are conceived
              collectively as a whole(s) or a continuum/continua, they could not be
              ultimately real. The collective concepts of the aggregate as a
              “whole” or as a “continuum” subject to
              cessation as they cease to appear to the mind, get excluded from the
              conceptual framework of the reality of the five aggregates when they
              are logically analysed.</p>

              <p>The
               philosophers<sup>[<a name="note-4" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#4">4</a>]</sup> who championed this view are some of the best-known Indian logicians
              and epistemologists. Other great names who propogated the tradition
              include Devendrabuddhi (?), ÅšÄ�khyabuddhi (?), Vinitadeva
              (630–700), Dharmottara (750–810), Moká¹£akaragupt (ca.
              1100–1200). DignÄ�ga (480–540) and DharmakÄ«rti
              (600–660) are credited to have founded this school. For the
              theory of the two truths in the SautrÄ�ntika we will need to rely
              on the following texts:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>DignÄ�ga's <em>Compendium of
              Right-cognition</em> (<em>PramÄ�á¹‡asamuccaya</em>,
              <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 1b–13a),</li>
              <li> DignÄ�ga's <em>Auto-commentary on the
              Compendium of Right-cognition</em> (<em>PramÄ�á¹‡asamuccayavá¹›tti, Tshad ma</em> ce
              14b–85b),</li>
              <li>DharmakÄ«rti's <em>Verses on
              Right-cognition</em> (<em>PramÄ�á¹‡avÄ�rttikakÄ�rikÄ�</em>,
              PVK; <em>tshad ma</em> ce 94b–151a),</li>
              <li>DharmakÄ«rti's <em>Commentary on the
              Verses of Right-cognition</em> (<em>PramÄ�á¹‡avÄ�rttikavá¹›tti</em>,
              PVT; <em>tshad ma</em> ce 261b–365a),</li>
              <li>DharmakÄ«rti's <em>Ascertainment of
              Right-cognition</em> (<em>PramÄ�á¹‡aviniÅ›caya, tshad

              </ol>
              <p>Broadly, all objects of knowledge are classified into two realities
              based on the ways in which right-cognition (pramÄ�á¹‡a) engages
              with its object. They are either directly accessible
              (<em>pratyaká¹£a)</em>, which constitutes the objects that
              are obvious to the cognition, or they are directly inaccessible
              (<em>paroká¹£a)</em>, which constitutes the objects that are
              occulted, or obscured from the cognition. A directly accessible object
              is principally known by the direct perceptual right-cognition
              (pratyaá¹£a-pramÄ�á¹‡a), whereas a directly inaccessible
              object is principally known by the inferential right-cognition
              (anumÄ�na-pramÄ�á¹‡a).</p>
              <h3><a name="SauUltTru">2.1 Ultimate truth</a></h3>
              <p>Of the two types of objects, some are ultimately real while others
              are only conventional real, and some are not even conventionally real,
              they are just false, or fictions. In defining the ultimate truth in the
              SautrÄ�ntika tradition, we read in DharmakÄ«rti's PVK:
              “That which is ultimately causally efficient is here the
              ultimately existent (paramÄ�rthasat). Conventionally existent
              (saá¹�vá¹›tisat) is otherwise. They are declared as the
              definitions of the unique particular (svalaká¹£aá¹‡a) and the
              universal (sÄ�mÄ�á¹…yalaká¹£aá¹‡a)”
              (DharmakÄ«rti PVK <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 118b).</p>
              <p>Ultimate truth is, on this definition, a phenomenon (dharma) that is
              ultimately existent, and ultimately existent are ultimately causally
              efficient. Phenomenon that is ultimately causally efficient is
              intrinsically or objectively real, existing in and of itself as a
              “unique particular”
               (svalaká¹£aá¹‡a).<sup>[<a name="note-5" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#5">5</a>]</sup> By
              “unique particular” DharmakÄ«rti means ultimately real
              phenomenon—dharma that is self-defined, uniquely individual,
              objectively real, existing independent of any conceptual fabrication,
              ultimately causally efficient (artha), dharma that serves as the
              objects of direct perception, dharma that presents itself to the
              cognitions as distinctive/unique individuals.</p>
              <p>In the PVT DharmakÄ«rti characterises (<em>Tshad ma</em> ce
              274b–279b) all ultimately real unique particulars exist as distinct
              individuals with their own intrinsic natures. And they satisfy three
              criteria:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> They have determinate spatial locations (deÅ›aniyata / yul
              nges pa) of their own, as real things do not have a shared property
              amongs themselves. The real fire we see is either near or far, or at
              the left or the right, or at the back or in the front. By contrast, the
              universal
               fireness<sup>[<a name="note-6" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#6">6</a>]</sup>,
              that is, the concept of being a fire, does not
              occupy a determinate position.</li>
              <li>Unique particulars are temporally determinate (kÄ�laniyata /
              dus nges pa or dus ma ‘dres pa). They are only momentary
              instants. They spontaneously go out of existence the moment they have
              come into existence. This is not the case with the universals. Being
              purely conceptually constructed, they remain uninfluenced by the
              dynamism of causal conditions, and hence are not affected by time.</li>
              <li> Unique particulars are ontologically determinate
              (Ä�kÄ�raniyata / ngo bo nges pa / ngo bo ma ‘dres pa) as
              they are causally conditioned; the effects of the aggregation of the
              causal conditions that have the ability to produce them. When those
              causal conditions come together at certain points in time, unique
              particulars come into existence. When those conditions disintegrate and
              are not replaced by new conditions, the unique particulars go out of
              the existence. When the conditions have not yet come together, unique
              particulars are yet to obtain their ontological status.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>So the “determinate intrinsic natures of the unique
              particulars,” DharmakÄ«rti argues in PVT “are not
              accidental or fortuitous since what is not determinate cannot be
              spatially, temporally and ontologically determinate” (<em>Tshad
              ma</em> ce 179a).</p>
              <p>The unique particulars are, SautrÄ�ntika claims, ultimately
              real, and they supply us four arguments to support the claim:</p>
              <p>(1) Unique particulars are causally efficient phenomena
              (arthakriyÄ�samartha) (PVT <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 179a) because: (a)
              they have the ability to serve the pragmatic purpose of
              life—fulfil the objectives in our life, and (b) ability to
              produce a variety of cognitive images due to their remoteness or
              proximity.  (Dharmottara's
              <em>NyÄ�binduá¹­Ä«kÄ� Tshad
              ma</em> we 36b–92a) Both of these abilities must be associated
              exclusively with the objects of direct perception (<em>Tshad ma</em> we
              45a).</p>
              <p>(2) Unique particulars present themselves only to direct perceptual
              cognition as distinct and uniquely defined individuals because the
              unique particulars are, as DharmakÄ«rti's
              <em>NyÄ�yabindu</em> points out “the objects whose nearness
              or remoteness presents the difference of cognitive image” (<em>Tshad
              ma</em> ce 231a) and that object alone which produces the impression of
              vividness according to its remoteness or proximity, exists ultimately
              (Dharmottara<em>Tshad ma</em> we 44b–45a).</p>
              <p>(3) Unique particulars are not denotable by language since they are
              beyond the full grasp of any conceptual mind
              (Å›abdasyÄ�viÅ›aya). Although unique particulars are the
              objective references of language and thought, and we may have firm
              beliefs about them, conceptual mind does not fully grasp their real
              nature. They are ultimately real, directly cognisable by the means of
              certain perception without the reliance on other factors (nimitta) such
              as language and thought. Therefore they must exist. They are the sorts
              of phenomenon whose cognition would not occur if they are not
              objectively real.</p>
              <p>In the SautrÄ�ntika ontology ultimately real/existent
              (synonymous) unique particulars are classified into three kinds:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>momentary instants of matter (rÅ«pa),</li>
              <li>momentary instants of consciousness (vijñÄ�na)
              and</li>
              <li>momentary instants of the non-associated composite phenomena,
              which are neither matter nor minds or mental factors
              (<em>citta-caitta-viprayukta-saá¹ƒskÄ�ra</em>).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The SautrÄ�ntika's theory of ultimate truth mirrors its
              ontology of flux in which the unique particulars are viewed as the
              spatially infinitesimal atoms constituting temporally momentary events
              (ká¹£aá¹‡ika) or as successive flashes of consciousnesses,
              cognitive events, all devoid of any real continuity as substratum.
              Unique particulars are ultimately real, although they are not enduring
              substances (dravyas) inhering in it's qualities (guá¹‡as) and
              actions (karmas) as the NaiyÄ�yika-VaiÅ›eá¹£ika claims.
              They are rather bundles of events arising and disappearing instantly.
              Even the continuity of things and motion are only successive events
              closely resembling each other. On this theory ultimate realities are
              momentary point instants, and Vasubandhu and DharmakÄ«rti both
              argue that no conditioned phenomenon, therefore, no ultimately real
              unique particulars, endure more than a single moment—hence they
              are momentary instants (ká¹£aá¹‡ika).</p>
              <p>Four closely interrelated arguments provide the defence of the
              SautrÄ�ntika's claim that ultimately real unique particulars
              are momentary instants. Vasubandhu and DharmakÄ«rti both employ the
              first two arguments. The third argument is one DharmakÄ«rti
              specialises in his works.</p>
              <p>(1) Ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants
              because their perishing or destruction is spontaneous to their
              becoming. This follows because (i) unique particulars are inherently
              self-destructive (Vasubandhu, AbhiDKB, <em>Mngon pa</em> khu 166b–167a),
              and (ii) their perishing or cessation is <em>intrinsic</em> and does
              not depend on any other <em>extrinsic</em> causal factors
              (DharmakÄ«rti, PVK <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 102a; PVT, <em>Tshad
              ma</em> ce 178ab).</p>
              <p>(2) The ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants
              because they are motionless, and do not move from one temporal or
              spatial location to another. They perish just where they were born
              since nothing exists later than its acquisition of
              existence (Vasubandhu, AbhiDKB <em>Mngon pa</em> khu 166b).</p>
              <p>(3) The third argument proves the momentary instants of the unique
              particulars from the inference of existence (sattvÄ�numÄ�na).
              This is a case of the argument from identity of existence and
              production (svabhÄ�vahetu). All unique particulars which are
              ultimately existent, are necessarily produced, since only those that
              are ultimately existent, insofar as DharmakÄ«riti is concerned, are
              able to a perform causal function—i.e., to produce effects. And
              causally efficient unique particulars imply constant change for the
              renewal and the perishing of their antecedent identities, therefore,
              they are momentary.</p>
              <p>Finally (4), unique particulars are ultimately real not only on the
              ground that they constitute the final ontological status, but also
              because it forms the basis of the SautrÄ�ntika soteriology. The
              attainment of nirvÄ�á¹‡a — the ultimate freedom from the
              afflictions of life—for the SautrÄ�ntika, according to
              DharmakÄ«rti's <em>VÄ�danyÄ�ya</em>, has an immediate
              perception of the unique particulars as its necessary condition
              (<em>Tshad ma</em> che 108b–109a).</p>
              <h3><a name="SauConTru">2.2 Conventional truth</a></h3>
              <p>DharmakÄ«rti defines conventional truth, in his <em>PVK</em>, as
              dharma which is “conventionally existent” and he identifies
              conventional truth with the
              “universal”
               (sÄ�mÄ�nya-laká¹£aá¹‡a)<sup>[<a name="note-7" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#7">7</a>]</sup> just as he identifies ultimate truth with the
              unique particular (<em>Tshad ma</em> ce 118b). When a SautrÄ�ntika
              philosopher describes a certain entity as a universal, he means a
              conceptual entity not apprehended by virtue of its own being. He means
              a general property that is conceptually constructed, appearing to be
              something common amongst all the items in a certain class of objects.
              Unlike NyÄ�ya-VaiÅ›eá¹£ika view where the universals are
              regarded as objectively real and eternal entities inhering in the
              substances, qualities and particulars, universals, for the
              SautrÄ�ntika are pure conceptual constructs. SautrÄ�ntika holds
              the view known as nominalism or conceptualism—the view that
              denies universals any independent extramental objective reality
              existing on their own apart from being mentally constructed.</p>
              <p>While unique particulars exist independently of the linguistic
              convention, universals have no reality in isolation from the linguistic
              and conceptual conventions. Thus, universals and ultimate reality are
              mutually exclusive. Universals are therefore only conventionally real,
              lacking any intrinsic nature, whereas unique particulars are the
              ultimately real, and exist intrinsically.</p>
              <p>The SautrÄ�ntika defends the claim that the universals
              (sÄ�mÄ�nya-laká¹£aá¹‡a) are only conventional truths
              for the following reasons (<em>tshad ma</em> ce 118b):</p>
              <ol>
              <li> Universals are the domains of inferential cognition since they
              are exhaustively grasped by the conceptual mind by the means of
              language and thought (DharmakÄ«rti, <em>NyÄ�yabindu</em>,
              <em>tshad ma</em> ce 231a).</li>
              <li> Universals are the objects of the apprehending cognition which
              arises simply out of having beliefs about the objects without the need
              to see any real object.</li>
              <li> Universals are causally inefficient. By “causal
              inefficiency,” the SautrÄ�ntika, according to
              Dharmottara's
              <em>NyÄ�yabinduá¹­Ä«kÄ�</em>,
              (<em>Tshad ma we</em> 45ab) means three things: (a) universals are
              purely conceptually constructed, hence unreal; (b) universals are
              unable to serve a pragmatic purpose as they do not fulfil the
              life's objectives; and (c) cognitive images produced by
              universals are independent of the proximity between the objects and
              their cognitions since the production of the image does not require
              seeing the object as it is in the case of perception and the unique
              particulars.</li>
              <li> Universals are products of the unifying or mixing of language
              and their referential objects (unique particulars), and thus appear to
              conceptual minds as generalities, unified wholes, unity, continuity, as
              phenomena that appear to the conceptual mind to have shared properties
              linking with all the items in the same class of objects.</li>
              <li> Universals, consequently, obscure the individualities of the
              unique particulars from being directly apprehended. This is because, as
              we have already seen, universals, according to DharmakÄ«rti's
              PVK (<em>Tshad ma</em> ce 97ab) and PVT (<em>Tshad ma</em> ce 282ab),
              are only conventionally real since they are conceptual constructs
              founded on unifying and putting together the distinct individualities
              of the unique particulars as having one common property being shared by
              all items in the same class.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>According to the SautrÄ�ntika philosophy, language does not
              describe reality or the unique particulars positively through the real
              universals as suggested by the NaiyÄ�yikas. SautrÄ�ntika
              developed an alternative nominalist theory of universal called the
              apoha-theory in which language is seen to engage with the reality
              negatively by means of elimination or the exclusion of the other
              (anyÄ�poha / gzhan sel). On this theory, the function of language,
              specifically <em>naming</em>, is to eliminate the object from the class
              of those objects to which language does not apply.</p>
              <p>In brief the SautrÄ�ntika's theory of the two truths rests
              on dichotomising objects between the unique particulars, which are
              understood as ultimately reals, dynamic, momentary, causally effective,
              the objective domain of the direct perception; and the universals,
              which are understood as only conventionally reals, conceptually
              constructed, static, causally ineffective and the objective domain of
              the inferential cognition.</p>
              <h2><a name="Yog">3. YogÄ�cÄ�ra</a></h2>
              <p>The VaibhÄ�á¹£ika's realistic theory of the two truths
              and the SautrÄ�ntika's representationalist theory of the two
              truths both affirm the ultimate reality of the physical objects
              constituted by the atoms. YogÄ�cÄ�ra rejects the physical
              realism of both VaibhÄ�á¹£ika and SautrÄ�ntika, although it
              agrees with the SautrÄ�ntika's representationalist theory as
              far as they both affirm representation as the intentional object in
              perception and deny in perception a direct access to the external
              object. Where they part their company is in their response to the
              questions: what causes the representations? Is the contact of senses
              with physical objects necessary to give rise to the representations in
              perception? The SautrÄ�ntika's reply is that the external
              objects cause representations, given that these representations are the
              intentional objects there is indeed a contact between the senses and
              the external objects. This affirmative response allows the
              SautrÄ�ntika to affirm the reality of external objects. The
              YogÄ�cÄ�rin however replies that the “subliminal
              impressions” (vÄ�sanÄ�s) from the foundational
              consciousness (Ä�layavijñÄ�na) are the causes of the
              mental representations, and given that these impressions are only
              internal phenomena acting as the intentional objects, the contact
              between the senses and the external objects is therefore rejected even
              conventionally. This allows the YogÄ�cÄ�rin to deny even the
              conventional reality of all physical objects, and argue that only
              conventional reals are our mental representations, mental creations,
              cognitions etc.</p>
              <p>The central thesis in the YogÄ�cÄ�ra philosophy, the theory
              of the two truths echoes this, is the assertion that all that is
              conventionally real is only ideas, representations, images, creations
              of the mind, and that there is no conventionally real object that
              exists outside the mind to which it corresponds. These ideas are the
              only objects of any cognition. The whole universe is a mental universe.
              All physical objects are only fiction, they are unreal even by the
              conventional standard, similar to a dream, a mirage, a magical
              illusion, where what we perceive are only products of our mind, without
              a real external existence.</p>
              <p>Inspired by the idealistic tendencies of various sÅ«tras
              consisting of important elements of the idealistic doctrines, in the
              third and the fourth centuries many Indian philosophers developed and
              systematised a coherent Idealist School. In the beginning of the
              <em>Viá¹ƒÅ›atikÄ�</em> Vasubandhu treats
              <em>citta</em>, <em>manas</em>, v<em>ijñÄ�na,
              vijñÄ�pti</em> as synonymous and uses
              these terms as the names of the idealistic school. The chief founders
              were MaitreyanÄ�th (<em>ca</em>. 300) and Asaá¹…ga (315–390),
              propagated by Vasubandhu (320–380), DignÄ�ga (480–540) Sthiramati
              (<em>ca</em>. 500), DharmapÄ�la (530–561), Hiuan-tsang (602–664),
              DharmakÄ«rti (600–660), ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita (ca.725–788)
              and KamalaÅ›Ä«la (ca.740–795). The last two are
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra-MÄ�dhyamikas in contrast with the earlier
              figures who are identified as YogÄ�cÄ�rins.</p>
              <p>Like other Buddhist schools, the theory of the two truths captures
              the central YogÄ�cÄ�ra doctrines. MaitreyanÄ�th asserts in
              his <em>Verses on the Distinction Between Phenomena and Reality</em> (<em>DharmadharmatÄ�vibhaá¹…ga-kÄ�rikÄ�</em>,
              <em>DharDVK; Sems tsam</em> phi 50b–53b)—“All this is
              understood to be condensed in two categories: phenomena (dharma) and
              reality (dharmatÄ�) because they encompass all.”
              (<em>DharDVK</em> 2, <em>Sems tsam</em> phi) By “All”
              YogÄ�cÄ�rin means every possible object of knowledge, and they
              are said to be contained in the two truths since objects are either the
              conventional truth or the ultimate truth. Things are either objects of
              conventional knowledge or objects of ultimate knowledge, and a third
              category is not admitted.</p>
              <h3><a name="YogConTru">3.1 Conventional Truth</a></h3>
              <p>Etymologically the term conventional truth covers the sense of what
              we ordinarily take as commonsensical truths. However, in contrast with
              the naïve realism associated with the common sense notions of
              truths, for YogÄ�cÄ�ra the term “conventional
              truth” has somewhat a negative connotation. It exclusively refers
              to the objects of knowledge like forms, sound etc., the mode of
              existence or mode of being which radically contradicts with the mode of
              its appearance, and thus they are false, unreal, and deceptive. Forms,
              sounds, etc., are defined as conventional truths in that they are
              realities/truths from the perspective of, or by the force of, three
              forms of convention:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> fabrication (asatkalpita),</li>
              <li> consciousness (vijñÄ�na), or</li>
              <li> language, signifier, a convenient designator (Å›abda).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>A conventional truth is therefore a truth by virtue of being
              fabricated by the conceptual mind; or it is truth erroneously
              apprehended by means of the dualistic consciousness; or it is true
              concept, meaning, signified and designated by a convenient designator/signifier.</p>
              <p>Because the YogÄ�cÄ�rins admit three conventions, it also
              admits three categories of conventional truths:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> fabricated phenomena;</li>
              <li> mind/consciousness; and</li>
              <li> language since conventional truths exist due to the force of
              these three conventions.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The first and the last are categories of the imaginary phenomena
              (parikalpita) and the second is the dependent phenomena
              (paratantra).</p>
              <p>YogÄ�cÄ�ra's claim that external objects are not even
              conventionally real, what is conventionally real are only our
              impressions, and mental representations is one Vasubandhu closely
              defends by means of the YogÄ�cÄ�ra's theory of the three
              natures (<em>trisvabhÄ�va)</em>. In his <em>Discernment of the
              Three Natures</em> (<em>TrisvabhÄ�vakÄ�rikÄ�</em>, or
              <em>TrisvabhÄ�vanirdeÅ›a</em>, <em>TSN; Sems tsam shi
              10a–11b</em>), Vasubandhu explains that the YogÄ�cÄ�ra ontology
              and phenomenology as consisting of the unity of three natures
              (<em>svabhÄ�va</em>):</p>
              <ol>
              <li> the dependent or other (<em>paratantra</em>);</li>
              <li> the imaginary / conceptual (<em>parikalpita</em>); and</li>
              <li> the perfect / ultimate (<em>pariniá¹£panna</em>)
              (<em>TSN</em> 1, <em>Sems tsam</em> shi 10a)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The first two account for conventional truth and the latter ultimate
              truth. We shall consider the import of the three in turn.</p>
              <p>First, Vasubandhu defines the dependent nature as: (a) one that exists
              due to being causally conditioned
              (pratyayÄ�dhÄ«navá¹›ttitvÄ�t), and (b) it is the basis
              of “what appears” (yat khyÄ�ti) mistakenly in our
              cognition as conventionally real, it is the basis for the
              “unreal conceptual fabrication” (asatkalpa) which is the
              phenomenological basis of the appearance of reified subjects and
              objects (<em>TSN</em> 2 <em>Sems tsam</em> shi 10a). The
              implications of the YogÄ�cÄ�rin expression “what
              appears” to describe the dependent nature are therefore twofold:
              (a) that the things that appear in our cognitions are exclusively the
              representations, which are the manifest forms of the subliminal
              impressions, and (b) that the entire web of conventional reality,
              which presents itself to our cognitions phenomenologically in various
              ways, is exclusively the appearance of those representations. Apart
              from those representations, consciousnesses, which appear to be
              external objects, there is no conventionally real external content
              which corresponds to what appears.</p>
              <p>Second, in contrast with the dependent nature which is the basis of
              “what appears” (yat khyÄ�ti), the imaginary nature
              (<em>parikalpita</em>), as Vasubandu defines it, is the mode of
              appearance “as it appears” (sau yathÄ� khyÄ�ti) on
              the ground that its existence is only an “unreal conceptual
              fabrication” (asatakalpo) (<em>TriSN</em> 2, <em>Sems tsam</em> chi 10a). The imaginary nature is only an “unreal conceptual
              construction” because of two reasons: (i) it is the dependent
              nature—representations—merely dually reified by the mind
              as an ultimately real subject, or self, or eg, and (ii) the imaginary
              nature is dualistic reification of beings and objects as existing
              really and externally, there is no such reality.</p>
              <p>Third, given the fact that the dependent nature is devoid, or free
              from this duality, the imaginary nature is a mere superimposition on
              it. Hence nonduality, the perfect nature (pariniá¹£panna) is the
              ultimate reality of the dependent nature.</p>
              <h3><a name="YogUltTru">3.2 Ultimate truth</a></h3>
              <p>In the <em>Commentary on the SÅ«tra of Intent</em> (<em>Ä€rya-saá¹ƒdhinirmocana-sÅ«tra</em>, <em>Mdo sde</em> ca 1b–55b) it is stated that “Reality as it is, which is
              the intentional object of a pure consciousness, is the definition of
              the perfect nature. This must be so because it is with respect to this
              that the Victorious Buddha attributed all phenomena as natureless,
              ultimately.” (<em>Mdo sde</em> ca 35b)
              Vasubandhu's <em>TSN</em> defines “the perfect nature
              (<em>pariniá¹£panna)</em> as the eternal nonexistence of ‘as
              it appears’ of ‘what appears’ because it is
              unalterable.” (<em>TSN</em> 3, <em>Sems tsam</em> chi 10a)
              “What appears” is the dependent nature—a series of
              cognitive events, the representations. “As it appears” is
              the imaginary nature—the unreal conceptual fabrication of the
              subject-object duality. The representations, (i.e., the dependent
              nature) appear in the cognition as if they have in them the
              subject-object duality, even though the dependent nature is wholly
              devoid of such subject-object duality. The perfect nature is therefore
              this eternal nonexistence of the imaginary nature—the
              duality—in the dependent nature.</p>
              <p>Vasubandhu defines the perfect nature as the ultimate truth and
              identifies it with mere-consciousness. “This is the ultimate
              (paramÄ�rtha) of the dharmas, and so it is the reality
              (tathatÄ�) too. Because its reality is like this all the time, it
              is mere consciousness.” (<em>Triá¹ƒ</em> 25, <em>Sems
              tsam</em> shi 3b) Accordingly Sthiramati's <em>Commentary on the
              Thirty Verses</em> (<em>Triá¹ƒÅ›ikÄ�bhÄ�á¹£ya</em>, <em>Triá¹ƒB;
              Sems tsam</em> shi 146b–171b), explains “ultimate”
              (paramÄ�rtha) here as refering to “’the the
              world-transcending knowledge’
              (<em>lokottara-nirvikalpa-jñÄ�na</em>) in that there is
              nothing that surpasses it. Since it is the object of [the transcendent
              knowledge], it is the ultimate. It is even like the space in having
              the same taste everywhere. It is the perfect nature, which is
              stainless and unchangable. Therefore, it is known as the
              ‘ultimate.’” (<em>Triá¹ƒB, Sems tsam</em> shi
              169ab)</p>
              <p>So, as we can see the dependent and the imaginary natures together
              explain the YogÄ�cÄ�ra's position on conventional reality and
              the perfect nature explains its conception of the ultimate
              reality. The first two natures provide an argument for
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra's empirical and practical standpoint
              (vyavahÄ�ra), conventional truth and the third nature an argument
              for its ultimate truth. Even then the dependent nature alone is
              conventionally real and the perfect nature alone is ultimately
              real. By contrast, the imaginary nature is unreal and false even by
              the empirical and practical standards. This is true in spite of the
              fact the imaginary nature is constitutive of the conventional truth.</p>
              <p>So, the perfect nature—nondual mind, i.e., emptiness
              (Å›Å«nyatÄ�) of the subject-object duality—is the
              ultimate reality of the YogÄ�cÄ�ra conception. Ultimate truth
              takes various forms as it is understood within the YogÄ�cÄ�rin
              tradition. As MaitreyanÄ�tha states, ultimate truth takes three
              primary forms—as emptiness it is the ultimate object, as
              nirvÄ�á¹‡a it is the ultimate attainment, and as nonconceptual
              knowledge it is the ultimate realization (<em>MadhVK</em>, <em>Sems
              tsam</em> phi 42B).</p>
              <p><em>YogÄ�cÄ�ra Arguments</em></p>
              <p>The core argument in support of the only mind thesis is the
              impossibility of the existence of external objects. Vasubandhu develops
              this argument in his <em>Viá¹ƒ</em> 1–27 as does DignÄ�ga in
              his <em>Examination of the Intentional Object</em> (<em>Ä€lambanaparÄ«ká¹£Ä�vá¹›tti</em>,
              <em>Ä€lamPV</em> 1–8, <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 86a–87b) against the
              atomists (NaiyÄ�yikas-VaiÅ›eá¹£ika and
               Ä€bhidharmikas<sup>[<a name="note-8" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#8">8</a>]</sup>).
              Against the
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra idealist thesis the realist opponents, as Vasubandhu
              observes, raise three objections:—“If consciousness
              (does) not (arise) out from an object (i) neither the determination or
              certainty (niyama) in regard to place (deÅ›a) and time (kÄ�la),
              (ii) nor the indetermination or unexclusiveness (aniyama) in regard to
              the series of (consciousness) (iii) nor the performance of the
              (specific) function (ká¹›tyakriya) are logically possible
              (yuktÄ�)” (<em>Viá¹�</em> 2, <em>Sems tsam</em> shi
              3a).</p>
              <p>Vasubandhu offers his YogÄ�cÄ�ra reply in the
              <em>Viá¹ƒ</em> to these realist objections and insists that the
              idealist position does not face these three problems. The first problem
              is not an issue for the YogÄ�cÄ�ra since dreams (svapna)
              account for the spatio-temporal determination. In dreams, in the
              absence of an external object, one still has the cognition of a woman,
              or a man in only determinate / specific time and place, and not
              arbitrarily and not everywhere and not in any moment. Neither is the
              second problem of the lack of an intersubjective agreement an issue for
              the YogÄ�cÄ�ra. The case of the pretas (hungry-ghosts) account
              for intersubjective agreement as they look at water they alone, not
              other beings, see rivers of pus, urine, excrement, and collectively
              hallucinates demons as the hell guardians. Although pus, urine,
              excrement and hell guardians are nonexistent externally, due to the
              maturation of their collective karma, pretas exclusively experience the
              series of cognitions (vijñapti), other beings do not encounter
              such experience (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em> 3, <em>Sems tsam</em> shi). Nor is
              the lack of causal efficacy of the impressions or representations in
              the consciousness a problem for the YogÄ�cÄ�ra. As in the case
              of wet dreams, even without a union of the couple, the emission of
              semen can occur, and so the representations in the consciousness are
              causally efficient even without the externally real object.</p>
              <p>YogÄ�cÄ�ra's defensive arguments against the realist
              challenges are quite strong. However unless YogÄ�cÄ�ra is able
              to undermine the core realist thesis—i.e., reality of the
              external objects—and its key supporting argument—the
              existence of atoms—then the debate could go either way.
              Therefore YogÄ�cÄ�ra shows the nonexistence, or unreality of
              the atoms as the basis of the external object to reject the realist
              position.</p>
              <p>YogÄ�cÄ�ra's impressions-only theory and the
              SautrÄ�ntika's representationalist theory both explain our
              sensory experience (the spatio-temporal determinacy, intersubjective
              agreement, and causal efficacy). They agree on what the observables
              are: mental entities, including mental images but also emotions such as
              desires. They also agree that karma plays vital role in explaining our
              experience. The realist theory, though, according to
              DignÄ�ga's <em>Investigation About the Support of the
              Cognition</em> (<em>Ä€lambanaparÄ«ká¹£Ä�vá¹›
              tti, Ä€lamPV</em>) has to posit the reality of additional physical
              objects, things that are in principle unobservable, given that all we
              experience in the cognition are our impressions (<em>Ä€lamPV</em>,
              <em>Tshad ma</em> ce 86a).</p>
              <p>If the realist thesis were correct, then there would be three
              alternatives for the atoms to act as the intentional objects of
              cognition.</p>
              <ol>
              <li> Atoms of the things would be either <em>one</em> in the way the
              Nyya-Vaieika conceives the <em>whole</em> as
              something constituted by parts but being single, <em>one</em>,
              different from the parts that compose it, and having a real existence
              apart from the existence of the parts. Or</li>
              <li> things would have to be constituted by <em>multiple</em> atoms
              i.e., a number or a group of atoms coexisting one besides the other
              <em>without forming a composite whole</em> as a result of mutual
              cohesion between the atoms. Or</li>
              <li> things would have to be atoms <em>grouped</em> <em>together</em>, massed together as a unity among themselves with a
              tight cohesion. YogÄ�cÄ�ra contends that these are the only
              three alternatives in which the reality of the external objects
              can functioning as the objects of cognition.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Of the three alternatives: (1) points to the <em>unity</em> of a
              thing conceived as a whole; and (2) and (3) point to the
              <em>multiplicity</em> looking at the things as loose atoms, i.e.,
              composite atoms. Not one of the three possibilities is, on
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra's account, admissible as the object of
              cognition however. The first is inadmissible because nowhere an
              external object is grasped as a <em>unity</em>, <em>whole</em>,
              <em>one</em> apart from its parts (<em>Ä€lamPV Tshad ma ce</em> 86b). The second is inadmissible because when we see things we find that
              the atoms are not perceived individually as one by
              one (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em>13, <em>Sems tsam</em> shi 3b). The third
              alternative is also rejected because the atoms in this case cannot be
              proved to exist as an indivisible (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em> 14, <em>Sems
              tsam</em> shi 3b).</p>
              <p>Further, if there were a simultaneous conjunction of an atom with
              other six atoms coming from the six directions, the atom would have six
              parts because that which is the locus of one atom cannot be the locus
              of another atom. If the locus of one atom were the locus of the six
              atoms, which were in conjunction with it, then since all the seven
              atoms would have the same common locus, the whole mass constituted by
              the seven atoms would be of the size of a single atom, because of the
              mutual exclusion of the occupants of a locus. Consequently, there would
              be no visible mass (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em>12, <em>Sems tsam</em> shi
              3b).</p>
              <p>Since unity is an essential characteristic of being the whole, or
              composite whereas indivisibility an essential characteristic of being
              an atom when both the unity and individuality of the atoms are
              rejected, then the whole and indivisible atoms are no longer
              admissible. Therefore, Vasubandhu sums up the YogÄ�cÄ�ra
              objections against the reality of the external sense-objects
              (Ä�yatanas) as: “An external sense-object is unreal because
              it cannot be the intentional object of cognition either as (1) a single
              thing or (2) as a multiple in [isolated] atoms; or (3) as a aggregate
              because the atom is not proven to exist” (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em>11,
              <em>Sems tsam</em> shi 3b).</p>
              <p>The realist insists that the external sense objects are real and
              that their reality is ascertained by the various means of knowledge
              (pramÄ�á¹‡as) of which perception (pratyaká¹£a) is the most
              important. If the external sense objects are nonexistents, there can be
              no intentional objects, then cognition would not arise. Since
              cognitions do arise, there must be external objects as their
              intentional objects.</p>
              <p>To this objection, YogÄ�cÄ�ra employs two arguments to
              refute the realist claim and to establish the mechanism of cognition,
              which takes place without the atoms of an external object. The first
              argument shows that atoms do not satisfy the criterian of being the
              intentional object, therefore they do not cause the perception.
              “Perceptual cognition [takes place] just like in dreams and the
              like [even without an external object]; moreover, when that [cognition]
              occurs, the external object is not seen; how can it be thought that
              this is a case of perception?” (<em>Viá¹ƒ</em>16, <em>Sems
              tsam</em> shi 3b).</p>
              <p>The second is the time-lag argument, according to which, there is a
              time-gap between the perceptual judgement we make and the actual
              perceptual process. When we make a perceptual judgement, at that time
              we do not perceive the external object as it is in our mental
              consciousness (manovijñÄ�na) that carries out the judgement
              and since the visual consciousness that perceives the object has
              already ceased. Hence at the time when the mental consciousness
              delivers it judgment, the perceptual cognition no longer exists since
              all things are momentary. Therefore the atoms of an external object is
              not the intentional object of perceptual cognition, since it has
              already ceased and does not now exist therefore it is not responsible
              for the cognition's having the content it has, like the unseen
              events occurring on the other side of the wall (Vasubandhu's
              <em>Viá¹ƒÅ›atikÄ�-kÄ�rikÄ�vá¹›tti</em>,
              <em>Viá¹ƒKV</em> 16–17).</p>
              <p>YogÄ�cÄ�ra therefore concludes that we cannot postulate the
              reality of an external object through direct perception. However since
              in perceptual cognition we are directly aware of something, there must
              be an intentional object of the perceptual cognition. That intentional
              object of the perceptual cognition is, according to YogÄ�cÄ�ra,
              none other than the subliminal impressions (vÄ�sanÄ�s) passing
              from their latent state contained in the storehouse consciousness
              (Ä�layavijñÄ�na) to their conscious level. Therefore the
              impressions are the only things that are conventionally real.</p>
              <p>Vasubandhu's <em>TSN</em> 35–36 inspired by the Buddhist
              traditional religious beliefs also offers others arguments to defend
              the idealism of YogÄ�cÄ�ra:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> one and the same thing appears differently to beings that are in
              different states of existence (<em>pretas</em>, men, and gods); </li>
              <li> the ability of the <em>bodhisattvas</em> and
              <em>dhyÄ�yins</em> (practitioners of meditation) who have attained
              the power of thinking (<em>cetovaÅ›itÄ�</em>) to visualise
              objects at will;</li>
              <li> the capacity of the <em>yogins</em> who have attained serenity
              of mind (<em>Å›amatha</em>) and a direct vision of dharmas as they
              really are (<em>dharma-vipaÅ›yanÄ�</em>) to perceive things at
              the very moment of the concentration of mind (<em>manasikÄ�ra</em>)
              with their essential characteristics of flux, suffering, nonself,
              empty; and</li>
              <li> the power of those who have attained intuitive knowledge
              (<em>nirvikalpakajñÄ�na</em>) which enables them
              not to block the perception of things.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>All these arguments based on the facts of experience show that the
              objects do not exist really outside the mind, that they are the
              products of mental creation and that their appearance is entirely mind
              dependent. Therefore YogÄ�cÄ�ra's theory of the two
              truths concludes that the whole world is a product of mind—it
              is the collective mental action (karma) of all beings. All living
              beings see the same world because of the identical maturation of their
              karmic consequences. Since the karmic histories of beings are same,
              there is homogeneity in the way in which the world is experienced and
              perceived. This is the reason there is an orderly world instead of
              chaotic and arbitrariness. This is also the reason behind the
              impressions of the objectivity of the world.</p>

              <p>After the Buddha the philosopher who broke new ground on the theory
              of the two truths in the Madhyamaka system is a South Indian monk,
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna (ca. 100 BCE–100 CE). Amongst his seminal
              philosophical works delineating the theory are
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's</p>
              <ul>

              <p>Ä€ryadeva's work
              <em>Catuá¸¥Å›atakaá¹£Ä�strakÄ�rikÄ�</em> (<em>Four Hundred Verses</em>) is also considered as one of the
              foundational texts delineating Madhyamaka's theory of the two
              truths.</p>
              <p>NÄ�gÄ�rjuna saw himself as propagating the dharma taught by
              the Buddha, which he says is precisely based on the theory of the two
              truths: a truth of mundane conventions and a truth of the ultimate.
              (<em>MMK</em> 24.8, <em>Dbu ma</em> tsa 14b–15a) He saw the theory of
              the two truths as constituting the Buddha's core teaching and his
              philosophy. NÄ�gÄ�rjuna maitains therefore that those who do
              not understand the distinction between these two truths would fail to
              understand the Buddha's teaching (<em>MMK</em> 24.9, <em>Dbu
              ma</em> tsa 15a). This is so, for NÄ�gÄ�rjuna, because (1)
              without relying on the conventional truth, the meaning of the ultimate
              cannot be explained, and (2) without understanding the meaning of the
              ultimate, nirvÄ�á¹‡a is not achieved (<em>MKK</em> 24.10,
              <em>Dbu ma</em> tsa 15a).</p>
              <p>NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's theory of the two truths is fundamentally
              different from all theories of truth in other Indian
              philosophies. Hindu philosophers of NyÄ�ya-VaiÅ›eá¹£ika,
              SÄ�á¹ƒkya-Yoga, and
              MÄ«mÄ�á¹�sÄ�-VedÄ�nta—all advocate a
              foundationalism of some kind according to which ultimate reality is
              taken to be the “substantive reality” (drayva) or
              foundation upon which stands the entire edifice of the conventional
              ontological structures where the ultimate reality is posited as
              immutable, fixed, irreducible and independent of any interpretative
              conventions. That is so, even though the conventional structure that
              stands upon it constantly changes and transforms.</p>
              <p>As we saw the Buddhist realism of the VaibhÄ�á¹£ika and the
              representationalism of the SautrÄ�ntika both advocate ultimate
              truth as ultimately real, logically irreducible. The idealism of
              YogÄ�cÄ�ra holds the nondual mind as the only ultimate reality
              and the external world as merely conventional truths. On
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's Madhyamaka all things including ultimate
              truth are ultimately unreal, empty (Å›Å«nya) of any intrinsic
              nature (svabhÄ�va) including the emptiness (Å›Å«nyatÄ�)
              itself, therefore all are groundless. In this sense a MÄ�dhyamika
              (a proponent of the Madhyamaka thought) is a an advocate of the
              emptiness (Å›Å«nyavÄ�din), advocate of the intrinsic
              unreality (niá¸¥svabhÄ�vavÄ�din), groundless, essenceless,
              or coreless. Nevertheless to assert that all things are empty of any
              intrinsic reality, for NÄ�gÄ�rjuna, is not to undermine the
              existential status of things as simply <em>nothing</em>. On the
              contrary, NÄ�gÄ�rjuna argues, to assert that the things are
              empty of any intrinsic reality is to explain the way things really are
              as causally conditioned phenomena
              (<em>pratÄ«tyasamputpaá¹…hÄ�</em>).</p>
              <p>NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's central argument to support his radical
              non-foundationalist theory of the two truths draws upon an
              understanding of conventional truth as tied to dependently arisen
              phenomena, and ultimate truth as tied to emptiness of the intrinsic
              nature. Since the former and the latter are coconstitutive of each
              other, in that each entials the other, ultimate reality is tied to
              being conventionally real. NÄ�gÄ�rjuna advances important
              arguments justifying the correlation between the conventional truth
              vis-à-vis dependent arising, and emptiness vis-à-vis
              ultimate truth. These arguments bring home their epistemological and
              ontological correlations (<em>MMK</em> 24.14; <em>Dbu ma</em> tsa 15a).
              He argues that wherever applies emptiness as the ultimate truth, there
              applies the causal efficacy of the conventional truth and wherever
              emptiness does not apply as the ultimate truth, there does not apply
              the causal efficacy of the conventional truth (<em>Vig</em>.71)
              (<em>Dbu ma</em> tsa 29a). According to NÄ�gÄ�rjuna, ultimate
              truth's being empty of any intrinsic reality affords conventional
              truth its causal efficacy since being ultimately empty is identical to
              being causally produced, conventionally. This must be so since, for
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna, “there is no thing that is not dependently
              arisen; therefore, there is no such thing that is not empty”
              (<em>MMK</em> 24.19, <em>Dbu ma</em> tsa 15a).</p>
              <p><em>SvÄ�tantrika / PrÄ�saá¹…gika and the two
              truths</em></p>
              <p>The theory of the two truths in the Madhyamaka in India
              took a great resurgence from the fifth century onwards soon after
              BuddhapÄ�lita (ca. 470–540) wrote <em>A Commentary on
              [NÄ�gÄ�rjuna's] Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way</em> (<em>BuddhapÄ�litamÅ«lamadhyamakavá¹›tti</em>,<sup>[<a name="note-10" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#10">10</a>]</sup><em>Dbu
              ma</em> tsa
              158b–281a). Set forth in this text is a thoroughgoing
              non-foundationalist philosophic reasoning and
              method—<em>prÄ�saá¹…ga</em> arguments or <em>reductio ad
              absurdum</em> style without relying upon the <em>svatantra</em>,
              independent syllogistic argument—to elucidate the Madhyamaka
              metaphysics and epistemology ingrained in theory of the two
              truths. For this reason, BuddhapÄ�lita is often described as the
              founder of the PrÄ�saá¹…gika Madhyamaka, although elucidation
              of the theory itself is set out in the works of
              CandrakÄ«rti. Three decades later
               BhÄ�vaviveka<sup>[<a name="note-11" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/twotruths-india/notes.html#11">11</a>]</sup> (ca. 500–570) challenged
              BuddhapÄ�lita's interpretation of the two truths, and developed a
              Madhyamaka account of the two truths that reflects a significant
              ontological and epistemological shift from BuddhapalitÄ�'s
              position, which was later championed by CandrakÄ«rti to whom we
              shall return shortly.</p>
              <p>Many later commentators ignore the philosophical content of the
              debate between the PrÄ�saá¹…gika and the SvÄ�tantrika and
              claim that their controversy is confined only to pedagogical or
              methodological issues. There is another view according to which the
              content of the debate between the PrÄ�saá¹…gika and the
              SvÄ�tantrika—BuddhapÄ�lita versus BhÄ�vavevika
              followed by BhÄ�vavevika versus CandrakÄ«rti—is
              essentially philosophic in nature. Underpinning the dialectical or
              methodological controversy between the two Madhyamaka camps lies a
              deeper ontological and epistemological divide implied within their
              theories of the two truths, and this in turn is reflected in the
              different methodological considerations they each deploy. So on this
              second view, the variation in the methods used by the two schools of
              the Madhyamaka are not simple differences in their rhetorical devices
              or pedagogical tools, they are underlain by more serious philosophical
              disagreements between the two.</p>
              <p>According to this view the philosophical differentiations between
              the SvÄ�tantrika and the PrÄ�saá¹…gika is best contained
              within the discourse of the two truths. PrÄ�saá¹…gika's
              theory of the two truths we leave aside for the time being. First we
              shall take up the SvÄ�tantrika's account.</p>

              SautrÄ�ntika—and YogÄ�cÄ�ra predominantly target the
              ontological foundationalism which underpins their theories of the
              ultimate truth. He rejects them on the ground that from an analytic
              cognitive perspective, which scrutinises the nature of reality,
              nothing—subject and object—is found to be ultimately real
              since all things are rationally reduced to spatial parts or temporal
              moments. Thus he proposes the view that both the subject and the
              object are <em>conventionally</em> intrinsically real as both are
              conventional truths, where as both are
              <em>ultimately</em> intrinsically unreal as both are empty of ultimate
              reality, hence emptiness alone is the ultimate reality.</p>
              <p>Although BhÄ�vavevika is said to have founded the
              SvÄ�tantrika Madhyamaka, it is important to note that there exists
              two different subschools of the SvÄ�tantrika tradition:</p>
