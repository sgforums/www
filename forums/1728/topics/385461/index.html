              <p>I think it stems from meeting with other beings (i.e. activities such as eating, talking, touching, murdering, etcetc.), incompatibilites may arise and one has to know of such conflicts from incompatibilities.</p>
              <p>Thus some enlightened individuals prefer to live in isolation, that makes them less liable. Thats my take.</p>

              <p>Certainly. The Buddha taught that the path to liberation, nirvana, enlightenment, is the noble eightfold path.</p>
              <p>Without self reflections, we cannot practice noble eightfold path. If we do not reflect whether we have</p>
              <p><br># 3 Wisdom (PrajñÄ� • PaññÄ�)<br><br>    * 3.1 Right view<br>    * 3.2 Right intention<br><br># 4 Ethical conduct (ÅšÄ«la • SÄ«la)<br><br>    * 4.1 Right speech<br>    * 4.2 Right action<br>    * 4.3 Right livelihood<br><br># 5 SamÄ�dhi: Mental Discipline, Concentration, Meditation<br><br>    * 5.1 Right effort<br>    * 5.2 Right mindfulness<br>    * 5.3 Right concentration<br><br># 6 The acquired factors<br><br>    * 6.1 Right knowledge and right liberation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then we cannot hope to gain liberation.</p>
              <p>For example if we continue to have Wrong View, Wrong Intention, Wrong Speech, Wrong Action, Wrong Livelihood, Wrong Effort, Wrong Mindfulness, Wrong Concentration, and we do not reflect on it and change our ways, then we cannot hope to gain liberation but may fall into the 3 lower realms.</p>
              <p>Awareness and self reflection is thus, so important. We have to be aware of our mind at every moment and always do self reflection to make sure we're on the right path. :)</p>

              <p>You don't have to be a perfect person to attain nirvana. However, you need to reflect on your ways, give up any wrong views and doings, and practice the right path.

              <p>Enlightenment and Nirvana is not something only Buddha achieved. Countless people until today, including people in this forum, have achieved that. Hence it is truly possible</p>

It prevents rebirth in the lower realms and plants seeds for a higher rebirth (such as rebirth in human and deva/celestial realm).

              <p> In the sutras, it was recorded that among Buddha were thousands of disciples who attain Arhatship and also numerous Bodhisattvas, all who have realised emptiness and become liberated.</p>
              <p>To become Buddha however, takes many lifetimes of cultivation, due to the immense merits required to be a Buddha who turn the dharma wheel. A Buddha is not only enlightened to the nature of reality and liberated from the world of suffering (samsara), he is also perfectly omniscient, with all the virtuous qualities, skillful means, wisdom, that is able to lead countless sentient beings to awakening. i.e. Shakyamuni Buddha</p>
              <p>I have not met a Buddha like Shakyamuni in this lifetime, but I have met persons who achieve complete realisation and liberation.</p>
              <p>It should also be noted that the aspiration of someone trying to achieve Arhatship (personal liberation) is different from that of the Mahayana aspiration, which is to become a Bodhisattva who eventually attains Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings out of great compassion.</p>

              <p>HH Drikung Kyabgon, in <em><strong> <a href="http://www.namsebangdzo.com/product_p/5752.htm&amp;Click=1171">The
               Practice of Mahamudra</a></strong>,</em> responds to a question concerning 
              the relation of these stages to the
              bodhisattva's levels of realization: </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"These are somewhat different ways of looking at the same process. <br> First of all, the fivefold <em> <a href="http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_higher_teachings.htm">Mahamudra</a> </em>does not relate directly to the ten <br> bodhisattva bhumis.  There is no need to look for that.   Mahamudra is 
              really talking about something a bit different, it's approaching it from
               the point of view of practice.  What relates more closely to the 
              bodhisattva bhumis is what was just discussed -- the four levels of 
              yogic attainment.  These do
              relate more directly to the ten bodhisattva bhumis, and, in fact, one 
              great teacher of the Drukpa Kagyu wrote a text which includes a 
              discussion relating those two systems. <br> <br> Without going into a great amount of detail, we could say that the 
              first level of yogic attainment, that of one-pointed concentration, 
              wherein the direct realization of the nature of mind first begins to 
              dawn, corresponds to the first bodhisattva bhumi where ultimate reality 
              is first glimpsed. 
              However, you have the three levels of that first stage of yogic 
              realization, that of the lesser, the middle, and greater practitioner. </p>
              <p>Technically, the first bodhisattva bhumi would correspond only 
              to the level of the highest
              practitioner of the first level of yogic realization.  Only at that 
              level is reality actually glimpsed.  So the lesser and the middle level 
              practitioner of the first stage of yogic realization would correspond to
               the Path of
              Preparation levels called "heat" and the level called "summit," 
              respectively. 
              These are the second to the highest and the highest levels of the Path 
              of Preparation.  This precedes the
              <em>Dharshana-marga</em>, the Path of Seeing. <br> <br> The Path of Seeing is distinguished by the first glimpse of ultimate 
              reality, the non-conceptual direct perception of emptiness, which is 
              what is gained on the first level of yogic realization by the highest 
              level of practitioner. 
              So, what we have is the first of the bodhisattva bhumis corresponding to
               the highest level of practice of the first stage of yogic realization. <br> <br> From there you can go up through the bhumis, starting with the lowest 
              level of practice of the second stage of realization, that of freedom 
              from projection; this would be the second bodhisattva bhumi.  The middle
               level of practice at that state would be the third, and the highest 
              level of practice at that stage is the fourth.  Then, the three stages 
              of yogic realization of one taste correspond to the fifth, sixth, and 
              seventh.  Then finally, the three levels of practice at the highest 
              level of realization correspond to the last three, the eighth, ninth, 
              and tenth bodhisattva bhumis.  Once one 
              has attained the eighth bodhisattva bhumi, this is considered to be 
              the enlightenment of the Buddha, but it has to be filled out in the 
              ninth and finally, in the tenth stage."  </p>

              <p>I have met both Bodhisattvas and Arhats. It's not easy to guage their attainments unless you are already familiar with the teachings and maps of the practice and the phases a practitioner will go through. Maps like the 10 Bodhisattva bhumis, Mahamuda 4 yogas, 4 paths (to Arhatship), 10 ox herding pictures, 5 ranks of tozan, etc, are such insight maps. There are specific markers and phases/stages of insights on the path.</p>

              <p>then say for example a Mahayanist practitioner is necessarily a bodhisattva if they took the bodhisattva vows right?

He is still training to become a bodhisattva but is not a real bodhisattva in the sense of a truly enlightened being. Once a bodhisattva achieves liberation, he is also freed from the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth. He is no longer being dragged into the various realms by the power of his karma. The difference is that because the arhat does not have the vows of great compassion to attain full buddhahood for the sake of all other beings, and because he is no longer under the power of karma to have uncontrolled rebirth, he just enters cessation. A bodhisattva returns not by karma but by the power of his vows.
