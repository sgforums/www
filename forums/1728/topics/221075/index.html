By this I am asking; what draws one to focus themselves on such a task??  I know, ask myself that same question right?  Well, that is all well, and good, but I would only be answering the questions from my prespective.  Sure, so would you be giving your opinion, but is there something out there (writing that is) that would describe the over all reasons for choosing such a path?</blockquote>/\<br></div>

Therefore, their resolution to liberate and save all sentient beings are stronger and their sphere of activity such as manifesting in helping other is more active than an arhant. For example, Guan yin, the bodhisattva of compassion- could manifest in all realms; as and in many ways to save and liberate others from suffering.<br><br>While the arhant focus more on self-liberation, they could  extend their compassion to help and liberate others too... but they usually stay physically in the human realm.<br></div>
