It's takes many practices to be very very fortunate to see an Enlighten One. Many high monks of this age also need to practice thru-out their life. Praying alone I don't think is enough.<br><br>Their method of prayers much more like Tao-Jiao. Pretty different from Buddhist lineage.<br><br>That's one of my experiance which I cannot accept &amp; keep it away forever.

My dharma teacher too does that in very rare cases before (maybe once or twice), although most of the time she is compassionate looking, masters does that (not only Vajrayana), and that is skillful means. Of course though, if in the process of scolding the student, he/she becomes attached and becomes really angry, then he/she is not a true master. Because a true master, whatever form he/she manifest, is always compassionate at heart. My dharma teacher for instance, while she was scolding her daughter at a distance, would scold, and turn back and talk to her maid in a perfectly cool and happy manner, and the maid thought she was crazy because who would actually be cool and next moment angry and next moment cool. In reality a bodhisattva is not at all angry or etc, when conditions are there, he manifest in an approapriate manner to treat sentient beings. There is no 'anger' involved.<br><br>Sorry, back to topic. Skillful means of course, implies, that it is linked to wisdom. Without wisdom how can you have skillful means? Without wisdom, action is unskillful. Skillful means like wrathful form definitely works when a student has committed an offense against precepts, or in any way, having shown imperfectness that needs to be 'reformed', or his ego is too big, he needs someone to give him a scolding. Ego can serve as an obstruction from attainment. True masters doesn't need to be nice, he/she can be the ego's nightmare.<br><br>However, that is definitely not the way to be used to deal with people from lets say.. I Kuan Dao. That would be the most unskillful means. That is definitely not going to work for trying to bring across the message of Buddhism to someone who hasn't even stepped into Buddhism. But rather, that would certainly scare them away. That is equated to hard core evangelism and the kind of fundamentalistic extremist sort of behavior. The kind of people that everyone resent very much. Religious freedom and tolerance is a very very basic thing, something that even God-based religions like Islam or Christianity has adopted. Few days ago, I was discussing this video with my friend: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0MHK8ntKqk&amp;NR" rel="nofollow">I Am A God Warrior!!!</a> Really crazy. If people do not tolerate other people's beliefs, then the world will be a terrible place to live in. Don't forget that some fundamentalistic Christians, Muslims, also think that Buddhism destroys the spiritual health of their followers, and employ extremistic means of converting others. That is why we have hard core evangelists and terrorists. I believe everyone should exercise their spirit of inquiry and free will in regards to matters like Religion.<br><br>This is definitely against Buddhism's spirit of free inquiry. All we can do is to promote Buddhism through teaching, not forceful methods that other religions have used. I do not believe Buddhism is pessimistic and passive, because Buddhism (at least recently) has been doing a lot to educate people of the teachings of Buddhism. But to spread our teachings through force is another extreme. Remember the teaching of Buddha, "Middle-way".</div>

It is from a reality show.<br><br><blockquote>Marguerite professes to be a fundamentalist Christian, and traded homes with a New Age humanist, Jeanne D'Amico Flisher, from Boxborough, Massachusetts. Many viewers were taken aback by Marguerite's erratic behavior, vociferous attitude, yelling, unexplained vomiting and continuous proselytization.</blockquote></div>
