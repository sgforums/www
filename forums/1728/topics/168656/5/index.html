Even the ancient Yin Yang symbol recognises that in black there is always a little of white, and vice versa. An action, especially in real life and not games, often is not absolute. Looking at it from a different point of view yields a different result. Anyway, I am saying that while I may be having fun, but I have fun from bashing the really deserving.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry sinweiy... thread re-opened to say my last words <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Woah.... one day at class chalet and so many posts? I didn't even intend to return this morning... but fortunately I did, to take some stuff. And i'll be back at the chalet later and wont be back till tmr. so peace, alright?<br><br>About Shade343, I do not find his posts very wrong. It's good to have different views... otherwise the forum and even the IRC channel loses its purpose. Yes, he does not speak from Buddhist perspective, but this forum is not only limited to Buddhist perspectives... meaning we welcome anyone to discuss their own perspective and viewpoints. Shade343 is inclined to post on his understandings based on his faith on Sai Baba's teachings.<br><br>As for Bodhiruci, regarding the incident of his unhapiness with me, perhaps it was due to a misunderstanding. I have hinted that I may be able to meet him although I have never explicitly stated that I WILL be able to meet him nor stated a time and location... It seems to me that he is bitterly disappointed that I did not turn up. However later he apologised for his harshness. I think this is great and not everyone would have done the same or had the courage to do so. He also seem to be knowledgeable especially in the Mahayana teachings.<br><br>To suicine: I agree with laurence that you tend to make one liner statement. You say others 'post without backing'... but you yourself post statements without backing. Which is precisely why I have edited your messages and said that those one line statements without explanation or reasoning is of no value.<br><br>Sinweiy: I decided to close this topic but not delete it... hope people have learnt from this.<br><br>Enough said. Topic closed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">post re-edited upon request by bodhiruci for correction</span></div>
