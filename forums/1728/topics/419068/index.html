            <div class='col-md body'><p>Event : Dzogchen Retreat with His Holiness Menri Trizen <br>Date : June 25 - July 15 2011<br>Venue : Serenity Ridge 25 miles south of Charlottesville, Virginia<br>Website : https://www.ligmincha.org/news-releases/summer-2011.html<br><br>According to the Bon dzogchen teachings, the suffering of sentient beings can be traced to a single cause: our failure to comprehend that external appearances are only a manifestation of our own innate awareness. The teaching of the Six Lamps, from the Oral Transmission of Zhang Zhung, guides us to experience pure vision by recognizing the clear light of self-awareness in all levels of our existence:<br><br>* In the vast, infinite space that is the base-of-all<br>* In the space within our heart center<br>* In the subtle channels of our sacred body that connect the heart with the eyes<br>* In the external space surrounding us<br>* In all external visions<br>* In the visions we experience after death<br><br>During these teachings, through instruction and guided meditations Tenzin Rinpoche will help us learn to maintain our connection with the inseparable state of emptiness and innate awareness and to perceive all aspects of our environment with pure vision. Ultimately this practice is a path to self-liberation, enabling one to experience all visions of the bardo (the transitional state after death) as inseparable from one’s own essence, the essence of Samantabhadra.<br><br><br><br>In teaching the Experiential Transmission, Rinpoche draws from a text known as the Chag Tri (Nyam Gyu Dru Gyal wa’i Chag Tri). The Chag Tri has 11 chapters, taught at Serenity Ridge as a five-part series:<br><br>Part 1: The Ngöndro. This first part comprises the recitation and instruction of the preliminary practices, or ngöndro. The ngöndro is the authentic doorway through which a practitioner gains entry to the Experiential Transmission teachings and receives the blessings of its lineage holders. Its integrated series of nine preliminary practices help to tame the mind, turn the mind toward the path, and purify the illnesses, obstacles and mental obscurations that obscure the mind’s primordially perfect nature.<br><br>Part 2: Introduction to the Nature of Mind. The knowledge and skills learned here are applied in all parts of the cycle to come. In a deliberate and structured way, the Part 2 teachings present the foundational practice of zhiné as the skillful means to develop a calm abiding mind; and give instructions for dark retreat, sky gazing, and sun gazing as skillful means to develop stability in mindfulness. These practices ultimately permit experiences of innate awareness, or rigpa. In turn, when experiences of innate awareness are developed and stabilized in a methodical way through meditation practice, they confirm the direction of the practitioner’s journey and allow it to naturally unfold.<br><br>Part 3: The View, Meditation, Behavior, and Result of Dzogchen. Part 3 further guides students in developing inner clarity and integrating what they have learned into their practice and their lives. Practitioners will explore:<br><br>    * how the base of naked seeing provides the self-introduction and the dzogchen view<br>    * how the path of experiencing the clear light is the meditation<br>    * how the secondary causes of being challenged to bring every experience to the path are the behavior<br>    * how the fruition of developing confidence in the three kayas and finding one’s own place is the result.<br><br>Part 4: Removing Obstacles. Here students will receive teachings on how to overcome obstacles to their practice while sustaining and cultivating the results they have achieved during previous parts of the cycle. They will learn and engage in practices that work with the channels, prana and tigle, such as trul khor (Tibetan yoga), tsa lung, and additional support practices drawn from the Zhang Zhung Nyam Gyu, A Khrid and other sources.<br><br>Part 5: The Practice of Seven Cycles of Clear Light. During this final part of the cycle, students will receive guidance in tögel (pure vision) meditation and will engage in practices with the sky, sun and darkness. Tenzin Rinpoche will discuss the dark-retreat experiences of various teachers, including his own experiences; and will offer a brief explanation of the seven cycles comprising the traditional retreat of 49 days in total darkness. For those students who have completed Parts 1 through 5 and are ready to engage in the 49-day dark retreat, Rinpoche will be available to give personal, one-on-one guidance.</p></div>
