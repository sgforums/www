              increased interest in the status and changeability of social roles of both men
              and women across cultures. By and large, research indicates that traditional
              patterns of social behaviour persist where gender specific roles are concerned.
              There is also evidence that despite certain shifts in public perception in
              society, the establishment of conventional roles in Asian cultures begins
              almost from infancy and continues into old age. So why would this norm be an

              distinguished from other Buddhist traditions by its doctrinal emphasis of the
              notion that the mind precedes the world. Its description of the Buddhist path
              as a training regimen for the mind, proficiency in a diverse range of both
              meditative techniques and aspects of conduct that will eradicate keles — in
              order to attain awakening, has grabbed the attention of those seeking solace in

              formation of a Bhikkuni order with five hundred women, perhaps in the first
              monastic order for women. In the 3rd century BC Arahant Sangamitta, daughter of
              Indian Emperor Asoka arrives in Sri Lanka with the sacred Bo sapling, one of
              the most revered Buddhist relics of the country. History narrates that 11
              Bhikkunis arrived in the island along with Arahant Sangamitta, who pioneered
              the Bhikkuni ordination in Sri Lanka. A number of invasions however saw the
              decline in the Bhikkuni order. At present, with no ordination sanctioned, women
              voluntarily take limited vows to live as renunciants and are not as privileged
              to receive higher ordination as Bhikkus.  <strong></strong></span></p>

              arrest, to spearhead a growing movement of Bhikkuni ‘rebels.’   </span></p>

              wider tradition that bhikkuni ordinations could be valid, having last been
              performed in Theravada communities over 1,000 years ago, though the matter has
              been under active discussion for some time. Amidst the debate that continues to
              argue the opportunities and obstacles of establishing a Bhikkuni order, Ven.
              Ajahn Brahm, on October 22, 2009 along with Ven. Bhante Sujato facilitated an
              ordination ceremony for bhikkhunis where four female Buddhists, Ven. Ajahn
              Vayama, and Venerables Nirodha, Seri and Hasapanna, were ordained into the Western
              Theravada Bhikkuni Sangha. The ordination ceremony took place at Ven. Ajahn
              Brahm’s Bodhinyana Monastery in Perth, Australia. He claims that there is no
              valid historical basis for denying ordination to bhikkunis.  </span></p>

              young monk in Thailand that the problem was a legal problem, that the bhikkuni
              order couldn’t be revived. But having investigated and studied, I’ve found out
              that many of the obstacles we thought were there aren’t there at all. Someone
              like Bhikku Bodhi [a respected Theravada scholar-monk] has researched the Pali

Ajahn
              Brahm is now engaged in a Dhamma tour delivering talks and guiding meditation
              retreats in and around London. The objective of this Dhamma tour is to support
              the establishment of a Bhikkuni presence in the United Kingdom. The mission
              titled the Anukampa Bhikkuni project arises from Ven. Brahm’s sense of
              gratitude to his birthplace where he first learned of Buddhism.   <strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>One of the notable
              participants of this movement, Venerable Bhikkuni Visuddhi is a fully ordained
              bhikkhunÄ«, a rarity in Europe as only three or four ordained bhikkunÄ«s live
              there. BhikkunÄ« Visuddhi lives according to tradition of relying only on
              offerings (dÄ�na) from her lay followers and she provides her teaching in the
              form of dhammadÄ�na. Meanwhile Venerable Bhikkuni Canda, born Lucie Stephens in
              England, came into contact with the Buddha’s teachings in India in 1996 at the
              age of twenty, through the Vipassana tradition. During her first retreat she
              decided to devote the rest of her life to ending suffering through practising
              the Buddha’s teachings.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>In October 2015 Ven. Ajahn
              Brahm requested Bhikkuni Canda to consider the formulation of a programme to
              establish a monastery in UK, in order to increase equality in practice and
              ordination opportunities for women. He believes the availability of Theravadi
              Buddhism is important as Buddhist nuns are far more capable of teaching and
              inspiring people.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>“I support the equity of
              full ordination to Bhikkunis so that they can walk with their heads held high,
              so that Theravadi Buddhist women in England can realise that their religion
              gives equality to people of all genders and races. I think as Buddhists we
              should show the way and take leadership in this” Ven. Brahm opines.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The group’s aspiration is to
              develop a monastery with a harmonious and meditative atmosphere, for women who
              wish to train towards full ordination. At present, there are many Bhikku
              monasteries worldwide, but very few for Bhikkunis and even fewer for those who
              wish undertake training towards Bhikkuni ordination. Thus the need arises to
              encourage equality in terms of practice and ordination opportunities for women,
              for Buddhism to thrive and remain relevant in the 21st century. As Bhikkhuni
              Canda relates; “I had been a novice nun in Burma for four years, when Ajahn
              Brahm told me about bhikkunis practicing in Perth. A wave of inspired joy swept
              through me and I knew instantly in my heart: if I had the chance for full
              ordination I’d take it!”  </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The Buddha’s initial
              reluctance in ordaining Bhikkunis that is still upheld in Vinaya rules among
              the local Theravada traditions may have resulted from precaution. Nevertheless
              women were not barred from ordination and the establishment of an order for
              women was only sanctioned with the subsequent ‘garudhammas’ imposed on the
              Bhikkunis. Today, even with general acceptance about the emerging importance of
              the matriarchal role of women in society, this mission is evidence that there
              remains one last bastion forbidden to women in religion. Nonetheless as Ven.
              Ajahn Brahm opines it is far more fruitful to light a candle than curse the
              darkness.  </span></p>
