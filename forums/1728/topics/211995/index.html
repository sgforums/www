            <div class='col-md body'>fyi, here's from Ven Huifeng:<br><br><blockquote>Dear Xabir:<br><br>Karma is cetana, volition / intention.<br>As such, there is no 'unintentional' karma.<br><br>The Jains (another religious group at the time of the Buddha) believed that even unintentional actions have karmic result. The Buddha disagreed.<br>They also believed that physical action was heaviest,<br>Where the Buddha stated that mental (cetana - intention) is heaviest.<br><br>The monk who stepped on the ants was a blind arhat. It is impossible for him to arise the thought of killing, as this is an unwholesome thought. Arhats do not have unwholesome thoughts.<br><br>karma can apply to walking, sitting, etc. depends on what state of mind one does these in.<br>eg. in the time of a past buddha, a layman went to make offerings to the buddha, carrying gold cutlerly some distance to make the offering. Along the way, as he walked, he was full of joy and happiness that he could make an offering to the Buddha and Sangha. In the time of Sakyamuni, he uncovered a gold-vein in the ground. The Buddha explained how this was the result of his carrying the gold vessel, with positive mental karma, to the Buddha. (The site of the gold-vein was the length of the journey he walked carrying the gold cutlerly, pots, etc.)<br><br>The mental, physical and verbal actions of liberated being, etc. Buddhas and arhats, are arkiya - non-functional (not the best translation), in the sense that they do not have karmic result for themselves. They no longer have volition in the sense above.<br><br>Hope this makes things clearer.<br><br>Huifeng </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cont..<br><br><blockquote>Dear Sinwei:<br><br>The below is not directly in response to you, because I don't know your views on the matter. It just made me think of something though, so thought I would add a little.<br><br>Whether an action has result or not is independent on whether the recipient experiences resentment or not.<br><br>There seems the misconception at times that:<br>"One experiences the negative result of killing, because the person killed will come back for revenge."<br><br>This is incorrect. Why?<br><br>Example:<br>A person could kill an arhat. The arhat will not have any sense of revenge at all, and secondly, they can't come back to take revenge, even if they wanted to, which they don't.<br>Yet, that action of killing an arhat will have extremely, extremely serious consequences - direct rebirth into the low hells, for a long, long, time.<br><br>And, as Sinwei rightly states:<br>A person could accidently kill something, and they may seek revenge. Now, how could one experience the negative result (of their revenge) without committing the karma in the first place (the karma of intentional murder)?<br>Now of course, their relationship may be more complex than that, and there may be other factors, but that would be a case of result without karmic action.<br>So, again, the view that it is due to revenge is incorrect.<br><br>When one commits an action, the seeds of that action - wholesome, unwholesome or neutral - are planted.<br>When the circumstances (causes and conditions) are ripe, they will experience the results - pleasure, pain or neutral sensation / feeling - respectively.<br><br>Huifeng</blockquote></div>
