              hero of the last millennium, who rose from the wind-swept Inner Asian steppes
              to create the world’s largest ever empire in history. Mesmerising accounts of
              Genghis Khan abound in scores of books available now – highlighting how
              ruthlessly he had seized swathes of land (12 million square miles) from Korea
              to Poland by routing empire after empire. It is said that Genghis Khan’s army
              reduced China’s population by half. His army swept through Eurasia, erased the
              Khwarazm Empire, and annihilated over 40 million people on the way. They also
              wiped out three-fourths of modern-day Iran’s population. Their conquest of
              Baghdad, Syria and Egypt was considered the most catastrophic event in Islamic
              history. Genghis Khan did not even spare the Slavic and European world. His
              army hit hard on the ancient centres of Russian civilization; went further to
              subjugate today’s Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland. By the time
              Genghis Khan died in 1227, the Mongol Empire was twice the size of the Roman
              Empire and Muslim Caliphate and four times the size of Alexander the
              Great's.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>But, soon after his death, the great empire
              broke into four parts. While Kublai Khan (1264–1294) established the Yuan
              dynasty in China after subjugating the Song dynasty, others formed the
              Chagatai Khanate, Ilkhanate Khanate and Golden Horde Khanate. The
              Mongols no longer remained Mongols after Genghis Khan’s death. His heirs later
              went in different direction and orientations. Those who ruled China turned to
              Buddhism, while others who founded Khanates in Eurasia adopted Islam of the
              Sufi variant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Most historical writings tell epic tales of
              Genghis Khan’s extreme cruelty. In the European imagination, he is an Asian
              scourge and a symbol of everything evil. Till date, his name is used to
              frighten children in Europe. Among Muslims, Genghis is portrayed as a brutal
              mass slaughterer equivalent to Satan. Recalling Genghis Khan was a taboo during
              the Soviet era, for he reminded Russians of the humiliation they faced under
              his yoke.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Strangely, no one appreciated Genghis Khan’s
              profound grasp of realpolitik. Very few are prepared to accept that he was
              actually a harbinger of peace and stability and that he had established a<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Pax Mongolica</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>from
              Asia to Europe. Indeed, some Russians do acknowledge that the Mongol yoke
              critically offset the recurrent European invasions of Russia; a reason why some
              Russians find Mongols even today as a friendly force, compared to the Europeans
              who continue to threaten Russia’s existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Indeed, Genghis Khan was the real globaliser
              – connected civilizations that ushered in an era of greater exchange and flow
              of commerce, goods, ideas, philosophy, and technology across vastly myriad
              cultures along the fabled Silk Road. The Mongols were the first to introduce
              paper currency and create a high-speed postal and communication network system.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Genghis Khan employed craftsmen and artisans
              to get gunpowder and compass techniques that revolutionised warfare. The
              militaries of the world owe Genghis Khan for his virtuosity in introducing
              professionalism with a centralised command structure. The Mongols brilliantly
              developed a wide intelligence network, and a highly sophisticated bureaucracy
              for governance. Equally significant was the new codified international law and
              a diplomatic code of conduct that sustained Mongol power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>In fact, the Chinese today seem to be
              shoplifting Mongol ideas; the One Belt One Road initiative is a good example in
              this regard.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Genghis Khan was certainly not barbaric. He
              had a sense of civilizational values when he ordered the adoption of the Uyghur
              script to create a written language for the Mongol<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Ulus</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>(nation).
              Uyghur was rich in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist philosophy during his time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>As for his belief, Genghis Khan stuck to the
              core principle of universalism. He practiced<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Tengrism</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>or
              Shamanism that revered<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Ekh-Tengir or
              Kukh-Tengir</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>(Great Blue Sky), but he was tolerant
              of different religions prevalent in his empire such as Nestorian Christianity,
              Buddhism, Islam and various animistic traditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>In practice, Genghis Khan was a pragmatist
              rather than an ideologue. He exempted Buddhist monasteries from taxation
              because they served his empire, but banned Islamic practices like Halal
              butchering which he thought did not serve any purpose. He considered Muslims
              and Jews as "slaves". Unlike other conquerors, Genghis Khan respected
              women and constantly sought the advice of his mother and wives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>But the irony is that Genghis Khan’s legacy
              has been kept secret and obscure, still a subject of intrigue and speculation.
              Most accounts on him are grotesquely misleading and prejudicial. But the most
              galling aspect of all is China’s proclamation of Genghis Khan as one of its
              honorary Emperors but of ‘Mongol origin’! To justify their subjugation of Inner
              Mongolia, the Chinese have glorified Genghis Khan as a unifier rather than an
              oppressor. The forays of Mongols and their butchery of millions of Chinese are
              censored for political reasons. Instead, the sly Chinese portray Genghis Khan's
              legacy for public view in a Mausoleum built in his memory in Inner Mongolia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #116c9e;'>A curious Mongol link with<span> </span><em>Inethik</em><span><em> </em></span>(India)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>One rather intriguing feature is that Mongol
              emperors and tribes, from Genghis Khan to the last Mongol rulers of Oriyat,
              Torgud or Kalmyk variants, invariably tended to see their own image through the
              Indian mirror. Historians trace Mongol interface with India to the second
              century in the Common Era, during the reign of Kanishka when the Sogdanian
              (Uzbek) traders were the first to narrate Indian wisdom to the Mongol nomadic
              tribes wandering in Central Asia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>This leads to yet another perplexing question
              that is often raised but remains unanswered – why Genghis Khan, who left no
              territory unconquered, did not invade India? The Mongol leader did not spare
              the Chinese, Koreans, Persians, Afghans, Arabs, Slavs, Europeans whether
              Christians, Jews or Muslims, causing so much damage to them even to the verge
              of their extinction. But there is no rational explanation, specific facts and
              references as to why the Mongol army kept off India even though they had every
              opportunity to do so by exploiting the already disunited Sultanates then.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Genghis Khan had reached even neighbouring
              Afghanistan under the control of Shah Muhammad's son Jalal-ud-din, but he
              decided to turn back from there. So what deterred him from invading India?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Among some logical explanations cited include
              the Indian tropical climate – considered unsuitable for Mongol troops and
              horses (cavalry). But the Indian climatic condition has never been known to
              have deterred other foreign invaders including Greeks, Turks and Moguls from
              militarily venturing into India. Genghis Khan’s own descendants, Tamerlane and
              Babur, were later able to create havoc in India massacring thousands in Delhi
              alone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The logistical problem of crossing the
              perilous and impassable Himalayas for his return may have been another reason.
              Some give credit to Shams-ud-din Iltutmish for his diplomatic skill in dealing
              wisely with Genghis Khan’s messengers and thus escaping the Mongol rage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Yet, one most astonishing and popular myth
              goes that the Mongols including Genghis Khan innately regarded India as
              sacrosanct and inviolable. Many strongly believe that Genghis Khan’s ritual of<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Tengir</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>worship

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>But the most common legend is the one
              mentioned in the<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Secret History of the Mongols</span></em>:
              that Genghis Khan was stopped by a “Unicorn” who spoke with the voice of his
              dead father and conveyed to him that invading India would not be blissful and
              it would go against his fortune. Genghis Khan took it as a blessing and
              immediately turned back from Afghanistan along with his troops.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The stories also go that his advisors advised
              him against touching Buddhist monasteries in Turfan and Khotan – considered
              then as symbols of Indian wisdom. Some Mongol Buddhists also consider Genghis
              Khan to be a reincarnation of<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Bodhisattva</span></em><span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span>Vajrapani.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>While these could be termed as myths,
              historical records do prove that those Mongol descendants avowed to the Islamic
              faith such as Babur did not spare India while those who embraced Buddhism such
              as Kublai Khan revered India and proclaimed themselves as<span><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;">Chakravartin</span></em><span><em><span style="color: #2c2c2c;"> </span></em></span>Khans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>In fact, the Mongols were so inherently
              rooted in Indic religion that even after their disintegration by the 13th-14th
              century, they took to Buddhism albeit through the Manchus and Tibetans. By the
              16th century, the vernacular Mongolian Buddhism, which had direct roots in
              Sanskrit, was overshadowed by the Tibetan Lama orthodoxy under the patronage of
              the Manchu Chin’g Dynasty and lasts until now. In fact, the last theocratic
              ruler of Mongolia Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was dethroned in 1920 in a
              Communists Revolution, was considered the reincarnation of a Bengali scholar
              Acharya Taranatha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>It is interesting to see how, in the 21st
              century, the Mongols are speedily returning to the global stage with their lost
              Mongol-Buddhist identity. Today, Genghis Khan stirs Mongol nationalism. He
              enjoys a divine status on both sides of the Mongolia-China border. His birth
              anniversary is celebrated with fervour both in Inner and Outer Mongolia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The Chinese are fearful not just of Genghis
              Khan’s legacy but also of Buddha and the India factor. To mollify Mongols, the
              Chinese treat Genghis Khan as their hero, but the fear of a new generation of
              Mongols imbuing ancient links disturbs Chinese minds. In July 2015, Chinese
              authorities arrested an Indian national in Inner Mongolia for watching a
              documentary on Genghis Khan – an indication of the Chinese paranoia built
              around these realities.</span></p>

              worries Beijing. To rival India, the Chinese are seeking direct contact with
              Mongol Buddhists. They have already reached out with cash for helping Mongols
              reconstruct major monasteries lying in ruins since their destruction during the
              Stalin era. Apart from cultivating members of the Mongol clergy, the Chinese
              are trying to gain control over the Soviet-era Buddhist outfit, the Asian
              Buddhist Conference of Peace (ABCP) based in Ulaanbaatar. The moribund ABCP
              enjoys the UN tag. A plan is also afoot now to take the Chinese-chosen Panchen
              Lama to Ulaanbaatar this summer. All these are part of China’s calculus to
              influence the politics of Lamaistic Buddhism in the post 14th Dalai Lama era.
              Clearly, Beijing sees yet another geopolitical benefit of edging in on India’s

              India. Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Mongolia last year and the grant of USD 1
              billion credit line was meant to reaffirm India’s strong commitment to protect
              and boost Mongol identity. Further steps are needed to help Mongolia
              financially and with archaeological skills for restoring numerous headless and
              bullet holes-marred Buddhist statues as also to preserve ancient monasteries
              that contain priceless hand-printed Sanskrit texts.</span></p>

              Buddhism is democracy – born in the early 1990s with Indian incentives.
              Buddhism, democracy, freedom and nationalism are seemingly intersecting
              powerfully in the current political and economic context of Mongolia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>India should help Mongolia bust the
              stereotypical myths and cardboard image of the great Mongol heroes. Instead of
              demonising Genghis Khan as a barbaric plunderer, his legacy should be preserved
              as a proud Asian heritage. Opportunity exists to build a fresh Mongol narrative
              based on previously untapped resources. Such a requirement demands urgency in
              the context of China’s historical reassertion both in the maritime and Inner
              Asian domain.</span></p>

              concerned by China’s rise. Though the Chinese bring lots of money to Mongolia
              in return for accessing its mineral resources in the Gobi desert, the threat
              that Mongolia too would eventually be swallowed by China, like what happened to
              Inner Mongolia, does exist. Therefore, only a powerful resurrection of Genghis
              Khan could expose many of the historical truths especially to debunk Chinese
              historical claims in Asia.</span></p>

              for maintaining the Asian balance of power. Clearly, India’s cultural presence
              in the midst of China and Russia is good for the Asian order. Mongolia is also
              nicely positioned in close proximity to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet,
              resource-rich Siberia, Russia’s Far East and North Korea. Thus, a benign Indian
              presence in Mongolia is geopolitically vital.</span></p>
