              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Anti-Buddhist Media and Myanmar: Complex Regional and
              Historical Dynamics</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Michiyo Tanabe and Lee Jay Walker, Modern Tokyo Times,
              November 25, 2016</span><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is illegal in Muslim nations like Saudi Arabia
              (however the same Sunni Islamist nation is intent on spreading Salafi Islam
              into the heart of Buddhism with the connivance of local 'Buddhist' politicians
              who act oblivious to the rapidly declining plight of Buddhism in traditional
              Buddhist countries) </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yangon, Myanmar -- The mass media in both the West and
              Islamic world needs to find space in order to simplify hatred. It matters not
              if turning a blind eye to Sunni Takfiri massacres in Syria and the nations that
              are endorsing this, nor that in Myanmar’s recent history more Christians than
              any other non-Buddhist faith group have been killed based on ethnic and
              religious tensions. Instead, the simple version – while negating the Christian
              angle – is that Muslims are killed and targeted by radical Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ironically, the latest chain of events began after Muslims
              killed nine police officers in Rakhine state. International Crisis Group
              reports, “The attacks were carried out by Muslims, according to both government
              statements and local sources. An unverified video of the attackers, filmed in
              the wake of the attacks, has been circulating on social networks and seems
              legitimate. In it, one of the group calls on “all Rohingya around the world to
              prepare for jihad and join them”. This, the need for local knowledge to carry
              out the assaults, and the difficulty of moving large numbers of people around
              this area are all suggestive of local Muslim involvement – possibly organized
              with some outside support. However, many details of who exactly organized this
              and how remain unclear.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Myanmar is blighted by many internal rebellions and is
              struggling on the path to democracy. Indeed, while the mass media is focused on
              the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, you have other continuing
              convulsions that are well outside Buddhist-Muslim issues. For example, Myanmar
              News reports, “About 3,000 Myanmar citizens fled across the border after the
              Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Myanmar
              National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Arakan Army (AA) staged a
              coordinated attack on military outposts, police stations, and a trade center in
              Muse and Kutkai townships. Ten people were killed and 33 others were injured
              during fighting on Nov. 20-22.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Free Burma Rangers equally highlights the recent conflict
              between central authorities and different ethnic groups – many who are mainly
              Christian. In this incidence, the Free Burma Rangers reports, “In the last
              month sporadic fighting in two separate incidents was reported in Central Shan
              State between the Burma Army and the Shan State Army-South (SSA-S). The clashes
              were deliberate actions by the Burma military and corresponded with the
              deployment and rotation of two separate Burma Army infantry battalions in the
              region. The attacks came within the first anniversary of the Nationwide
              Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), which was signed October 15th, 2015… The attacks
              caused thousands of people in the region to flee, with rangers reporting over
              2,000 people displaced and living in nearby IDP camps.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">UCA News reported last month, “At least 30,000 people from
              different faiths and ethnic groups were estimated to have taken part in a
              demonstration in Myanmar’s northern Kachin State on Oct. 22 where they demanded
              an end to military operations in the region… Protestors, including Catholic
              priests and nuns, held placards that read, “stop civil war” and “may there be
              peace in Myanmar” on the streets in Myitkyina, the capital city of Kachin
              State.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">UCA News continues, “The fighting between the Kachin
              Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar military in Kachin and Shan states is
              considered the most severe of the country’s four ongoing conflicts.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In other words, countless issues are underreported because it
              doesn’t suit the simplistic anti-Buddhist agenda in relation to the Rohingya
              Muslim crisis. Myanmar is clearly faced with countless ethnic and religious
              issues – alongside the road to democracy, countering poverty, narcotics, and
              the legacy of history. Despite this, the media is fixated on a one-dimensional
              approach – just like the mass media response to the crisis in Syria based on
              utterly biased reporting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a regional context it is abundantly clear that certain
              Buddhist clerics are disillusioned and aghast at the cleansing of Buddhists in
              the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, countless terrorist attacks by
              Islamists against Buddhists in Southern Thailand, the destruction of holy
              Buddhist places in Afghanistan by Sunni Takfiris, endless Han migration to Tibet
              in order to dilute the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, and other issues, for
              example Buddhism is illegal in nations like Saudi Arabia (the same Sunni
              Islamist nation is intent on spreading Salafi Islam into the heart of
              Buddhism). Therefore, from the point of view of Buddhist clerics in Myanmar who
              support the protection of Buddhism internationally, these regional and
              historical realities are being neglected by a simplified Western and Islamic
              media bias.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Internationally, Sunni Takfiri Islamists are killing various
              non-Muslim faith groups and minority Muslim sects, including the endless
              butchering of Shia Muslims in many nations. Similarly, while Hinduism is in
              free fall in Bangladesh and Pakistan, the opposite can’t be stated for Islam in
              India. In other words, the endless one-way civilization war equally applies to
              the Indian subcontinent. Not surprisingly, and with Buddhists being cleansed in
              neighboring nations, then militancy within Buddhist circles in Myanmar is
              deemed to be self-defensive. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After all, historically, Buddhists understand full well that
              Islamic invading armies destroyed countless numbers of holy Buddhist
              monasteries and places of learning over many centuries. Indeed, while Christian
              and Muslim slavery of black Africans is a historical reality, with Muslim
              slavery starting first on a major scale in Africa and ending last (still issues
              of slavery in Mauritania and in the recent history of Sudan), then the Buddhist
              view in certain circles in Myanmar is based on self-preservation, the need for
              an alternative voice to be heard, and to tackle mass distortions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Media outlets that condemn Buddhists in Myanmar are
              neglecting the reality of what Sharia Islamic law means to faith groups
              including Buddhists and Hindus. Are these religious minorities equal in Islamic
              Sharia states? Can Buddhist males freely marry Muslim females in nations like
              Saudi Arabia? The answers are obvious because non-Abrahamic faiths have been
              treated brutally under Islamic Sharia law throughout history. Likewise, in
              modern day Saudi Arabia if a Buddhist male fell in love with a Muslim Saudi
              female then he would face prison – or death in accordance with the tenets of
              Islamic Sharia. Yet, you don’t see major Western and Islamic media outlets
              stressing “Islamic fascism” and so forth but similar labels are aimed at
              Buddhist clerics in Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Similarly, in Myanmar – and nobody is negating that massacres
              have taken place against Muslims in this nation – the simple reality is that
              more Christians belonging to various ethnic groups, for example, the Chin,
              Karen, and Kachin, have been killed than any other non-Buddhist faith group.
              Despite this, over the many decades you never had the same outpouring of “good”
              against “evil,” or headlines stressing “Christian genocide” to anything like
              the degree of the Muslim focus in modern day Myanmar. In other words, an agenda
              by the Western and Islamic media is at hand whereby Sunni Takfiris will
              manipulate a biased media – just like the endless rhetoric against Syria – in
              order to propagate more Sunni Islamist militancy in nations like Bangladesh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Massacres and intimidation have happened on both sides in
              Myanmar but like Kosovo, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, you have a favorable Western
              and Sunni Muslim media joint angle opposed to the brutal one-sided other.
              Similarly, the Christian angle of alienation and persecution in Myanmar is
              being reduced to a completely different way of reporting. Once more the mass
              media is stoking fires based on the usual one-sided agenda. Therefore, Sunni
              Islamists in Bangladesh who are killing secularists, writers, and persecuting
              religious minorities, will gain from one-sided distortions. The same equally
              applies to the Sunni Islamist Takfiri agenda including ISIS (Islamic State –
              IS), al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and a plethora of other sectarian and
              terrorist groups – and to certain nations including Saudi Arabia that bans all
              non-Muslim holy places throughout the entire nation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Myanmar needs honest brokers to help this nation overcome
              decades of complex issues. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sabre rattling by the media and United Nations will only lead
              to further bloodshed because sooner or later international jihadists will enter
              the fray.</span></p>
