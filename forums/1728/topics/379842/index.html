              <p>It occured to me that the places I've ever been in life were all hazy like a dream, they came and went. Then I had a further realisation... even my thoughts too, are like a dream, they came and went in lightning speed. Our entire life is literally "like a dream, an illusion, a bubble or a shadow, like a dew or like lightning flash". It's all like a dream!</p>
              <p>And so... I dropped all my thoughts and at that moment, what's left? Only my own existence and presence... which is real and not hazy at all... which does not come and go, will never come to past and is always Present. And there is just this awareness of my own existence and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Just drop all your mental chattering, drop everything, and allow yourself to be filled with only this sense of existence or presence until you realize what existence is. This is then the beginning of true self knowledge beyond the duality of knower and known.</p>
              <p>Friends... life is literally like a dream.. if you haven't realised, whatever you experienced, did, achieved, gained or possessed, the relationships you cherish, or things you learnt in this life, including even your dharma knowledge... that has to be left behind when physical death comes. It is just like an illusion. If you do not know what is real then all is for naught. Don't waste your life away chasing after phantoms and dreams and not realise who you truly are.</p>

              <p>Here's something I found on another forum, thought of sharing it:</p>
              <p>DHARMA TALK ON ONE MIND<br><br>by Bassui Tokusho Zenji<br><br>If you
              would free yourself of the sufferings of the Six Realms, you must learn
              the direct way to become a Buddha. This way is no other than the
              realization of your own Mind. Now what is this Mind? It is the true
              nature of all sentient beings, that which existed before our parents
              were born and hence before our own birth, and which presently exists,
              unchangeable and eternal. So it is called one's Face before one's
              parents were born. This Mind is intrinsically pure. When we are born it
              is not newly created, and when we die it does not perish. It has no
              distinction of male or female, not has it any coloration of good or
              bad. It cannot be compared with anything, so it is called
              Buddha-nature. Yet countless thoughts issue from this Self-nature as
              waves arise in the ocean or as images are reflected in a mirror.<br><br>If
              you want to realize your own Mind, you must first of all look into the
              source from which thoughts flow. Sleeping and working, standing and
              sitting, profoundly ask yourself, "What is my own Mind?" with an
              intense yearning to resolve this question. This is called "training" or
              "practice" or "desire for truth" or "thirst for realization." What is
              termed Zazen is no more than looking into one's own mind. It is better
              to search your own mind devotedly than to read and recite innumerable
              sutras and dharani every day for countless years. Such endeavors, which
              are but formalities, produce some merit, but this merit expires and
              again you must experience the suffering of the Three Evil Paths.
              Because searching one's own mind leads ultimately to enlightenment,
              this practice is a prerequisite to becoming a Buddha. No matter whether
              you have committed either the ten evil deeds or the five deadly sins,
              still if you turn back your mind and enlighten yourself, you are a
              Buddha instantly. But do not commit sins and expect to be saved by
              enlightenment [from the effects of your own actions. Neither
              enlightenment] nor a Buddha nor a Patriarch can save a person who,
              deluding himself, goes down evil ways.<br><br>Imagine a child sleeping
              next to its parents and dreaming it is being beaten or is painfully
              sick. The parents cannot help the child no matter how much it suffers,
              for no one can enter the dreaming mind of another. If the child could
              awaken itself, it could be freed of this suffering automatically. In
              the same way, one who realizes that his own Mind is Buddha frees
              himself instantly from the sufferings arising from [ignorance of the
              law of] ceaseless change of birth-and-death. If a Buddha could prevent
              it, do you think he would allow even one sentient being to fall into
              hell? Without Self-Realization one cannot understand such things as
              these.<br><br>What kind of master is it that this very moment sees
              colors with the eyes and hears voices with the ears, that now raises
              the hands and moves the feet? We know these are functions of our own
              mind, but no one knows precisely how they are performed. It may be
              asserted that behind these actions there is no entity, yet it is
              obvious they are being performed spontaneously. Conversely, it may be
              maintained that these are the acts of some entity; still the entity is
              invisible. If one regards this question as unfathomable, all attempts
              to reason [out an answer] will cease and one will be at a loss to know
              what to do. In this propitious state deepen and deepen the yearning,
              tirelessly, to the extreme. When the profound questioning penetrates to
              the very bottom, and that bottom is broken open, not the slightest
              doubt will remain that your own Mind is itself Buddha, the
              Void-universe. There will then be no anxiety about life or death, no
              truth to search for.<br><br>In a dream you may stray and lose your way
              home. You ask someone to show you how to return or you pray to God or
              Buddhas to help you, but still you can't get home. Once you rouse
              yourself from your dream-state, however, you find that you are in your
              own bed and realize that the only way you could have gotten home was to
              awaken yourself. This (kind of spiritual awakening] is called "return
              to the origin" or "rebirth in paradise." It is the kind of inner
              realization that can be achieved with some training. Virtually all who
              like Zazen and make an effort in practice, be they laymen or monks, can
              experience to this degree. But even such [partial] awakening cannot be
              attained except through the practice of Zazen. You would be making a
              serious error, however, were you to assume that this was true
              enlightenment in which there is no doubt about the nature of reality.
              You would be like a man who having found copper gives up the desire for
              gold.<br><br>Upon such realization question yourself even more
              intensely in this wise: "My body is like a phantom, like bubbles on a
              stream. My mind, looking into itself, is as formless as empty-space,
              yet somewhere within sounds are perceived. Who is hearing?" Should you
              question yourself in this wise with profound absorption, never
              slackening the intensity of your effort, your rational mind eventually
              will exhaust itself and only questioning at the deepest level will
              remain. Finally you will lose awareness of your own body. Your
              long-held conceptions and notions will perish, after absolute
              questioning, in the way that every drop of water vanishes from a tub
              broken open at the bottom, and perfect enlightenment will follow like
              flowers suddenly blooming on withered trees.<br><br>With such
              realization you achieve true emancipation. But even now repeatedly cast
              off what has been realized, turning back to the subject that realizes,
              that is, to the root bottom, and resolutely go on. Your Self-nature
              will then grow brighter and more transparent as your delusive feelings
              perish, like a gem gaining luster under repeated polishing, until at
              last it positively illumines the entire universe. Don't doubt this!
              Should your yearning be too weak to lead you to this state in your
              present lifetime, you will undoubtedly gain Self-realization easily in
              the next, provided you are still engaged in this questioning at death,
              just as yesterday's work half done was finished easily today.<br><br>While
              you are doing Zazen neither despise nor cherish the thoughts that
              arise; only search your own mind, the very source of these thoughts.
              You must understand that anything appearing in your consciousness or
              seen by your eyes is an illusion, of no enduring reality. Hence you
              should neither fear nor be fascinated by such phenomena. If you keep
              your mind as empty as space, unstained by extraneous matters, no evil
              spirits can disturb you even on your deathbed. While engaged in Zazen,
              however, keep none of this counsel in mind. You must only become the
              question "What is this Mind?" or "What is it that hears these sounds?"
              When you realize this Mind you will know that it is the very source of
              all Buddhas and sentient beings. The Bodhisattva Kannon is so called
              because he attained enlightenment by perceiving -i.e., grasping the
              source of the sounds of the world about him.<br><br>At work, at rest,
              never stop trying to realize who it is that hears. Even though your
              questioning becomes almost unconscious, you won't find the one who
              hears, and all your efforts will come to naught. Yet sounds can be
              heard, so question yourself to an even profounder level. At last every
              vestige of self-awareness will disappear and you will feel like a
              cloudless sky. Within yourself you will find no "I," nor will you
              discover anyone who hears. This Mind is like the void, yet it hasn't a
              single spot that can be called empty. This state is often mistaken for
              Self-realization. But continue to ask yourself even more intensely,
              "Now who is it that hears?" If you bore and bore into this question,
              oblivious to anything else; even this feeling of voidness will vanish
              and you will be unaware of anything-total darkness will prevail. [Don't
              stop here, but] keep asking with all your strength, "What is it that
              hears?" Only when you have completely exhausted the questioning will
              the question burst; now you will feel like a man come back from the
              dead. This is true realization. You will see the Buddhas of all the
              universes face to face and the Patriarchs past and present. Test
              yourself with this koan: "A monk asked Joshu: 'What is the meaning of
              Bodhidharma's coming to China?' Joshu replied: 'The oak tree in the
              garden.' " Should this koan leave you with the slightest doubt, you
              need to resume questioning, "What is it that hears?"<br><br>If you
              don't come to realization in this present life, when will you? Once you
              have died you won't be able to avoid a long period of suffering in the
              Three Evil Paths. What is obstructing realization? Nothing but your own
              half-hearted desire for truth. Think of this and exert yourself to the
              utmost.</p>
