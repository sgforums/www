              <p>I attended once before. It is called æ�¯é¾™æ³•ä¼š (appease the naga). Naga is referring to dragons and serpents (è›‡ç²¾). We believe that either we had offended or ancestors had offended these beings in our past or present life without our knowing. These beings will disturb our peace (sickness, life not smooth sailing etc.). This puja is to appease these beings so that life will be peaceful and sickness especially skin disease will be cured.</p>

              <p>you donate $$$ will do lor.  The puja can be done for you.  Money can make the world go round.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My main concern is who is hosting the puja .  Any proper lineage. So many fake lama nowadays.  Many rinpoche who claims lineage but they could be cult .  Have to check their backgrounds properly whether they are from any traditional tantric lineage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I attended one before but it is a treasure vase that you can throw into the sea to pray for health and wealth from Naga (dragon kings).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's a very happy journey out to sea.  We offer jasmine flowers, milk and hata and a treasure vase.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I understand it is effective for skin disease like eczema which the doctor say currently there is still  no cure. My family also has history of serious eczema problem. I chant åœ°è—�ç»� and when my family members get better, I chant å�—æ— åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨. My family members recovered completely from serious eczema after suffering for many years.</p>
              <p>However, don't expect immediate effect,<em> </em>I saw the effect after 7 times of chanting but complete cures came after about half a year. I always encourage people with incurable diseases to chant åœ°è—�ç»� or recite å�—æ— åœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨. It really works if one does with sincerity but must be patient to see the result.</p>
              <p>I think there is no way to pray to naga without attending personally unless someone goes on your behalf. That person has to visualise you while praying to the nagas. That was what I did for one of my family member who could not attend the last time I attended.</p>

              <p>non-attendees are people who can't attend . I throw their purchased vases for them because too many vases and not enough hands to throw into the sea.</p>
              <p>When did i say i attend the prayer on behalf of them?  Maybe the word "strangers" will let you be more understanding?</p>
              <p>and i am not the only one who helped the strangers who didn't attend to throw their vases</p>
              <p>The Gullimard temple is the rare one doesn't accept money for non-attendee.  But most of the temples will still accept .  You don't expect a patient in coma to attend any prayer events himself, do you.</p>

              <p>non-attendees are people who can't attend . I throw their purchased vases for them because too many vases and not enough hands to throw into the sea.</p>

              <p>Then, the patient's loved ones should help. If there is nobody and if it is not effective to just pay but not attending so why do it. I believe if there is special case like really no one to attend, the people in this temple is kind enough to do special arrangement but I believe this special arrangment is troublesome to do for all but a few should be ok.</p>

              <p><br>you are assuming all patients have loved ones?  there are many left alone to die .</p>
              <p>you are assuming all patients' friends/relatives believe in buddhist praying? there are many who will argue theirs' beliefs are the real ones.  Pushing the other idea out.</p>
              <p>If you can get to pay $$$ and join in auspicious event without obstacle, consider it a blessing liao.</p>
