              Theravada meditation teacher: I see it as THE opportunity of life times.
               3:23 AM |  Posted by Elena |  
              
              Hello Elena,
              
              Thank you for your willingness to look at this. I admire and respect
              your dedication toward helping others.
              
              A little about my back ground. I have been practicing meditation
              consistently for over fifteen years and have been teaching meditation
              and Buddhist principles for seven of those. I am an ordained Buddhist
              minister, but shy away from the ritualistic practices of the Buddhism.
              I teach three or four times per week to help people find a solution to
              ease their troubles, I have literally gone through hundreds and hundreds
              of meditation students. I have written several books an the subject, and
              lead by example by practicing sitting meditation a lot! but! No one, to
              my knowledge, is waking up! there is no permanent liberation to be
              found. No body, including myself, is getting truly free.
              
              In my personal practice I have seen improvements in clarity and
              understanding of selflessness. I have a love for the truth. That is what
              motivates me. I have the determination to look in side and see what is
              not there. There are moments of seeing through the illusion but it does
              not stick. There is this self talk that says "this is a gradual path,
              just relax and it will come" and then there is the other inner voice
              that says " you don't have much time, get this done with, see through
              the illusion of the 'I' NOW and for ever and really help others".
              
              I enjoy teaching, but even more, there is the inner drive to help people
              through there suffering, ( you have this same drive). I understand that
              the suffering that is so prevalent in the people I meet is from the the
              false identity of "self". Although to truly liberate others, I should
              first be free from this illusion my self other wise It seems like I am
              teaching people what I know and that seems to be how to relax the body
              and still the mind.
              
              I am needing a push. I know it is possible get beyond this wall. I wish
              to see the truth and have it last and stick. I want to hear that SNAP in
              the back of the head and know that I really qualify to talk to others
              about what their life can be like once liberated. I know that what you
              and the others are doing here works, and see it as THE opportunity of
              life times.
              
              
              
              Elena: I appreciate your honesty, Shawn. This what will get you through: be willing to re-examine your immediate experience what is what. Â As meditator you can break up your experience on components, right? So lets just do that. Look at "I" right now and tell me what you see. One by one, anything that arises - write. 
              
              
              
              Shane: When looked at, "I" seems to arise and fall away. Such as, when something has to be done or when a mind state is noticed it seems to be more present. Just now when searching for a way to communicate this the "I" did not seem to be present. So there seems to be a strong "I" should do this or "I" will be doing or "I" did that. But, it does seem to come and go. Oh! one strong thing I just realized, is that when I noticed that you called me Shawn instead of Shane, a sense of Shaken identity or a grasping at the "I" arose.
              
              
              
              Elena: It's strong, this grasping. I called Robert S."Bob" and the same happened! Look how label Shane is just the same as label "I". it's just a label.Â 
              
              What is Shane? A word/thought + emotions+sensation.Â 
              What is "I"? A word/though + emotions + sensations.
              
              Thought - exist
              Emotions - exist
              Sensations - exist
              
              Shawn - just a label
              I - just a label
              
              Look in this direction.
              
              Let me know what comes up.
              
              
              
              Shane: It is noticed right away that what comes up is a feeling of tension or uneasiness. The label is just there. Thought Â triggers emotion and sensation the result is this uneasiness.
              
              
              
              Elena: Shane is a label, as Shawn too! So we have this feeling arising when the label is a little off. You are Theravada guy, you can break up the experience and see:
              - feeling - yes
              - uncomfortable sensations - yes
              - associated thoughts - yes
              
              me? - no
              
              where is the self in all of that?
              
              sense of self - yes
              actual self - no
              
              but again, you can look deep what sense of self is -
              
              all the same thoughts, sensations, feeling
              
              Please look at all this, and write to me what's going on
              
              You are very close, can't be otherwise with all your experience...
              
              ...which is not yours. Just is.
              
              Experience is. The thought "I" "mine" comes and claims the experience.
              
              Sharing just happening, you know. Are you doing it? No.You know, it's just a movement that get's expressed in particular way. So why anything else should be different?
              
              Ask yourself, ask where you hang on. What is that?Â 
              Please, do not go into equanimity, go hot and desperate and ask. "Where the hell I am clinging??!!" Â ASK! 
              
              
              
              Shane: There is a strong feeling that staying with the immediate experience is key here. This being the only reality there is. The only place where we can find true honesty of any situation. So, with the arising of a thought, there seems to be the co-arising or the manipulation of the already present emotions and sensations. [this can sound deeper than it really is, can't it] it is just what it is. These things happen and they are not me as long as I do not try to attach a story to all of it. It occurs to me that even if attaching a story to these arising things, it still is not the truth. just a false label that is applied to the process of thought-emotions-sensations or as you said, what is what.
              
              
              
              Elena: What you wrote to me was more like a discourse, Shane. We both don't need that, really. Let's do this. I will push, you look, you come back and answer EXACTLY what was asked. Â You try your best not to analyze, otherwise I would have to slap you, Shane, even though I do respect all your experience, but at the same time, I would not be doing what I am doing, if I would just listen to you. I trust what's arising here, so if I read and I feel no interest, no concentration in what you wrote to me, I trust that. Was it great insight? Maybe, but I don't care. I keep very narrow focus, and won't step even one step sideways. Tell me if it is ok with you, and if you are willing to stay to the end? And if you are willing to stop reading no-self, non-duality staff while with me, if you are willing to have raw emotions, and if you are willing to look at them in the way i ask you.Â 
              I am going to wait for your answer.
              
              
              
              Shane: Yes Elena, lets do this. no reading stuff and raw emotions. I read your question as "Where the hell am I clinging??!!" Â So I am just going to just write here....this is tough because I feel as if there is something that I should be fighting off, like beating down with a stick to get ride of it, but Â don't know what it is for sure.
              
              
              
              Elena: You did not answer my question, Shane.Â 
              Here it is again:
              â€œAsk yourself, ask where you hang on. What is that? Please, do not go into equanimity, go hot and desperate and ask. "Where the hell I am clinging??!!" Â ASK.â€� 
              
              
              
              Shane: to an attempt to be that intelligent, charming, funny, nice hard working guy. But wonder what all of that is. Is it the "I" or is it just the way i see the personality or want is it? Seems strange but i seem to be looking for something to let go of, something bad or wrong and find it frustrating not knowing what it is.
              
              
              
              Elena: I want to know if you asked. What did you do? Did you look up in your habitual way (not bad, or good here), just habitual. For you it may be subtle, since you used to look, divide, dissect.
              
              Here how it goes with Theravada people: they focus their attention, divide the experience, look, understand, etc. What's wrong with this?
              That self, that is in the middle of each step.
              
              You came to me and said : I feel this dissatisfaction, I feel the search is still going, I have a burning desire to see the truth to help others. It is very noble intention, very cool. And its great you know it is possible. It means that it is possible for you. Any moment.
              
              So when I tell you ask yourself where you hang on,
              
              here is what you do:
              
              You understand that this is essential for youÂ 
              to see the truth.
              With that understanding and strong intention,Â 
              to the point of desperation,Â 
              like this is the last question of you life -Â 
              only oneÂ 
              and then you die,Â 
              you -
              ASK
              
              then you become very quite,Â 
              another words,Â 
              shut up the habitual thinking, analyzing, any meditation - whatever you are doing
              
              completely shut it off
              
              and listen
              Shane: "The clinging could be..."
              
              so I won't here "could be" or "should be" - it must be clearly seeing
              
              Let's do it again.
              
              
              
              Shane: I did just as you asked....It is being! it is continually trying to be some thing or some one. A relentless trying to be this or that. A teacher, an author, a humanitarian what ever...it is being. NOT to let it be.... but to be somebody. I will have to let this settle to see if there is something more. but there are tears...
              
              
              
              Elena: so now look plainly, physically, with 2 eyes and see that being-ness is going, regardless of you trying to be, tensing in this "somebody" or that oneâ€¦it's just is. And tensing/contracting is that beinng-ness too. There is no you. Regardless of how being-ness presenting itself. No you. Just as a label, yes. Actual you - not at all. Nada. Look that this being-ness does not require you as an entity there to manage it's flow. Look at the baby. When baby is born there is only being, being-ness there. Baby is one with it's environment. Baby cries out of sensations of hunger, movement happens toward the breast. Where is self in all that? None. Something happens later when baby start to associate the sensations, the body with himself - "I", "mine". All experience now is divided and labeled. But what's true? There is no separation, no entity. So all life now this paradox is trying to resolve itself. This is the suffering - the turmoil of dissatisfaction, of seeking, of feeling incomplete, feeling of something missing. Until the label seeing again as a label, not the owner of the house. The owner never was there, just an illusion. Can you look now and tell me what you see. Look right at your experience. What is there?
              
              
              
              Shane: The experience right now! is that there is the world being the world with its sounds and colors. Sense information coming into this body. Everything is happening as it should. No surprises. When just sitting here seeing and looking at this, It feels like there is no one pushing. just looking is happening.
              
              
              
              Elena: great. Look now. Answer me this:
              
              Is there you in any shape or form in the reality?
              
              
              
              Shane: I looked and looked...there is body, like Â flesh and bones. but, no owner of this stuff.
              
              
              
              Elena: do you exist?
              
              
              
              Shane: No, there isn't anything existing. nothing there to claim it existences. Funny... nothing there to even claim it doesn't exist.
              
              
              
              Elena: hahahaha! You made me laugh! So then what is "I" really?
              
              
              
              Shane: Its just a label, really a mistake. like seeing a shadow and thinking its real, but nothing to see. Okay, like thinking of a shadow and believing its real.
              
              
              
              Elena: What is happening now? Tell me what do you see.
              
              
              
              Shane: There is just seeing, thoughts are happening, the body is being the body, there are sounds, and actually very pleasant emotions coming from the not being or not having to be that was mentioned earlier. [that's when they started] The body is just sitting and mostly just simply doing.
              
              
              
              Elena: Ok, great, my friend Shane. And now - chop that wood: lead the classes, wash the dishes, write a book! Let's keep in touch, please write if anything, ok? Much love to you. Big warm hug!Â 
              
              
              
              Shane: A very joyful Thank you! thank you! thank you! you are wonderful, like magic. Your words cut through the crap and into the heart of it. Things are very clear now! If you need anything please let me know. And please keep doing this work, it just might be our only hope.
              Much love to you! and a big WARM hug back (it was over100 Degrees here again today)
              
              Love, Shane
              
              
              
              Elena: Thank you for your love. It was really an honor. You can help many people, even though we both know that all is right, and what is happening - happening, and there is no teacher or student, or people to help, but also this play is happening - in teacher and students, and help needed, and push needed, and whatever - all so intricate, so amazingâ€¦play along! And now you can really go into marketplace. So much love to you, Shane!
              We will be in touch, of cause!Â

              Not everyone on the ruthlesstruth roll realized anatta. There can also be different levels of understanding. It depends so I cannot speak for all. I don't think shane's understanding is conceptual.
                                
              @jui: unless they contemplate and learn buddha's teachings, it is difficult to gain furtther clarity beyond what they realized. Right view is very important. As Thusness said, tho RT people have realization, they don't know the "next step".
                                
              Thusness asked me not to spread ruthless truth here for this reason. However I think direct path pointing is very effective and powerful (I and thusness ourselves followed similar approaches even before hearing ruthlesstruth) so I think there are some merits and inspiration from their approaches.

              <p>what i like about this approach is that it is completely open and lets everyone get a chance at liberation ... the path is not that difficult or far-away and not exclusive and everyone has a chance.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Nice article. I copied it out for those who are interested.I talked to people who are non Buddhists, they found it difficult to understand what does Buddha mean by "no I". They began to agree with Buddha when I told them that we could not control our body from aging, falling sick etc. Though this is not the essence but only the basic. At least they agree that the bodies are not ours because we have no control over it.</span></p>
              <h2><span style="color: #000000;">Classical Liberation</span></h2>
              <p>Many refer to the various Buddhist practices, as well as the eastern non-Buddhist practices, as the classical approaches to Liberation. In many cases, this is seen as the only way.</p>
              <p>The primary tool, along with morality and wisdom, in reaching the reward in these classical approaches is the practice of meditation. Meditation allows one to go within and begin the work needed to better understand what is happening with the mind and body.</p>
              <p>Throughout the Buddhist discourses, we can find teachings that point to ultimate reality. This ultimate reality is the understanding of Anatta or non-self. In an early Buddhist discourse called the “Anattalakkhana Sutta” [SN 21.59], translated as non-self characteristic, the Buddha clearly points out that there is “no self” or no ownership of the body, our feelings, perceptions, thoughts or consciousness.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He made it clear that if we actually owned these things, we would be able to control our emotions and also have the ability to fully control sickness as well as stop the aging and death process of the body. Since everything is in continual instability, impermanent, and in a constant state of change, there cannot be any control outside of being free from the desire to be in control in the first place.</span></p>
              <p>In the “Anattalakkhana Sutta” the Buddha said the realization of non-self brings about a series of mental events that lead to Liberation. This results in freedom from the desire for control. This Liberation is our freedom from suffering. The Buddha stated that once non-self is seen, there is disenchantment with the body and mind. This turns into a dispassion that produces a release.</p>
              <p>This release is the un-fettering or un-chaining from the very things that have been preventing freedom. This is the release from the attachment to the self.</p>
              <p>With the ending of the attachment to the self, comes the ending of striving for completion or for the personal fulfillment to become something other than what we presently are.</p>
              <p>There is a simple saying that goes like this: “No self, no problem.” This is a true statement in the respect that when problems arise and are confronted with an absence of self, these so called problems are seen more as a situation and furthermore as simply an experience and nothing personal. The result is that it is much easier to be a part of this thing called life.</p>
              <p>The Buddha obviously wanted everyone to realize non-self and to see through the illusion of the self. This was his life’s work.</p>
              <p>He did this work for fifty years. He had many methods of pointing this out to people. He knew some people had to sincerely practice meditation to help them see this realization, and he also had his very effective direct approaches. It is mentioned in the “Bahiya Sutta” that at one time while the Buddha was in a hurry, he was approached by an ascetic called Bahiya who had asked for a teaching that would liberate him.</p>
              <p>The Buddha then quickly said only what was necessary to awaken Bahiya:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>"Then, Bahiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bahiya, there is no you in terms of that. When there is no you in terms of that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.”</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In the Buddha’s quick instructions is a method for realizing non-self. Through hearing these words, Bahiya was liberated. He got the “push” that was needed at the proper time.</p>
              <p>Getting the push at the right time seems to be the key for many practitioners. People are “Waking Up” as if they were on a razor’s edge, teetering between confusion and Liberation. Many people only need a push in the right direction to fall onto the side of clarity and truth and a realization of who they are or are not.</p>
              <p>Each of us has a duty to fulfill. This duty is to move toward Liberation from the bindings of the identity with the self and the problems this false identity causes. This can be a part of whatever practice you currently have.</p>
              <p>Meditation is a wonderful method to prepare one for Liberation. It seems to clear the way for selfless reality as it unfolds. Many long-time meditators report “Waking Up” quickly and suddenly by the mere insight that arises from that push in the form of a proposed question or during a dialogue.</p>
              <p>The practice of meditation seems to help the process, but some feel it is not essential since people have “Woken Up” without any prior practice of formal meditation.</p>
              <p>Contemplation and inquiry, whether in or out of formal meditation, seems to be very beneficial, and there are likely many other practices not mentioned here that help prepare one for Liberation.</p>
              <p>It must be said at this time that the biggest deterrent; the greatest thing that prevents Awakening, is the belief that it cannot happen right now! With this false belief, you will not stand a chance.</p>
              <p>Liberation. It can happen. It is happening, and it is available NOW!</p>

              <p>I'm not sure what you mean by concluding.</p>
              <p>However when the realization that There is no You hits you, then the view of self is seen to be delusional. It is not a conclusion based on inference, but a seeing through of a delusion as delusion.</p>

              By not concluding - it is implied that one remains open to being ''receiving'', open to being ''receptive'' and it is simply flowing - like a river, the only certainty is that of being ... of course, the human mind is such that it will try to capture and hold it and make it permanent. The only permanent thing is that of changing and yet not changing (it is a phenomenon of paradox!
              
              Ps - when one has knowledge or comes with knowledge of eg, what is success, what is nirvana, one's knowledge is bound to impinge/encroach on isness of ...There are no absolutes and i say that cos as long as one is in the mind-body one may interpret according to one's idea of. Knowing cannot happen in memory or the imagination. The latter is psychological and the knowing is a here-now phenomenon.

              <p>One thing I have understood over the years is that practicing being Here/Now is not the same as realizing 'there is no you'.</p>
              <p>I have read The Power of Now in 2006, have experienced Presence on and off since, but it is not only until 2010 that I have realized the truth about no-self.</p>
              <p>When no self is realized, one does not need to place effort to maintain 'suchness'... without the sense of a seer, perceiver, agent, naturally experience becomes direct, intimate, non-dual, immediate, etc.</p>
              <p>But it is not by cultivating the 'non-dual, immediate' but rather it is the natural result of seeing through the delusion, leaving the experience of suchness without the delusion of an experiencer.</p>

              Thanks, I did go thru the site that u had recommended ....yes, it is relatively true but as I have mentioned before, there are no absolutes and each and everyone who purports to practice or not practice - and this is my experince and that is that all methods are traps and of course, one cannot ignore methods but being conscious of these does make a difference.
              I say that cos many a times one assumes that one looks at a person or things or ... as ti is but seldom does it transpire, what transpires is that of imposing one's color on what is transpiring.
              As for practices, i dont practice anything and to not read much though I am familiar with  such authors, saints or whatever they are perceived to be.
              I dont believe/disbeilive nor do i agree or disagree !

              <p>He he..</p>
              <p>My theory is that i wasted too much time in I AM phase. Had someone pointed out earlier, i wouldn't have beat around the bush for so long. As for Thusness's pointing out, I am very grateful.. because it opened up a pathway for further progress. I just don't wish someone go through such wasteful journey as mine :)</p>
              <p>Personally, my thinking is that I AM phase has its importance in getting one to realised the all-pervading and 'deathless' nature. As for someone realising no-self (straight), he/she may not have the benefit of such a strong conviction in deathlessness. However, my idea is that for such practitioners, they will eventually come face to face with deathlessness... in the later stage of the path. For the pure I AM realiser, this definite realisation of deathlessness comes first.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion only.</p>

              coming, going, movement, location, like the universe is a process
              of activities dissolving moment by moment... there isnt even 'a
              universe'...<br> (12:15 AM) Thusness: no<br> taht is completely wrong<br> after anatta, u r able to experience whatever arises directly<br> feel wholely<br> (12:17 AM) AEN: yea<br> (12:17 AM) Thusness: yet u are still contracting<br> ur entirely body is imprint to hold<br> (12:17 AM) AEN: oic<br> (12:18 AM) Thusness: letting go non-dually means allow whatever
              arises to let go<br> (12:19 AM) AEN: ic..<br> (12:19 AM) Thusness: means ur body and mind must let go<br> by its own accord, non-dually<br> not by disassociation<br> practice this<br> (12:21 AM) AEN: oic..<br> (12:21 AM) Thusness: ur mind, ur thoughts, ur body<br> without ground, without center, without essence<br> like painting on a pond</p>
              <p><br> Another conversation with Thusness.</p>
              <p><br> AEN: Simpo advise people to go straight to realise anatta and
              bypass I AM. Do u think it is advisable?<br> Thusness: This is one area I hv been thinking. The main issue is
              the degree of luminosity. But in no mind or AF, we see such
              experience too.<br> AEN: Oic... I realise anatta in ruthlesstruth is rare. Most people
              are talking about impersonality, not even non dual. After talking
              with them, I find that people still don't experience or realize no
              dualistic separation.<br> Thusness: Anatta is about right view...<br> AEN: Ic.. Ciaran realized no self right. Except most of his
              students don't... Not even non dual<br> Thusness: Yes. Unfortunately, he cannot clearly discern the
              grayscale of no-self (comments: i.e. impersonality, non-dual,
              anatta)<br> AEN: yeah</p>
