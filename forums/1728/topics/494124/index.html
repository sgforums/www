              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is only when we confront and accept the heart of darkness within ourselves that
              we can shatter the walls of ego that divides us from others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the mid-1980s my Otani University adviser, Professor Shunsho Terakawa, gave a
              public lecture after an old friend and schoolmate of his died of cancer. The
              two had attended a school together outside the city of Hiroshima, and on a rare
              day off from classes, August 6, 1945, they decided to take a bus into the city
              to hang out there. The 8 o’clock bus was packed, so they waited for the next
              bus. Then, at about the time the first bus would have arrived in the city, they
              heard and felt the impact of the atomic bomb and saw its mushroom cloud.
              Wanting to know what had happened, they started walking toward the city. What
              they found was utter destruction: overwhelming numbers of people for blocks and
              blocks lay dead and dying. Professor Terakawa described the people walking out
              of the city as frightening sights: some had swatches of burned skin hanging off
              their bodies and eyeballs falling out of their sockets. He and his friend were
              totally helpless, knowing there was nothing they could do for any of the people
              crying out in pain and fear. It was too much for him to process as a teenager,
              but the memories of that day later shaped the direction and depth of his
              religious studies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              remember that the title of his public lecture was Ningen no mumyo, which
              translates as “The Darkness (mumyo) of (no) Humanity (ningen).” He spoke of the
              atomic bombings not as the doing of one particular country against another but
              as the vicious actions of human beings upon our fellow human beings. In this
              way, Professor Terakawa had entered the mind of Prince Siddhartha sitting under
              the Bodhi tree. In the prince’s self-examination, he was forced to confront
              himself as the cruel warrior, no different from his father and all the kings
              before and after him, kings who commanded their armies to rain destruction on
              any clan, village, or kingdom that posed a threat to their prosperity.
              According to the Japanese Shin Buddhist teacher Haya Akegarasu’s retelling of
              the Agamas (early Buddhist scriptures), when the prince recognized this
              bloodthirsty horror in the depth of his being, he shouted, “Avidya!” Though
              what Buddhists call “the awakening” arose with that shout, there are different
              interpretations of what the word meant.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we accept the usual English translation of the Sanskrit word avidya as
              “ignorance,” it follows that Siddhartha awoke to the fact he was not-knowing
              (a-vidya) reality correctly. Vidya can indicate the concept of “knowing” but
              that meaning comes out of “seeing, understanding” (i.e., making sense of what
              you see). When avidya was translated into Chinese, it became two characters: wu
              (not) and ming (seen clearly, brightness). This is mu-myo in Japanese
              pronunciation. This understanding of avidya as not-bright, or not-seen-clearly,
              has a different connotation from the typical English translation of
              “ignorance.” It became a tradition in East Asian Buddhism to define
              Siddhartha’s awakening not by the dispelling of his previous ignorance but by
              the direct confrontation with what was “not-bright” (mumyo) deep within
              himself—the visceral realization of his ability to inflict pain on others.
              Prince Siddhartha became the awakened Buddha when he saw his own avidya, his
              own dark heart and mind (mumyo), rather than merely his “ignorance.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Jodo Shinshu (“Pure Land True Essence”), or Shin Buddhism, this radical stance
              is emphasized. Whereas other paths say that you can practice your way out of
              the heart of darkness, Shin Buddhists aspire to come to grips with our own
              warrior nature. We aspire to keep investigating all the ways we use to separate
              ourselves from others and dismiss the worth of their lives. We aspire to “own”
              all evils, so that we cannot use morality as a yardstick to justify our
              condemnation of other living beings. In the Tannisho, Shinran (1172–1263), our
              tradition’s founder, is recorded as saying, “Given karmic conditions, I could
              do anything.” In 20th-century terms, what he meant was, “I could be Adolf
              Hitler.” In study sessions with my students, I used to ask, “Can you see Hitler
              being born in the Pure Land?” Now I realize the real issue is this: only when I
              can see myself as Hitler will I truly be born in the Pure Land. “Namu Amida
              Butsu” [a chant also known as the nembutsu, Shin Buddhism’s central practice]
              is a call for me to come just as I am, with my heart of mumyo, darkness.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is only when one identifies totally with mumyo, the heart of darkness, that the
              walls of the proud ego-self are shattered and the true light of wisdom can
              shine through in one’s actions. In the Pure Land tradition we find inspiration
              and guidance in the lives of those, known and unknown, who have treated all
              people—including the common folk as well as criminals and outcasts—with
              respect.</span></p>
