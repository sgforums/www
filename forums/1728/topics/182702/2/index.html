(pride, ego, anger, hatred, confusion? why like that?) its not easy.... but if one continues to be in these lamenting thoughts, you are already starting to live in hell becos of anger and hatred. you should also think what makes you unable to be a good buddhist and what's hindering you? go to the root problem of ignorance - that's when you practice diligently as a buddhist and study &amp; understand buddha's teachings.<br></div>
