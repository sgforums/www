            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DEDICATING FOR DONORS - 2006</strong><br><br>Hundreds of Singaporeans made donations to Sravasti Abbey during Ven. ChodronÂ’s recent visit there. Their enthusiasm to see the Dharma spread in the West was inspiring. Many Singaporeans requested that Abbey residents pray for their recovery from illness, good health and long life, elimination of obstacles and success, and for the good rebirth of their deceased relatives. Others offered funds for an acre or half acre of land; some offered lights on the altar. On May 12Â—Vesak Day according to the Chinese calendarÂ—Sravasti Abbey residents and guests did the Lama Chopa puja during which they created positive potential that they dedicated for the well-being of all sentient beings and in particular for their Singaporean donors and other benefactors. We were happy that two Singaporean FOSA supportsÂ—Leng Poh and JillianÂ—were with us for the event.<br><br><img src="http://www.sravastiabbey.org/images/may06pujaJillian.jpg"><br>We set up another altar in addition to the main one in our meditation hall on which we placed offerings especially for this pujs. Here Jillian is making offerings on behalf of all Singaporean donors<br><br><img src="http://www.sravastiabbey.org/images/may06pujaparticipants.jpg"><br>Tracy, Jan, Pema, and Leng Poh finalize who will do what during the puja<br><br><img src="http://www.sravastiabbey.org/images/may06pujaTC.jpg"><br>Ven.

Dhammika<br><br><img src="http://www.bdms.org.sg/Images/ven_d.jpg"><br><br>Venerable Shravasti Dhammika was born in Australia in 1951 into a Christian family, and converted to Buddhism at the age of eighteen.  In 1973 he went to Thailand with the intention of becoming a monk but was unimpressed by what he saw in the monasteries there.  He then went to Laos, Burma and finally to India.  For the next three years, he traveled around India learning yoga and meditation, and finally ordaining as a monk under Venerable Matiwella Sangharatna, the last disciple of Anagarika Dharmapala.  In 1976 he went to Sri Lanka where he studied Pali at Sri Lanka Vidyalaya, and later became one of the co-founders and a teacher, of Nilambe Meditation Centre in Kandy.  Since then, he has spent most of his time in Sri Lanka and Singapore. Bhante Dhammika, as he is known to his students and friends had written over twenty-five books and scores of articles on Buddhism and related subjects.  He is also well-known for his public talks and represented Theravada Buddhism at the European Buddhist Millennium Conference in Berlin in 2000.  Apart from Buddhist philosophy and meditation, Bhante Dhammika has a deep interest in the historical topography of Buddhism and the phenomenon of pilgrimage and has traveled widely in India and other Buddhist lands.  His others interests include Indian history, art and botany. </span></div>
