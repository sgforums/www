            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is gaining wide appeal across the globe. The large international membership of the World Buddhist Sangha Council is clear evidence. There are a growing number of internet sites that offer information about Buddhism. Many companies produce music, videos, and multi-media educational material on Buddhism. Buddhism has even influenced pop culture and permeated into the psyche of the masses. In Singapore too, Buddhism has not only retained its relevance, but is gaining popularly. Between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of Singaporeans above 15 years old who are Buddhists increased from 31% to 43%, the largest increase amongst all major religions. Dharma talks in Singapore are now also conducted in English, to reach out to young Singaporeans, including professionals. Devotees today do not just visit the temples to pray. They are eager to delve deeper into the Buddhist scriptures and reflect upon their philosophical and spiritual significance<br><br><a href="http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm</a></div>

This was followed by a series of daily lectures and demonstrations lasting three months. The Buddha's explanations were given to the complete satisfaction of everyone present.<br><br>It is most remarkable that when reduced to basic principles, many statements in the Buddhist scriptures are in line with modern scientific discoveries. Buddhism is scientific in that it combines objective observation, experiment and analysis in the spirit of free inquiry.<br><br>Buddhism is beyond Science as it can contribute to modern life by providing the moral and spiritual guide for the individual in our increasingly technological and materialistic age, showing us the path to True Happiness. As Einstein said, "Religion without Science is blind; Science without Religion is crippled."</blockquote>/\<br></div>

As I experiecned things, studied, and observed, I came to the conclusion that Christianity is nothing but a tool to control others and it out of touch with reality and scientific/technogical progress.

I also will not follow a religion that believes that gaining knowledge damned all of humanity down to the last generation.<br><br>To me, Buddhism equals freedom  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
