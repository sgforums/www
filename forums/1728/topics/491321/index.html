                                  research work on local ecology and folk spirituality often brings me into the
                                  grounds of small village Buddhist temples, many of which are surrounded by
                                  dense sacred groves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">At this time of year, the temple
                                  grounds may be littered with strange little woody structures, about two to
                                  three centimeters in diameter and shaped like an eight-pointed star. Alongside
                                  the woody fruits are scattered hundreds of bright shiny tannish-brown seeds, a
                                  little less than a centimeter in length.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">These are the fruits and seeds of
                                  a small evergreen tree called a star anise. Several dozen species of star
                                  anise, all placed in the genus Illicium, are known worldwide, mostly from Asia
                                  but also from North and Central America. The most famous of these is the
                                  Chinese star anise (I. verum), the dried fruits of which are widely used as a
                                  spice and herbal medicine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Although the star anise trees are
                                  not related to actual anise, they contain similar flavonoids and produce the
                                  same licorice-like taste and smell. In Asia the Chinese star anise, called
                                  to-shikimi in Japanese, is used to spice up a great variety of dishes. In
                                  Europe as well, this star anise is employed to flavor liquors such as French
                                  absinthe and pastis, Italian sambuca and Greek Ouzo.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Unfortunately, the species found
                                  at Japanese temples, called the Japanese star anise or shikimi (I. anisatum),
                                  contains deadly toxins that can cause severe inflammation of the kidneys and
                                  digestive organs. In Japan the fruits of this species are listed under the
                                  Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law (Dokubutsu Oyobi Gekibutsu
                                  Torishimari Ho).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> In America, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
                                  has issued a warning against drinking star anise tea, which is sold as a health
                                  tonic and also thought to prevent abdominal cramps in infants. These teas are
                                  made from Chinese star anise, but some may contain small amounts of Japanese
                                  star anise as well, and can cause severe vomiting and even seizures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Although highly toxic, the
                                  shikimi is considered a sacred plant in folk Buddhism. The first time I
                                  encountered one of these shrubs was several decades ago, on a research trip
                                  into the far north. I was staying in a Japanese-style inn in a small mountain
                                  village. There had recently been a death in the family, and the people were
                                  holding a simple funeral ceremony. The deceased, an elderly man, had been laid
                                  out in a coffin in an inner room, and the mourners were filing in to offer
                                  sticks of incense. Surrounding the body were cut branches of a very fragrant
                                  shrub that I was later informed was shikimi. The branches, I was told, helped
                                  to purify the air and keep down the odors of decay.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Much later I again encountered
                                  the shikimi on a hiking trip up Mt. Atago, a 924-meter-high mountain that
                                  guards the northwest wall of the Kyoto Basin. The deity inhabiting this
                                  mountain, Atago Gongen, is an amalgamation of the Buddhist avatar Shogun-Jizo,
                                  once popular among medieval period samurai warriors; and the Shinto fire kami
                                  Kagutsuchi, still renown throughout the land for his ability to keep Japan’s
                                  wooden dwellings safe from fires. Atago Gongen is said to appear in the form of
                                  a long-nosed winged creature known as a tengu, and is served by wild boar
                                  familiars. In popular representations he is usually depicted as a helmeted
                                  Buddhist saint riding a horse.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Today, there is a Shinto shrine,
                                  Atago Jinja, near the top of the mountain. Normally, trees in the Tea Family,
                                  sakaki (Cleyera japonica) or hi-sakaki (Eurya japonica) are presented as
                                  offerings to the kami at Shinto shrines. At this shrine, however, branches of
                                  shikimi are offered instead. This situation may reflect the history of the
                                  shrine, which until the late 19th century was a Buddhist temple. In the past,
                                  women from nearby villages would hike up to the shrine each day, carrying
                                  bundles of shikimi sprigs to sell to the pilgrims and visitors. Today the
                                  sprigs can be purchased at the shrine office.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Shikimi is also used to make
                                  traditional incense, and for carving Buddhist images. The leaves are so
                                  fragrant that you can easily identify a shrub with your eyes closed. The
                                  flowers, which in the Kanto Region bloom in mid-April, are two to three
                                  centimeters in diameter, and range in color from fairly dense yellow to white
                                  with a slight yellow tint. Each arm of the woody eight-armed star contains a
                                  single seed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Shikimi are native to Japan from
                                  the north Kanto region southward, and are also distributed on Taiwan and the
                                  Chinese mainland. They prefer shade to strong sun, and in Japan are often found
                                  growing in mountainside forests under momi fir trees (Abies firma). Shikimi are
                                  also widely planted at Buddhist temples and graveyards, including the large
                                  public cemeteries in big cities. Dried Chinese star anise fruits are widely
                                  available in Japanese supermarkets, where they are usually sold under the
                                  product name hakkaku.</span></p>
