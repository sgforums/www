            <div class='col-md body'><br>I believe there is an important distinction to be made between religion and spirituality. Religion I take to be concerned with belief in the claims to salvation of one faith tradition or another--an aspect of which is acceptance of some form of meta-physical or philosophical reality, including perhaps an idea of heaven or hell. Connected with this are religious teachings or dogma, ritual, prayers and so on. Spirituality I take to be concerned with those qualities of the human spirit--such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony, which bring happiness to both self and others.<br><br>-His Holiness the Dalai Lama<br>From "The Pocket Dalai Lama," edited by Mary Craig, 2002.

It is interesting to see him contrast all that stuff with spirituality.<br>He's in good company though.<br>The Buddha himself was never too keen:<br><br>Quote:<br>"Vaccha, the position that 'the cosmos is eternal' is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, &amp; fever, and it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, full Awakening, Unbinding.<br><br>&amp;<br><br>Quote:<br>"A 'position,' Vaccha, is something that a Tathagata has done away with. What a Tathagata sees is this: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is perception... such are mental fabrications... such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' Because of this, I say, a Tathagata Â— with the ending, fading out, cessation, renunciation, &amp; relinquishment of all construings, all excogitations, all I-making &amp; mine-making &amp; obsession with conceit Â— is, through lack of clinging/sustenance, released."<br><br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipit....072.than.html<br><br>Religions seem to attract people like Vacchagotta</div>
