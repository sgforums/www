            <div class='col-md body'>WISDOM DEVELOPS SAMADHI by Acariya Maha Boowa Nanasampanno<br><br>SILA .<br><br>Sila - is that which sets a limit to the "outgoing exuberance" in a person's actions of body and speech and the responsiblity for these actions and their results rest with heart.<br>Good people do not like to associate with someone whose "outgoing exuberance" is not restrained by sila, and nobody trusts him. In business and othet affairs, even if there are only one or two people who have bad sila and no sense of shame in their behaviour, it is certain that the social group in which they live and work cannot remain secure for long. It is bound to be destroyed or set in disorder by them in whatever way they can, as soon they have a chance when others are off their guard. It is like living with a fierce poisonous snake which is just waiting to bite whenever one is unprotected.<br><br>Thus sila is the Dhamma which protects the world, keeping it cool and happy so that there shall be no cuase for doubt, suspicion and mistrust which can arise from a mutual lack of confidence in those things which are liable to cause friction and trouble. These things often start in a small way and develop into larger things, things which everone wants to avoid.<br>Maintaining sila gives a recommendation of their individual personal integrity and of their mutual integrity, thus keeping them from falling apart when they gain and lose from each other in business or society everywhere.<br><br>just something to share  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
