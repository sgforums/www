              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">KUALA LUMPUR: Non-believers in Malaysia should be “hunted
              down” as Malaysia has no place for atheism, says Datuk Seri Dr Shahidan Kassim
              (pic).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department said such
              groups go against the Federal Constitution, which states Islam is the official
              religion while others are free to practise their own faith.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Not once does it (the Constitution) mention atheism. This
              clearly shows that the group goes against the Constitution and basic rights,”
              he told the press in Parliament here on Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A group called Atheist Republic had a gathering of its Kuala
              Lumpur chapter recently, and a photo of the gathering has triggered outrage
              from some in the Muslim community after it was highlighted on social media.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shahidan said he would suggest to religious departments and
              muftis to intervene in the matter by identifying members of the group.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I suggest we track them down and identify each of them.
              After that, we have to bring them back to the right path,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He said these people became atheists because they lacked
              religious understanding and knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“That is why they are easily swayed by new age teachings,” he
              said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, Shahidan said the group needs to be dealt with in a
              proper manner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“We can’t act in such a way where they could gain sympathy
              from other people. This would just make them more popular,” he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It was reported that the Federal Government would investigate
              the local group, with the help of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia
              Commission as it involved the faith of Muslims.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I believe this Minister is making reference to the Malays themselves.
                  He was mentioning something about this group of Atheists as going against the
                  constitution and basic rights. Article 11 in the Malaysian constitution states that,
                  ‘every person has the right to profess and practice his own religion’. Isn’t he
                  contradicting himself when he talks about this group going against the Federal
                  Constitution and also infringing on individual basic rights? Most confusing
                  statement indeed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">He also did mention that this group is lacking in religious
                  understanding and knowledge. I suppose he expect the whole Malay race to think
                  completely alike and any variation in thoughts are not to be tolerated as far as
                  their religion is concerned?</span></p>
