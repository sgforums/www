              <p>My reply to someone asking about the external signs related to the fruition of chanting:</p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>Icic... maybe you can search the internet for some of the benefits of mantras. It is a good practice so keep it up.</p>
              <p>But the most important benefit is that it can calm your mind...
                                            when you are chanting, you must be aware of the chanting. If your mind
                                            wanders on what you are going to do next, or what someone has done to
                                            you, what happened to you, i.e. past and future, then the chanting will
                                            not be of much effect.</p>
              <p>My local dharma teacher tells of 3 stages of chanting... I can only type from what I remember, briefly:</p>
              <p>1)
                                            Chanting as a means to control our mind. Our mind is lost in discursive
                                            thinking, and lost its calmness. So by focusing our attention on
                                            chanting, we can prevent the discursive mind from wandering again. Unfortunately, many people at this stage simply 'chants with his mouth'. That is useless. His mind wanders on other things, and is not even aware that is chanting. It is only his mouth that 'chants'. The mind is not chanting. We must avoid this by all means, and chant with sincerity and one pointedness.</p>
              <p>2) When we chant for a long period of time, the chanting itself
                                            becomes a momentum that gathers strength and helps us in daily life,
                                            constantly 24/7. Even in sleep. That means lets say you chant Amitabha
                                            (or any other chant), you will reach a stage where you automatically
                                            chant the mantra... its like motor going by itself in your head... you
                                            just keep chanting, the chanting takes place 'automatically' even
                                            without your intention to start chanting. This is important so that
                                            whenever you face any situations, you will not lose your calm and
                                            samadhi (one pointedness). Even in sleep, even in dreams, if you have a
                                            nightmare or you dream of ghosts chasing you, you will automatically
                                            start chanting... and free yourself from such situations. If something
                                            bad happens to you, even if your past life debtors or spirits want to
                                            take away your life, you will automatically chant and even if you die
                                            you will be able to be born in higher realms or in the pure lands.</p>
              <p>3)
                                            Be-with-buddha chanting. You maintain ever present awareness that knows
                                            your chanting. That means, you are aware of chanting Om-ma-ni-pad-me-hum...
                                            totally present, aware, as you chant. This awareness is also aware of every arising
                                            thought, or even when there is no thoughts, it is present. With this
                                            awareness you will not be tricked by ignorant thoughts, whether the
                                            thought is good or bad, awareness is present and knows. When you reach
                                            this level, it is 'nian zhong you fo'. Every 'nian' got 'Buddha'. What
                                            is Buddha? Buddha is our Awareness. It is our true nature that is ever
                                            present and inherent in every being. If you reach this level, you are
                                            being with buddha'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if you see yourself
                                            progressing along these lines, then you do not need to rely on external
                                            signs to increase your faith in the mantra or chanting. The
                                            clarity/awareness, calmness, bliss is itself assuring. You will want to
                                            keep practicing to experience these qualities and you will see it help
                                            you even in daily lives. What is important is also to practice in daily
                                            lives, to 'extend' these qualities to meet daily lives situation.</p>
              <p>You
                                            do not need to see or hear the Buddha, if you Be With Buddha, you will
                                            "be with" Buddha (Awareness) right in this moment, you will be one with
                                            all Buddhas in the 10 directions. It is not through seeking him in
                                            forms and sound, as the Buddha taught:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;">“He 
                                                    who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox 
                                                    path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).”<br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;">“All 
                                                    forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees 
                                                    the Tathagata.” </span></p>

                  </table>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">It is stated in the 
                              Diamond Sutra, “He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in 
                              sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).” 
                              It further states that, “All forms are but illusions, in seeing 
                              that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata”. It is only 
                              when we have attained a certain advanced level in the learning and practising 
                              of Buddhism that we will be able to understand the profound meaning of 
                              these verses. If you were to tell a person who has just started to learn 
                              Buddhism that learning Buddhism is like these verses, then he would find 
                              them too profound. He would not be able to make out what Buddha is like. 
                              Of course, he knows what human beings are like and quite naturally he 
                              will assume that only those who are similar in form to human beings are 
                              Buddhas. We can say that this is correct, but we can also say that this 
                              is wrong. For example, kindergarten teachers may use drawings of an old 
                              man and old woman when teaching the young children about grandfathers 
                              and grandmothers. Thereafter, when the children see other old folks in 
                              such resemblance they know that they are someone else’s grandparents. 
                              But, to university students it would be inappropriate for professors to 
                              use the same approach when talking about such blood relationships. <br> <br> It is the same in learning Buddhism. When we encourage a new student of 
                              Buddhism to pay respect to the Buddha in the temple or monastery, he will 
                              not be frightened when he sees that the Buddha is the same as a human 
                              being. At the same time, when he sees that the Buddha and Bodhisattva 
                              images are so dignified and compassionate, it will give rise to a feeling 
                              of joy and reverence and lead him to learn Buddhism.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Often we come across 
                              people who have been learning Buddhism for a long time saying that they 
                              saw this Buddha or that Bodhisattva in their dreams. Initially, when we 
                              do not know about their level of understanding of Buddhism, we may praise 
                              them by saying, “Oh! You have such good affinity with Buddha and 
                              Bodhisattva that you can even see their images!” But it is wrong 
                              if we always praise them like this. If they report dreams like this for 
                              more then 3 times, you have to tell them, “The Mara is here, you 
                              have seen the Mara! All the Zen masters advise to obliterate the Buddha 
                              when the Buddha appears, and obliterate the Mara when the Mara appears 
                              [1].” We cannot praise them any more because they have already developed 
                              an attachment to forms. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">In the same way, when 
                              we are dealing with people who are already advanced in Buddhism, we should 
                              use the method of the Diamond Sutra rather than the kindergarten method: </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;">“He 
                              who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox 
                              path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).”<br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;">“All 
                              forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees 
                              the Tathagata.” </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">At this level, people 
                              will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that eradicates superstition 
                              and attachment to all forms. </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Critics often say 
                              that the Buddha image is an idol. They criticize that Buddhism worships 
                              idols. In reality, the cross, the Jesus Christ image and Mother Mary, 
                              they are also idols. In this sense, is there a religion that does not 
                              worship idols? Therefore, we cannot say that Buddhism is the only religion 
                              that worships idols. The fact is that only Buddhism does not worship idols. 
                              The Diamond Sutra states, “All forms are but illusions, in seeing 
                              that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.”! </span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The essence of the 
                              Buddha, the Buddha Nature is omnipresent in the space of the Dharma realm, 
                              and the Dharma Nature is omnipresent in the space. </span></p>

              <p>Meditate reciting <em>Buddho</em>, <em>Buddho</em> <a name="tex2html234" href="http://www.amaravati.org/abmnew/index.php/teachingsofajahnchah/article/387/#foot6157"><sup>2</sup></a> until it penetrates deep into the heart of your consciousness (<em>citta</em>).
              The word ''<em>Buddho</em>'' represents the awareness and wisdom
              of the Buddha. In practice, you must depend on this word more than
              anything else. The awareness it brings will lead you to understand
              the truth about your own mind. It's a true refuge, which means that
              there is both mindfulness and insight present.</p>
              <p>Wild animals can have awareness of a sort. They have mindfulness as
              they stalk their prey and prepare to attack. Even the predator needs
              firm mindfulness to keep hold of the captured prey however defiantly
              it struggles to escape death. That is one kind of mindfulness. For
              this reason you must be able to distinguish between different kinds
              of mindfulness. The Buddha taught to meditate reciting ''<em>Buddho</em>''
              as a way to apply the mind. When you consciously apply the mind to
              an object, it wakes up. The awareness wakes it up. Once this knowing
              has arisen through meditation, you can see the mind clearly. As long
              as the mind remains without the awareness of ''<em>Buddho</em>'',
              even if there is ordinary worldly mindfulness present, it is as if
              unawakened and without insight. It will not lead you to what is truly
              beneficial.</p>
              <p><em>Sati</em> or mindfulness depends on the presence of ''<em>Buddho</em>''
              - the knowing. It must be a clear knowing, which leads to the mind
              becoming brighter and more radiant. The illuminating effect that this
              clear knowing has on the mind is similar to the brightening of a light
              in a darkened room. As long as the room is pitch black, any objects
              placed inside remain difficult to distinguish or else completely obscured
              from view because of the lack of light. But as you begin intensifying
              the brightness of the light inside, it will penetrate throughout the
              whole room, enabling you to see more clearly from moment to moment,
              thus allowing you to know more and more the details of any object
              inside there.</p>
              <p>You could also compare training the mind with teaching a child. It
              would be impossible to force a child, who still hadn't learnt to speak,
              to accumulate knowledge at an unnaturally fast rate that was beyond
              its capability. You couldn't get too tough with it or try teaching
              it more language than it could take in at any one time, because the
              child would simply be unable to hold its attention on what you were
              saying for long enough.</p>
              <p>Your mind is similar. Sometimes it's appropriate to give yourself
              some praise and encouragement; sometimes it's more appropriate to
              be critical. It's like the child: if you scold it too often and are
              too intense in the way you deal with it, the child won't progress
              in the right way, even though it might be determined to do well. If
              you force it too much, the child will be adversely affected, because
              it still lacks knowledge and experience and as a result will naturally
              lose track of the right way to go. If you do that with your own mind,
              it isn't <em>sammÄ�</em> <em>patipadÄ�</em> or the way
              of practice that leads to enlightenment. <em>PatipadÄ�</em> or practice refers to the training and guidance of body, speech and
              mind. Here I am specifically referring to the training of the mind.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught that training the mind involves knowing how to teach
              yourself and go against the grain of your desires. You have to use
              different skilful means to teach your mind because it constantly gets
              caught into moods of depression and elation. This is the nature of
              the unenlightened mind - it's just like a child. The parents of a
              child who hasn't learnt to speak are in a position to teach it because
              they know how to speak and their knowledge of the language is greater.
              The parents are constantly in a position to see where their child
              is lacking in its understanding, because they know more. Training
              the mind is like this. When you have the awareness of ''<em>Buddho</em>'',
              the mind is wiser and has a more refined level of knowing than normal.
              This awareness allows you to see the conditions of the mind and to
              see the mind itself; you can see the state of mind in the midst of
              all phenomena. This being so, you are naturally able to employ skilful
              techniques for training the mind. Whether you are caught into doubt
              or any other of the defilements, you see it as a mental phenomenon
              that arises in the mind and must be investigated and dealt with in
              the mind.</p>
              <p>That awareness which we call ''<em>Buddho</em>'' is like
              the parents of the child. The parents are the child's teachers in
              charge of its training, so it's quite natural that whenever they allow
              it to wander freely, simultaneously they must keep one eye on it,
              aware of what it's doing and where it's running or crawling to.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you can be too clever and have too many good ideas. In the
              case of teaching the child, you might think so much about what is
              best for the child, that you could reach the point where the more
              methods you think up for teaching it, the further away the child moves
              from the goals you want it to achieve. The more you try and teach
              it, the more distant it becomes, until it actually starts to go astray
              and fails to develop in the proper way.</p>
