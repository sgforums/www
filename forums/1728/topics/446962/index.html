              Today while re reading paltrul rinpoche's commentary on the three points that strike the essence and john myhrdin's commentary I cycled through from I AM (felt as the "actualness" of undeniable non-conceptual pure presence-awareness) to anatta, emptiness, d.o. That deconstructed everything into luminous and momentarily self-releasing, impermanent sensations
              
              There is truly no self in everything that arises and ceases in lightning speed moment to moment according to causes and conditions: which is everything without exception
              
              I was reading it (Golden Letters) on google books then contemplating a little afterwards.
              
              It seems the paltrul rinpoche three points had been very beneficial to me... Previously I gained the insight into the "unsupported, disjoint, insubstantial, bubble-like, groundless and self-releasing" of manifestation shortly after reading it

              <p>There are certain aspect of Dzogchen that always puzzle me and thus , i don't quite understand.</p>
              <p>That is:</p>
              <p>Emotions such as anger are classified as discursive thought. Emotions are allow to arise and dissolve'.</p>
              <p>This aspect i don't really understand. And I hope someone can enlighten me on that.</p>
              <p>I can understand how conceptual thoughts/memories can arise and liberate. But, to me, emotion is a different matter. To me, emotions signifies that distraction has ALREADY occurred. Emotion such as anger is not an inherent object.. but  arises due to a series of causes and effect. Emotion should not arise when 'sense of self' is absent. Emotion depends on self as a center reference to compare and conjure desire.</p>
              <p>So... my understanding is that when abiding as awareness, there should not be any emotion. Because emotion is the result of following thoughts and contents and that  a dualistic split has already occured.</p>

              <p>This is a good question but I am not a Dzogchen practitioner so it may not be the right Dzogchen answer.  I will do that after work. :-)</p>

              <p><br>Hi Aik TC,</p>
              <p>Seriously, i dun think i am qualified to explain the self-liberation of afflictive emotion. To me, self-liberation is the most advanced stage already. I dun think self-liberation is possible without a certain stability in the realisation of no-self, non-dual, emptiness.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, from what i interprete from the book, when afflictive emotion has arised, distraction indeed has already occured.  So the self-liberation of afflictive emotion is most probably the 'method' to resolve affliction and bring oneself back to awareness.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Experiences has certain characteristics that one realised from insights. These characteristics are no-selfness, non-duality and emptiness. When afflictive emotion have arised, awareness of no-selfness, non-duality and emptiness are momentarily lost. I understand this as Distraction.</p>
              <p>However, even at these moments of distraction, the characteristics are still of no-selfness, non-duality and emptiness. When in distraction, experiences are not realising/feeling these characteristic at that moment. At such times, the experience seems solid... although really it is empty. At such times, there feels a self is experiencing the affliction, although really there is no-self. At such times, there feels as if there is the affliction and the one feeling the affliction, although really there is non-duality.</p>
              <p>This is what makes liberation possible ?</p>

              The purpose of tantra is also to control, pacify, and finally eradicte afflictions.
              
              Only that they do this by utilizing and transforming them. Its a different approach.

              <p>Thanks for sharing. As for as i know, self-liberation is taught in Dzogchen and Mahamudra.</p>
              <p>But in this life i have never really met any Teachers from such lineage. Most of the teachings are read from books.</p>
