            <div class='col-md body'>I believe there are people who think that practitioner of Buddhism are somewhat pessimistic. Be it through some chinese dramas, or people that they see or hear in their daily life... I absolutely disagree on this.<br><br>A lot of people might have heard of "Fang Xia" - Letting go, a commonly heard term in Buddhism. I have been practicing this since the day I have a better understanding of it through my Australia's Shifu. I find it very useful as it helps suppress my negative thoughts and worries and turn me away from being pessimistic.<br><br>Before I make a forward step to get to know more about Buddhism, I was a pessimistic guy who habour lots of worries, I hate crowds and seldom join people. This really makes my life dull. I used to put my own viewpoints into understanding Buddhism and hence causing me to make a lot of wrong assumptions. But now thinking back, I am really grateful to a friend who brought me into Buddhism. I am now cheerful and easy-going, and I cannot believe I can have so many friends. Many of my doubts in Buddhism (that I tried figuring out myself) have been cleared after seeking advise from my Shifu.<br><br>A lesson that I learn: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Always seek a Shifu rather than trying to understand Buddhism in our own viewpoint.</span>" Trust me, they are very friendly and approachable. I believe if I did not make that very first step, I would still be having the same misconceptions on Buddhism.</div>

And the result of purification is freedom, liberation, non-dualism and compassion. In another word, itÂ’s An-Hsiang or eternal peace and composure. So that we can still live in this world of chaos happily and optimistically with a transcendent mind. Personally, I think thatÂ’s how Buddhism can turn the Earth into a pure land. And thatÂ’s how Buddhism can changes our lives.<br><br></div>
