After the famous Gongkar Rinpoche (previous incarnation) identified and recognized Him as a reincarnation of a great practitioner, Rinpoche consequently embarked on the fulfillment of His destiny by joining the local monastery in Tibet - at the age of ten.<br><br>By fifteen years old, Rinpoche was enrolled in Gaden Shartse Norling College, located in central Tibet. It is the most prestigious and renowned school in Tibet, and it was at Gaden Shartse Norling College where Rinpoche pursued his study of Buddhist scriptures, and eventually, earning Him the highest honours among the foremost scholars of His day. At that time, RinpocheÂ’s field of study included Pramana Vidya (Logic), Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom), Madhyamika (Middle Philosophy), Abidharma (Treasure of Knowledge), Vinaya (Spiritual Rules and Moral Law).<br><br>In 1959, after nineteen years of intensive study and training, Rinpoche sat for the Geshe Lharmapa examination. This major examination was held in the summer palace of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, located in the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. Candidates were various scholars and top students from the 3 main monasteries, and yet Rinpoche still managed to emerge 2nd overall. In the next year, H.E. was officially conferred as Â“Geshe LharampaÂ” Â– a qualification which is equivalent to the PH.D. degree in the Indian universities. And in that same year, Rinpoche joined the tantric college in Lhasa, and started intensive study in Tantra since. In the following years, H.E. taught many young incarnate lamas, as well as gave dharma talks to the mass public. In 1964, Rinpoche arrived in Dharamsala, and was subsequently appointed as Spiritual Assistant to His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama Â– Rinpoche serves His Holiness faithfully till today.<br><br>In 1976, under His HolinessÂ’s suggestion, various universities in America invited Lati Rinpoche over, where H.E. gave illuminating dharma discourses to an appreciative public. In addition, Rinpoche taught at Namgyal Gomba (His HolinessÂ’s personal monastery), at the debating college, and has guided and taught many laypeople as well. In the same year, Rinpoche was appointed as the Abbot of the Shartse Norling College of Gaden Monastery, in South India. H.E. held this position for eight years Â– where besides looking after the administration, law and order of the Sangha, Rinpoche also personally taught extensively on all aspects of Buddhism. RinpocheÂ’s contribution towards Gaden Shartse Norling College is widely recognized by all, and H.E. is deeply respected by many strong devotees all over the world.<br><br>Since His retirement, Rinpoche dedicated His life mainly on dharma practice, as well as propagating the dharma, guiding people along the sometimes complex path of the dharma. On repeated requests from many countries in Europe and America, Rinpoche has travelled extensively, benefiting dharma students in various parts of the world.<br><br>To His credit, Lati Rinpoche has authored many important books on Tibetan Buddhism, including:<br><br>v      Death, Intermediate State and Rebirth.<br><br>v      Mind in Tibetan Buddhism<br><br>v      Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism<br><br></div>

In this series of pujas, which includes the Fire Puja for Increase, Arya-Tara Puja and White Umbrella Puja (to clear obstacles) and more, many are considered to be among the largest scale of pujas in Tibetan Buddhism. With blessings from the Three Jewels, and having Sangha members and a highly-realized Master to perform the pujas; we not only can purify negativities (which we have accumulated since beginningless time), we will also be able to clear obstacles of Singapore and her people, and aid in the nationÂ’s overall progress and economic growth.<br><br>*There will be both English and Mandarin translations for all events:<br><br>Chinese Translator: Venerable Lobsang Mengur<br><br>Eng Translator: Prof Cheng Chen-Huang<br><br>Brief Explanations:<br>ARYA-TARA AVERTING-OBSTACLES OFFERING PUJA<br>Goddess Arya Tara is the epitome of the ten directional Buddhas, and is especially effective in clearing obstacles in assistance oneÂ’s career. In this puja, we will first invoke Goddess TaraÂ’s blessing with the Seven-Limb offering (prostration, confession, offering, rejoicing, dedication, etc), then prayers will be recited, requesting for her blessing. Together with the offering of sixty tormas, we can then prevent disturbances from the external environment (including the formless). This puja is rather complex, but is an undoubtedly rare and effective prayer ceremony.<br><br>GREEN TARA INITIATION<br><br>Green Tara is a very swift and powerful deity of activity who clears our obstacles, and helps us successfully accomplish both temporal and ultimate happiness. One will be able to dispel black magic, charms, &amp; disturbances from the formless as well as prevent diseases and harm to oneself. It can also boost oneÂ’s spiritual growth &amp; other aspects Â– career &amp; academic studies. An empowerment gives one the permission to meditate on the deity. After receiving the deityÂ’s blessing of body, speech and mind, one becomes empowered to do the practice.<br><br>MEDICINE BUDDHA WELLNESS PUJA &amp; INITIATION<br><br>The Medicine Buddha is also known as the King of medicines. He not only serves to heal all sentient beings from their physical illness, but also helps to eradicate all sources of sufferings which main source is Â– ignorance. By eradicating ignorance, one will be liberated from the suffering of samsara.<br><br>Because we are not yet enlightened, we succumb to our afflictive emotions and delusions, especially the 3 poisons Â– greed, hatred and ignorance. In total, there are 84,000 kinds of delusions that we will face; various illnesses and diseases arise due to them, and out physical body suffers under their torments. The Medicine Buddha made a strong wish to liberate all sentient beings, hence, by merely chanting His Mantra, one can not only prevent disasters and natural calamities, increases oneÂ’s lifespan, one will also accumulate merits to be reborn in the Pure Land of Medicine Buddha.<br><br>PALDEN-HLAMO SUBDUING-EVIL PUJA<br><br>In many occasions in our daily lives, we go overboard in our behavior and cause hurt to other sentient beings, consequently accumulating bad karma for ourselves. Sometimes we may even offend spirits, ghosts and demons unknowingly, whereupon they will cause natural disasters and calamities and chaos to disturb us. The Subduing-Evil Puja is one of the most effective pujas to counter such problems. By requesting Palden-Hlamo for her help, and upon Her blessings, we can quickly purify all our negative karma, and prevent any disturbances from the external environment.<br><br>WHITE UMBRELLA RITUAL OFFERING PUJA<br><br>Asuras and gods reside in the region between the God and Demi-God realm (within samsara). There naturally grows a wish-fulfilling tree Â– whenever the gods run into any difficulty, they would pray to this tree and their wishes will be fulfilled. This has however, incurred the wrath and jealously of the Asuras, and in a fit of hatred, raged attack towards the god realm. Not wanting to suffer defeat, the King of the God realm quickly approached Lord Buddha Shakyamuni to seek His blessings. At that moment, there shone a bright white light from the crown of the Lord Buddha. And it manifested into the intrepid and powerful White Umbrella Tara. With the pure merits of Lord Buddha, the White Umbrella Tara emanates a thousand arms and a thousand eyes, blessing and saving all the harm of the gods.<br><br>The benefits of a White Umbrella Khorlo:<br><br>Will not be affected by any poisons<br>Will not be injured by any weapons or machines<br>Will not be hurt by fire and extreme heat<br>Will not be drowned in deep waters<br>Will not be disturbed by the formless<br>Will not be affected by any curses or charms<br>Will be safe and free from accidents (if hung in the car)<br>Will be protected and blessed by all Vajra Dakas, Dakinis and Bodhisattvas<br><br>Within this Khorlo is a piece of White Umbrella mantra, as well as the secret mandala of the deity. The Khorlo has been blessed by a thousand over monks of the Gaden Shartse Monastery, and possesses unimaginable merits, and be free of obstacles.<br><br>NAMGYALMA LONG LIFE PUJA<br><br>The special benefits of this puja can be categorized in two different levels Â– that of a national level, and that of an individualÂ’s basis.<br><br>To the collective karma at national level, this puja can help acquire the following Eight Qualities of Fully-Matured Karma:<br><br>Long life of the citizens<br>Pleasant appearance and outlook<br>Rebirth among the affluent<br>Fortune and wealth<br>Respectable speech<br>Rebirth to human life<br>Power and authority<br>Determination and strong will-power<br><br>On an individual level, one can acquire the following benefits:<br><br>You can purify the negative karma accumulated in the past thousand aeons just by listening to the chanting of this prayer text, and will not take rebirth in the three lower realms.<br>Will be able to quickly achieve the fully realized Bodhicitta.<br>With sincere requests to the deity, and by placing the prayer text or statue at the topmost area of the bed, inside the stupa, or any high area for that matter, one will be able to receive blessing via the reflection of the sun by shining upon the text, or when the wind blows onto us. We will be blessed and will be prevented from rebirth in the three lower realms.<br>At the time of oneÂ’s death, if one were to have somebody chant this mantra for him 21 times, one will be able to avoid rebirth in the lower realms.<br>Will be able to obtain the desire happiness, and take rebirth in the pure lands.<br><br>NAMTOSE FORTUNE &amp; WEALTH-INVITING PUJA &amp; INITIATION<br><br>Namtose is a famous protector and wealth deity of Esoteric Buddhism. For centuries great Buddhist practitionerÂ’s and yogis relied on his practice for wealth, protection and cultivation of the path. The Namtose puja summons immense positive wealth energies upon the puja participants, and is a very effective method to invoke positive wealth energy of the universe and its inhabitants. Though getting rich is a result of oneÂ’s past actions, participating in the Namtose puja plays a significant role in its own way to change the course of oneÂ’s financial situation.<br><br>FIRE PUJA FOR INCREASE OF MERITS<br><br>There are objects of offering of fire pujas, the offering to deities being the main focus.<br><br>They are:<br><br>Offering to (1) all Buddha, Bodhisattvas and deities<br><br>Offering to (2) Protectors and highly-realized godly beings<br><br>Giving to (3) all sentient beings<br><br>Giving to (4) all spirits and hungry ghosts.<br><br>Usually, the fire puja can be divided into four types: Peace, Increas, Power and Force. Participating in this fire puja can increase our merits, health, lifespan, wisdom, wealth and even our dharma practice. All the offerings and ingredients used in the fire puja process are all adhered strictly from prayer text, hence the fire puja is a very special ritual. It is so strict that even common layman are advised not to touch any of the puja offerings Â– only the sangha members or those who has obtained the lineage or practice is allowed to process and perform the fire puja.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>PUJA OF GREAT COMPASSION &amp; MERIT-INCREASE<br><br>CONDUCTED BY HIS EMINENCE KYABJE LATI RINPOCHE<br><br>Venue: Tentage Set-Up Along Bencoolen Street (Behind Kuan Yin Temple)<br><br>28th October Â– 1st November 2004 (Five-Day Program)<br><br>Date<br>Time<br>Program<br><br>28/10/04<br><br>Thurs<br>10.00am -12.00pm<br>Opening Speech:<br><br>How to Change Your Human Body to that of a Buddha<br><br>3.00pm Â– 5.00pm<br>Gyabshi Four Hundred Grand Offerings Puja (1)<br><br>7.30pm Â– 9.30pm<br>Gyabshi Four Hundred Grand Offerings Puja (2)<br><br>29/10/04<br><br>Fri<br>10.00am -12.00pm<br>Arya Tara Obstacles-Clearing Puja (1)<br><br>3.00pm Â– 5.00pm<br>Arya Tara Obstacles-Clearing Puja (2)<br><br>7.30pm Â– 9.30pm<br>White Tara Initiation<br><br>30/10/04<br><br>Sat<br>10.00am -12.00pm<br>Lion-Faced Dakini White Umbrella &amp; Heart Sutra Obstacles-Clearing Puja<br><br>3.00pm Â– 5.00pm<br>Confession &amp; Cleansing Purification Puja<br><br>7.30pm Â– 9.30pm<br>Vajrasattva Initiation<br><br>31/10/04<br><br>Sun<br>10.00am -12.00pm<br>White Dzambala Wealth-Receiving Kangso Puja (1)<br><br>3.00pm Â– 5.00pm<br>White Dzambala Wealth-Receiving Kangso Puja (2)<br><br>7.30pm Â– 9.30pm<br>White Dzambala Initiation<br><br>01/11/04<br><br>Mon<br>10.00am -12.00pm<br>Prostration &amp; Ritual Offerings to the Sixteen Arhats (1)<br><br>3.00pm Â– 5.00pm<br>Prostration &amp; Ritual Offerings to the Sixteen Arhats (2)<br><br>7.30pm Â– 9.30pm<br>Four Armed Kuan Yin (Chenrezig) Initiation<br><br>Dro-Phen Ling is most privileged to have invited one of the most highly-respected Masters of Tibetan Buddhism (Gelugpa tradition) - His Eminence Kyabje Lati Rinpoche, to conduct this Puja of Great Compassion and Merit-Increase which will last over a duration of 5 days. Rinpoche is a deeply-realized practitioner, and have had received many lineage teachings and practices from various High Masters. It would certainly be our blessings and fortune if we were able to receive and attend the pujas and initiations conferred upon by Rinpoche during this grand puja event.<br><br>Four-Armed Kuan Yin (Chenrezig) Initiation          01/11/04 (Mon)          PM 7.30 - 9.30<br><br>The four-armed Kuan Yin is the epitome of bodhicitta in all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. To liberate sentient beings of various characteristics, Kuan Yin manifests in various forms, and is known as the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion, and has an especially close affinity with sentient beings like us.<br><br>The four-armed Kuan Yin, together with Manjushri and Vajrapani, symbolizes great compassion, wisdom and power Â– whose practices all Mahayana Buddhist practitioners have to undergo. The scriptures record: The benefits and merits of the six syllable mantra is inconceivable, chanting it can alleviate and destroy sufferings of illnesses, punishment, fear of untimely death, increase oneÂ’s lifespan, as well as invite wealth and fortune. The benefits are so aplenty that even at the time of death, doors to rebirth of the lower realms will be closed, and one will be able to gain a rebirth in the human or god realm.<br><br>The six syllable mantra is not only the source of all happiness, it is also the foundation of reaching the destination to the path of liberation, of opening up wisdom, of realizing great bodhicitta, as well as saving and benefiting all sentient beings of the six realms. Chanting the mantra is so meritorious, it purifies our negative karma accumulated from beginningless time, it also helps destroy our afflictive emotions and delusion Â– helping us attain Enlightenment swiftly.<br><br>Gyabshi Four Hundred Grand Offerings Puja<br><br>28/10/04 (Thurs)                  PM 3.00 - 5.00, PM 7.30 Â– 9.30<br><br>The 400 grand offerings include: 100 light offerings, 100 stupas, 100 ritual cakes and 100 human effigies. After conducting the puja with chanting and offerings, we will not only be able to eradicate the four demons, namely Â– demon of delusions, demon of desires, demon of death and demon of the five contaminated aggregates; we will also be able to purify our bad karma and negative energy Â– hence, enabling our obstacles to be cleared.<br><br>Arya Tara Obstacles-Clearing Puja<br><br>29/10/04 (Fri)    AM 10.00 - 12.00, PM 3.00 - 5.00<br><br>Goddess Arya Tara is the epitome of the ten directional Buddhas, and is especially effective in clearing obstacles in assistance of oneÂ’s career. In this puja, we will first invoke Goddess TaraÂ’s blessings with the Seven-Limb offerings (Prostration, Confessions, Offering, Rejoicing, Dedication etc.), then prayers will be recited, requesting for Arya TaraÂ’s blessings. Together with the offering of sixty tormas, we can then prevent disturbances from the external environment (including the formless). This puja is rather complex, but is an undoubtedly rare and effective prayer ceremony.<br><br></div>
