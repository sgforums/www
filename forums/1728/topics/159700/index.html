Jambudvipa, of course, corresponds to India which was the entire known world to those who created the Mt. Sumeru cosmology.<br>West of Mt. Sumeru is the continent called Aparagodaniya. Here, the inhabitants herd cattle and live very comfortable lives in this rich land. This continent is circular and also has two islands.<br>East of Mt. Sumeru is the continent called Purvavideha.

The people here are extremely virtuous and live for a thousand years. This continent is very much like the Garden of Eden in that there is no crime, or disease, or violence and food is easily attainable without work.

            <div class='col-md body'>Within our chiliocosm, there are 1 Billion sun-systems (solar systems). Out of these, 4 planets have man living on it. In the future, these 4 planets (including ours) will be united under a universal wheel-turning king. He will have a golden flying vehicle that can fly him to any planet within 1 day's time. Lifespan at that time will be uncountable (84000 = uncountable), their height will be very very high, our height is lower than their knees. There will be no diseases, war, famine, crimes, etc etc... cities are large in population and close to each other, within 1 dharma discourse by Maitreya Buddha, more than 9 billion people attain enlightenment/liberation (which is only possible through modern technology). There will be 3 such discourses.<br><br>From my memory, Buddha also described galaxies as 'spiralling systems' or something around that line... or 'wheel system'.<br><br>Point is, there are definitely extra terrestrials.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
