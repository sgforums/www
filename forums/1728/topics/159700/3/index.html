Or could it be possible that you have forgotten/mixed up the terms? Maybe they said something like our current bodhi tree is different from their bodhi tree. Just a guess, I may be wrong.

I have printed one Kalachakra Mantra image and pasted it on my room's wall, below I wrote it "Kalachakra for World Peace".<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Kalachakra Initiation is the largest and most important Buddhist ritual conferred by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. <strong>It is traditionally given to groups of people assembled from around the world and therefore associated with the promotion of world peace.</strong> The Kalachakra Initiation is considered a special blessing for all who participate and for the place in which it is given.</span><br><br>.................<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Kalachakra serves as a universal prayer for peace and harmony in the world.  For each individual who participates, it is also a renewal of commitment to one's inner spiritual path.</span><br><br>----------------<br>Well basically, Kalachakra talks about a tyrannical force with hitler-like abitions intends to conquer to world and had almost conquered the entire world. Its only at that time then the shamballa ppl have no choice but to fight them bcos they found the location of shamballa and is attempting to conquer Shamballa.<br><br>It is not a war of believers and non-believers, but rather it is an inevitable one, more like the Allied forces fighting off Hitler.<br><br>And what is the essence of Kalachakra? <span style="font-style: italic;">Once I asked, Â“What is the essential teaching of the Kalacakra Tantra; what does it really mean?Â” His holiness replied, Â“The essential message of the Kalacakra cycle is that time as such does not exist.Â”</span> (refering to His Holiness Sakya Trizin Rinpoche)<br></div>
