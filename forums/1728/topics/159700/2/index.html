At that time, Pure Land is established on Earth, why Pure Land?<br><br>In sutra, its stated that when Mind is pure, Land is pure. Meaning those people at that time have pure minds, they do not commit crimes, etc. And how? By purifying the human minds right now.... creating a Pure Land on Earth. At that time, more than 9 billion people will attain enlightenment in each of the 3 famous Maitreya Buddha's dharma discourse!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LongChen,<br><br>It is difficult to comprehend the mystery of life.  Just like there is no half-infinity, the Movement is really the Source. The nature of Consciousness is without self, it is the very otherness that we experience, not to distant itself from itself.  The hidden unmanifest is ever manifesting, in the movement everything IS.<br><br>There are more workers and warriors then we imagine.  Some plant the seed of luminosity, some plant Emptiness.  Not all are aware of their designated roles but knowingly or unknowingly they carry out their tasks.  The tasks carried out might appear conflicting as if enlightened beings battling among themselves.  Thus battling is not only dark against light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>From the perspective of the source, there is no conflict, not even in the minuteness moment of arising Â– a lost balance does not exist in reality but only in forms.  Â‘BirthÂ’ is the beginning of life and yet it is also the beginning of Death.  The wise therefore look beyond the appearance of forms and works on cause, condition and effect and understands the emptiness nature of reality.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi LongChen,<br><br>It is difficult to comprehend the mystery of life.  Just like there is no half-infinity, the Movement is really the Source. The nature of Consciousness is without self, it is the very otherness that we experience, not to distant itself from itself.  The hidden unmanifest is ever manifesting, in the movement everything IS.<br><br>There are more workers and warriors then we imagine.  Some plant the seed of luminosity, some plant Emptiness.  Not all are aware of their designated roles but knowingly or unknowingly they carry out their tasks.  The tasks carried out might appear conflicting as if enlightened beings battling among themselves.  Thus battling is not only dark against light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>From the perspective of the source, there is no conflict, not even in the minuteness moment of arising Â– a lost balance does not exist in reality but only in forms.  Â‘BirthÂ’ is the beginning of life and yet it is also the beginning of Death.  The wise therefore look beyond the appearance of forms and works on cause, condition and effect and understands the emptiness nature of reality.<br></div></blockquote>I see... so true.<br><br>Thanks, Thusness.</div>

The 2nd Shamballa king (the current Dalai Lama is known to be one of his incarnation I heard) wrote a large commentary on Kalachakra Tantra. It is introduced into Tibet in 1027 by those Shamballa people, yes, that is true... but it originated from Shakyamuni Buddha. Certain lamas (like the Dalai Lama?
