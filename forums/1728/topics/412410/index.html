              <p>Hello Everybody</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you advise me about this?</p>
              <p>Recently I was doing my house springing and dig out a box (containing all buddha books and cds) and has been in one of my bedroom for 2 years plus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard that keeping buddha books and cds in the bedroom is not good as it will caused dishormony among the spouses and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also heard that without using or reading the books/cds will create 'siao ren' and cause unhappiness among the family members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This 2 years, there is indeed some unhappiness moments between me and my spouse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder whether I can donate all the buddha books/cds to the temple?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advise me and thanks for your reply in advance.</p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi friend, <br><br>I believe you have been misguided by many superstitious and wrong information from folk religious believers about Buddhism. <br><br>In Buddhism, Dharma materials such as Buddhist books, sutras, dvds, tapes are all propagation materials which contians the teachings of the Buddha-Dharma and all these are respected because the Dharma (Teachings of Buddhism) is vital for the continuation and spread of Buddhism. <br><br>There is no such belief according to Buddhism that putting Buddhist materials at home or in room will cause disharmony among family members. Infact, sutras are normally honoured on the Altar of family as a symbolic expression of the Dharma teachings of the Buddha or Buddhist books are kept in clean shelves for the the family to read and understand the teachings of the Buddha. Esp, if you have children at home, the more you should expose your children to proper Buddhist books and materials and raise him/ her up with Buddhist values and identity. Buddhist scriptures are also encourged to be placed in homes so that anyone in the family will have the practise of reciting and recollecting the teachings of the Buddha through reciting it and importantly building the family on the Buddha as a source of faith.<br><br>Furthermore, according to Buddhism, we don't have "xiao ren", this is obviously a chinese folk religious belief which has nothing got to do with Buddhism and thus this methodlogy should not be applied on Buddhism, the Buddha taught us to express loving compassion towards all sentient beings because all beings are future Buddhas to be, not a single sentient being is being condemned by the Buddha as "xiao ren" , this untruthful hearsays about without using / reading sutras books will cause xiaoren is absolutely untrue and not in accord with Buddhist beliefs. <br><br>Infact I encourage you and your family to constantly read proper Buddhist books and sutras and build your family with Buddhist faith and guiding principles, this will help you and your family create happiness and love through faith bonding.<br><br>If there have been  unhappiness btw you and your spouse in these two years, first both of you should sit down and talk and solve the problem, if not? seek a family counseller for proper guidance and also start to build your family with proper Buddhist Faith and values by attending Dharma talks and praying together as a family. (Buddhist temples not the taoist ones) support each other with prayers, love and concern. This is whenby the Buddha will bestow his blessings upon family whom practises the Dharma in the rightful manner. <br><br>Yes, you can donate the books and materials to Buddhist temples free distribution corner if you do not want them anymore, this is not because you need to "deposit your bad luck" at a temple but to let the next person whom want to read the Buddhist book a chance to get it, in modern words, this is called "resource sharing". BUT remember, Buddhist sutras, books, tapes, vcds DO NOT causes disharmony among family, this is a grave misrepresentation by uninformed folk believers of some chinese traditonal religions.<br><br>May you and your family prosper and grow in love under the Buddha's blessings.<br><br>Namo @mituofo<br><br><br>With metta,<br>Goh</p></div>
