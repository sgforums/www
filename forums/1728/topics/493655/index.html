              Buddhism thrive on high</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Zhang Qian | February 8,
              2017,| ShanghaiDaily.com</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">PUTUO
              Mountain, a small island southeast of Shanghai, is a Buddhist pilgrimage site that
              has been attracting worshippers for thousands of years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is known as the “Buddhist kingdom on the sea.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              legend behind the site dates back to the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), when a
              Japanese monk, Hui’e, studying Buddhism in China was attracted to a statute of
              the bodhisattva Guanyin (Avalokitesvara), the goddess of mercy, compassion,
              kindness and love, at the Fahua Temple on Wutai Mountain in inland Shanxi
              Province. He finally secured the abbot’s permission to transport the statue
              back to Japan to help popularize the religion there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              the trip, his boat was wracked by storms, fog and countless iron lotus flowers
              on the surface of the sea near the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province. The
              stunned monk took it as a sign from Guanyin that she didn’t want to go to
              Japan. According to the legend, a giant iron bull appeared and carved a path
              through the sea by swallowing the lotus. The path led to a cave near an estuary
              on Putuo Mountain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              monk managed to get the statue on shore, where a fisherman was so awed by her
              presence that he gave his house over to her. The house became a temple known as
              Bukenqu Guanyin Yuan, which literally translates as “Refusing to Go Guanyin
              Temple.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Putuo
              Mountain is one of the “Four Great Buddhist Mountains of China.” Today, on this
              13-square-kilometer island, more than 200 temples and nunneries exist. Buddhist
              believers travel from afar to seek the mercy of Guanyin, even dating back to
              olden times when the sea voyage could be treacherous.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              original Bukenqu Temple, rebuilt in 1980, retains its former look. It has three
              simple halls surrounded by a yellow wall. It stands as a monument to the idea
              that faith doesn’t need luxuriously decorated temples to honor the deities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              written notice is found on nearly every temple on the island, suggesting that
              burning three plain incense sticks is sufficient to show respect or deliver a
              message. A pack of three sticks sells for 1 yuan (14.7 US cents).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Generally,
              it is all right for visitors to burn incense at every temple they visit, but
              they are advised to make a wish with only one Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Not
              far from the Refusing to Go Guanyin Temple is a partially submerged cave called
              Chaoyin, or “sound of the waves.” It is believed to be the site where the monk
              Hui’e landed and transported the statue ashore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              cave is also the site where Guanyin is said to have appeared to a devout Indian
              monk who burnt his fingers to honor her. An advisory carved there in the Ming
              Dynasty (1368-1644) warns visitors against repeating his ritual.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Other
              legendary sites include Duangu Shengji, where Guanyin is supposed to have
              disguised herself to provide food to a hungry girl on a boat, and Er Gui Ting
              Fa Shi, a stone where two turtles are said to have listened to Guanyin’s
              explanation of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are four big Buddhist temples on the island — Puji, Huiji, Fayu and Baotuo. The
              first three are open to public, but Baotuo Temple is reserved for private
              religious rituals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              most big Buddhist temples may look similar to those not familiar with the
              religion, Puji Temple is somewhat different. It has rarely opened its front
              gate since the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              story goes that the emperor, traveling incognito in plain clothes, was
              enchanted with the beautiful scenery of Putuo Mountain. Arriving at Puji Temple
              late in the evening, he knocked and asked the monk who came to the door to
              inform the abbot that a distinguished guest had arrived and the main gate
              should be opened for him to enter and stay overnight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              abbot told the monk he was happy to provide accommodation but insisted that the
              visitor enter by the side gate because temple rules required the main entrance
              to be closed after dark. The young monk got the message mixed up and told the
              emperor that he should not stay the night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              angry emperor, who had to journey to Hangzhou for a bed, ordered the main
              entrance of Puji Temple closed forever. The abbot later tried to rectify the
              misunderstanding, and the emperor finally relented and agreed that the main
              entrance could be opened, but only every 60 years or for auspicious occasions
              such as an emperor’s visit or the death of an abbot.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              trip to Putuo Mountain is no longer a life-threatening journey. Many of the
              Zhoushan Islands are now linked by bridges, which means the area can be reached
              by bus from Shanghai and Ningbo. The bus terminates at the Shenjiamen Bus
              Station, and from the Banshengdong Wharf on the Shenjiamen waterfront, it’s a
              10-minute fast-ferry trip to Putuo Mountain, costing about 22 yuan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              protect the environment of the island, no private vehicles are allowed on
              shore. Shuttle buses carry visitors from one site to another. A cable car trip
              to the top of mountain costs 35 yuan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              to get there: Direct ferry services to the island are available from Shanghai
              and Ningbo. There are two boats departing from Shanghai. One leaves in the
              evening for an overnight trip while the other leaves early in the morning. The
              ferries that run from Wusong Dock in Shanghai to the island cost 109-499 yuan a
              trip.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Tips:
              Once on the island, package tickets to sites on Putuo Mountain cost 160 yuan
              from February to November, and 140 yuan for December and January. The price may
              rise to 200 yuan during special times such as national holidays.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Some
              temples charge an extra 5-6 yuan for a ticket to burn incense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              island hosts a number of high-end hotels, averaging 1,000 yuan per night. There
              are also cozy inns run by local residents out of their homes, usually costing
              no more than 200 yuan a night. Innkeepers sometimes invite guests to a
              courtyard dinner against the backdrop of the setting sun.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Puji,
              Fayu and Huiji Temples provide vegetarian meals for devout Buddhist followers,
              while numerous street restaurants featuring fresh seafood are often crowded
              with visitors at dinnertime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">THE
              grandiose quartet of sacred Buddhist mounts</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">IN
              addition to Putuo Mountain southeast of Shanghai, there are three other
              spiritual sites in China that comprise what is known as the “Four Great
              Buddhist Mountains.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wutai Mountain</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mountain in Shanxi Province perhaps tops the list of the “great four” because
              of its long history of religious development. It is believed to be the place of
              enlightenment for Manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wutai
              translates as “five plateaus,” and the mountain is duly comprised of five
              peaks, all of them broad and flat. The mountain covers about 3,000 square
              kilometers, with the highest summit at 3,061 meters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              Wutai Mountain was originally a Taoist site, Buddhism came to the area in the
              Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-220). Conflicts rose between Taoists and Buddhists.
              A truce of sorts was reached by an ancient ritual of burning religious texts to
              see which survived the flames. All the Taoist classics were destroyed in the
              fire, it is said, while those of Buddhism remained intact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              its height, Wutai Mountain was home to more than 300 Buddhist temples, which
              were gradually merged into 39 temples on the mountain and eight in outlying
              areas. The most well-known are Xiantong Temple, Tayuan Temple, Wenshu Temple,
              Shuxiang Temple and Longhu Temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wutai
              Mountain was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Emei Mountain</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mountain in Sichuan Province is believed to be the place of enlightenment for
              Samantabhadram, the bodhisattva of meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Emei,
              with its top peak rising 3,079 meters, is a popular tourist destination and
              pilgrimage site. The first temple there was completed in the first century as
              Buddhism entered China along the Old Silk Road. The religion thrived from the
              6th century, and Sichuan Province was once the center of the Zen school of
              Chinese Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              8-meter-high statue of Samantabhadra was built in the famous beamless Wannian
              Temple in the 9th century and is still worshipped today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              were once more than 1,000 Buddhist temples on Emei Mountain, leaving a rich
              legacy of relics and architecture. Today, some 30 temples remain, including
              Baoguo Temple, Fuhu Temple and Huazang Temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Emei
              Mountain was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jiuhua Mountain</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mountain in Anhui Province honors Ksitigarbha, the bodhisattva who is
              considered a protector of children and a guardian of souls in hell.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              mountain covers some 120 square kilometers and includes nine scenic peaks. The
              setting is lush, with waterfalls, pine and bamboo forests, deep caves and
              picturesque rocks. It is said that Ksitigarbha once lived in a cave there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Legend
              has it that the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) poet Li Bai traveled to Jiuhua and
              wrote: “Sailing down the Jiujiang River, I saw the Jiuhua peaks in the
              distance, looking like a heavenly river hanging in heaven. The sacred mountain
              generates nine glories.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During
              the golden periods of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties,
              there were as many as 360 temples and up to 5,000 monks and nuns living there. Today,
              about 80 temples remain, including Huacheng, Guoqing and Dabeilou temples.</span></p>
