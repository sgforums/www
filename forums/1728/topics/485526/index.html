              identified with, tho it might be subtly identified with perhaps?</span></span></span></span></span>"<br><br><br>I replied:<br><br><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span>In
               your model, the universe is made up of many different circles. Each 
              circle represents an individual's experience. And within each individual
               circle, there is a dot or eye at the center, which represents the agent
               or center or perceiver of experience</span></span><span><span><span> that sees/knows/feels the field of experience. The eye or center cannot see beyond that circle.</span><br><br><span>In
               actuality there is no center. In other words, the 
              seeing/hearing/sensing/cognizing/thinking field is simply a 
              self-cognizing sensations, perceptions, etc. The circle is a 
              self-luminous, self-aware circle with no center or perceiver apart from 
              perceiving/perception. There can be a perception of a center, but there 
              is never a center of perception. Even that perception of a center is 
              just another perception, no different from another sight or sound as 
              part of the field of perceptions/sensations. Clear seeing (realization 
              of anatta) will eliminate the perception of a center (after insight 
              there can still be a trace of self but will also gradually be released 
              with practice). </span><br><br><span>Furthermore,
               we have to penetrate dependent origination. This is where net of indra 
              comes in. Each circle, each node, in the universe is a reflection of all
               other nodes. There is no universal self underlying all nodes, but 
              instead, one node reflects all nodes. All nodes are manifestation of 
              total exertion of the universe. This is also where our holographic 
              nature can be seen. Omniscience is possible not because there is a 
              universal Self subsuming all, but because of our interconnectedness and 
              emptiness. Psychic phenomena happen because of the non-local nature of 
              dependent origination.<br><br>...a while later I wrote...<br><br><br></span></span></span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span>I'm
               not sure what you mean by 'your body is being followed'. But what I can
               tell you here is that the construct or sense of a body being here has 
              dissolved... and Goenka describes this very well when he said, "...Then 
              working with both you reach the st</span></span><span><span><span>age
               of feeling sensation throughout the body—sabba-kÄ�ya. Initially it is 
              very gross, solidified, intensified, but as you keep practising 
              patiently, persistently, remaining equanimous with every experience, the
               whole body dissolves into subtle vibrations, and you reach the stage of
               bhaá¹…ga, total dissolution. Having started with natural breath, you 
              learn to reach the important station of feeling sensations in the whole 
              body in one breath: from top to bottom as you breathe out, from bottom 
              to top as you breathe in..."</span><br><br><span>There is no denial of anything, just that everything dissolves into luminous vibrations<br><br>...a while later I wrote...<br><br><br></span></span></span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Oh
               ok I think I get what you mean. It seems that you think (and feel) that
               there is an observer that follows the body around and experiences the 
              body. Like the third-person camera view that follows around a character 
              in a video game like GTA. This is false because first of all as 
              explained above, the 'body' is really just an imputed construct, like a 
              placeholder with a supposed fixed shape and boundaries, but when we see 
              through the construct then there is just vibrant patterns of energies 
              and dissolution of a substantial mind-body. We literally feel no 
              boundaries and instead vibrant energies that is disjoint yet in total 
              exertion.</span><br><br><span>Secondly
               there simply was never an observer who can 'follow' or 'observe' 
              anything. Sensations are self-luminous, meaning, sensation feels, no 
              feeler involved. Scenery (i.e. vision) sees, no seer. They simply happen
               and are aware-ing so to speak. There is no such thing as an inner 
              person inside the head looking out there at the world as depicted in 
              cartesian dualism ( </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.overthinkingit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cartesian_theater-300x236.jpg">http://www.overthinkingit.com/.../cartesian_theater...</a><span> ). There is in seeing just scenery, full stop. In hearing just sound. That is anatta (later should go into twofold emptiness).</span><br><br><span>Another
               thing I think it's important to point out is that the so called 
              'circle' or 'mindstream' is simply another placeholder, another 
              conventional label or imputation. There is no real 'circles' or 
              'mindstreams'... it is like h2o is empty of being an entity or having a 
              substance called 'water' but due to the aggregation of two hydrogen 
              atoms and one oxygen atom, a conventional label is applicable called 
              'water molecule'. Yet there is no such thing as a core or waterness that
               resides in the center of the three molecules connecting and 
              coordinating them. No waterness of water can be found apart from 
              imputation. Likewise due to the five aggregations or skandhas the 
              conventional label 'person' is applied but in actuality there is no real
               person or soul or core. And likewise, 'mind' is a conventional label 
              for the four mental aggregates, which are all self-luminous, manifesting
               transience that dependently originates and is fundamentally empty and 
              non-arising.</span><br><br><span>As 3rd Karmapa says, "Mind is no mind--the mind's nature is empty of any entity that is mind</span><br><span>Being empty, it is unceasing and unimpeded,</span><br><span>manifesting as everything whatsoever."</span><br><br><span>One last point.</span><br><br><span>It
               is important not to subsume subject-object into Self, as that can 
              either mean subsuming into a universal consciousness, or leads to seeing
               that everything is self and therefore other mindstreams are subsumed 
              into self, which is sollipsistic. Both are false views. The point is to 
              see through inherency, not to subsume one pole to another (either object
               into subject, or subject into object). </span><br><br><span>Conventionally,
               water is still water, and is not the same as for example, carbon 
              dioxide molecule. The point is not to collapse all types of molecules 
              into one 'water substance', but to see through the inherency and touch 
              the manifestation and dependencies. Likewise I am still I, you are still
               you, conventionally. Through insights into anatta and emptiness we see 
              through the inherency of Self, mind, body, and therefore experience 
              becomes direct gapless self-luminous because there is no more imputing 
              the perception of inherent subjectivity and objectivity and instead one 
              penetrates the reification and touch the suchness of the six entries. 
              Yet there is no absolutist claims like 'There is only THIS' or 'There is
               only SELF' or 'There is only X and no others', etc, which is really 
              still an essentialist/substantialist/inherent view.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Thanks for your sharing and honesty about the deep unwillingness to relinquish ownership of body. As Buddhists we must be aware of the deep I and mine making, that is what makes us unwilling to cut off our organs or legs or hands and give it to someone else. Let's not even speak about our own organs... if you have sons and daughters, you will feel deep sadness when one of them dies or some mishap happens. Or if you are a billionaire or millionaire, imagine losing all your money overnight during a financial crash or recession. It is truly painful only due to the I and mine making, sense of ownership, possessiveness. We don't feel much pain when someone else loses their money or children. It is only possible for us to overcome this bond through meditating on the dharma, dependent origination, anatta, anicca, until deep wisdom completely clears our bonds. That is why we practice.<br><br>What you said about control is also very important. There are a few aspects to anatta.<br><br>As the teachings point out, there are Four Kinds of Clinging to Self<br>     There are four kinds of clinging to self arising out of the belief in a self or soul.<br> <br>     1.Clinging to Self as the Master (SÄ�mi Atta)<br>     2.Clinging to Self as an Abiding Soul (NivÄ�sÄ« Atta)<br>     3.Clinging to Self as the Doer (KÄ�raka Atta)<br>     4.Clinging to Self as the Experiencer (Vedaka Atta)</p>

                      background; instead to there being two (experiencer-experienced) or 
                      three (experiencer-experiencing-experienced) things it's resolv</span></span><span><span><span>ed
                       that in reference to what is experienced there is precisely only what 
                      is experienced. This is resolving that self as witness/observer is 
                      non-arisen since it depends on imputation.</span><br><br><span>Secondly
                       it's resolved that in that naked foreground manifestation there is no 
                      active subject endowed with cognitive or productive 
                      abilities/capacities. This is resolving that self as controller/doer is 
                      non-arisen since it depends on imputation.</span><br><br><span>Thirdly
                       it's resolved that in that naked foreground manifestation without both 
                      active and in-active subject there is not a single phenomenon that could
                       be said to be "mine". This is resolving that self as owner/posessor is 
                      non-arisen since it depends on imputation.</span><br><br><span>Last
                       aspect... Is to resolve that there is no pervailing 
                      substance/beingness/awareness that remains unchanged... No global source
                       for naked manifestation and likewise no "the awareness" and the like. 
                      This is resolving that self as universal selfhood is non-arisen since it
                       depends on imputation.</span><br><br><span>First aspect is that there is no receiving end for thought... Just thought without background against which it appears.</span><br><br><span>Second aspect is that we don't find any thinker behind thoughts who is emitting them.</span><br><br><span>Third aspect is that we don't find any thought that we could pin down as "mine", belonging to "me".</span><br><br><span>Fourth
                       aspect is that we don't find any universal unchanging essence in any 
                      possible relationship to thoughts (identical with them, different from 
                      them, being in them, containing them or possessing them).</span><br><br><span>Sentient
                       being is conventional term when there is ignorance, attachment and 
                      aversion... and delusion of self-view that solidifies this process of 
                      grasping into substantial being. Meaning sentient being is term for 
                      grasping at self as</span><br><br><span>a)observer/witness</span><br><span>b)controller/doer</span><br><span>c)owner</span><br><span>d)abiding soul/being/essence/source</span><br><br><span>When
                       it's directly resolved in one's own mindstream both poles of sentient 
                      and insentient are seen to be delusory... If something that was posited 
                      as sentient is non-arisen exactly to what we could compare "insentient"?
                       How many one-sided coins we could find?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>Thanks for your sharing and honesty about the deep unwillingness to relinquish ownership of body. As Buddhists we must be aware of the deep I and mine making, that is what makes us unwilling to cut off our organs or legs or hands and give it to someone else. Let's not even speak about our own organs... if you have sons and daughters, you will feel deep sadness when one of them dies or some mishap happens. Or if you are a billionaire or millionaire, imagine losing all your money overnight during a financial crash or recession. It is truly painful only due to the I and mine making, sense of ownership, possessiveness. We don't feel much pain when someone else loses their money or children. It is only possible for us to overcome this bond through meditating on the dharma, dependent origination, anatta, anicca, until deep wisdom completely clears our bonds. That is why we practice.<br><br>What you said about control is also very important. There are a few aspects to anatta.<br><br>As the teachings point out, there are Four Kinds of Clinging to Self<br>    There are four kinds of clinging to self arising out of the belief in a self or soul.<br><br>    1.Clinging to Self as the Master (SÄ�mi Atta)<br>    2.Clinging to Self as an Abiding Soul (NivÄ�sÄ« Atta)<br>    3.Clinging to Self as the Doer (KÄ�raka Atta)<br>    4.Clinging to Self as the Experiencer (Vedaka Atta)</p>

              <p>Yes, clinging. That's exactly what it is, when we try to control our possessions.</p>
              <p>We try to control everything because we cling to them.</p>
              <p>But of course, we can control things but only limited control. This we can experience for ourselves.</p>
              <p>E.g. when we are studying or doing meditation, we can concentrate our mind but usually after a while, you find your mind wanders, tired, bored or even sleepy.. :)</p>
