Jesus words are truly full of parables.<br><br>I found this based on an essay on christian mysticism:<br><br>In My FatherÂ’s house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there you may be also. I will not leave you comfortless, but will come to you. -John 14<br><br>The Edgar Cayce discourses have some of the most insightful comments on this well-known quote from JesusÂ’ Last Supper teachings. Â“As you read, Â‘In my FatherÂ’s house,Â’ know that it means in your FatherÂ’s house, in your own soul, in your own experience are the many mansions! And Â‘were it not so, I would have told you,Â’ means that if it were not so, you yourself would have known!Â”<br><br>As with so much of the deep-trance material that came through Cayce, it takes us deep within our consciousness:<br><br>Â“Â‘In my FatherÂ’s house are many mansions,Â’ means many consciousnesses, many stages of enfoldment, of unfoldment, of blessings, of sources. Thus as He declares, Â‘Behold I stand continuously before the door of your consciousness, of your own mansion.Â’ For your body is indeed the temple of the living God. And there He has promised to meet you.Â”<br><br>This sounds so easy and yet is so difficult in the doing. The Cayce readings, which come from attunement to GodÂ’s universal consciousness, teach that often the problem is of our own making. We expect the Divine to be spectacular, but it is subtle, still, and gentle. We doubt, even when it is close at hand. The Divine Consciousness is so close and we are so much a portion of Its being that we are one. Â“Not only God is God, but self is a part of that Oneness,Â” says Cayce. Â“So oft in seeking that some great thing may be done does the soul stumble over itself, but Â‘I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am there you may be also, and if I go I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there you may be also.Â’ And, Â‘I will not leave you comfortless, but will come and enjoin you in your daily activities, your daily service.Â’ This is the promise to every soul. If you would make that promise your own, then seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. Let there be definite periods when you look within self, cleansing the mind, the body, in such ways and manners and measures that you would offer as your offering unto the holy experiences that may be yours. For, he that expects nothing shall not be disappointed, but he that expects much -- if he lives and uses that in hand day by day -- shall be full to running over.Â”<br><br>LetÂ’s be expectant, believing, and budgeting the time for deep inner at-onement with the Divine.<br><br>Â“How? How, then, may you approach the throne? Turn yourself within. As you meditate, give forth in your own words these thoughts:<br><br>Â“Â‘Father, God, maker of heaven and earth! I am yours -- you are mine! As I claim that kinship with that Holy Love, keep you me in that consciousness of your presence abiding with me; that I may be that channel of blessings to others, that I may know your grace, your mercy, your love -- even as I show such to my fellow man!Â’<br><br>Â“And you may be very sure the answer comes within. Thus, as you apply -- the answer comes. By applying -- we do not mean a separation from the world. For even as He, you are IN the world but not OF the world. But putting away the worldly things you take hold upon the spiritual things, knowing that the worldly are but the shadows of the real.Â”<br><br>Try the deep meditative method on page four of this issue. It has helped me reach these levels of oneness with God, a universal, infinite God of many mansions, many dimensions yet knowable personally. As Cayce said, Â“I am yours and you are mine!Â” Claiming that kinship as we move out of ourselves and into the Presence is enlivening.<br><br>A place has been prepared for us, and we have help in getting there. Abiding in that heavenly place for just a few minutes each day can make a wondrous difference in our lives and the lives of those around us. Enjoy.

Then we should worship him? But, Buddha is not a deity, neither claimed to be one, and was never worshipped.

But he was not the only one, because countless others, even today, do remember their past lives, although the number of past lives they remember is of course incomparibly less than that of Buddha, because Buddha himself had practised for many lifetimes before attaining Buddhahood. Also what is the meaning of the term 'deity like powers' which you coined? Due to our current inability to understand, the poverty of our classical science to comprehend how these "powers" came about, our mind infer/connect these powers with 'deities' because we cannot understand 'deities'. In Buddhism, which is a non-theistic teaching, we do not relate 'powers' with deities. Our inability to understand it through our current logical analysis or with classical science doesn't mean it has to do with higher powers of deities, we just have to practise and see for ourselves. It is not 'superstitious', because we can see for ourselves the nature of the mind, we do not merely blindly believe in what is said. Just like scientists will do the experiment themselves. I have posted before something by Ken Wilber, he said some people criticise others without first looking through Galileo's telescope.<br><br>As a matter of fact the Buddha taught how we can attain these powers ourselves, it is certainly not an unachievable feat that is only within reach of non-humans or some divine figures 'up there', and through the practise of Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom (the Buddha however, did not recommend in general, particular yogic exercises as compared to some other religions to attain such powers). Therefore 'deity like' powers is certainly NOT the right way to describe these phenomena. You can say that Buddhism is a Science, that ultimately leads to liberation from all sufferings, vexations of the mind to realise the highest bliss of Nirvana. Supernatural powers are not the key issue in these, although it is true that through deep meditation we can ascertain for ourselves, see for ourselves that there really is such thing called rebirth.<br><br>In regards to powers that are gained through practises, you can refer to the topic: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053" rel="nofollow">amazing abilities by concentration</a> Also I would like to remind you what Ajahn Brahmavamso said, <span style="font-style: italic;">Even if a monk did perform a miracle, many people would say: "This is just a trick.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing I want to add, we have to accept that logical reasoning isn't the only mode of accessing, understanding and penetrating the nature of things.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Casino_King,<br><br>It is inadequate to use rational thought to understand spiritual matters. Logic is only that branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning.  It does not deal with all types of thinking such as remembering (Recalling past life included), dreaming (Dream Yoga), day dreaming, neurosis,  learning..etc.  These other types of thinking are the job of psychology and parapsychology.<br><br>Although evidence is needed to serve as a base for inductive and deductive reasoning, full proof evidence to arrive at a certain conclusion is not necessary in logical analysis.   In daily life, not all reasoning attempts to provide conclusive evidence for the truth of a given conclusion and more often than not, conclusive evidence cannot be produced.  For pragmatic ground,  we merely want the evidence we arrived at be 'well founded'.<br><br>As human, sleeping and dreaming took up pretty much percentage of our life.  We are not just a rational being, to understand human, we have to deal with all these matters with spiritual issues included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>Would also like to share something by the Dalai Lama:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....Nowadays physicists explain phenomena do not exist objectively in and of themselves but exists in the context of involvement with an observer. I feel that the relation between matter and consciousness is a place where eastern philosophy and western science could meet. I think this would be a happy marriage with no divorce. If we work along the lines of a joint effort by Buddhist scholars with experience in meditation and unbiased physicists to engage in a deeper research in the relation between matter and consciousness, we may find beautiful things which may be helpful. Also those scientists working on the human brain working on the field of neurology could benefit from the Buddhist explanations about consciousness. Some time ago, I asked a neurologist how memory functions. He reported they still have not found a concrete explanation. So in this field too we can work together. Some western medical professionals are also interested in curing certain illnesses through meditation. This is another interesting topic for joint project. Because of Buddhism's emphasis on self-creation, there is no Creator deity. Thus some consider it strictly speaking not a religion. A western scholar told me Buddhism is not a religion. It is a kind of science of mind. In this sense Buddhism does not belong to the category of religion. I consider this to be unfortunate. But in some sense Buddhism becomes closer to science. However from the scientists' viewpoint, Buddhism is a spiritual path. It is unfortunate that we do not seem to belong to science either. Buddhism thereby belongs to neither religion nor pure science. But this provides us an opportunity to make a bridge between faith and science. This is why I believe in the future we will work at bringing these two forces together. The majority of people ignore religion. But among those who do not, there is on one side of group who are experiencing the values of a spiritual path. On the other is a group who are denying any value to religion. As a result there is constant conflict between these factions. If one way or another we can help bring these two forces closer, it would be worthwhile....</span><br><br>- The Dalai Lama, Meaning of Life 3-4</div>
