            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Isis:<br><strong>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunyata in the Tathagatagarbha Sutras</span></strong><br><br>The class of Buddhist scriptures known as the Tathagatagarbha sutras presents a seemingly variant understanding of Emptiness, according to which the Buddha and Nirvana, unlike compounded, conditioned phenomena, are not empty of intrinsic existence, but merely empty of the impermanent, the painful and the Self-less. In the "Srimala Sutra" the Buddha is seen as empty of all defilement and ignorance, not of intrinsic Reality. The "Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra" supports such a vision and views Ultimate Emptiness as the Buddhic cognition ( "jnana" ) which perceives both Emptiness and non-Emptiness, wherein "the Empty is the totality of Samsara and the non-Empty is Great Nirvana". <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[u]The Buddha in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra further indicates that to view absolutely everything as empty is an unbalanced approach and constitutes a deviation from the middle path of Buddhism: "[u]The wise perceive Emptiness and non-Emptiness, the Eternal and the Impermanent, Suffering and Bliss, the Self and the non-Self.</span> ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To perceive the Emptiness of everything and not to perceive non-Emptiness is not termed the Middle Way; to perceive the non-Self of everything and not to perceive the Self is not termed the Middle Way.</span>" [/u][/u]Moreover, this particular sutra contains a passage in which the Buddha castigates those who view the Tathagatagarbha (which is the indwelling, immortal Buddha-element) in each being as empty, declaring of them that they are effectively committing a form of painful spiritual suicide through their wrongheaded stance: "By having cultivated non-Self in connection with the Tathagatagarbha and having continually cultivated Emptiness, suffering will not be eradicated but one will become like a moth in the flame of a lamp." (Tibetan version of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra). The attainment of nirvanic Liberation ("moksha"), by contrast, is said to open up a realm of "utter bliss, joy, permanence, stability, [and] eternity" (ibid), in which the Buddha is "fully peaceful" (Dharmakshema "Southern" version). Perhaps the clearest statement of Tathagatagarbha Buddhism's understanding of Emptiness is found in the Angulimaliya Sutra, where we read the following clarifying explanation:<br><br>" ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by cultivating extreme emptiness and continually considering things to be empty, one will behold the utter destruction of all phenomena. Though Liberation is not empty, one will see and think it to be empty. Thus, for example, having thought hail-stones to be jewels, one comes to think that real gems are empty [ÃºÃ»nya]. Likewise, you too think of phenomena which are not empty [aÃºÃ»nya] to be empty [ÃºÃ»nya], for viewing phenomena as empty, you dissolve into emptiness (ÃºÃ»nya) even those phenomena which are not empty. Some phenomena are empty [of existence] and some phenomena are not empty [of existence]. Just like the hail-stones, the billions of kleshas [mental and moral afflictions] are empty [of existence], like the hail-stones, those phenomena appertaining to ignorance are empty [of existence] and swiftly fade away. Like the real beryl gems, the Buddha is eternal. Liberation is like the real beryl gems."</span><br><br>Thus in the distinctive Tathagatagarbha sutras a balance is drawn between the empty, impermanent and coreless realm of samsara and the lasting, liberating Reality of the Buddha and Nirvana.<br><br>From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emptiness_%28Buddhism%29<br>[/b]</blockquote>therefore brahman is real and not empty, and if you think this statement is wrong its only because you yourself placed the restrictive qualities on brahman in your mind, right?</div>

Samsara is full of sufferings, even if you live in heaven, or an ok life on earth, nothing is lasting and satisfactory. Also, nirvana is the highest bliss so everyone should seek nirvana.<br><br>Secondly, you can only help people be liberated only if you are first liberated and enlightened yourself.</div>

That mode of cognition is dualistic.  All is Mind but this mind is not to be taken as Â‘SelfÂ’.  Â“I AmÂ”, Eternal Witness, are all products of our cognition and is the root cause that prevents true seeing.<br><br>The Â‘whoÂ’, Â‘whereÂ’ and Â‘whenÂ’, the Â‘IÂ’, Â‘hereÂ’ and Â‘nowÂ’ must ultimately give way to the experience of total transparency.  Do not fall back to a source, just the manifestation is sufficient.  This will become so clear that total transparency is experienced.  When total transparency is stabilized, transcendental body is experienced and dharmakaya is seen everywhere.  This is the samadhi bliss of Bodhisattva.  This is the fruition of practice.<br><br>Experience all appearance with total vitality, vividness and clarity.  They are really our Pristine Awareness, every moment and everywhere in all its manifolds and diversities.  When causes and conditions is, manifestation is, when manifestation is, Awareness is.

It will be better you drop them whether they are correct or wrong.. Of course wrong views should be corrected but any mental perceptions when clung to will hinder direct experience.
