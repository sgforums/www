Therefore the Buddha said, 'Human life is hard to attain, and it is difficult to encounter the dharma'.<br><br>Most people in Singapore and many other parts of the world are too busily engrossed in material pursuits and seeking in life. Their whole life is seeking, seeking and seeking... always looking for something at the external world, maybe satisfied for a while but not too long. It is very difficult for such people to be convinced that true joy and bliss can be found if we look within. Therefore, they are like the frog in the well, or perhaps its the other way round, 'they don't look at the box they are sitting on'. Now I'm not saying there is anything wrong with working to get a more decent living on the material level, but many people are totally attached to that story and completely engrossed in seeking a better material life, not knowing about any spiritual aspects. Most people's life are also far from blissful, often stormy and painful... if one were to know the Buddhadharma, then one would be able to transcend all this. Buddhism is a way of blissful living.<br><br>What is Buddhadharma all about? It is to discover our innate blissful, pure, indestructible nature... as opposed seeking things that are illusory and temporary. I can tell you, many people's life are truly a waste of time because what they attained will not last and is never satisfactory.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>My shi fu spent plenty of years wandering with no possessions, broken shelter, bad clothes and no good food<br><br><img src="http://xs74.xs.to/pics/06135/song1.GIF"><br><br>As was said above, one becomes truly wealthy only by finding one's 'jewel' - the all pervading dharma nature/buddha nature that is always present all long, can be found if we look within.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">[b]One day a stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then he asked: "What's that you're sitting on?" "Nothing, " replied the beggar. "Just an old box. I've been sitting on it for as long as I can remember. "Ever look inside?," asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point, there's nothing in there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar, reluctantly, managed to pry open the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with gold.<br><br>I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside.

In reality we do will not 'exist' without buddha nature. It is like a mirror that reflects all, without which we will not be aware of anything. It is like space, without space we cannot be. It is like a projector, and projects the entire world in our mind like a cinema projects the images on the screen. Buddha nature is also known as primordial luminosity, or like a sun. Therefore it is not a law that is under space and time. Our buddha nature transcend space and time and is ever present. But everyone is busy engrossed in the movie, not realising it is only a show, that it isn't real. They forgot to look within... The primordial consciousness. Any analogies described above is not it, only description and is very limited, like trying to describe colours to the blind. You can only describe things he could relate but you can never show him what colours are.</div>

Sensation is not the Self. Perception is not the Self. The mental constructions are not the Self. And neither is consciousness the Self. Perceiving this, O monks, the disciple sets no value on the body, or on sensation, or on perception, or on mental constructions, or on consciousness. Setting no value of them, he becomes free of passions and he is liberated. The knowledge of liberation arises there within him. And then he knows that he has done what has to be done, that he has lived the holy life, that he is no longer becoming this or that, that his rebirth is destroyed.' (Anatta-Lakkhana Sutta).<br><br>The Anatta doctrine of the Buddha is over 2500 years old. Today the thought current of the modern scientific world is flowing towards the Buddha's Teaching of Anatta or No-Soul. In the eyes of the modern scientists, man is merely a bundle of ever-changing sensations. <strong>Modern physicists say that the apparently solid universe is not, in reality, composed of solid substance at all, but actually a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flux of energy</span>. The modern physicist sees the whole universe as a process of transformation of various forces of which man is a mere part. The Buddha was the first to realize this. </strong></span><br><br>Soul-Theories<br><a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dhammananda/115.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dhammananda/115.htm</a><br><br>/\<br><br></div>
