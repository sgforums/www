It is<br>beyond the human brain to understand the world and its<br>environment, so the brain compensates by creating simplified<br>illusions that act as a replacement for understanding.<br>When the illusions work well and the human who subscribes<br>to the illusion survives, those illusions are passed to new<br>generations.<br><br>Â“The human brain is a delusion generator.<br>The delusions<br>are fueled by arroganceÂ—the arrogance that humans are the<br>center of the world, that we alone are endowed with the magical<br>properties of souls and morality and free will and love. We<br>presume that an omnipotent God has a unique interest in our<br>progress and activities while providing all the rest of creation<br>for our playground.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:</div><div class="quote_body">Then what is true?</div></blockquote>As I have explained to Cenarious, mind is a faculty that is conscious. Consciousness is in itself formless and is conscious of form.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The fact that the mind is formless means that it is unconstrained, and hence has immense potential. The mind can comprehend all objects including its own creations.  The description of the root mind as 'formless' doesn't just refer to its non-material nature, but it emphasises that it is unlimited, non-mechanistic and totally free from any structure or topology. So it it is free from steps, loops, branches, strings, tables, stacks, queues, datastructures and all the other algorithmic constraints . In Buddhist psychology the root mind is non-physical and non-algorithmic.  The mind cannot be understood in terms of circuit diagrams and flowcharts. It is pure awareness.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry just to correct certain things i said about consciousness cos i think my explanation not adequate. Awareness is not only formless, its nature is empty... It is completely empty. Not knowing this, the 'formless' source can be an object of clinging. This awareness is also not separate from form, otherwise it would be dualistic. It is not separate from conditions.. Neither is it equal to its conditions. Not two, not one. Being non dualistic it is completely beyond the mind's ability to comprehend, because the mind functions in dualistic ways. It can only be experienced through mindfulness.</div>

'I am' currently embarking onto a new stage... and this article seems to correlates.<br><br>'I am' now, at times, seeing how mind cognate and sees 'things' and 'individual'. This is an unconscious gripping habit that forms concepts from perceptions that are derive from the other streams that forms the sensory data... all of which are 'streams' of cause and effects.<br><br>For, in truth, there are no things and no individuals. Just as there is no 'you' as a self, there are no others as 'self' too.

' Purpose' or meaning are all conceptualised at the cognitive level... that is why... the deeper state of nature cannot be known through discussion and arguing... because all these activities are operating at the conceptual and cognitive level.<br><br>Just my opinion...please read with discernment... thanks.</div></blockquote>purpose has to do with habit-energy isn't it? no habit-energy means no purpose right?</div>
