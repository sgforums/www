Yes, to treat the experience of luminosity as a source hiding somewhere is the wrong way of understanding God/Brahman. Only through realising dependent origination, and through direct experience (see thusness's six stages of experience) will one fully understand its nature. Not understanding as in knowledge or theory, because nothing at this level can be grasped by the gross mind. The gross mind only understands things intellectually but never intuitively. Although countless mystics have experienced the 'true experience' that is beyond all description although you may call it 'God' or 'absolute', which cannot be doubted when experienced because it is more real than real, many are blinded by this transcendental experience and fail to see its true nature... And tightly cling onto the formless. The wise neither clings to form nor formless.</div>

Sensation is not the Self. Perception is not the Self. The mental constructions are not the Self. And neither is consciousness the Self. Perceiving this, O monks, the disciple sets no value on the body, or on sensation, or on perception, or on mental constructions, or on consciousness. Setting no value of them, he becomes free of passions and he is liberated. The knowledge of liberation arises there within him. And then he knows that he has done what has to be done, that he has lived the holy life, that he is no longer becoming this or that, that his rebirth is destroyed.' (Anatta-Lakkhana Sutta).<br><br>The Anatta doctrine of the Buddha is over 2500 years old. Today the thought current of the modern scientific world is flowing towards the Buddha's Teaching of Anatta or No-Soul. In the eyes of the modern scientists, man is merely a bundle of ever-changing sensations. [b]Modern physicists say that the apparently solid universe is not, in reality, composed of solid substance at all, but actually a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flux of energy</span>. The modern physicist sees the whole universe as a process of transformation of various forces of which man is a mere part.

Only a matter without mass have infinite velocity.</blockquote>i am no expert in Physic, but found this regarding the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">experience </span>of time slowing" of a person in a spaceship.<br><br>from the Physics expert, QnA:<br><a href="http://experts.about.com/q/Physics-1358/Time-travel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://experts.about.com/q/Physics-1358/Time-travel.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Question<br><br>If a spaceship is traveling at the<br>speed of light and time is slowing so<br>say how does the spaceship travel the<br>186,000 miles in a second?<br><br>Answer<br>First of all, let's change your question to "spaceship is traveling CLOSE to the speed of light". Anything with mass can not travel at that high a speed.<br><br>Now let's explain what we mean when we say "time is slowing." The situation is as follows:<br><br>Someone is in a spaceship. I won't say "standing still" because one of Einstein's postulates is that motion can only be described as relative to something else, so you can say that the person is standing still relative to the spaceship she is in.<br><br>Anyway, she sees another spaceship going by at 99% of the speed of light IN HER REST FRAME.  She looks at the ruler, the clock, and the kilogram weight on that ship.  She says "How odd: the clock in that spaceship is going slow, that ruler is too short, and that mass is more than a kilogram."<br><br>Meanwhile, the person in the second spaceship looks at the clock, the ruler, and the kilogram weight in the first spaceship. HE says "How odd: the clock in the ship stationary to the stars is going slow, the ruler is too short, and that mass is more than a kilogram."<br><br>It's important to emphasize that BOTH people are correct in how they view the other's measuring devices: in THEIR own frame. If you make the first postulate (No way to tell if you are moving or standing still EXCEPT relative to something else) AND the second -- No matter what frame you are in, light will always be measured as traveling at the same speed -- and then do the math, you get these results.  It's a bit confusing, I admit, but experiments have shown this is what happens. </blockquote>some "abstruct" illusions there.<br><br>/\<br></div>
