That apart from the phenomena arising and ceasing, there is no 'self' or 'Self' to be found anywhere.  That 'I' and 'Self' completely dissapear.  It is not something theoritical or conceptual.  It is the truth that has been distorted by dualistic perception.   It is a very distinct phase of transiting from dualistic experience of reality into non-dual.  In terms of Presence, yes.

Which is why it is important that at death there is someone reading the pointing out instructions to the dying on recognising the clear light as one's true nature and merge with it. Even for one who has recognised/glimpsed it in his lifetime may still need someone to remind him at that time unless one is already totally liberated. By the way did you read the tibetan book of the dead?</div>

For example if one take a look at God based religions all have similar concepts like concept of god, soul theory, eternal hell or eternal heaven.

Let's say your father is expert at business, and under his guidance you have the expertise in business. Then your father is in a way, reborn as a different form - as 'you'.<br><br>In Buddhism, consciousness is ever changing, and like energy it is can neither be destroyed nor created, but rather is ever changing in different forms. Similarly consciousness is not annihilated at death, neither is it eternal, it reborns as a different form. There is no 'soul', no 'self' that is undergoing reincarnation. At a deeper level, every moment we are reborn... because our thoughts are like a continuous chain, one leading to the next. If we can glimpse the reality that there never was a self, we will put an end to rebirth, put an end to that chain, even if it were only for a brief moment. It is a glimpse of Nirvana.<br><br>Actually I don't really mean to put an end to all changes... things continue to change in the world, that is reality. There is only this ever-changingness. Here is a very good article by Ajahn Brahmavamso on No-Self:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=49" rel="nofollow">http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=49</a><br><br>...When philosophy books talk about 'self reflection' or 'self knowledge', the fact that not only do "I know", but that "I know that I know", or that "I know that I know that I know", is given as a proof of the existence of a self. I have looked into that experience, in order to see what actually was going on with this 'knowing' business. Using the depth of my meditation, with the precision that that gave to mindfulness, to awareness, I could see the way this mind was actually working. What one actually sees is this procession of events, that which we call 'knowing'. It's like a procession, just one thing arising after the other in time. When I saw something, then a fraction of a moment afterwards I knew that I saw, and then a fraction of a moment afterwards I knew that I knew that I saw. There is no such thing as, "I know that I know that I know". The truth of the matter is, "I know that I knew that I knew". When one adds the perspective of time, one can see the causal sequence of moments of consciousness. Not seeing that causal sequence can very easily give rise to the illusion of a continuous 'knower'. This illusion of a continuous 'knower' is most often where people assume that their 'self' resides.<br><br>However, as it says in the suttas, one can see that even knowing is conditioned (sankhata) (MN 64). One can see that this too rises because of causes, and then ceases when the causes cease. This is actually where one starts to see through the illusion of objectivity. It is impossible to separate the 'knower' from the known....<br><br>-----<br><br>'<strong>Knowing' is like the particles of sand on a beach. From a distance it looks like there is no gap, no space, between those grains of sand. Then one goes closer and closer and closer and sees that there are just grains of sand, and in between those grains there is nothing. Nothing runs through those grains of sand. Like water in a stream. It looks like there is a continuous flow. However, once one gets closer with a microscope, an electron microscope, one can see that between the water molecules there is nothing, just space. One can then see the granular nature of consciousness. One consciousness arises and then another disappears. As it says in the Satipatthana Samyutta, "cittas arise and pass away" (SN 47, 42).</strong></blockquote><blockquote>"The life of a sentient being is a long dream. Existence only appears to be real. When one finally awakens, or attains Buddhahood, existence is seen for what it is--a sequence of illusions. Until that time, people will remain obsessed by the body, mind, and external phenomena, not realizing that they are illusory. You will live in a dream, thinking that it is reality. . . .<br><br><strong>"Sentient beings mistakenly view their moment-to-moment illusory existence as a continuous, connected lifetime. Because they are unaware that their life is unreal, they do not attempt to wake up."</strong><br><br>--ChÂ’an Master Sheng-yen, Complete Enlightenment, pp. 108-109</blockquote>Just for sharing, some J Krishnamurti's quotes that arrived in my mail in the past 2 days:<br><br>=== JKrishnamurti.org - Daily Quote ===<br><strong>In Death Is Immortality</strong><br><br>Surely, in ending there is renewal, is there not? It's only in death that a new thing comes into being. I am not giving you comfort. This is not something to be believed or thought about or intellectually examined and accepted, for then you will make it into another comfort, as you now believe in reincarnation or continuity in the hereafter, and so on. But the actual fact is that that which continues has no rebirth, no renewal. Therefore, in dying every day there is renewal, there is a rebirth. That is immortality. In death there is immortality - not the death of which you are afraid, but the death of previous conclusions, memories, experiences, with which you are identified as the Ã¢Â€Âœme.Ã¢Â€Â� In the dying of the Ã¢Â€ÂœmeÃ¢Â€Â� every minute there is eternity, there is immortality, there is a thing to be experienced - not to be speculated upon or lectured about, as you do about reincarnation and all that kind of stuff.... When you are no longer afraid, because every minute there is an ending and therefore a renewal, then you are open to the unknown. Reality is the unknown. Death is also the unknown. But to call death beautiful, to say how marvelous it is because we shall continue in the hereafter and all that nonsense, has no reality. What has reality is seeing death as it is - an ending; an ending in which there is renewal, a rebirth, not a continuity. For that which continues decays; and that which has the power to renew itself is eternal. The Book of Life - November 16<br><br>=== JKrishnamurti.org - Daily Quote ===<br><strong>Reincarnation Is Essentially Egotistic</strong><br><br>You want me to give you an assurance that you will live another life, but in that there is no happiness or wisdom. The search for immortality through reincarnation is essentially egotistic, and therefore not true. Your search for immortality is only another form of the desire for the continuance of self-defensive reactions against life and intelligence. Such a craving can only lead to illusion. So what matters is not whether there is reincarnation, but to realize complete fulfillment in the present. And you can do that only when your mind and heart are no longer protecting themselves against life. The mind is cunning and subtle in its self-defense, and it must discern for itself the illusory nature of self-protection. This means that you must think and act completely anew. You must liberate yourself from the net of false values which environment has imposed upon you. There must be utter nakedness. Then there is immortality, reality. The Book of Life - November 17</div>

It reminds me of this passage (the terms he used aren't really Buddhist but I feel this passage is relevant here):<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/pathwa_titoat.cfm/" rel="nofollow">http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/pathwa_titoat.cfm/</a><br><br>Pathways: Why does Spirit bother to manifest at all, especially when that manifestation is necessarily painful and requires that It become amnesiac to Its true identity? Why does God incarnate?<br><br>Ken Wilber: Oh, I see youÂ’re starting with the easy questions. Well, IÂ’ll give you a few theoretical answers that have been offered over the years, and then IÂ’ll give you my personal experience, such as it is.<br><br>I have actually asked this same question of several spiritual teachers, and one of them gave a quick, classic answer: Â“ItÂ’s no fun having dinner alone.Â”<br><br>ThatÂ’s sort of flip or flippant, I suppose, but the more you think about it, the more it starts to make sense. What if, just for the fun of it, we pretend -- you and I blasphemously pretend, just for a moment -- that we are Spirit, that Tat Tvam Asi? Why would you, if you were God Almighty, why would you manifest a world? A world that, as you say, is necessarily one of separation and turmoil and pain? Why would you, as the One, ever give rise to the Many?<br><br>Pathways: ItÂ’s no fun having dinner alone?<br><br>Ken Wilber: DoesnÂ’t that start to make sense? Here you are, the One and Only, the Alone and the Infinite. What are you going to do next? You bathe in your own glory for all eternity, you bask in your own delight for ages upon ages, and then what? Sooner or later, you might decide that it would be fun -- just fun -- to pretend that you were not you. I mean, what else are you going to do? What else can you do?<br><br>Pathways: Manifest a world.<br><br>Ken Wilber: DonÂ’t you think? But then it starts to get interesting. When I was a child, I used to try to play checkers with myself. You ever tried that?<br><br>Pathways: Yes, I remember doing something like that.<br><br>Ken Wilber: Does it work?<br><br>Pathways: Not exactly, because I always knew what my Â“opponentÂ’sÂ” move was going to be. I was playing both sides, so I couldnÂ’t Â“surpriseÂ” myself. I always knew what I was going to do on both sides, so it wasnÂ’t much of a game. You need somebody Â“elseÂ” to play the game.<br><br>Ken Wilber: Yes, exactly, thatÂ’s the problem. You need an Â“other.Â” So if you are the only Being in all existence, and you want to play -- you want to play any sort of game -- you have to take the role of the other, and then forget that you are playing both sides. Otherwise the game is no fun, as you say. You have to pretend you are the other player with such conviction that you forget that you are playing all the roles. If you donÂ’t forget, then you got no game, itÂ’s just no fun.<br><br>Pathways: So if you want to play -- I think the Eastern term is lila -- then you have to forget who you are. Amnesis.<br><br>Ken Wilber: Yes, I think so. And that is exactly the core of the answer given by the mystics the world over. If you are the One, and -- out of sheer exuberance, plenitude, superabundance -- you want to play, to rejoice, to have fun, then you must first, manifest the Many, and then second, forget it is you who are the Many. Otherwise, no game. Manifestation, incarnation, is the great Game of the One playing at being the Many, for the sheer sport and fun of it.<br><br>Pathways: But itÂ’s not always fun.<br><br>Ken Wilber: Well, yes and no. The manifest world is a world of opposites -- of pleasure versus pain, up versus down, good versus evil, subject versus object, light versus shadow. But if you are going to play the great cosmic Game, that is what you yourself set into motion. How else can you do it? If there are no parts and no players and no suffering and no Many, then you simply remain as the One and Only, Alone and Aloof. But itÂ’s no fun having dinner alone.<br><br>Pathways: So to start the game of manifestation is start the world of suffering.<br><br>Ken Wilber: It starts to look like that, doesnÂ’t it? And the mystics seem to agree. But there is a way out of that suffering, a way to be free of the opposites, and that involves the overwhelming and direct realization that Spirit is not good versus evil, or pleasure versus pain, or light versus dark, or life versus death, or whole versus part, or holistic versus analytic. Spirit is the great Player that gives rise to all those opposites equally -- Â“I the Lord make the Light to fall on the good and the bad alike; I the Lord do all these thingsÂ” -- and the mystics the world over agree. Spirit is not the good half of the opposites, but the ground of all the opposites, and our Â“salvation,Â” as it were, is not to find the good half of the dualism but to find the Source of both halves of the dualism, for that is what we are in truth. We are both sides in the great Game of Life, because we -- you and I, in the deepest recesses of our very Self -- have created both of these opposites in order to have a grand game of cosmic checkers.<br><br>That, anyway, is the Â“theoreticalÂ” answer that the mystics almost always give. Â“NondualityÂ” means, as the Upanishads put it, Â“to be freed of the pairs.Â” That is, the great liberation consists in being freed of the pairs of opposites, freed of duality -- and finding instead the nondual One Taste that gives rise to both. This is liberation because we cease the impossible, painful dream of spending our entire lives trying to find an up without a down, an inside without an outside, a good without an evil, a pleasure without its inevitable pain.<br><br>Pathways: You said that you had a more personal response as well.<br><br>Ken Wilber: Yes, such as it is. When I first experienced, however haltingly, Â“nirvikalpa samadhiÂ” -- which means, meditative absorption in the formless One -- I remember having the vague feeling -- very subtle, very faint -- that I didnÂ’t want to be alone in this wonderful expanse. I remember feeling, very diffusely but very insistently, that I wanted to share this with somebody. So what would one do in that state of loneliness?<br><br>Pathways: Manifest the world.<br><br>Ken Wilber: ThatÂ’s how it seems to me. And I knew, however amateurishly, that if I came out of that formless Oneness and recognized the world of the Many, that I would then suffer, because the Many always hurt each other, as well as help each other. And you know what? I was glad to surrender the peace of the One even though it meant the pain of the Many. Now this is just a little tongue taste of what the great mystics have seen, but my limited experience seems to conform to their great pronouncement: You are the One freely giving rise to the Many -- to pain and pleasure and all the opposites -- because you choose not to abide as the exquisite loneliness of Infinity, and because you donÂ’t want to have dinner alone.<br><br>Pathways: And the pain that is involved?<br><br>Ken Wilber: Is freely chosen as part of the necessary Game of Life. You cannot have a manifest world without all the opposites of pleasure and pain. And to get rid of the pain -- the sin, the suffering, the duhkha -- you must remember who and what you really are. This remembrance, this recollection, this anamnesis -- Â“Do this in Remembrance of MeÂ” -- means, Â“Do this in Remembrance of the Self that You AreÂ” -- Tat Tvam Asi. The great mystical religions the world over consist of a series of profound practices to quiet the small self that we pretend we are -- which causes the pain and suffering that you feel -- and awaken as the Great Self that is our own true ground and goal and destiny -- Â“Let this consciousness be in you which was in Christ Jesus.Â”</blockquote></div>

ItÂ’s often a series of glimpses of One Taste -- glimpses of the fact that you are one with absolutely all manifestation, in its good and bad aspects, in all its frost and fever, its wonder and its pain. You are the Kosmos, literally. But you tend to understand this ultimate fact in increasing glimpses of the infinity that you are, and you realize exactly why you started this wonderful, horrible Game of Life. But it is absolutely not a cruel Game, not ultimately, because you, and you alone, instigated this Drama, this Lila, this Kenosis.<br><br>Pathways: But what about the notion that these experiences of Â“One TasteÂ” or Â“Kosmic ConsciousnessÂ” are just a by-product of meditation, and therefore arenÂ’t Â“really realÂ”?<br><br>Ken Wilber: Well, that can be said of any type of knowledge that depends on an instrument. Â“Kosmic consciousnessÂ” often depends on the instrument of meditation. So what? Seeing the nucleus of a cell depends on a microscope. Do we then say that the cell nucleus isnÂ’t real because itÂ’s only a by-product of a microscope? Do we say the moons of Jupiter arenÂ’t real because they depend on a telescope? The people who raise this objection are almost always people who donÂ’t want to look through the instrument of meditation, just as the Churchmen refused to look through GalileoÂ’s telescope and thus acknowledge the moons of Jupiter. Let them live with their refusal. But let us -- to the best of our ability, and hopefully driven by the best of charity or compassion -- try to convince them to look, just once, and see for themselves. Not coerce them, just invite them.

Â“I donÂ’t know what the words mean.Â”<br><br>Â“Why should you?Â” said Mr. Propter.
