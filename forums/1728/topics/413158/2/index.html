              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: CG Times;">This is extracted from Pureland of the Patriachs - Master Han Shan....<br><br><strong>T</strong>he Dharma of Buddha Recitation is for the purpose of achieving rebirth in the Pure Land, thus ending the cycle of Birth and Death. This is a most crucial matter. Therefore, sentient beings are urged to practice Buddha Recitation. Unfortunately, people today understand only that Buddha Recitation can lead to the end of Birth and Death, without understanding where the root of Birth and Death lies. How should you practice Buddha Recitation so as to end the cycle of Birth and Death? If you do not sever the root of Birth and Death, how can you expect to end that cycle? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;">What is the root of Birth and Death? An ancient master has said: </span></p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: CG Times;">If your evil karma were not heavy, you would not have been born in the Saha world. If love-<a href="/forums/1728/topics/hanglo.htm#attachment"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">attachment</span></span></a> is not severed, you cannot be reborn in the Pure Land. </span></blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;"><strong>Therefore, we know that love-attachment is the root of Birth and Death.</strong> All sentient beings are subject to the suffering of Birth and Death because of the affliction of love-attachment. The root of this attachment does not come from this life alone, nor indeed from one, two, three or four previous lives. Rather it stems from time without beginning, birth after birth, death after death. Abandoning one life only to reappear in another life, we are always swayed by love-attachment, up to our present lifetime. Thinking back, when did you have a single thought not tied to this root of love-attachment? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;">The seeds of this love-attachment have accumulated over long eons and are planted very deep. Therefore, birth after birth, death after death, the cycle never stops. <strong>For now, you should direct your mind to Buddha Recitation, seeking only to be reborn in the Pure Land. If one part of your mind is geared to Buddha Recitation while the other is tied to Birth and Death, even if you continue this recitation until the final moment, you will only see that you are still rooted in love-attachment, still in the cycle of Birth and Death. At that time, you will realize that such Buddha Recitation is useless.</strong> You may then complain that Buddha Recitation does not bring results, but it will be too late for regrets. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;">I urge those who practice Buddha Recitation to understand first that love-attachment is the root of Birth and Death. <strong>Buddha Recitation requires that you sever love-attachment in thought after thought.</strong> During recitation at home, when you see your son or daughter or grandchildren, or your material possessions, you are attached to all of them. Thus, <strong>everything and every thought is a recipe for Birth and Death.</strong> You may recite the Buddha's name, but if the root of love-attachment is in your mind and you never lose this for one moment, you need not wonder why you cannot concentrate on it!<sup><a href="/forums/1728/topics/hannote.htm#N_11_"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"> (11)</span></span></a></sup></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;">When the mind is filled with attachments, Buddha Recitation remains superficial. One part of the mind is practicing Buddha Recitation while the other is increasingly filled with love-attachment. If thoughts of children and grandchildren are in the forefront of your mind, the mind trying to recite the Buddha's name cannot resist the mind of love, and thus you cannot sever love-attachment. This being so, how can you expect to put an end to the cycle of Birth and Death? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;"><strong>Because this condition of attachment stems from many previous lifetimes, for fruitful Buddha Recitation, just start in the present, even though you may not be wholly familiar with the method nor have a fully sincere mind.</strong> If you have no power and no control over yourself now, you will have no control during the final moments of your life either. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: CG Times;">Therefore, I would like to urge all of you: if you really want to recite the Buddha's name and put an end to Birth and Death,<sup><a href="/forums/1728/topics/hannote.htm#N_12_"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"> 12)</span></span></a></sup> <strong>cut off the root of Birth and Death in thought after thought.</strong> Then, Birth and Death will end in thought after thought. It is not advisable to wait till the end of your life to do this. I urge you to do your best. Bear in mind that everything is Birth and Death. To end the cycle of Birth and Death in your current lifetime, <strong>concentrate on reciting the Buddha's name in thought after thought.</strong> If you practice like this every moment and still do not end the cycle of Birth and Death, then all the Buddhas would be lying. So whether you are a monk or a layman, just keep Birth and Death at the forefront of your mind. This is the method for ending Birth and Death and there is no more wonderful method than this. </span></p>

              Non duality is a great wisdom through seeing the nature of things through a focus of the mind. One pointedness toward a single focus and concentration is simply a way or method to many who have difficulty in renoucing attachment. Utimately yes even dharma have to let go.

              <p>Hi Fugazzi,</p>
              <p>What you have described is the 'I AM' level experience.</p>
              <p>Buddhism goes further than this to no-self, non-duality and emptiness. In the non-duality stage of realisation and experience, the watcher is not beyond or behind the mind/thoughts etc. At the non-dual level realisation, inner and outer is seen as an illusion. The perception of the 'watcher' beyond is a subtle false impression.</p>
              <p>To experience non-duality, a more thorough letting go is required. Basically, there are many layers of graspings/desiring that are invisible/unconscious.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Yes not easy at the very beginning, but with practice it will weaken and weaken more and more, until it falls off.</p>
              <p>We are not really attached to the people or things we think we are. It's more like we are attached to our mental projections and thoughts - thoughts and memories of the past, thoughts and daydreams of how these things can become.<br><br>If we merely, see them as they are - with no memories and thoughts of the past with these, they will just be like any other person.<br><br>If you practice Pureland, instead of following these thoughts when they come up and re-experiencing the happy feelings etc., immediately transform the thought into the Buddha's name. Try to keep the Buddha's name in mind at all times, then the thoughts will have no room to make trouble for you.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>3. The Krishnamurti Connection With Buddhism</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In many ways Krishnamurti's message is similar to the one that Buddhism teaches. Both point to the ease and susceptibility of the human mind to succumb to conditioning as the origin of all our human problems. Both doctrines, therefore, prescribe the use of an intense awareness of all of our mental processes, thoughts, memories, beliefs, hopes, and fears in order to gain that state of enlightenment which Krishnamurti calls insight or complete and unconditional freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On the surface there appears to be conflict between Krishnamurti and Buddhism on some points. To Krishnamurti the process of enlightenment takes place instantaneously, like a sudden awakening. To most Buddhists enlightenment would take place only after years of painstaking meditative practice and countless rituals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the preceding we examined the nature of human psychological time. Time is measured by humans usually through a process of increase or decrease. We sense that time is passing because we are growing older or earning more money or waiting to be promoted to a higher rank. More precisely, psychological time is our perception of the process of increase or decrease and nothing more. Without that perception there would be no sense of passage of time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When we talk of working and meditating over a period of years to achieve enlightenment it is the same as saying, "I will create the passage of time by undergoing a process of 'increase' from a lower to a higher spiritual level". By taking this approach we will have avoided taking the discontinuous leap into enlightenment, and instead we will have created our own delay in achieving enlightenment. As we mentioned earlier, the human ego is involved with this process. In fact, one could say that the human ego is this process, i.e. perception (increase/decrease) = psychological time = ego.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It stands to reason that any Buddhist authority who urges others to work real hard over a long period of time in order to achieve enlightenment is selling an ego package. Yet, we sometimes hear such advice coming from Buddhists. Krishnamurti's view of enlightenment is not that of a gradual one which increases slowly over years of hard work, because that sort of ego-related process creates its own delay and thus insures that the end is never attained. In Krishnamurti's view enlightenment comes by its own accord where and when it chooses, and there is little that we can do about it. It comes to us at auspicious times like a major discontinuity in our lives, and it reminds us of some Buddhist accounts of awakening which were induced by an unexpected slap to the face or a blow to the body. Ego involvement in enlightenment (or meditation for that matter) is no more than an interference which will negate the process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is the author's opinion that Krishnamurti's views provide us with more insight into The Sutra of the Heart of Transcendent Knowledge than most explanations available from the Buddhist world. In the Sutra, Avalokitesvara states that there is no birth and no cessation, ... no decrease and no increase, ... It is the exact same process which Krishnamurti dwells upon in volume after volume of his works. Enlightenment is a state that is timeless which means that its chief attribute is one of no-time, meaning no involvement with ego or ego-created time. Once an acknowledgment is made by the ego that time is required to attain enlightenment, the search has gone off on a hopeless tangent and will end in failure. The ego has to surrender its jurisdiction in the matter of enlightenment and allow something which is infinite and unknowable to take its course.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To Krishnamurti any process of thought is unsacred. Thoughts of the dharma or Buddha are as unsacred as any other type of thought. The only thing remaining sacred in Krishnamurti's view is that which thought is incapable of capturing or the unknowable. All thoughts are mere human creations of the human brain stem and are forever incapable of capturing that which is infinite and unknowable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At first it seems that most Buddhists would agree with the foregoing paragraph. But there is plenty of Buddhist literature available which encourages Buddhists to meditate upon sacred images or thoughts or The Eight-Fold path or some mandala or mantra. It is self-evident that a state of complete emptiness is impossible as long as any images whatsoever persist in the mind. The Sutra says that emptiness is form and all form is emptiness, yet many Buddhist leaders keep on encouraging others to fill this vast, wonderful emptiness with a product of the human nervous system as if that product is sacred enough to occupy space as long as it has received the authorized stamp of approval from a duly appointed Buddhist authority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some Buddhist groups conduct prayer meetings. Prayer is an obvious exercise of the ego, a deliberate, calculating way to gain an increase over a period of time. There are some who feel that more prayer results in more gain. It is another attempt to attain something despite the fact that there is no attainment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>4. No Path, No Progress, No Goal</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"...the bodhisatvas have no attainment, they abide by means of prajnaparamita."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To Krishnamurti there is no "path", no procedures, no organization, and no rules that should be laid down by men for other men to follow on the road to enlightenment. As part of the path, Buddhists must observe a very typical, man-made, structure which begins at the top with The Three Precious Ones: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Each of these pillars has subsets of rules associated with it: The Five Skandhas, The Eight Siddhis, etc. Some would have us believe that learning all these articles of faith are necessary for enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Much Buddhist literature suggests that in following Buddhism there is a great object that one must attain and that one progresses towards this goal as one takes each step along the path. To Krishnamurti setting a psychological goal and working for progress in any direction will only lead to more confusion and suffering. Any attempts at psychological self-betterment will amount to no more than just one more futile duplication of many similar past efforts, all of which had previously failed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The typical pattern of human behavior that we always seem to fall into, perhaps by virtue of conditioning, is the "work for a reward" stereotype. One finds a religion and sees something desirable in it which becomes an object of attainment. The next step is to devise a plan to acquire the object, and finally, with great deliberation we set about to carry out that plan with hard, unrelenting work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Krishnamurti tells us that the "work for a reward" operandi has been tried countless times by homo sapiens, but it has never led us to anything new or different in the area of spiritual enlightenment. What do we make of all this? Buddhist leaders round the world tell us that there are Buddhist goals and a path of hard work and attainment for reaching these goals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Here again Krishnamurti seems to be more in agreement with the very core of Buddhist teachings than the Buddhists themselves. The Sutra of the Heart of Transcendent Knowledge sounds more like Krishnamurti than does many of the Buddhist teachers: "There is ... no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no nonattainment ..." Here Krishnamurti is telling us to live up to the precepts of this great Buddhist Sutra. He is not telling us to follow a path, but to under stand that there is no path. He tells this just as bluntly and simply as the Sutra does. There is no apparent sympathy or embellishments for the benefit of those who either fail to understand or for those who have beliefs in goals to which they must continue to cling.</span></p>

              <p>example if on the table there are gold and brass to choose, people who know the value will take the gold. knowing the value of Pureland and Amitabha is like knowing that gold is more valuable than brass. is u know then letting go is as easy as just taking the gold.</p>
