              <p><br>yes, that mean the person practicing Pureland while reciting the Buddha's name, "at the time of departure", will not be brain dead (or end of breath) first before Amitabha come and fetch him/her. It is AFTER Amitabha come and fetch him/her to pureland, THEN the left over body are pronounce brain dead.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the mind of these people are very clear when it's time to depart, no illness (if practice good) and they know the timing and they will start to prepare before hand.

              <p><br>keep it up...say easy also not easy...say difficult also not difficult. When Patriarch Shan Tao was around, he said 10000 practice, 10000 can go to pureland. it's that easy. but nowaday, old Master Chin Kung's teacher Li Bi-nan's school in taiwan said that only 3-4 out of 10000 were up to standard. He said that it's Not difficult to practice, it's because they(we) didn't practice properly.</p>
              <p>Patriarch Shan Tao say to go to pureland, it's not so important how many time u recite the name, more important is whether u have sincere <strong>Faith and Aspiration</strong> or not.</p>

              <p>ya. want the Right thing. for pureland school, the three main factor is faith, aspiration and practice(nienfo).</p>
              <p>keep telling oneself that i must reborn in pureland. vow to be reborn there. keep telling oneself that Amitabha and western pureland is real. time to time, sincerely recite the Buddha's name. practice to do good now. we cannot wait until last minute then start to practice hard. as we might not know we might later on get Alzheimer è€�å¹´ç—´å‘†ç—‡, where the mind is confuse when dying. as these people even with supportive recitation also very difficult. The Amitabha Sutra said that one's mind must be unconfuse and without inversion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Shariputra, if a good man or woman hears 'Amitabha' spoken and holds that name, whether for one day, two days, three, four, five days, six days, as long as seven days, with one heart <strong>unconfused</strong> -- when this person approaches the end of life, before him will appear Amitabha and all the Assembly of Holy Ones. When the end comes, his heart will be <strong>without inversion</strong>; in Amitabha's Land of Ultimate Bliss, he will attain rebirth. ---Amitabha Sutra</em></p>

              <p>In case anyone may read this and misunderstand and think that the Pureland practice grasps at the external... there is a good section in the book "<a href="http://www.ymba.org/BWF/bwf0.htm">Buddhism of wisdom and faith</a>", which can clarify these doubts.</p>
              <p>Anyone who feels that they can't really believe in the "external" Pureland and Amitabha Buddha, or have been told this is a practice for grandfathers and grandmothers who are illiterate should read this book. It will help to establish the understanding of the principles of Pureland practice. Have bolded some of the important points in the passage below..<br></p>
              <p>
              </p><h4 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">47) Buddha Recitation -- Essence and Practice</h4>
              <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">There are two aspects to Buddha Recitation -- essence and practice. According to Elder Master Ou-I:</span><blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"Buddha Recitation-practice" means believing that there is a Western Pure Land and a Lord Buddha named Amitabha, but not yet realizing that "this Mind <em>makes </em>Buddha, this Mind is Buddha." It consists of resolutely seeking rebirth in the Pure Land and reciting as earnestly as a lost child longing for his mother, never forgetting her for a single moment.
              <p><a name="essence1"></a>"Buddha Recitation-essence," on the other hand, means believing and understanding that Lord Amitabha Buddha of the West inherently exists in full within our mind, is created by our mind, and making this sacred name -- inherently existing in full within our mind and created by our mind -- the focus of our recitation, without a moment of neglect."</p>
              </blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In other words, "Buddha Recitation-practice" is the method of those who do not understand anything about meaning or essence, who just believe that there is a Land of Ultimate Bliss and a Buddha named Amitabha, and who fervently and earnestly recite the Buddha's name seeking rebirth there.</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">"Buddha Recitation-essence" is the method of those who practice in an identical manner, but who also deeply realize that the Pure Land and Lord Amitabha Buddha are all in the True Mind, manifested by the pure virtues of the True Mind.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">This being so, is there a difference between Buddha Recitation-practice and Buddha Recitation-essence? Of course there is. Those who follow Buddha Recitation-practice see Amitabha Buddha as <em>outside the Mind; </em>therefore, opposing marks of subject-object still exist. Thus, such practice is not yet all-encompassing and complete. Those who practice Buddha Recitation-essence thoroughly understand the True Mind and therefore sever all marks of subject-object -- to recite is Buddha, to recite is Mind, reconciling Mind and Realm.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Let me relate an anecdote. One night, a Master who is a friend of this author dreamed that a yellow-robed monk came to ask him, "You practice Buddha Recitation, but what is Buddha?" <em>Answer </em>"Buddha is Mind." The monk continued, "How about explaining to me what you mean by Buddha is Mind?" In his dream, the author's friend improvised the following stanzas:</p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Each utterance of the Buddha's name following the rosary is Mind, <br>Buddha is clearly Mind, why waste time searching for Him? <br>The Buddha's sea of wisdom reconciles Mind and Realm! <br>Mind and Buddha are born equal.
              <p><strong>To abandon Mind and follow the Buddha is to be still in a dream, <br>To be attached to the Buddha as Mind is not yet perfect comprehension;</strong> <br>Mind and Buddha are both originally illusory and dreamlike, <br>To transcend both Buddha and Mind is to arrive at the perfect City of Lights.</p>
              </blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The Master understood the essence of Buddha Recitation, reconciling the Buddha's name with the realm of the Mind.</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="essence2"></a><a name="existence"></a>There is one e<strong>rroneous idea, prevalent among those who lean toward the subtle and the mysterious, which requires clarification. Many of them, emphasizing theory over practice, tend to be attached to the concept of "Amitabha as the Self-Nature, Pure Land as Mind-Only," and reject the existence of the Western Pure Land or rebirth there.</strong> These individuals explain the sutra teachings on Pure Land from the viewpoint of principle or essence, saying "Amitabha is our Buddha Nature, the Pure Land is the pure realm of the Mind, why seek it on the outside?" <strong>This is the great mistake of those who emphasize mundane, conventional reasoning.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">They cling to theory (essence) while neglecting practice, prefer essence to marks, and rely on Ultimate Truth to reject the manifestations of mundane truth -- <strong>failing to realize that the two are inseparable.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="AwakeningofFaith"></a>According to the <em>Treatise on the Awakening of the Faith, </em>the True Mind has two aspects: essence and marks. The aspect of essence is called the Door of True Thusness, the aspect of marks is the Door of Birth and Death. True Thusness is inseparable from Birth and Death; Birth and Death <em>are</em>True Thusness. This is why the Patriarch Asvaghosha called True Thusness the "truth-like Emptiness treasury" and Birth and Death the "truth-like Non-Emptiness treasury." True Thusness and Birth and death have the same truth-like nature.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Take the great ocean as an example. We cannot accept sea water but not waves. If we were to do so, we would be wrong about the manifestations of the ocean and fail to understand truly what the ocean is. Therefore, when we abandon phenomena, noumenon cannot stand by itself; when we reject marks, essence cannot remain stable.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="ksitigarbha"></a>A great many individuals, educated in mundane ways, become afflicted with the disease of grasping at the "Truth of Emptiness" when they study Mahayana sutras, particularly those that expound the Prajna Paramita truth, which they do not fully understand. Thus, they explain sutras which elucidate phenomena and marks, such as the Pure Land Sutras or the <em>Ksitigarbha (Earth Store Bodhisattva) Sutra, </em>from the viewpoint of noumenon and principle. <strong>They mistake these "marks" sutras as expedients to guide those of limited capacities. However, in truth, they are the mistaken ones!</strong> In this connection, I will quote a few passages from the sutras, to destroy this attachment to Emptiness.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="HeartSutra"></a>As stated in the <em>Heart Sutra:</em></p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">There is no wisdom, and there is no attainment whatsoever. Because there is nothing to be attained, a Bodhisattva relying on Prajnaparamita has no obstruction in his mind. Because there is no obstruction he has no fear, and he passes far beyond all confused imaginations and reaches ultimate Nirvana. The Buddhas in the past, present and future, also, by relying on the Prajnaparamita, "have" attained Supreme Enlightenment. (Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada, <em>The Buddhist Liturgy </em>p. 47)</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">At first, Buddha Sakyamuni, in accord with Ultimate Truth, said "there is no attainment whatsoever." Then, in accord with conventional truth, He said "the Buddhas in the past, present and future have attained Supreme Enlightenment." Seeing "attainment" is attachment to existence. Seeing "non-attainment" is to err in the direction of attachment to emptiness. Therefore, cultivators should thoroughly understand the deep meaning behind the sutras and enter the Middle Way.</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="DiamondSutra1"></a>In the <em>Diamond Sutra, </em>Sakyamuni Buddha stated:</p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Who sees Me by form, <br>Who seeks Me in sound, <br>Perverted are his footsteps upon the Way; <br>For he cannot perceive the Tathagata. <br>(A. F. Price, tr. "The Diamond Sutra," p. 65. In <em>The Diamond Sutra &amp; The Sutra of Hui Neng.)</em></blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">However, the Lord Buddha then continued:</span><blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="DiamondSutra2"></a>
              <p>Subhuti, do not think the opposite either that when the Tathagata attained Supreme Enlightenment it was not by means of his possession of the thirty-two marks of physical excellence. Do not think that. Should you think that, then when you begin the practice of seeking to attain supreme enlightenment you would think that all systems of phenomena and all conceptions about phenomena are to be cut off and rejected [thus falling into nihilism]. Do not think that. And why? Because when a disciple practices seeking to attain supreme enlightenment, he should neither grasp after such arbitrary conceptions of phenomena nor reject them. (Wai-tao, tr., "The Diamond Sutra," in Goddard, ea.,<em>A Buddhist Bible</em>, p. 103-4.)</p>
              </blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">First, Buddha Sakyamuni taught that we should not follow sounds, forms and marks in seeking the Way. After that, he reminded us that at the same time, we should not abandon sounds, forms and marks, nor should we destroy all dharmas. Thus, we can see that the Way belongs neither to "forms" nor to "emptiness." Clinging to either aspect is misguided. A famous </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="Zen"></a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Zen monk once said:</span><blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Thirty years ago, when this old monk had not yet entered the Order, he perceived rivers as rivers and mountains as mountains. After meeting good spiritual advisors who taught him how to cultivate, he saw rivers as not-rivers and mountains as not-mountains. Now that he has seen the Way and reached the state of still emptiness, he realizes that rivers have always been rivers and mountains have always been mountains.</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="SuTungPo"></a></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">A Zen poet, Su Tung P'o, expressed the same idea:</span><blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The sound of the stream is the Buddhas' vast long tongue, <br>The shape of the mountain is intrinsically the pure Dharma body.</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The meaning of the poem is that forms, marks and sounds are intrinsically the Great Way. We should understand them with a non-discriminating mind, neither clinging to them nor rejecting them to seek Enlightenment in the realm of hollow emptiness [which is contrary to True Emptiness]. <strong>Therefore, the phrase, "Self-Nature Amitabha, Mind-Only Pure Land" is not a denial of the Pure Land or Amitabha Buddha, but is rather an expression that gathers marks toward essence, brings "function" toward nature, to manifest the ultimate truth of the Void.</strong> In this ultimate truth, even Buddhas do not exist, let alone other dharmas.</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The ancients have said:</p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Although theory can be understood in a flash, practice should be carried out step by step.</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Even in Zen, which is said to be a "direct method," as long as we have to sit in meditation, or gather our mind, or meditate on a koan or enter and exit samadhi, we are still within the sphere of expedients. Moreover, in the metaphysical realm, there are many levels of attainment. Not until we have reached the stage of non-cultivation can we dispense with expedients and really proclaim that all dharmas are empty.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><em>If we have not reached that stage</em></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">, even a small thing like a mote of dust is real; we still feel warm near a fire or cold in the midst of frost and we still feel pain when a small thorn pricks our body -- how, then, can we say that all dharmas are non-existent and void?</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="selfnature"></a>Therefore, those who like to advance lofty and wonderful propositions, such as "Amitabha is the Self-Nature, the Pure Land is Mind Only," and go on to reject the actual practice of Buddha Recitation will find themselves in the predicament of "destroying the boat before stepping ashore." There is no way such persons can avoid drowning. On the contrary, since ancient times, those who have thoroughly understood essence have always paid particular attention to practice -- because practice symbolizes essence.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The ancients have said:</p>
              <blockquote style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>Only those endowed with wisdom can reconcile the essence and marks of Buddha Recitation and truly understand it in an exhaustive manner. Otherwise, we had better grasp at marks in our cultivation; the more we do so, the more effective our practice will be.</strong></blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>This is because the more we cling to forms, the more earnest is our determination to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. Once reborn there, we will surely be awakened to the True Mark.</strong> The subject of phenomena and noumenon, essence and marks can be discussed</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><em>ad infinitum </em></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">. However, if we can understand it, we understand everything. I sincerely hope that fellow cultivators will skillfully reflect on this question to avoid being misled while treading the Way.</span>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">When the author had reached this point in the manuscript, a visiting lay Buddhist asked, "I have heard a number of fairly accomplished Zen Masters say, 'The intelligent should just concentrate their minds and have pure thoughts, without wasting their time and effort to follow the illusion of Buddha Recitation. Let us leave the vehicle empty so that it can run light, not weigh it down with excess baggage!' I have heard such reasoning but do not know how to reply. I wish you could elucidate the matter."</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><a name="IndexSamadhi"></a><em>Answer: </em>The aim of Zen is True Thusness Samadhi. The goal of Pure Land is the Buddha Recitation Samadhi. True Thusness Samadhi is like gold bullion, while Buddha Recitation Samadhi is similar to gold necklaces, bracelets, and other pieces of jewelry. All contain the basic metal gold. Therefore, when we have attained Buddha Recitation Samadhi, we have attained True Thusness Samadhi as well. True Thusness Samadhi centers on wisdom; Buddha Recitation Samadhi encompasses not only wisdom but merit and virtue as well. This is because the Pure Land practitioner not only bases himself on pure one-pointedness of mind, he receives the virtues derived from reciting the Buddha's name in addition. However, neither True Thusness Samadhi nor Buddha Recitation Samadhi can be attained in one lifetime; they are the results of many eons of continuous practice. This is particularly true in this Dharma-Ending Age.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Thus, <strong>while Buddha Recitation Samadhi is the aim of the Pure Land method, it is not the primary one. The principal and essential goal is to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land within one lifetime so as to reach the stage of non-retrogression. </strong><em><strong>This is what sets Pure Land apart from other schools and gives it its name.</strong></em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>This is precisely why many Zen Masters, having awakened to the Way but realizing that Supreme Enlightenment is still far away, change direction and adopt Buddha Recitation seeking rebirth in the Pure Land.</strong> Although painstaking, reciting the Buddha's name and bowing to images of the Buddhas bring additional merits and virtues, a result of the cultivation of the two karmas of body and speech.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Take the example of a truck returning to the capital from the mountain town of Dalat. If, after discharging its cargo, the truck returns empty, it will, of course, be lighter. However, if it can load up with vegetables and other produce, the truck will not only be back in the capital, its owners will, in addition, have a cargo of produce. Earning additional merits and blessings through the diligent and painstaking efforts of Buddha Recitation is a natural cause and effect occurrence -- where is the loss? However, any hardship, if it does occur, will only be felt in the beginning stages of Buddha Recitation. When recitation has become second nature, reaching the level of No-Mind, all hardship will have vanished!</p>

              <p>Hi likeyou,</p>
              <p>In ancient days till todays, many citizens with difficulty in their country travelled to other more promising country to seek better livelihood. Thereafter, they would bring along their family members after securing a good and stable live there. As such, if you do not want to be born in pureland, you are not able to evoke your nature ability to patiently await their "yuan" or opportune period to be liberated, in which, they direly need to rely on your help to secure an eternal life in the fastest possible time. They may suffer many lives and eons of deluded afflictions and pain, unneccessarily. The choice is still yours :)</p>

              <p>Ermm........... if you believe in reincarnation, you will know that you had and will have many children, wives or husbands and parents in your past life and future life if you did not liberate yourself from reincarnation. Thus, no point attaching to them. You can advise them to practice Pureland so they will be with you in Pureland.</p>

              <p>Amituofo,</p>
              <p>to me, the greatest filial piety and compassion/love is for one to be born there in pureland and then return back to liberate your love ones to pureland, no matter where they are. of cos, if they can go now will be better. :)</p>
              <p>that say if u can get 2 people there, then u will be assure that they(as Bodhisattvas) will come and help u later on. :)</p>

              <p><br>For those loved ones who are non believers, I pray to Buddha that they will å¼€æ™ºæ…§, if not in this life, hope that it will be in their next life, so that they can è‡ªåº¦. What I can do is to dedicate merits to them after chanting, shifu says it helps.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I will "trick" them to chant Amitabha at least once in their lifetime as shifu says this is planting seed in them. When the seed will grow, it depends very much on themselves. If not in this life, may be it will grow in their next life. </p>

              If they cannot go or don't believe right now, it doesn't matter. What matter's most is you have to get on the boat yourself 1st. Once you are up on the boat and not drowning, then you can help them onto the boat, so don't worry that they will be stuck here.
              
              Whoever comes to you when you die, do not follow, not your dearest ones, not even heavenly beings. Only follow Amitabha Buddha.
              
              Have to slowly eradicate the love and attachments for love ones, otherwise when death comes, these thoughts of love and attachments will be countering your recitation of the Buddha's name and will drag you back preventing you from being reborn in Pureland.
              
              I attended ven Jing Jie's talk last time and he told us a story about this rich man, who use money to build a place for people to nianfo and practice. He himself also practice with them. When he was dying, ppl come and help him by doing help-chanting. When he heard these chanting and chanted along, his complexion got better and better. Then his younger wife came and saw him dying and started to cry and such. His face start to changed, and he looked worse and worse, until he died and did not reborn in PL. His son or dunno who, dreamt of him telling them he has been reborn as a dog somewhere. And they went to collect the dog.
              
              The story is roughly like this, but basically, it shows that the thoughts and emotion of love and attachment are very dangerous and can hinder our rebirth. It important that the faith, vows and practice to go to PL be stonger than these thoughts so as not to be affected by them.
