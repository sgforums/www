              <p>Different levels of devas have different looks. Some are very beautiful and majestic. I can't remember what are their description. My local dharma teacher saw one that was very tall and the suit looks a bit warrior like. My Taiwanese teacher had visited heaven twice (he also visited hell) and saw amazing palaces made entirely of jewels, and even went there with one other person. Oh and my Taiwanese dharma teacher met the Maras from the 6th heaven. I wrote this before:</p>
              <p><em>The maras  stories are true and my teachers and Master have actually really encountered them in their experience. For my Taiwanese teacher, right before his liberation, a very very beautiful woman beyond anything one has ever seen appeared right in front of his eyes, covered with silk like semi transparent clothes, and was trying to seduce my teacher. He recognised it was Mara (or mara's daughters) and remained unmoved and even verbally reprimanded Mara. Right after that, Mara disappeared, along with where he is sitting on, and the whole room, and the whole universe... just disappeared. Nirvana is attained.<br><br>In another occasion, my Master (same as my Taiwanese teacher's master) looked as if he was very very sickly and looked like he was dying in the airplane. After the journey my Master explained he was having a battle with the maras who are preventing him from spreading the dharma in South East Asia and Singapore as they knew there are much favourable conditions in the region.<br></em></p>
