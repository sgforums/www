              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Katy Butler SUMMER 2005
              tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Every
              Wednesday morning when I can afford the time, I park at the foot of the valley
              I live in and climb Mount Tamalpais, my holy mountain. It is more sacred to me
              than any temple, and as powerful a place of practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              path is as ritualized as the stations of the cross. I take a wooden footbridge
              over a stream and climb through second-growth redwoods and past blackberry
              bushes, now sere and brown in the winter cold. My worries come with me: I chew
              on a conflict with my eighty-year-old mother, a disastrous visit home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              climb steep railroad-tie steps to Cowboy Rock. My glutes and lungs burn,
              driving me into my body. I pant. I sweat. I take off my fisherman’s knit
              sweater, machine-loomed in England and bought at a local mall. Then up past the
              county water-tank and the dozen expensive houses built where the Flying Y Ranch
              used to be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At
              ten o’clock, I breach a ridge and enter a vast bowl of unpopulated hills. Car
              sounds die away. Finches twitter in the chaparral. I follow the trail beneath a
              bay laurel, upswept by the winds into a clinging topiary. A madrone shows its
              red bones. “Mountains,” the Zen master Eihei Dogen told an assembly of Japanese
              monks in 1240, “are our Buddha ancestors”—our primordial teachers. Inside my
              brain, an invisible hand turns the volume knob down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Now
              I am moving deep into the sock of the valley—the only visible human. Except for
              a ribbon of yellow-lined asphalt below me, there is no sign of human making.
              Beyond the last hills lies the Pacific.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">An
              hour later I round a ridge and the peak of the mountain reveals herself,
              rising. I remember Mirabai, the sixteenth-century devotional poet who abandoned
              her aristocratic family and wandered India, singing, “I worship the mountain
              energy night and day.” The trail switchbacks take me down deeper. An hour after
              noon, I stop at a flat, thick wooden bench in a grove of old-growth redwoods
              that the loggers left behind. Here I sit zazen, robed in silence and filtered
              brown light. The natural world restores my soul. It soothes me like a mother. I
              rest my head on it and lay my burdens down before it the way some Christians
              rest their heads on the cross.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">California
              is not my native home. I was raised in Oxford when England was recovering from
              the Second World War. The country had been a coal-burning industrial power for
              more than a century, but compared to the way Americans live today, we lived
              almost as frugally as Thoreau at Walden Pond.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eggs
              and butter and meat were rationed. Shoes were polished and repaired. A big
              black dray horse named Flower clopped down our street twice a week, pulling a
              cart from which my mother chose vegetables to cook with dinner. Our cramped
              brick row house had no central heating, and white furry mold grew up the walls
              of the cellar. People took buses or walked everywhere. Even after our family
              bought a car, my father was one of thousands who mounted bicycles and flooded
              the city at rush hour like swarming bees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              mother, who had no outside job, knitted sweaters and darned socks in the
              evenings before the fire. She had a washing machine but no dryer. Before she
              hung the laundry up to dry, she cranked it through the rollers of a mangle to
              squeeze the water out. Nobody called her “ecological” or understood that her
              daily work was an expression of respect for the natural world. But she was as
              frugal and attentive as the cook in a Zen monastery. One of her favorite
              phrases was “elbow grease.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              day when I was very young, she stopped the car on a road through a great beech
              woods. It was autumn. All the leaves were golden yellow. The branches of the
              beeches met high above our heads, making an arched and open cathedral. The very
              air was yellow with the glory of the trees.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              mother turned off the ignition and put the keys in her pocket.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“We
              are going to build a house for the fairies,” she said, and opened the door. We
              walked into the glowing woods. At a hollow place at the foot of a tree, my
              mother knelt down. She brushed away leaves and stuck forked twigs into the
              ground. She balanced sticks across the clefts, making roof-beams, a ridgepole,
              then rafters. I propped beech leaves against the sides and set them along the
              roof— they were broad-bladed, like flattened spears, and their points made a
              jagged line along the peak. We put moss in the front garden, and round white
              stones to lead the fairies to the door. My mother was an agnostic, a rebel, and
              a lover of modern architecture. She had nothing good to say about reverence.
              But that day she led me to something she could not give me and built something
              close to an altar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              parents were nominally Anglicans, and on Sundays, when I grew older, they sent
              my brothers and me to the church of St. Michael and All Angels. There, in the
              basement Sunday school, I glued images of martyred saints onto cardboard. I was
              told that God was everywhere and saw everything, and I imagined him as a series
              of transparent shower curtains embedded with multitudinous fish eyes, moving in
              every wind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At
              night, I’d kneel by my bed and beg for a sign of His reality. But God was
              silent—at least in the forms that I expected Him to speak – until Saturday,
              when I would ride my bike to green fields bordering a stream and lie face down
              in the mossy grass, letting the green energy rise up into me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There,
              I had an inkling of a wholeness beyond the logic of my family. I didn’t have to
              work for it. All I had to do was put myself in a position to receive. Green
              things continued to feed what I call my soul long after I abandoned hope of
              ever seeing the luminous fish eyes of God waving in the transparent wind. I
              worshiped holy water and holy dirt long before I called it prayer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              I was eight, my family moved to America and my parents built a Bauhaus-inspired
              four-bedroom house overlooking a lake in the suburbs of Boston. America amazed
              us: the supermarkets, with row on row of perfect, pesticide-kissed fruit; the
              oil furnaces in the basements of big houses, blasting hot air into every room;
              the ice cream parlors with their banana splits and three-scoop ice cream
              sundaes; the giant milk-fed children; the enormous superhighways and big
              cars—all summing up what my mother called America’s “higher standard of
              living.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              due course my father got a better job and a bigger house and our family
              acquired many little machines: a television, station wagon, lawnmower, second
              car, blender, coffee grinder, microwave, rice cooker, toaster oven, hairdryer,
              air conditioner. Friends of my parents moved into a new development where
              clotheslines were forbidden.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              didn’t think we were trying to satisfy endless craving. We didn’t see a
              connection between what we bought and the destruction of wild places we loved.
              We just wanted to be warm, safe, fed, and comfortable. We did not know that
              something in the human brain never hears or whispers “enough.” We were part of
              a liberal, affluent society that believed that “the greatest good for the
              greatest number” was mathematically translatable into “the greatest number of
              goods for the greatest number.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We
              knew nothing of Buddhism. We’d never heard of a then-obscure British economist
              named Ernest Friedrich Schumacher, who, in a 1966 essay called “Buddhist
              Economics,” suggested another path, especially for developing nations: the
              greatest possible human enjoyment from the smallest quantity of goods.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Buddhist ethos of right livelihood, E. F. Schumacher argued, could be extended
              to an ethos of right consumption. He argued against elaborately sewn,
              soon-to-be-outmoded suits and in favor of the loosely draped medieval robes of
              the monk—always in fashion! No ascetic, he argued for a middle way in material
              matters—in favor of enjoyment and against craving. Happiness, his work
              suggested, was not typified by the ice cream sundae wolfed down alone in front
              of the television, but by a cookie and a cup of green tea, brewed in awareness
              and sipped at leisure with friends, while watching the rising moon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              I was twenty-eight and working as a newspaper reporter in San Francisco, my
              roommate and I went on a camping trip in the Ventana wilderness inland from Big
              Sur. On a whim, we drove down a long dirt road to a hot springs resort deep in
              a knifelike canyon in the Santa Lucia mountains. The place turned out to be
              Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, and by chance I ran into an old San Francisco
              friend who had become a resident there. He arranged a cabin where we could
              spend the night, and the next morning before dawn he led me to the zendo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Two
              and a half hours later, I came out into an early morning light in a state of clarity
              I’d never before known. Something I had not known was still alive inside me had
              been listened to, and I had faith that it would someday find its voice. I spent
              the whole of the next summer there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              we walked up and down the canyon to clean cabins, chop vegetables, light
              kerosene lamps, and sit in the airy wooden zendo, we were soaked in the natural
              world. Crickets, streams, silence, and the rising force of the surrounding
              mountains permeated everything we did. I still wonder if Buddhism would have grabbed
              me the way it did if I’d first encountered it in a city.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              morning in the zendo I saw a lizard crawling along the shoulder of a man’s
              black robe. Another evening in the zendo, we prostrated ourselves over and over
              in the Full Moon Ceremony, and I climbed a hillside afterward in the
              astonishingly bright light of the full moon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              the library, I came across Dogen, who brought an invigorated form of Ch’an
              (Zen) from China to Japan in the thirteenth century. His work was dappled with
              natural images: the moon flooding the water with light; a water bird paddling
              and leaving no trace; a vegetable leaf transformed into the golden body of a
              Buddha; mountains flowing, mountains walking, mountains traveling on water.
              “The color of the mountains is Buddha’s body,” he wrote. “The sound of flowing
              water is his great speech.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Christian theology I’d been raised in had posited a hierarchical “great chain
              of being” with God on top, humans in the middle, and all other creatures and
              plants arrayed systematically below. Dogen suggested a radically democratic
              “flow of being” in which we humans could be instructed by the ten thousand
              interpenetrating and flowering things of the natural world. In Dogen’s view,
              each thing flowed without effort from form to form: from cloud to rain to
              stream to cloud and back again; from corpse to rot to compost to earth to
              flower. These were not metaphors for transience, reincarnation, no-self and
              interdependence, but manifestations of them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Walls
              and fences cannot instruct the grasses and trees to actualize spring,” Dogen
              wrote. “Yet they reveal the spiritual without intention, just by being what
              they are. So too with mountains, rivers, sun, moon, and stars.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When
              the summer was over, I drove back to the city and started meditating each
              morning in a basement zendo near the freeway. I spent hours each day meeting
              deadlines on a computer under fluorescent lights downtown. Something wordless
              that had risen up in me in nature—a yearning for beauty and an ecstatic
              gratitude for life—had helped pull me back into religious life and into a new
              religion. Now I lost touch with it again. I saw no connection between the awe
              I’d felt in the mountains surrounding Tassajara and the chanting and bowing I
              did in an urban Buddha hall each morning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Awe
              seemed out of place in my city practice and city life. A fellow student told me
              he saw Buddhism as a philosophy and a practice, not a religion. He couldn’t
              understand why we bowed at all. Like many of the people I knew who practiced
              within the Vipassana tradition, he wanted simply to count the breaths, sweep
              the body, examine the workings of the mind, and practice walking meditation.
              His strain of American Buddhism, growing within a secular, consumerist urban
              culture, seemed rationalized, almost denatured, spun clean in a centrifuge. I
              kept hiking and meditating, but saw only my meditation as a form of practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like
              Christianity, Buddhism is one of the great abstract second-generation world
              religions. Its overarching principles are universal and portable, not bound to
              culture or place. But in place after place, both Christianity and Buddhism have
              been enriched by animism’s fertile, complicating stains. In Europe, Christian
              holy days were pegged to pagan festivals that brought a ragged joy into a
              religion flavored with self-denial; churches were built at the sites of wells
              and hills sacred to indigenous religions. Likewise, nature worship permeated
              Asian cultures before the Buddha was born.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Natural
              images abound in the early Buddhist sutras: Shakyamuni was born under a tree;
              he awakened on a cushion of buffalo grass in the light of the morning star; he
              touched the earth in response to the temptations of Mara; and he held up an
              Udambara flower to enlighten his disciple Ananda. He delighted over the beauty
              of the rice fields. He told his monks to meditate at the foot of trees. A
              decade ago, I went on a tour of Japanese temples as a travel writer for Vogue.
              Signs of Shinto nature worship were everywhere. In fields, folded white papers
              hung on shocks of rice to draw the attention of nature spirits. In the
              mountains, I walked under torii gates to a clearing in a cedar grove and found
              a small altar hung with red lanterns and guarded by two stone foxes. The trunks
              of cedars rose, as smooth as masts, far above my head, and then opened into a
              canopy of feathery branches. I was standing at the bottom of a
              hundred-foot-high column of filtered light. The shrine did not create the
              sacredness of the place, but simply drew attention to it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              was my wordless introduction to folk Shinto, Japan’s indigenous, pre-Buddhist
              religion. It has no founder, no dogma, and no scriptures—just rituals tied to
              the natural world. It honors a world spontaneously brought into being by the
              hard-to-translate kami— spirits of nature embodied and embedded in everything
              beautiful and therefore sacred: a rock, a lightning bolt, a waterfall, a grove.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Do
              not be attracted by the sounds of spring or take pleasure in seeing a spring
              garden,” Dogen told his disciples in thirteenth-century Japan. “When you see
              autumn colors, do not be partial to them. You should allow the four seasons to
              advance in one viewing and see an ounce and a pound with an equal eye.” But
              outside his monastery gates, rice farmers were welcoming the spring with Shinto
              festivals and giving thanks for the harvest in autumn, knowing full well that
              the seasons would turn and come again. I picked up a broom, entered the little
              enclosure, and swept the shrine free of fallen leaves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              few days later, in the mountains near Yoshino, I watched two young monks chant
              the Heart Sutra in a small temple built over a stream. They were followers of
              an ascetic and syncretic Shinto-Buddhist mountain tradition called Shugendo,
              which venerates snakes and waterfalls as well as buddhas and bodhisattvas. Blowing
              on conch shells, they exited the temple and walked up a series of stone steps,
              bowing at dozens of small altars. They bowed equally to peaceful stone
              bodhisattvas lined against a rock face running with water, and to a huge
              dragon-headed metal snake twined around a Shinto spear. I followed them,
              bowing, the two halves of my religious life finally coming together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              is usually three or four in the afternoon when I retrace my way off the
              mountain, leaving the redwood grove and moving through bays and grasslands,
              passing a red-tailed hawk swooping across the bowl of the hills. Car sounds
              return. I descend past the rich houses of Flying Y Ranch and Cowboy Rock, into
              the valley of my daily life. I put my sweater back on, and start thinking about
              dinner. I start the car and drive home, to our dishwasher, coffee grinder,
              microwave, computers, and panoply of electric lights. The joy of my day on the
              mountain has fueled my efforts to live a saner life. It somehow helps me
              meditate for the rest of the week.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At
              home, I pick up the phone, call my mother, and reconcile. Then I take Dogen
              down from my bedroom bookshelf and read “Instructions to the Tenzo,” a
              practical guide for the head cook at a Zen monastery. Its severe tone seems at
              first to have little in common with the mysticism of his Mountains and Waters
              Sutra. Lose not a grain of rice, he says. Take care of the monastery’s rice and
              vegetables “as though they were your own eyeballs.” And when you boil rice,
              “know that the water is your own life.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              try to obey. At dinner, I put the newspaper aside, light candles, and eat with
              full attention. “Innumerable labors brought us this food,” goes the meal verse
              we chanted at Tassajara. “We should know how it comes to us.” I try to remember
              where everything I use comes from and where it is going. I feel a mixture of
              guilt and gratitude. I try to regard every thing I handle—my rice, my sweater,
              my vacuum cleaner—as if they were my own eyeballs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              blow out the candles. I clean the table and stove using super-cleaning microfiber
              cloths that require only hot water rather than chemicals. I apply elbow grease.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">These
              forms of attention are more mundane and difficult for me to practice than the
              ecstasy I often feel on the mountain. Yet they too express a reverence for the
              natural world and an understanding of interdependence, just as my mother did
              when she squeezed water out of her laundry in England, and as Mirabai did when
              she worshiped the mountain energy night and day. Ultimately, Dogen says,
              housewifery and ecstasy are not that different. “Taking up a green vegetable,
              turn it into a sixteen-foot golden body,” he challenges me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My
              altar holds not only a Buddha, but a seashell, a metal cricket, a snake, and an
              image of Mary. Likewise, my religious practice now is a hodgepodge of nature
              worship and Buddhist meditation and twelve-step programs, and I cannot make it
              all sound logical or consistent. When I’m tired or lonely and want to be numb,
              you can often find me driving alone up Highway 101, feeding the hunger that
              isn’t hunger, stopping at Whole Foods and Costco and Trader Joe’s, loading up
              on Brazilian papayas and toilet paper from the forests of the Northwest and my
              favorite yogurt from Greece. Sometimes I think I’m in the realm of the gods
              when in reality I’m acting like a hungry ghost. I forget that there is
              something in the brain that never hears “enough.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Yet
              I don’t want to become so ascetic, taking no pleasure in a spring garden, but
              rather to open my heart and my senses to the vivid love I have for the natural
              world. The paradox is that when I open myself fully to pleasure, I use and
              waste less.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              next morning at breakfast, I light the candles, bow over my food and chant. I
              eat a bowl of oatmeal and half a papaya with a squeeze of lime. I dig the spoon
              into a bowl of smooth Greek yogurt. I let it roll off my tongue. It is not only
              asceticism that will save us, but delight. All the universe is one bright
              pearl, wrote Dogen. Everything is holy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wilderness Journey</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I
              found myself in a workshop one day talking about Zen and the environment,” says
              John Daido Loori, abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, New York,
              “and I realized how stupid it was because, you know, Zen is very experiential.
              You don’t talk about it. You do it. So I decided I should take these people,
              most of whom had never been in the wilderness, out into the wilderness and let
              them experience it for themselves.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That
              first canoe trip, a grueling 125-mile cross-country jaunt, was so successful
              and generated so much excitement that Loori and the monastery developed an
              array of programs and workshops known collectively as the Born as the Earth
              program, Each uses the wilderness experience and the natural environment to
              teach the interdependency of the self and the universe, and outdoors skills and
              knowledge to overcome feelings of fear or anxiety about being out in the wilds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Founded
              by Loori in 1980 in the tradition of the Mountains and Rivers order of Zen
              Buddhism, Zen Mountain Monastery sits on a 240-acre parcel of land in the
              Catskill Forest Preserve. In its first meeting, the monastery board designated
              80 percent of its land to be forever wild. “If a tree falls,” says Loori, “it
              rots where it falls.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Established
              as a contemplative retreat, the monastery was jolted into environmental activism
              when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation attempted to
              appropriate five acres of its land under eminent domain in the early nineties.
              The monastery decided to resist and found several environmental lawyers, field
              biologists, and ecologists among the alumni of the Born as the Earth programs
              willing to take on the DEC. They formed the Green Dragon Society under the
              auspices of a new nonprofit corporation called the Zen Environmental Studies
              Institute (ZESI) and won the case. The society is currently involved in a class
              action suit along with twelve other environmental groups to halt the
              development of a resort on Bellair Mountain, in the Catskill Forest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">All
              of these activities are based on a conviction that love of nature is a far more
              powerful force in protecting the natural environment than science, legislation,
              religion, or self-interest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              the ZESI brochure points out, ”We take care of the things we love.”</span></p>
