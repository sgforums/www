Can anyone verify this?<br><br>btw, I realise that there are quite a handful of young and well cultivated Venerables with stunning physical appearance. While I was at KMS last week and saw a very young and handsome young monk with a very pleasant chanting voice and a near perfect skin and feature.  Even as a man, I was captivated. My female relatives were all signing and kept wondering why such an promising young man became a monk.<br><br>I was rejoicing instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

It's predicated on the recognition that we're all one. And the common ground of all beings is that we all want to be happy and well, and have our loved ones be protected and safe and happy and not harmed. We're all joined in that way, therefore we dedicate ourselves to the greater welfare of all, not just for our own selfish, temporary welfare in this short life. When we take the Bodhisattva vow, we make ourselves a spiritual servant, like a saintly or peaceful warrior working for peace, enlightenment and the betterment of all beings. And not just human beings, but all beings of all kinds throughout all lifetimes, in all possible worlds and universes. It's really a saintly, cosmic aspiration of service and dedication to the highest good for all (as opposed to the temporary gratification or the materialism of this life). That's really the basics of Tibetan Buddhism, the Mahayana Buddhism, the Great Vehicle or Great Boat. The vehicle intent on universal liberation, not just individual relief or individual enlightenment. It's realizing that as long as any being is suffering or is imprisoned, I too am not completely free. So we pray, "May we all together complete the spiritual path. We vow not to go to Nirvana or complete our spiritual work until all beings get there." So as long as there is any suffering in the world, there is still spiritual work to do. That's the Bodhisattva vow and the Bodhisattva aspiration and that's the heart of the Mahayana Buddhism. Buddhism really has three schools and Mahayana is probably the biggest.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love in Buddhism<br><br>http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables.html<br><br>The definition of love in Buddhism is: wanting others to be happy.<br><br>This love is unconditional and it requires a lot of courage and acceptance (including self-acceptance).<br><br>The "near enemy" of love, or a quality which appears similar, but is more an opposite is: conditional love (selfish love).<br><br>The opposite is wanting others to be unhappy: anger, hatred.<br><br>A result which one needs to avoid is: attachment.<br><br>This definition means that 'love' in Buddhism refers to something quite different from the ordinary term of love which is usually about attachment, more or less successful relationships and sex; all of which are rarely without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to de-tachment and the unselfish interest in others' welfare.<br><br>'Even offering three hundred bowls of food three times a day does not match the spiritual merit gained in one moment of love.' - Nagarjuna<br><br>"If there is love, there is hope that one may have real families, real brotherhood, real equanimity, real peace. If the love within your mind is lost and you see other beings as enemies, then no matter how much knowledge or education or material comfort you have, only suffering and confusion will ensue" - His Holiness the Dalai Lama from 'The little book of Buddhism'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From <a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl030104.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl030104.html</a><br><br>http://www.wattkhmer.org/buddhistlove.html<br><br>A rich man said to the Buddha, "I see you are the Awakened One and I would like to open my mind to you and ask your advice. My life is full of work, and having made a great deal of money, I am surrounded by cares. I employ many people who depend on me to be successful. However, I enjoy my work and like working hard. But having heard your followers talk of the bliss of a hermit's life and seeing you as one who gave up a kingdom in order to become a homeless wanderer and find the truth, I wonder if I should do the same. I long to do what is right and to be a blessing to my people. Should I give up everything to find the truth?"<br><br>The Buddha replied: "The bliss of a truth-seeking life is attainable for anyone who follows the path of unselfishness. If you cling to your wealth, it is better to throw it away than let it poison your heart. But if you don't cling to it but use it wisely, then you will be a blessing to people. It's not wealth and power that enslave men but the clinging to wealth and power.<br><br>"My teaching does not require anyone to become homeless or resign the world unless he wants to, but it does require everyone to free himself from the illusion that he is a permanent self and to act with integrity while giving up his craving for pleasure.<br><br>"And whatever people do, whether in the world or as a recluse, let them put their whole heart into it. Let them be committed and energetic, and if they have to struggle, let them do it without envy or hatred. Let them live not a life of self but a life of truth, and in that way bliss will enter their hearts."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love as the basis of Spiritual Growth ...Ven. Prof. Dhammavihari Thera<br><br>http://www.metta.lk/english/wwyng2.htm<br><br>Let us see how Buddhism presents and develops its concept of love or respect and concern for all that lives. The Buddha preached and maintained that all life in the universe is a product of natural evolution, each little thing therein in the diverse eco-systems possessing its own right to exist. This thinking blossomed out in Buddhism's greatest contribution to mankind, namely the concept of mettÃ  [Skt. maitrÃ£ ] or universal loving kindness. One loves every other thing in the universe in a direct relationship of one to another, without a mediator or creator. We are, after all, in the world we live in, a part of a complete network. Inspite of our differences, we are integrated into a whole and each one of us loves to be loved. Therefore harmony and healthy relationships of one to another are considered a must which necessarily leads to a smooth running order in the universe.<br><br>Striking a very high note as it were, in his personal admonition to his own son Rahula in the MahÃ rÃ hulovÃ da Sutta [ M.1.424 ], the Buddha tells that the cultivation and practice of mettÃ  or universal loving kindness, dispels the unwholesome mental frame called enmity or hostility. It eliminates the possibility of 'coming into conflict with' those around us. This conflict and confrontation is referred to as vyÃ pÃ da and is considered as leading thereafter to violence or vihimsÃ . [MettaÃ¼ hi te RÃ hula bhÃ vanaÃ¼ bhÃ vayato yo vyÃ pÃ do so pahÃ£yissati. loc.cit.].<br><br>In loving via the medium of mettÃ , one expects nothing back as a return or reward. Love in mettÃ  knows of no bleeding hearts, with or without arrows piercing through them. This concept of love also brings along with it the cognate virtue of equality [or egalite]. In love, all have to become equal, and where honest equality prevails love must know no barriers, as known or unknown, friendly or otherwise. Not even as I and another. The amount of love one is required to give to others cannot in any way be less than what one wishes and expects others to bestow upon oneself.<br><br>Phrases like ' He who loves himself harms not another ' [TasmÃ  na hiÃ¼se paraÃ¼ attakÃ mo as at S.1.75] or ' Taking oneself as the norm [i.e. that one likes to be loved and treated with respect ] let one cause no harm or injury to others ' [AttÃ naÃ¼ upamaÃ¼ katvÃ  na haneyya na ghÃ taye as at Dhp. v. 129] clearly indicate the Buddhist self-stand [attÃ¥panÃ yika] judgement in the practice of love towards others. This applies to all grades of life [sabba-pÃ Ãµa-bhÃ¥ta-hita-anukampÃ£], literally all living things.To us, this practice of love does not appear as an injunction that one must love oneself first, and then and thereafter, extend love to others. The direction given is that one must love others to the same extent that one wishes to be loved by others. That is the meaning of attÃ naÃ¼ upamaÃ¼ katvÃ  = taking oneself as the model of loving. It certainly does not mean giving priority to oneself.<br><br>The Buddhist concept of love has the capacity to extend not only from human to animal but also from animal to the world of plants as well. There are schools of scientists in the world today who maintain that the world of plants also yearn for love and care. They claim that plants react very specifically to human emotions like love and cruelty in their own way. Besides, the plants as an integral part of our ecosystem have to be treated with utmost respect and recognition. For in the guarantee of their survival lies our own survival. There seems to be very little doubt about that. We shall discuss elsewhere, from the Buddhist point of view, about their being animate or inanimate, sentient or insentient. At any rate, it appears to be the greatest day in the life of a Buddhist saint when he sees no difference between his own body of flesh and blood and the trees and the grass that grow in the wild around him. So wishes Thera TÃ lapuÃ±a in verse No. 1101 of the TheragÃ thÃ .<br><br>When will that ever be, when I can compare<br>All infinite components of which I am made,<br>Those within me, with those without<br>Like trees and grass and creepers that trail ?<br><br>Seeing them all equal , well and true !<br><br>When will such vision , mine ever be ?<br><br>[Translated by the author]<br><br>KadÃ  nu kaÃ±Ã±he ca tiÃµe latÃ  ca khandhe ime ' haÃ¼ amite ca dhamme<br>AjjhattikÃ n ' eva ca bÃ hirÃ ni samaÃ¼ tuleyyaÃ¼ tadidaÃ¼ kadÃ  me. Thag. v.1101<br><br>In Buddhism, this practice of universal loving kindness or mettÃ  is called ' the Godly way of living ' or brahma-vihÃ ra. It knows no revenge. It is one of four gradually upgraded qualities of love. Collectively they are also called 'sates of unbounded or magnanimous living' : appamÃ na-vihÃ ra or appama??a. The other three are compassion or karuÃµÃ  , appreciative [not sympathetic] joy or muditÃ  and equanimity or upekkhÃ  . We wish to stress here adequately the word living [vihÃ ra]. These aspects of love cannot remain as mere thoughts in one's head or as mere wishes on one's lips. They must necessarily get translated into a philosophy of living. It must indeed be lived. If wishes were horses, then beggars would be kings. By virtue of their being life-toners, they are literally soul-elevating. They enrich our lives as we live that way. Hence they are called Brahma-vihÃ ra , i.e. Godly or Heavenly Modes of Living.<br><br>At the same time, universal loving kindness [or universal acceptance of friendship with everything that lives] practiced in this manner contributes to the much needed Buddhist virtue of ego-destruction or ridding oneself of the menacing notion of I and mine [ahaÃ¼kÃ ra- mamiÃ¼kÃ ra- mÃ nÃ nusaya ]. This absence of ego is the basic character of the goal of Nirvana. The over-inflation of the ego or self-hood is said to stand in the way of true happiness in this life as well as in the way of final release out of the painful round of births and deaths of saÃ¼sÃ ra. It warps and distorts good human relationships. It takes the lubricants off our interpersonal relationships.<br><br>Because we know we love ourselves and we know love plays such a great role in our lives, let us give this freely to others. Let none in the world we live in suffer for want of love. And let none suffer because we do not truly practice love towards all that live, like ourselves. Let us not forget our callous disrespect for the lives of others and the pain we thereby bring upon them.<br><br></div>
