              <p>Now Tibet and Mongolia is geographically located next to China and India. If you try to understand the history that came forth from Central Asia, you are in trouble. Most recently in the 20th century before Dalai Lama made the headlines, Adolf Hitler was waving an Aryan flag i.e. the swastika that all Vedic religions use. Adolf was trying to propagate the dharma - not just Buddhist dharma, but Vedic dharma - in Europe. Vedic dharma has got a common trait, they eat chicken and goats at times, yet they abstain from beef, because cows are sacred. However they drink milk, as Vimalakirti the lay householder taught Venerable Ananda one fine day. Now, while there are many gurus coming forth from Tibet these days due to Chinese treachery, majority of it has to do with their lifestyles.</p>
              <p>In an earlier sutta study I mentioned about Cunda, and how the Gautama Buddha died after He accepted Cunda's offering of pork delicacy. Now, the tibetan lineages or what is often known as the vajrayana, has got a lame excuse of sorts where austerity and ascetism is concerned. They eat after lunch and they eat meat, their explanation is because in the mountains vegetables are rare and the climate is cold, so the necessity arises. Well, this is similar with the modern-day Japanese problem with porngraphy. Because it's part of their culture you see. Unlike the Himalayan weather of areas that lie north of India, Japan has got freak seafood abundances, so they eat lots of vegetables and lots of seafood perhaps, yet because they are so adament about their elitist culture since the Qing Emperor of China, they swing the other direction where their girls gotta have the biggest of boobs and the fairest of skin so that they can make the best of videos with American technologies. However, the Japanese are very good at dieting, even their householders can survive incredible fasting and diets because it has something to do with their fascist imperial legacy of slaughtering fractions of mankind in Asia and Pacific to keep an emperor.</p>
              <p>The countries nearest to Japan include US. The countries nearest to Tibet include China. Like Japan, small countries like Koreas and Taiwan have got strange excuses for their lifestyles and the sufferings - often karmic - that spawn forth. Similarly, small countries near Tibet such as Bhutan and Nepal also have all kinds of strange excuses too. Now Tibet is a country different from Japan perhaps, in Japan people die from work stress and because of low fertility rates.</p>
              <p>Tibetans die because you tell them to shut up while in exile.</p>
              <p>We don't stop them from talking because they won't want to live if you stop the press from interviewing them, yet if gravity is 9.81m/s2 all over this planet even high up in the mountains, their suffering including their princesses' is not really different from your average Johor princess's when she don't want to wear a custom tudung.</p>
              <p>I may actually side with the Johor princess if it encourages her to put on nicer costumes, after all before the British got us autonomous in Singapore, Singapore was part of the Johor Sultanate, I was supposed to have a princess as well and she is not Tibetan, ironically, the Tibetan princess is also not Chinese, if you'd asked me the Tibetan princess deserves death, the Communists should have just killed her and saved me the trouble of typing, and I won't need to go into details about what happened to Adolf Hitler's mistress.</p>
