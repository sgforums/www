              <p>If don't know mean not yet realize it and ought to practice meditation and dharma reading up etc to cultivate both blessing and wisdom. This is the only way to develop the potential of past "true nature" so that the masters referring to is clear.</p>

              <p>I asked this question because I am confused by all the differing terminology.</p>
              <p>If my memory doesn't fail me I've heard of:  True Mind, True Nature, Essential Nature, One Mind, Original Nature, No Mind, etc.</p>
              <p>and in some cases, they have been described as eternal and infinite. </p>
              <p>At the same time, I have to remind myself that there is no spiritual intelligence or essence that is changeless.  Hence, I'm wondering if this True Nature/Essential Nature is more the "backdrop" against which phenomena arise and cease, and that True Nature/Essential Nature itself neither arises nor ceases. </p>

              <p>Because different masters may have different insights and way of explaining, there could be somewhat differing explanations.</p>
              <p>So far I like the Dzogchen explanation as it talks about the inseparability of Emptiness, Luminosity and natural manifestation of dependent origination. This concurs with my understanding.</p>
              <p>Btw since the nature of mind cannot be separated from manifestation, I would not say it is a 'backdrop' against phenomena. But this becomes apparent only when dualistic tendencies dissolve due to non-dual insight - not when there is an initial insight into the luminosity of mind (the 'I AM'). This is what I and Thusness have gone through, and Ken Wilber has gone through: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Wilber">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Wilber</a></p>

              <p><strong>SONG SIX: Initiation into our true existential condition </strong></p>
              <p>EHMAHO! Again, beloved children of my heart, listen! "Mind", this universal
                                                  concept, this most significant of words, being no single entity, manifests as the gamut of
                                                  pleasure and pain in samsara and nirvana. There are as many beliefs about it as there are
                                                  approaches to Buddhahood. It has innumerable synonyms.</p>
              <p>In the vernacular it is "I"; some Hindus call it "the Self"; the
                                                  Disciples say "self-less individual"; the followers of Mind-only call it simply
                                                  "mind"; some call it "perfect insight"; some call it
                                                  "Buddha-nature"; some call it "the Magnificent Stance" (Mahamudra);
                                                  some call it "the Middle Way"; some call it "the cosmic seed"; some
                                                  call it "the reality-continuum"; some call it "the universal ground";
                                                  some call it "ordinary consciousness". Since the synonyms of "mind",
                                                  the labels we apply to it, are countless, know it for what it really is. Know it
                                                  experientially as the here and now. Compose yourself in the natural state of your mind's
                                                  nature.</p>
              <p>When at rest the mind is ordinary perception, naked and unadorned; when you gaze
                                                  directly at it there is nothing to see but light; as Awareness, it is brilliance and the
                                                  relaxed vigilance of the awakened state; as nothing specific whatsoever, it is a secret
                                                  fullness; it is the ultimacy of nondual radiance and emptiness.</p>
              <p>It is not eternal, for nothing whatsoever about it has been proved to exist. It is not
                                                  a void, for there is brilliance and wakefulness. It is not unity, for multiplicity is
                                                  self-evident in perception. It is not multiplicity, for we know the one taste of unity. It
                                                  is not an external function, for Awareness is intrinsic to immediate reality.</p>
              <p>In the immediate here and now we see the face of the Original Lord abiding in the heart
                                                  centre. Identify yourself with him, my spiritual sons. Whoever denies him, wanting more
                                                  from somewhere else, is like the man who has found his elephant but continues to follow
                                                  its tracks. He may comb the three dimensions of the microcosmic world systems for an
                                                  eternity, but he will not find so much as the name of Buddha other than the one in his
                                                  heart.</p>
              <p>Such is my introduction initiating recognition of our true existential condition, which
                                                  is the principal realization in Cutting Through to the Great Perfection.</p>
              <p><strong>SONG SEVEN: Assertion of our Intrinsic Buddhahood</strong></p>
              <p>EHMAHO! Once more listen attentively, my noble sons and daughters. The three modes of
                                                  Buddha's being -- essence, nature and responsiveness -- and the five modes of being, as
                                                  well as the five aspects of primal awareness, all are completed and perfected in the
                                                  naturally luminous intrinsic awareness of the here and now.</p>
              <p>The essence of Awareness, indefinable by any term such as colour, shape or other
                                                  attribute, is the dharmakaya; the inherent radiance of emptiness is the light of the
                                                  sambhogakaya; and the unimpeded medium in which all things manifest is the nirmanakaya.</p>
              <p>The three modes are explained figuratively like this: the dharmakaya is a crystal
                                                  mirror; the sambhogakaya is its nature -- brilliant clarity; and the nirmanakaya is the
                                                  unobstructed medium in which the reflection appears.</p>
              <p>From the first, people's minds have existed as these three modes of being. If they are
                                                  able to recognize this spontaneously, it is unnecessary for them to practise even so much
                                                  as a moment of formal meditation -- the awakening to Buddhahood is instantaneous.</p>
              <p>In this introduction to the three modes they are defined separately. In truth, my
                                                  heart-children, do not fall into the error of believing them to be separate, belonging to
                                                  different continuums.</p>
              <p>From the beginning, the three modes of being are empty and utterly pure. Understanding
                                                  them as a single essence that is the union of radiance and emptiness, conduct yourself in
                                                  a state of detachment.</p>
              <p>The triad of essence, nature and responsiveness, again, corresponds to dharmakaya,
                                                  sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. Understanding these three as the mystic union of emptiness
                                                  and radiance, conduct yourself in a state of detachment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Further, since the primal awareness of self-existing Awareness manifests everything
                                      whatsoever, this awareness is the pure-being of the Creator, Vairocana; since it is
                                      unchanging and unchangeable, it is the pure-being of Immutable Diamond, Aksobhya-vajra;
                                      since it is without centre or circumference, it is the pure-being of Boundless Light-form,
                                      Amitabha; since it is also the gem that is the source of supreme realization and relative
                                      powers, it is the pure-being of the Fountain of Jewels, Ratnasambhava; since it
                                      accomplishes all aspiration, it is the pure-being of the Fulfiller of All Ambition,
                                      Amoghasiddhi. These deities are nothing but the creative power of Awareness.</p>
              <p>The primal awareness of Awareness is mirror-like awareness because of the manifest
                                      clarity of its unobstructed essence. It is awareness of sameness because it is
                                      all-pervasive. It is discriminating awareness because the entire gamut of diverse
                                      appearances is manifest from its creativity. It is the awareness that accomplishes all
                                      actions because it fulfils all our ambition. It is awareness of the reality-continuum, the
                                      dharmadhatu, because the single essence of all these aspects of awareness is primal
                                      purity. Not so much as an atom exists apart from these which are the creativity of
                                      intrinsic Awareness.</p>
              <p>When a pointed finger introduces you directly and immediately to the three modes --
                                      essence, nature and responsiveness -- and the Five Buddhas and the five aspects of
                                      awareness, all together, then what is experienced is brilliant, awakened Awareness
                                      unaffected by circumstance and uninfluenced by clinging thought; it is cognition of the
                                      here and now, unstructured and unaffected.</p>
              <p>All the Buddhas of the three aspects of time arise from this Awareness. Constantly
                                      identify yourselves with it, beloved sons and daughters, because this is the spirituality
                                      of all the Buddhas of the three aspects of time.</p>
              <p>Awareness is unstructured, natural radiance your own mind, so how can you say that you
                                      cannot see the Buddha? There is nothing at all to meditate upon in it, so how can you
                                      complain that meditation does not arise? It is manifest Awareness, your own mind, so how
                                      can you say that you cannot find it? It is a stream of unceasing radiant wakefulness, the
                                      face of your mind, so how can you say that you cannot see it? There is not so much as a
                                      moment of work to be done to attain it, so how can you say that your effort is unavailing?
                                      Centred and dispersed states are two sides of the same coin, so how can you say that your
                                      mind is never centred? Intrinsic Awareness is the spontaneously originated three modes of
                                      being, which is achieved without striving, so how can you say that your practice fails to
                                      accomplish it? It is enough to leave the mind in a state of non-action, so how can you say
                                      that you are incapable of attaining it? Your thoughts are released at the moment of their
                                      inception, so how can you say that the antidotes were ineffective? It is cognition of the
                                      here and now, so how can you say you do not perceive it?</p>
              <p><strong>SONG EIGHT: The Method of Attaining Conviction</strong></p>
              <p>EHMAHO! Once again, beloved sons and daughters, listen with devotion! "Mind in its
                                      insubstantiality is like the sky." Is this true or false, my children? Confirm it by
                                      relaxing completely and looking directly at the mind, gazing with your entire mind, free
                                      of all tension.</p>
              <p>"The emptiness of the mind is not just a blank nothingness, for without doubt it
                                      is the primal awareness of intrinsic Awareness, radiant from the first. Self-existent,
                                      natural radiance is like sunlight." Is this indeed true? To confirm it, relax
                                      completely, looking directly at the nature of your mind.</p>
              <p>"There is no doubt that it is impossible to objectify or grasp thought or the
                                      movement of memory. This capricious, changeable movement is like the cosmic wind!" Is
                                      this indeed so? To confirm it, relax completely, looking directly at the nature of your
                                      mind.</p>
              <p>"Without doubt all appearances whatsoever are our own manifestation. All
                                      phenomena, whatsoever manifests, is like reflection in a mirror." Is this indeed so?
                                      To confirm it, relax completely, looking directly at the nature of your mind.</p>
              <p>No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing to see other
                                      than that seen at the moment of vision. No experience is possible anywhere but in the
                                      mind, so there is nothing to meditate upon other than mind. No experience is possible
                                      anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing to do other than what is done in the mind.
                                      No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is no samaya to be sustained
                                      outside the mind. No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is no goal
                                      to be reached that is not in the mind.</p>
              <p>Look, look, and look again. Look at your own mind!</p>
              <p>Project your attention into external fields of space, and, attentively watching the
                                      nature of your mind, see if it moves. When you are convinced by observation that the mind
                                      does not move, retract your attention and concentrate upon the mind within, and look
                                      carefully for the projector of diffused thought. When you have decided that there is no
                                      entity responsible for thought patterns, look carefully for the colour and shape of the
                                      mind. When you arrive at the emptiness that has no colour or shape, look for a centre or
                                      circumference. Certain that middle and margin are the same, search for an inside and an
                                      outside. Finding no distinction between inside and outside, you arrive at Awareness, which
                                      is as vast as the sky.</p>
              <p>"By virtue of its all-penetrating freedom this Awareness that has no centre or
                                      circumference, no inside or outside, is innocent of all partiality and knows no blocks or
                                      barriers. This all-penetrating intrinsic Awareness is a vast expanse of space. All
                                      experience of samsara and nirvana arises in it like rainbows in the sky. In all its
                                      diverse manifestation it is but a play of mind."</p>
              <p>You need only look out from the motionless space of intrinsic Awareness at all
                                      experience, illusory like the reflection of the moon in water, to know the impossibility
                                      of dividing appearances from emptiness.</p>
              <p>"In a state of Awareness there is no separation of samsara and nirvana." Look
                                      out from the motionless space of intrinsic Awareness at all experience, illusory like the
                                      reflection in a mirror, and no matter what manifests it can never be tasted, its existence
                                      can never be proved. In this dimension samsara and nirvana do not exist and everything is
                                      the dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>All beings wandering in the three realms of samsara remain trapped in dualism until
                                      they realize that within their own perception resides the primal awareness that is the
                                      ultimate identity of all experience of samsara and nirvana. Due to the power of the
                                      delusive subject/object dichotomy, they hold samsara and nirvana to be different states of
                                      mind. They remain bound because, where in truth there is nonduality, they see a duality.</p>
              <p>In reality no distinction between samsara and nirvana can exist in anybody's mind.
                                      However, when the worldly fool rejects some things and indulges in others, avoiding the
                                      "bad" and cultivating the "good", despising one while loving another,
                                      then due to partiality, prejudice and bias, aimlessly he wanders through successive lives.</p>
              <p>Rather than attain the spontaneously accomplished three modes of intrinsic Awareness
                                      without striving, thick-headed aspirants explore the techniques and stages of many
                                      time-consuming methods of "self-improvement", leaving them no time to reach the
                                      seat of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>"Emphatically, all phenomenal appearances whatsoever are one's own vision."
                                      Look out from the state of motionless intrinsic Awareness and all light-form and animate
                                      existence is like reflection. Appearances are empty, sound is empty and indeed one's own
                                      nature is originally empty.</p>
              <p>Similarly, turn your attention inwards to the mind that is the viewer, and your thought
                                      processes, naturally subsiding, are empty like the sky, unstructured, free of conceptual
                                      elaboration, utterly indeterminable, beyond description, concept and expression of any
                                      kind.</p>
              <p>All events whatsoever are an illusory magical display of mind and all the magical
                                      display of mind is baseless and empty. When you have realized that all events are your own
                                      mind, all visual appearances become the empty dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>Appearances are not binding. It is through attachment to them that beings are fettered.
                                      Sever all delusive attachments, children of my heart!</p>
              <p><strong>SONG NINE: Mist Dream and Optical Illusion</strong></p>
              <p>EHMAHO! Best beloved, fearless sons and daughters, without applying the spur, the horse
                                      will not gallop; without thorough churning, the butter will not separate; without detailed
                                      explanation you will not be convinced of my meaning. So while I sing my long but lyrical
                                      songs, listen in comfort, relaxed, without drooping ears!</p>
              <p>Until you perceive all appearances as mind you will never realize the meaning of
                                      emptiness. To facilitate this understanding, you favoured children must apply yourselves
                                      fully to a diligent analysis and thorough search. Firstly, where do appearances come from?
                                      Secondly, where are they now? Lastly, where do they go?</p>
              <p>During your examination you will see that just as mist arises out of the sky and
                                      dissolves back into the sky, appearances are the magical display of your mind, arising in
                                      the mind and vanishing back into it.</p>
              <p>Take as an example the shimmering effect seen by a man with an impaired sense of vision
                                      when he gazes ahead. Although the shimmering appears to exist in front of his eyes,
                                      nothing is there -- it is an optical illusion.</p>
              <p>In the same way, when mental functions are impaired by negative propensities that cause
                                      clinging to apparently external objects as discrete and substantial entities, then visual
                                      and auditory phenomena appear to exist where not so much as an atom can be proved to have
                                      ultimate reality. Everything is a figment of the mind.</p>
              <p>All these figments of mind are baseless and empty. They are non-existent light-forms,
                                      apparition and magical illusion, like the reflection of the moon in water. Compose
                                      yourself in the reality of inseparable appearance and emptiness!</p>
              <p>Now in our sleep we may dream of our native country, our parental home, and our
                                      relatives or friends, as if they were actually present, and an appropriate strong feeling
                                      may arise. Although our family and friends are not actually present and we have not
                                      stirred an inch from our beds, we may experience a face-to-face encounter with them of the
                                      same vivid intensity as in the waking state.</p>
              <p>Each and every sensual experience of our lives is an experience similar to last night's
                                      dream. Just as we attach labels to dream entities, objectifying and clinging to them as
                                      substantial entities, so appearances are modified and apprehended by mind in the waking
                                      state. In the same way that dreams have no substance, so the figments of the mind, all
                                      appearances whatsoever, are also empty.<a name="QuickMark"></a></p>

              <p>Homage to Great Bliss!</p>
              <p>Mahamudra is knowing that<br> all things are one's own mind.<br> Seeing objects as external is just noetic projection.<br> The whole of "appearance" is as empty as a dream.</p>
              <p>The mind as such is merely a flow of awareness,<br> without self-nature, moving where it will like the wind.<br> Empty of an identity, it is like space.<br> All phenomena, like space, are the same.</p>
              <p>That which is termed Mahamudra,<br> Is not a "thing" that can be pointed to.<br> It is the mind's own nature<br> that is Mahamudra [i.e., the Absolute State].</p>
              <p>It is not something to be perfected or transformed.<br> Thus, to realize this, is to realize<br> that the whole world of appearance is Mahamudra.<br> This is the absolute all-inclusive Dharmakaya [i.e.,the Ultimate Embodiment of Buddhahood].</p>
              <p>Uncontrived and just as it is,<br> the inconceivable Dharmakaya,<br> is itself effortless meditation.<br> Trying to attain something is not meditation.</p>
              <p>Seeing everything like space, like a magical illusion,<br> Neither meditating nor not meditating,<br> Neither separate nor not separate:<br> Such is the Yogin's realization.</p>
              <p>All virtuous and evil actions<br> Become liberated through this knowledge.<br> The sinful defilements become the Absolute Gnosis itself;<br> becoming the Yogin's friend, this is a fire consuming the forest of trees.</p>
              <p>Where then is going or staying?<br> Who then needs to run to a Monastery to meditate?<br> If one does not understand this point,<br> liberation will be but a temporary event.</p>
              <p>When the true nature is realized,<br> one abides in the unwavering state.<br> Whether or not one is in the state of Integration or not,<br> There is nothing to be corrected by antidote or meditation.</p>
              <p>Whatever arises is devoid of self-nature.<br> Appearances are auto-liberated into the Sphere of Reality (Dharmadhatu).<br> Conceptual creation is auto-liberated into Absolute Gnosis (Mahajnana).<br> The non-duality [of these two] is the Dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>Like the flow of a great river,<br> Whatever occurs is meaningful and true.<br> This is the eternal Buddha state,<br> The Great Bliss, transcending the Worldly Cycle.</p>
              <p>All phenomena are empty of self-identity,<br> Wherein even the concept of emptiness is eliminated.<br> Free of concepts, clinging not to mental projections,<br> is the Path of all the Enlightened Ones.</p>
              <p>For those fortunate to connect with this teaching,<br> I have uttered these words of heartfelt instruction.<br> Thus, may all sentient beings<br> become established in Mahamudra.</p>
