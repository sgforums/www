              <p>talk without practice,i donot mean mahayana do not meditate,the pratice here means strickly follow the precepts of buddhism, and some ascetic way.the precepts and different from different sects,Therayana or Mahayana,but seems that å¾‹å®—,is a minority sect in chinese buddhism.Not many interested to follow the precepts exactly but into the theory and the meditation experience.</p>
              <p>And this is just a opinion among chinese folks.And i just recite it.</p>

              <p>I agree that there are some similarity. For example, some brahma practitioners who managed to enter samadhi also developed some supernatural power to see different realms like heaven, ghost and hell. But buddhism is about liberating from samsara, so having supernatural power cannot relate to buddhism.<br>Likewise, Buddha himself also taught some method to stay healthy, but one cannot be considered as buddhist by practicing this healthy lifestyle alone.<br>There was a saying that some hindusm deity was subdued by some buddhism masters and vow to be dharma protectors after converting to buddhism. :) I think that's why there are some dharma protectors who is also worshipped by hindusm.</p>

              <p>On the surface it seems very similar. For example, Hinduism teaches Self-realisation, Non-ego, and purportedly provides a path to enlightenment and liberation for its followers. (Mystical) Taoism, Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, Judaist Kabbalah and so on are also very similar.</p>
              <p>Because when we're talking about the core of religions, it's the mystics/contemplatives that are the 'highest level' practitioners... who seek to understand the truth of their religions not just by belief, theories or even feelings/emotions (common religious seekers may have powerful life-changing experiences or encounters with the divine force/spirit, or miracles, but it will always seem to be "separate" from the "seeker" until they realise union/its true nature) but by complete union with the true essence of god.</p>
              <p>But for the mystics, its a direct experience of the UNION with the Divine Presence of God, or in Hinduism they call it the realisation of the (true) Self, which is a non-personal Self, its the true self, the God-self. "God-consciousness". It's a complete dissolving of any sense of individuality into God/true-Self, a sort of non-dual experience (but not the kind of non-duality in Buddhism) and realising the true identity of luminous pure consciousness as God.</p>
              <p>In Hinduism its the identity of atman with Brahman (God, the Whole). Means completely dropping false notions of self and become/realise the true divine mind.</p>
              <p>In Christianity,  Paul said: <em>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20) -- see <a href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php">http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php</a></p>
              <p>In Taoism, Chuang Tzu calls it entering the Divine, the One. The Tao. And the forgetting of the 'self'.</p>
              <p>The falling away of self is common to all religions. But in Buddhism, No-Self is not a state or stage of the falling away of the ego or personality or a state of union with divine, it's actually a Dharma Seal or the nature of reality. And, there is no identification with an eternal witnessing consciousness as the Self, the view and experience of other mystics.</p>
              <p>That means, those mystics experience Consciousness/Awareness as an Eternal Watcher (which is God), a non-judging and permanent watcher watching everything in life yet remaining unaffected and unchanged. <strong>But when non-duality is realised, it's seen that there is no Observer apart from Observed. The true face of consciousness is seen. Scenery sees, there is no seer. Sound hears, there is no hearer. Thought thinks, there is no thinker. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All along</span> the transience rolls and knows; no separate watcher is real or needed.</strong></p>
              <p>Also the core difference in Buddhism is the teaching of Dependent Origination, Emptiness. It's difficult to explain, but even for the Hindu Advaita-Vedantins for example when they experience pure consciousness, they will make Consciousness into a permanent luminous-void background reality where phenomenon arise and subsides within while the background is unchanged (notice the duality here)... they will fail to realise that consciousness is everything without a background. And furthermore, they will fail to see that consciousness and
                                                                                                                                    conditions cannot be separated, and the nature of consciousness is
                                                                                                                                    Empty.</p>
              <p>For example, Shaivism which worships Shiva teaches that since all things are Shiva, and Shiva is real, everything is real. This is the realist point of understanding, but they will fail to understand that consciousness is Empty and inseparable from conditions.</p>
              <p>I am not good at explaining, but just want to say that the subtlety of spirituality cannot be overlooked. Have a good understanding of No-Self, Emptiness/Dependent Origination, and everything will be very clear.</p>
              <p>You probably read this, but if you haven't, this is our moderator Thusness's Six Stages of Experiences, from the realisation of the pure consciousness of I AM, to No-Self, to Emptiness. All are related to pure consciousness, but just that whether the true nature of pure consciousness is realised.</p>

                                                                                              is not true.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is based on the association that arises over time between thinking of

                                                                                                      It makes us think that this is where we are. This is the propensity/bond and identification of a self with the body.</p>
              <p>And by dropping the witness/center, one opens up to a vastness without a center. As Longchen said: <em>Additionally, the need to stay conscious through the meditation

              <p>Nevertheless,
                                                                                              prior to enlightenment the practice of maintaining mindfulness is

                                                                                              is often seen as 'stage-based' and 'effortful'.</p>

                                                                                              a transcendental and precious experience that serves as a condition for
                                                                                              further insights, but the experience itself does not come with the understanding
                                                                                              its nature as anatta. (and when one has experienced the I AM, one still has to switch to proper insight-practice/vipassana, but with the condition of Presence one may develope insights faster.)</p>
              <p>However, it should be noted that the kind of witnessing described above is not exactly the same as the mindfulness practiced in Vipassana/Insight-Practice, which leads to a more gradual and systematic way to experience insight, without going through the "I AM". <em>(of course this is just speaking generally, it depends alot on the condition of the practitioner, some might take 7 years, while people like Bahiya got enlightened in one day)</em> This practice is taught by Buddha. Vipassana is not so much focusing on experiencing/being the witness -- there is mindful awareness, but the "focus" is on the impermanence, suffering, and no-self nature of phenomenon. Means for example there is only the awareness of the minutest detail of every arising and passing sensations without abiding, and without attempting to be the unchanging watcher watching changes. Through this practice one will traverse many stages of insights (nanas) all the way to enlightenment. In this method, there will not be quick experience of Presence, but when Presence is experienced it comes with the realisation of non-duality/insight of Anatta (no-self).</p>
              <p>But in whichever case, what is necessary is the insight into
                                                                                              the 'nature' (of non-duality and anatta/no-self as dharma seal) which is 'always so', its an awakening, a quantum shift in
                                                                                              perception. With this awakening of insight, the pathless path is known.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>On the surface it seems very similar. For example, Hinduism
              teaches Self-realisation, Non-ego, and purportedly provides a path
              to enlightenment and liberation for its followers. (Mystical)
              Taoism, Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, Judaist Kabbalah and
              so on are also very similar.</p>
              <p>Because when we're talking about the core of religions, it's the
              mystics/contemplatives that are the 'highest level'
              practitioners... who seek to understand the truth of their
              religions not just by belief, theories or even feelings/emotions
              (common religious seekers may have powerful life-changing
              experiences or encounters with the divine force/spirit, or
              miracles, but it will always seem to be "separate" from the
              "seeker" until they realise union/its true nature) but by complete
              union with the true essence of god.</p>
              <p>But for the mystics, its a direct experience of the UNION with
              the Divine Presence of God, or in Hinduism they call it the
              realisation of the (true) Self, which is a non-personal Self, its
              the true self, the God-self. "God-consciousness". It's a complete
              dissolving of any sense of individuality into God/true-Self, a sort
              of non-dual experience (but not the kind of non-duality in
              Buddhism) and realising the true identity of luminous pure
              consciousness as God.</p>
              <p>In Hinduism its the identity of atman with Brahman (God, the
              Whole). Means completely dropping false notions of self and
              become/realise the true divine mind.</p>
              <p>In Christianity, Paul said: <em>I no longer live, but Christ
              lives in me!</em> (<cite>Gal.</cite> 2.20) -- see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php">http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php</a></p>
              <p>In Taoism, Chuang Tzu calls it entering the Divine, the One. The
              Tao. And the forgetting of the 'self'.</p>
              <p>The falling away of self is common to all religions. But in
              Buddhism, No-Self is not a state or stage of the falling away of
              the ego or personality or a state of union with divine, it's
              actually a Dharma Seal or the nature of reality. And, there is no
              identification with an eternal witnessing consciousness as the
              Self, the view and experience of other mystics.</p>
              <p>That means, those mystics experience Consciousness/Awareness as
              an Eternal Watcher (which is God), a non-judging and permanent
              watcher watching everything in life yet remaining unaffected and
              unchanged. <strong>But when non-duality is realised, it's seen that
              there is no Observer apart from Observed. The true face of
              consciousness is seen. Scenery sees, there is no seer. Sound hears,
              there is no hearer. Thought thinks, there is no thinker.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All along</span> the
              transience rolls and knows; no separate watcher is real or
              needed.</strong></p>
              <p>Also the core difference in Buddhism is the teaching of
              Dependent Origination, Emptiness. It's difficult to explain, but
              even for the Hindu Advaita-Vedantins for example when they
              experience pure consciousness, they will make Consciousness into a
              permanent luminous-void background reality where phenomenon arise
              and subsides within while the background is unchanged (notice the
              duality here)... they will fail to realise that consciousness is
              everything without a background. And furthermore, they will fail to
              see that consciousness and conditions cannot be separated, and the
              nature of consciousness is Empty.</p>
              <p>For example, Shaivism which worships Shiva teaches that since
              all things are Shiva, and Shiva is real, everything is real. This
              is the realist point of understanding, but they will fail to
              understand that consciousness is Empty and inseparable from
              conditions.</p>
              <p>I am not good at explaining, but just want to say that the
              subtlety of spirituality cannot be overlooked. Have a good
              understanding of No-Self, Emptiness/Dependent Origination, and
              everything will be very clear.</p>
              <p>You probably read this, but if you haven't, this is our
              moderator Thusness's Six Stages of Experiences, from the
              realisation of the pure consciousness of I AM, to No-Self, to
              Emptiness. All are related to pure consciousness, but just that
              whether the true nature of pure consciousness is realised.</p>

              <p>IMO, I think this is very well written</p>
              <p>Yah... Buddhism is the only religion that talks about "emptiness". It is a very profound realisation.... even more profound that the "non-dual".</p>
              <p>Basically, 'emptiness' resolve a lot of mystery.</p>
              <p>The word 'emptiness' and 'empty' is used in many other religions and spiritual practices too. This include Taoism, but the understanding is not the same. In many of these religion, 'emptiness' is referring to the Void. The Void in this case is the transcendental experience of All-pervading presence in a state of no thought.</p>

              <p>BTW the Shaivism I'm talking about is more specifically Kashmir Shaivism, a Hindu non-dual tradition.</p>
              <p>It's closer to non-duality than Advaita Vedanta, but clearly lacks the understanding of Dependent Origination. From what I have seen, many Neo-Advaitin masters have that level of experience, but I haven't seen one who has realisations of Emptiness.</p>
              <p>There has been some interesting discussions on this in the E-Sangha forum, and Loppon Namdrol, who Thusness thinks is highly enlightened and clearly experienced all 6 stages... pointed out the difference to us. BTW, Namdrol is also a Dzogchen practitioner under Chogyal Namkhai Norbu (but has some other gurus as well). If I remember correctly some rinpoche once asked him to teach dzogchen teachings but he turned down the offer. But I may have misunderstood.</p>
              <p>But he still clarifies alot of concepts for us and is a strong 'promoter' of dzogchen in e-sangha. BTW, there was once a dzogchen forum in e-sangha, but Chogyal Namkhai Norbu said no discussion of his teachings, and so the forum was closed down.</p>
              <p>The forum was very interesting and I believe has helped alot of people, but perhaps certain things shouldn't be discussed and can create karma.</p>
              <p>Thusness was also of the opinion there should be no public discussion of Dzogchen. I think it can cause confusions. But I guess if just brief overview it's ok, and refer people to the books and the teacher himself if he's interested.</p>

              <p>That's right... better to refer people directly to the Master and the Master's books instead, if he's interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw I must say that regarding Dependent Origination/Emptiness, it is central to Buddhism and must not be taken lightly at all... it sounds simple but actually is really profound. This is also the central and unique doctrine of Buddhism. Most people simply overlook it and thought it's clear and understood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha:</p>
              <p><span class="style30"><strong>"He who sees the Dependent Origination
                                               sees the Dhamma he who sees the Dhamma sees the Dependent
                                                Origination."</strong></span></p>

              <p>Hence, our Buddha-Nature/Dharma-Nature cannot be properly understood apart from understanding Dependent Origination/Emptiness.</p>

              <p>The falling away of self is common to all religions. But in
              Buddhism, No-Self is not a state or stage of the falling away of
              the ego or personality or a state of union with divine, it's
              actually a Dharma Seal or the nature of reality. And, there is no
              identification with an eternal witnessing consciousness as the
              Self, the view and experience of other mystics.</p>
              <p>That means, those mystics experience Consciousness/Awareness as
              an Eternal Watcher (which is God), a non-judging and permanent
              watcher watching everything in life yet remaining unaffected and
              unchanged. <strong>But when non-duality is realised, it's seen that
              there is no Observer apart from Observed. The true face of
              consciousness is seen. Scenery sees, there is no seer. Sound hears,
              there is no hearer. Thought thinks, there is no thinker.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All along</span> the
              transience rolls and knows; no separate watcher is real or
              needed.</strong></p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>When this is realised, practice becomes spontaneous, effortless
              and natural, and there is no attempt to maintain a conscious
              witnessing (which is related to holding onto a self), no 'effort'
              required, because it is seen that all transient phenomena has
              always been self-luminous, no watcher/witness is needed. (I think
              this is where the problem of insomnia may be overcome in those
              practitioners suffering from the side effects of intense Presence
              coupled with strong propensities/bond to Self)</p>
              <p>Also in my experience and I believe all others experience, if we
              attempt to use "effort" to maintain a witnessing, we may experience
              that the observer is an entity in the center of the head or
              somewhere in the body. In actuality, this is not true.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is based on the association that arises over time
              between thinking of one's self and the subtle muscular contractions
              in the forehead region. It makes us think that this is where we
              are. This is the propensity/bond and identification of a self with
              the body.</p>
              <p>And by dropping the witness/center, one opens up to a vastness
              without a center. As Longchen said: <em>Additionally, the need to
              stay conscious through the meditation is also dropped away. This
              opens up a vastness without center. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/meditation-spontaneous.html">Meditation and spontaneous manifestation</a>)</em></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, prior to enlightenment the practice of maintaining
              mindfulness is taught, and is a very important practice, but to the
              dualistic mind it is often seen as 'stage-based' and
              'effortful'.</p>
              <p>Also a strong practice of witnessing (so does self-inquiry and
              certain practices) can quickly lead to a vivid experience of the I
              AM, which is a transcendental and precious experience that serves
              as a condition for further insights, but the experience itself does
              not come with the understanding its nature as anatta. (and when one
              has experienced the I AM, one still has to switch to proper
              insight-practice/vipassana, but with the condition of Presence one
              may develope insights faster.)</p>
              <p>However, it should be noted that the kind of witnessing
              described above is not exactly the same as the mindfulness
              practiced in Vipassana/Insight-Practice, which leads to a more
              gradual and systematic way to experience insight, without going
              through the "I AM". <em>(of course this is just speaking generally,
              it depends alot on the condition of the practitioner, some might
              take 7 years, while people like Bahiya got enlightened in one
              day)</em> This practice is taught by Buddha. Vipassana is not so
              much focusing on experiencing/being the witness -- there is mindful
              awareness, but the "focus" is on the impermanence, suffering, and
              no-self nature of phenomenon. Means for example there is only the
              awareness of the minutest detail of every arising and passing
              sensations without abiding, and without attempting to be the
              unchanging watcher watching changes. Through this practice one will
              traverse many stages of insights (nanas) all the way to
              enlightenment. In this method, there will not be quick experience
              of Presence, but when Presence is experienced it comes with the
              realisation of non-duality/insight of Anatta (no-self).</p>
              <p>But in whichever case, what is necessary is the insight into the
              'nature' (of non-duality and anatta/no-self as dharma seal) which
              is 'always so', its an awakening, a quantum shift in perception.
              With this awakening of insight, the pathless path is known.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thusness says, <em>The key
              point about mindful awareness is there is no keeping of the mind on
              anything and by not resting on anything, it fuses into everything;
              therefore it cannot be concentrated; rather it is to relax into
              nothingness empty of self, empty of any artifical doing so that the
              natural luminosity can take its own course.  There is no
              focusing, there is only allowing the mirror bright clarity to shine
              with it natural radiance.  In essence there is no one 
              there, only the phenomenon arisng and ceasing
              telling their stories.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And here is how Buddha taught mindfulness and non-duality to
              Bahiya:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Then, Bahiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to
              the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard,
              only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In
              reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you
              should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in
              reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard,
              only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in
              reference to the cognized, then, Bahiya, there is no you in terms
              of that. When there is no you in terms of that, there is no you
              there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder
              nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress."</p>
