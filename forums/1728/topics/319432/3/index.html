              <p>Confucius teaching I think is good, but never had much reading of it yet.</p>
              <p>But the Middle Way that Nagarjuna is talking about here is a different matter...</p>
              <p>The Middle Way is the viewless view of Emptiness, beyond all extremes and conceptual notions of existence, non-existence, both, neither, eternity, nihilism and so on. Basically any dualistic, inherent views are 'extremes'.</p>

              <p>See ok...found this...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...dependent origination as an expression of the Middle Way. During one of our earlier lectures, we had occasion to refer to the Middle Way, and on that occasion we confined ourselves to only perhaps the most basic meaning. We have said that the Middle Way means avoiding the extreme of indulgence in pleasures of the senses and the extreme of self-mortification. In that context the Middle Way is synonymous with moderation. Now in the context of dependent origination, the Middle Way has another meaning which is related to the earlier meaning but deeper. In this context the Middle Way means avoiding the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. How is this so? The flame in the oil lamp exists dependent upon the oil and the wick. When either of these are absent, the flame will be extinguished. Therefore, the flame is neither permanent nor independent. Similarly, this personality of ours depends upon a combination of conditions - defilements and actions. It is neither permanent nor independent. Recognizing the conditioned nature of our personality, we avoid the extreme of eternalism, of affirming the existence of an independent, permanent self. Alternatively, recognizing that this personality, this life does not arise through accident, or mere chance, but is instead conditioned by corresponding causes, we avoid the extreme of nihilism, the extreme of denying the relation between action and consequence. While nihilism is the primary cause of rebirth in states of woe and is to be rejected, eternalism too is not conducive to liberation. One who clings to the extreme of eternalism will perform wholesome actions and will be reborn in states of happiness, as a human being or even as a god, but he will never attain liberation. Through avoiding these two extremes, through understanding the Middle Way, we can achieve happiness in this life and in the future life by performing wholesome actions and avoiding unwholesome actions, and eventually we can achieve liberation.</span><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm</a><br><br>/\</p>

              <p>Yes, I too feel that meditation is very important.</p>
              <p>IMO, it is almost impossible to make any progress without meditation.</p>
              <p>You know, in Dzogchen, the practice is said to be no meditation involved. However, those accomplished practitioners must have been great meditators before. Is just that we do not get to see them do it so often in the current life.</p>
              <p>Also, ... the followings are just my pure opinion with no affiliation to any buddhist teaching.... so please read with discernment...</p>
              <p>The grips and control of unconscious and subconscious karmic pattern is extremely strong and incredibly numerous. Without meditation, this tendencies are almost 100% controlling the behaviour of a person. It is that strong.</p>
              <p>Also, the events that happen in your life are 'controlled' by the subconscious impulses that are 'held' very deeply into the consciousness. You can call this the karma effects.</p>
              <p>That is why dreams can be used to foretell events that are about to happen. In the dream state, the physical 'realm' is momentarily suspended to allow for a different type of conditions to arise... in this case the dream state. The dream state is a symbolic representation of the karmic and intention imprints and tendencies that are held within the deepest subsconscious. This deepest subconscious should be the same as the alaya consciousness.</p>
              <p>What happen is that the dream plays a story with all the karmic influences symbolically represented. These karmic influences are actually about to surface and manifest soon... that is why they manifest as dreams first. Next, within a few weeks or months, the karma consequence manifest in the 'physical realm'.</p>
              <p>From my understanding and experience, the deepest subconscious (alaya consciousness?) is not accessible without meditation. In the deepest subconscious is 'held' the original state of the 'imprints' and 'intentions'. The deepest subconscious with its pure imprints can actually be very different from the manifested personality. The 'reasons' for the rebirth are also felt in that realm.</p>
              <p>just my opinion only.</p>
              <p>PS: when i use the word 'realm' please understand that it is not any place elsewhere. It is mainly for easy explanation.</p>

              <p>Hi rokkie, meditation is important but we should also understand that grounding in reality in daily activities and remaining still, undistracted, calm, and aware is equally important. Even after we have some meditation experience we have to bring it to our daily lives, otherwise there will be a gap and separation between meditation and living. We have to learn how to fully engage in activities and yet be fully authenticated with Reality. This gap is not easy to bridge especially prior to certain levels of insights and experience but we should do our best.</p>
              <p>Also, on the other hand, it is possible to have certain experience (of non-duality, or of I AM/Eternal Witness) and extend the experience/practice to daily living, but this does not mean we can forgo sitting meditation. Some practitioners with certain realisation (of what I mentioned above) thought they can forego meditation, but they are mistaken. Because sitting meditation allows us to experience certain aspects that cannot be experienced by daily living practice alone... for us to progress. Hence, both are equally needed.</p>
              <p>I have pasted an article, written by my local dharma teacher many years ago on practicing in movement. Hope it helps.</p>
              <p>But do note that we should discipline ourselves and find time to sit and meditate, in fact my local dharma teacher started to meditate at least 1 hour <strong>without fail</strong> everyday (or more) after my taiwanese teacher emphasized the importance of it... of course, he equally emphasize practicing in daily lives and said there should be no gap and separation between movement and stillness. And he often said that the bodhisattva has no time to sit around (fully engages in activities selfless service for sentient beings)... but yet he still sits many hours a day <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> Of course he doesn't mean literally that bodhisattvas cannot meditate, but that we must equally practice in daily living.</p>
              <p>For us, after my Taiwanese Teacher comes to Singapore and<span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-size: normal;">ä¼ æ³•, we are advised to meditate at least 1/2 hour a day or more. My Taiwanese teacher would make his students sit more than 1 hour with him. He himself sits, if I remember... something like 4 or 6 hours everyday, because he has now moved into his dharma center and has much time to himself. He is a lay person, though.</span></span></p>
              <p>Our moderator longchen recently left his job and increased his meditation hours. This provided the conditions that gave rise to his recent new and deepening experiences and insights.</p>
              <p>I remember our moderator Thusness told me years back that after his retirement (this or next year) he want to have at least 4 hours a day to meditate. He even thought of retreating to somewhere in China (some mountains? lol) for a period of time...</p>
              <p><strong>But do also take note that after the awakening of non-duality is stabilized, meditation takes secondary role and
                      is not seen as a means to enter a stage of experience -- because
                      non-duality is the ever-present nature of reality, not a stage. There
                      is no entry and exit. Nevertheless, it is still 'healthy' to meditate
                      -- just like exercising is healthy for the body, but still we don't
                      need to become super muscle builders. The Buddha, even after attaining
                      full enlightenment, still spends some hours each day meditating, but even if he does not do that, his enlightenment (non-dual recognition) is not 'reduced' at all.</strong></p>
              <p>Anyway back to Thusness... he's only 40... but he has a stable financial status... can't reveal so much in public! LOL. I think he is like Vimalakirti ;) That's why you seldom see him post here, he's always so busy. Fully engaged in activities yet non-dual! So non-dual certainly isn't just experienced in meditation :)</p>
              <p>(p.s. Vimalakirti: <em>a bodhisattva of the highest order, on par with such figures as
                                          Manjushri, who, in order to develop living beings, lives as a layman in

              <p>Yes, I too feel that meditation is very important.</p>
              <p>IMO, it is almost impossible to make any progress without

              <p>You know, in Dzogchen, the practice is said to be no meditation
                                                                          involved. However, those accomplished practitioners must have been

              <p>The grips and control of unconscious and subconscious karmic
                                                                          pattern is extremely strong and incredibly numerous. Without

              <p>Also, the events that happen in your life are 'controlled' by
                                                                          the subconscious impulses that are 'held' very deeply into the

              <p>That is why dreams can be used to foretell events that are about
                                                                          to happen. In the dream state, the physical 'realm' is momentarily
                                                                          suspended to allow for a different type of conditions to arise...
                                                                          in this case the dream state. The dream state is a symbolic
                                                                          representation of the karmic and intention imprints and tendencies
                                                                          that are held within the deepest subsconscious. This deepest

              <p>What happen is that the dream plays a story with all the karmic
                                                                          influences symbolically represented. These karmic influences are
                                                                          actually about to surface and manifest soon... that is why they
                                                                          manifest as dreams first. Next, within a few weeks or months, the
                                                                          karma consequence manifest in the 'physical realm'.</p>
              <p>From my understanding and experience, the deepest subconscious
                                                                          (alaya consciousness?) is not accessible without meditation. In the
                                                                          deepest subconscious is 'held' the original state of the 'imprints'
                                                                          and 'intentions'. The deepest subconscious with its pure imprints
                                                                          can actually be very different from the manifested personality. The
                                                                          'reasons' for the rebirth are also felt in that realm.</p>
              <p>just my opinion only.</p>
              <p>PS: when i use the word 'realm' please understand that it is not
                                                                          any place elsewhere. It is mainly for easy explanation.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the sharing, I fully agree with you said and I think it is a very good description of our 8th consciousness.<br><br><br>And also I agree that our propensities/momentum are reacting most or all of the time when there is a lack of practice. That is certainly the case especially when I am too busy to meditate! Like nowadays... hehe... lost my calmness..</p>
              <p>Also to add, we have to meditate in order to find the possibility of another mode of knowing free from symbols and bonds... otherwise the mind is unwilling to let go of its holding to thoughts, and incessant chattering and the need to know. It just doesn't know that an effortless/natural, thoughtless and blissful state of being is possible. Once the experience is there we can gradually overcome our long held tendencies and momentum. As we become aware of how our mind works it becomes clear... and as Thusness said, the contrast between naked awareness and the state where propensities/momentum are at work will allow us to be more aware of the workings of our karmic tendencies.</p>

              <p><br> And its true that those who attain enlightenment quickly have been
                                                                          practicing in previous lifetimes. For example
                                                                          when my Taiwanese teacher first met my Master, my Master immediately recognised
                                                                          him and told him 'you have finally come!' even though he has never met
                                                                          him in this lifetime. Which means... my master has been waiting and
                                                                          expecting him for very long time. Within 4 days under guidance of my Master, my Taiwanese teacher achieved enlightenment.</p>
              <p>My Taiwanese teacher has been
                                                                          following my Master for many lifetimes, and in fact is my Master's
                                                                          successor and abbot at a Zen temple in Kyoto, Japan in the immediate
                                                                          past life. Needless to say he has been practicing for many lifetimes and is a great practitioner.</p>
              <p>When he received dharma transmission from my Master, my Master told him he practiced and received the same dharma transmission
                                                                          in his past life from him before. Anyway, he is now my Master's dharma
                                                                          successor and the only one given the task of transmitting certain
                                                                          important dharmas. At first he was reluctant to teach [he has his own students at his center, and did not felt like traveling internationally to various Dao Chang to teach all the students in my Buddhist organisation]... but he had no choice after he was told before my master passed away 11 years
                                                                          ago 'if you did not speak, no one else could speak' and the dharma
                                                                          teaching 'lineage' (well, not exactly lineage, but the dharma transmission) would end there for our organisation. It was however not until about 5 years later before he started teaching, because the conditions were not there.</p>
              <p>Anyway, so generally speaking practice is not a 1 lifetime thing... it's continuous process spanning multiple lives... one lifetime is actually very short. Our practice continues to the next life.. Thusness once said that it may take lifetimes before realising the nature of emptiness (even if one realised non-duality). It is that difficult. So since you have just come upon such insights I want to congrate you.. :)</p>
              <p>BTW, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche (for those who doesn't know, a well-known and highly enlightened Dzogchen master who still lives today) does teach meditation. In fact I think recently he just held a teaching session of Shamatha and Vipashyana meditation to his students.</p>
              <p>From my understanding, ChNNR does not say "don't meditate" but practice what suits us according to our conditions. We have to have awareness of our own condition to make the decisions on the practices. I don't have his books with me now to quote him, but you should know since you are familiar with his teachings. He himself taught a set of practices of yoga and meditative methods, even visualisation and mantras. These are however seen as secondary in Dzogchen. Dzogchen does have its own set of practices also, however. In my understanding what's most important for a Dzogchen practitioner is the student practices whatever practices he's doing with the understanding that the Self-Perfected state 'already is'.</p>
              <p>BTW, Dzogchen tantras advises practitioners to go into retreat and that they will attain full enlightenment within 10 years of practice (those of a lower capacity, some practitioners 'get it' faster)... and to develope rainbow body takes even longer than that. it is not as 'easy' as some might think. Some intense periods of practice may be necessary depending on the practitioner's capacity.</p>

                  life.. Thusness once said that it may take lifetimes before
                  realising the nature of emptiness (even if one realised
                  non-duality). It is that difficult. So since you have just come
                  upon such insights I want to congrate you.. :)</p>

              <p>BTW one more thing about the bonds.</p>
              <p>It is possible through Buddhist practice to burn/dissolve away the bond once and for all and end the causes for rebirth (though if you're a Bodhisattva, you return again out of vows and compassion, but not due to karma).. this is through awakening of insight. I think most people know about this.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, though subconscious/Alaya consciousnesss/8th Consciousness seems to be separate realm/distinct layer of consciousness from our conscious experience, they are actually an inseparable flow. We can become aware of its interactions as a whole.</p>
              <p><br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: But my experiences
                                          are not consistent, you know.<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Of course lah, the
                                          consistencies comes from... it actually has to do a lot with the
                                          bond or the momentum you have {inaudible}. Insight actually burns
                                          the bond away. Insight meditation, insight into reality. You
                                          understand suddenly... the bond loosens, just breaks. Then
                                          stability is it must sink very deep into your consciousness, then
                                          it becomes stable. When I say sink into consciousness, it doesnÂ’t
                                          mean that there are {inaudible}. It is just for the sake of saying
                                          it has to sink very deep down.<br> <br> Consciousness, when I say that there is a sub conscious, and there
                                          is the conscious level. And I say what is done in the conscious
                                          level must sink very deep down into the sub conscious of they call
                                          {inaudible} and the 8th consciousness. When somebody said that,
                                          straight away the thinking mind thought that there is a sub
                                          conscious mind and a conscious mind, they are two, they are
                                          different. {inaudible}<br> <br> The sub conscious, the propensities, and what we call the conscious
                                          level are just mental states only. They are all the same. And you
                                          have to understand that they do not reside anywhere. When
                                          {inaudible} We are in a conventional world. The thinking mind will
                                          divide the conscious and the sub conscious and think that they are
                                          separate. The thinking mind will treat it as that way.<br> <br> Just like I said... is your head separated from your neck? {laughs}
                                          Is your legs separated from your head? {laughs} So first of all you
                                          must understand these first. You must be able to see things as a
                                          whole, and treat things as a process first. Just like you always
                                          hear people say Â“shi bai shi cheng gong zhi muÂ” (failure is the
                                          mother of success) Then you say that, this person fail. Then this
                                          person succeeds. Then to the person, at that moment he fail, is
                                          actually the beginning of success. To you, that is failure. But to
                                          him, that is the beginning of success. {inaudible} Same flow. But
                                          the mind goes and divides it, and you think that there is a very
                                          distinct layer, this is success. {inaudible} But the mind continues
                                          to divide, and that is the problem. {inaudible}<br> <br> Now can concentration lead to the understanding of reality, I said
                                          I donÂ’t think so. Correct? Because it requires insights.
                                          {inaudible}... of a subject and an object.... {inaudible}</p>

              <p><br>Conceptuality! wah u just gave me the opportunity to say something i have thought of saying yesterday... but condition wasn't there for me to post. So right now, condition arise. yuan qi :) thanks.. hehe.. you seem to know what i want to say, or maybe I just misunderstood what you meant ;)</p>
              <p>Like the flower in the mirror or the moon on water, it's illusory yet a perfect vivid manifestation of luminous clarity. Emptiness teaching doesn't ask us change or avoid the vision of the moon, but to see the moon with clarity without the illusion that there is a moon located inside or outside the water, or a flower located inside or outside the mirror. There is simply a pure dependently originated reflection, empty of inherent existence and location.</p>
              <p>But if you think that apart from the appearances there is an ultimate truth to be found, some kind of ultimate/absolute view of "Emptiness" that is "the ultimate", you are misled. Teaching of emptiness simply points, and dissolves all our views of inherency, leaving nothing to be found... not even emptiness...</p>
              <p>It's like saying that the 'redness' of flower is illusory. There is no inherent redness or flowerness (e.g. dogs don't perceive colours) But there
                                                                                                                                is also no separate reality called 'emptiness'. Basically it's just saying
                                                                                                                                the flower is not real (has no external/objective reality), but without establishing emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth.
                                                                                                                                <strong>Emptiness is also empty. </strong>So ultimately no views can grasp emptiness!</p>
              <p>Nevertheless vision of red flower continue to appear vividly according to conditions -- inseparably luminous and empty -- illusory divine appearances, empty yet complete and perfect as it is, spontaneously appearing according to conditions.</p>
              <p><strong>Hence ultimately no establishment of views are required, the viewless view is simply emptiness happening.</strong></p>
              <p>Hence you can see that the teachings of emptiness is only a skillful expedient means, deconstructing and destroying all our dualistic views and views of inherency, without establishing anything (some kind of 'ultimate truth' that can be arrived at)... nothing left but the perfect, complete, luminous-empty-appearance appearing naturally and spontaneously according to conditions.<br><br>However having said so much, even an intellectual understanding of emptiness through understanding the teachings is important prior to the insight/direct experience of emptiness, in that it prevents false views from arising and counters some of our dualistic assumptions so that we'll be on the right path. If one holds onto false views of self, eternalism, etc.. or any dualistic or inherent views... true experience cannot arise. <br><br>Also with false views, a sincere practitioner though he practices hard can get stuck in certain stage for a long time, even after having certain vivid experience of Presence... for example one may be stuck in the I AM/Eternal Witness stage... maybe 20 years or his entire life. Partly because there is no right views. In this case having right views can really help him develop further insights into the nature of presence. Our moderator Longchen is an example, as he was stuck in the I AM stage for many years... our moderator Thusness also, prior to encountering Buddhism. But Longchen was able to progress, after Thusness introduced him to the nature of non-duality and emptiness.</p>
              <p>In a rather recent advise to Longchen, Thusness said <strong>"In Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate
                                                                                                                                ourselves non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of Emptiness. It is a
                                                                                                                                raft but it is the antidote for the conventional mind to orientate
                                                                                                                                itself in a non-dual and non-local context. It also led to the amazing
                                                                                                                                insight that ‘duality’ is really the result of seeing and taking things
                                                                                                                                ‘inherently’ (You may want to the take up the challenge of re-engaging
                                                                                                                                in thoughts penetrating this viewless view of Emptiness and thoroughly

              <p>This has provided Longchen with the condition to realise Emptiness about a week back... this couldn't have happened without the teachings of Buddha or Thusness pointing out the subtleties to him. So understanding Buddhist teachings is important.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately sometimes, there are some practitioners (not referring to anyone in particular) who are too attached to non-conceptuality [and may have the skewed thought that sustaining thoughtless awareness is important while words and teachings are useless] and refuses to look into the teachings of Buddha and understand them, or thinks he understood but actually misunderstood them.</p>
              <p>They may prefer to simply remain non-conceptual and in naked awareness... but nevertheless he fails to see the subtle karmic propensity and momentum at work distorting his experience and forming subtle views. <strong>It is so subtle that the practitioner can't see it himself by his own wisdom</strong>, so the teachings by Buddha [with his omniscience and skillful means] will definitely help, and is actually necessary factor to give rise to insights. That is why proper understanding of Dharma teachings is important also -- it is an important factor to give rise to true insights.</p>
              <p>Like Thusness said, <strong>"It is not uncommon to find practitioners totally giving up this

              <p>That, you can't realise it by yourself without the help/teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha... unless you're a Pratyekabuddha, one who realised dependent origination/emptiness by himself without the teachings by another Buddha.... but it's said that a Pratyekabuddha can only exist in an era without Buddhadharma. ;) And furthermore, a Pratyekabuddha has trained under previous Buddhas and Buddha-sassana... just that when enlightenment occurred in that lifetime, it occurred at a time without other Buddhas or Buddhadharma.</p>
              <p>Anyway I guess, for the people I just mentioned (attached to non-conceptuality but missed the essence), the remedy is for them to let go of their clinging to non-conceptuality. And get him to have proper understanding of the teachings.</p>

              <p>But we're talking about practitioners with transcendental experiences, how is it relevant to beginners? Why should we bother.</p>
              <p>Thusness:<br> <strong><br> Knowing this, right and firm establishment of view of the dharma
                                                          seals is most crucial. Through diligent practice of mindfulness and

                                                          unnecessary pitfalls</span>. Any transcendental experiences and insights
                                                          that occurred during our journey will then be correctly understood.
                                                          The experiences will in turn re-enforce our understanding instead
                                                          of misleading us into the sense of 'Self' and further strengthen
                                                          the bond.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and btw, in case you forgotten, Right View is the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st of the 8 Fold Path</span></strong> to enlightenment.</p>
              <p><br>But in the end for all practitioners there is nothing to be understood, nothing to be grasped, teachings are there only to clarify and destroy our dualistic views and views of inherency, to point us to and allow the revelation of the nature of mind, our true nature/buddha nature, an unfabricated reality that is empty and ungraspable by thought and concepts.</p>
              <p>It is an insight, a quantum shift in perception, not a conceptual understanding. I believe this is what is known as the 'Right View Without Taint'.</p>
              <p>As for the teachings, they are a raft to orientate ourselves with the Viewless View, once insight dawns, the raft is left behind (let go of the teachings). But of course, before arriving at the viewless view of 'mere emptiness happening', please take up the raft and understand the teachings first!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for people like me who are too intellectual and conceptual and lacking experience and having strong karmic propensities/momentum... the remedy would be to prolong and sustain non-conceptuality.</p>
              <p>Practice this in daily lives but also very important to find time to meditate. And stop talking and thinking so much. LOL</p>
              <p><br><br>Also, to have an initial direct experience of Buddha Nature is the most important and precious, the first step. Only then can we begin to understand the teachings by experience, otherwise all the knowledge we acquire about our true nature, we can't truly relate to them... so what use is there. Nevertheless, an initial awakening still does not contain all the insights yet. Our Buddha-Nature could be mistaken as "I AM". And the teachings can still remain a mystery or an intellectual/conceptual understanding (such as emptiness and non-duality) and may even be misunderstood.</p>

              <p><strong>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly
                                                                                                                                                        understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of

Otherwise it becomes a hindrance, "shuo zhi zhang". We need to pause all conceptualising processes.<br><br>An initial awakening to presence can occur only when there is NO thoughts, not a single thought arising. That is a momentary, total suspension of thinking, but yet being fully awake and present. Then one may realise one's real 'identity'/true 'face' [which is the no-face awareness before your parents gave birth to you] as an all-pervading presence; it is not induced through meditation but naturally revealed -- like the sun or the clear blue sky (our buddha-nature) that has always been shining and clear and boundless but obscured by the clouds (our thoughts and concepts), but now it is as if every fleck of cloud had been wiped from the vast sky and it is finally revealed. The shining sun or the vast sky is always present and not induced but simply revealed.</p>
              <p>Hence achieving total non-conceptuality is vital. This cannot be achieved by force or suppression, but by letting go and following a correct method of practice, one can gradually arrive at it.</p>
              <p>But, later it will be realised and experienced that the clouds floating in the vast open sky never obscures the clarity of the shining sun or the boundlessness and freedom of the sky, and even later it is realised that the clouds and the sky are inseparable from the beginning... the cloud is the sky.</p>
              <p>But even then, non-attachment to thoughts is still important.</p>

              <p>I know what you talking about here, because I had a moment of
                                          complete clarity a few day ago.<br> <br> I saw that all there really is is awareness.<br> <br> Just awareness.<br> <br> Everything else is just stories.<br> <br> It was a wonderful liberating insight.<br> <br> I recognized what was being said by Nathan Gill, when he said that
                                          all words are not "it". And have nothing to do with "it".<br> <br> Unless you have the insight, the experience yourself, it is quite
                                          useless to talk about it.<br> <br> So I encourage everyone to go after the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insight</span> and stop spending so
                                          much time with words.</p>

              <p>It all sounds difficult and complicated when explained in words (but go listen to Buddha's teachings, he's wise and makes it all so simple for us!), but reality is actually the simple Isness, undeniable, immediate Presence of this moment... in which all is complete and nothing can be added or subtracted.</p>
              <p>But then dualistic thought says, "if it's so simple I don't have to learn dharma teachings anymore right!"</p>
              <p>Nope. We still have to learn dharma teachings 'of secondary meaning', in the simple Isness, immediacy of this moment.</p>
              <p>Learning dharma teachings is a condition for the arising of insight. (though it is NOT the only condition, but the first of the 8 fold path, to have Right Views)</p>
              <p>Without right action, without right mental development which includes mindfulness, concentration (and going beyond conceptual grasping)... insights cannot arise.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is founded on the reality of dependent origination, and all his teachings is completely consistent with the reality of Depedent Origination and Emptiness.</p>
              <p>Buddha completely understands the conditions that leads to the perpetuation/cycle of samsara, and the conditions that leads to insights and liberation.</p>
              <p>Even though all is happening in the simple Isness, undeniable, immediate Presence of this moment.</p>

                                                                                                  this: "This assembly of great elephants and dragons gather to hear

                                                                                                  Nowadays they just do this as a sort of ritual, so they chant the

                                                                                                  of first meaning is ineffable, so they chant: "The dragons and

              <p>Hi rokkie, meditation is important but we should also understand that grounding in reality in daily activities and remaining still, undistracted, calm, and aware is equally important. Even after we have some meditation experience we have to bring it to our daily lives, otherwise there will be a gap and separation between meditation and living. We have to learn how to fully engage in activities and yet be fully authenticated with Reality. This gap is not easy to bridge especially prior to certain levels of insights and experience but we should do our best.</p>
              <p>Also, on the other hand, it is possible to have certain experience (of non-duality, or of I AM/Eternal Witness) and extend the experience/practice to daily living, but this does not mean we can forgo sitting meditation. Some practitioners with certain realisation (of what I mentioned above) thought they can forego meditation, but they are mistaken. Because sitting meditation allows us to experience certain aspects that cannot be experienced by daily living practice alone... for us to progress. Hence, both are equally needed.</p>
              <p>I have pasted an article, written by my local dharma teacher many years ago on practicing in movement. Hope it helps.</p>
              <p>But do note that we should discipline ourselves and find time to sit and meditate, in fact my local dharma teacher started to meditate at least 1 hour <strong>without fail</strong> everyday (or more) after my taiwanese teacher emphasized the importance of it... of course, he equally emphasize practicing in daily lives and said there should be no gap and separation between movement and stillness.</p>
              <p>For us, after my Taiwanese Teacher comes to Singapore and <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: normal;">ä¼ æ³•, we are advised to meditate at least 1/2 hour a day or more. My Taiwanese teacher would make his students sit more than 1 hour with him. He himself sits, if I remember... something like 4 or 6 hours everyday, because he has now moved into his dharma center and has much time to himself. He is a lay person, though.</span></span></p>
              <p>I remember our moderator Thusness told me years back that after his retirement (this or next year) he want to have at least 4 hours a day to meditate. He even thought of retreating to somewhere in China (some mountains? lol) for a period of time... Oh and he's only 40... but he has a stable financial status... not to say so much in public! LOL.</p>

              <p>This is our moderator Thusness's views about sudden awakening.</p>
              <p><strong>The occurence for the first few glimpses of our nature is
                                              commonly refered to as 'sudden', like flashes of lightnings because
                                              these insights into our nature are out of the conventional routine
                                              dualistic views.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But for these glimpses to occur, it is a long
                                              process.</span>  After dissolving to certain degree the 'sense of self', 'sudden' will become irrelevant.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Zen school utilizes koans to lead to a sudden awakening. But you still have to practice it for some time before you realise the truth.</p>
              <p>There is no one who can make you enlightened in one day -- unless you are of high capacity. If things were that easy, everyone will be enlightened by now. So don't think fantasies, practice hard.</p>
              <p>It's not the dharma that is the problem, it's YOUR problem... your 'gen qi' is not there :) Even if you meet a Zen master who teaches you the sudden path, it will not 'click'... until you have prepared a lifetime's practice for that very moment.</p>
              <p>Some masters however, they can become enlightened very fast. Their 'gen qi' is there. My Taiwanese teacher became enlightened 4 days after meeting my Master, because he has practiced and followed my Master for many lifetimes, including in the immediate past life he was my Master's successor and abbot of a Zen temple in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
              <p>BTW, my Taiwanese teacher teaches the sudden method. But ours is 'Dun4 Chao1', not 'Dun4 Wu4'.</p>
              <p>He said if meet the right person, he will be enlightened on the spot... and there are such persons. But how many have the 'gen qi' these days? Very few. I have been transmitted the dharma, but I'm not yet enlightened.</p>
              <p>But this should not be a let down, but should turn into a strength, because you know that if you practice what is taught, the goal can surely be achieved.</p>
              <p>But here's an advise: if you meet someone you're confident is a Ming2 Shi1 (one who is enlightened)... follow him and practice hard.</p>
              <p>Also what you mean by "æœºé”‹æ£’å–�"</p>

              <p><br>Conceptuality! wah u just gave me the opportunity to say something i have thought of saying yesterday... but condition wasn't there for me to post. So right now, condition arise. yuan qi :) thanks.. hehe.. you seem to know what i want to say, or maybe I just misunderstood what you meant ;)</p>
              <p>Like the flower in the mirror or the moon on water, it's illusory yet a perfect vivid manifestation of luminous clarity. Emptiness teaching doesn't ask us change or avoid the vision of the moon, but to see the moon with clarity without the illusion that there is a moon located inside or outside the water, or a flower located inside or outside the mirror. There is simply a pure dependently originated reflection, empty of inherent existence and location.</p>
              <p>But if you think that apart from the appearances there is an ultimate truth to be found, some kind of ultimate/absolute view of "Emptiness" that is "the ultimate", you are misled. Teaching of emptiness simply points, and dissolves all our views of inherency, leaving nothing to be found... not even emptiness...</p>
              <p>It's like saying that the 'redness' of flower is illusory. There is no inherent redness or flowerness (e.g. dogs don't perceive colours) But there is also no separate reality called 'emptiness'. Basically it's just saying the flower is not real (has no external/objective reality), but without establishing emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth. <strong>Emptiness is also empty.</strong> So ultimately no views can grasp emptiness!</p>
              <p>Nevertheless vision of red flower continue to appear vividly according to conditions -- inseparably luminous and empty -- illusory divine appearances, empty yet complete and perfect as it is, spontaneously appearing according to conditions.</p>
              <p><strong>Hence ultimately no establishment of views are required, the viewless view is simply emptiness happening.</strong></p>
              <p>Hence you can see that the teachings of emptiness is only a skillful expedient means, deconstructing and destroying all our dualistic views and views of inherency, without establishing anything (some kind of 'ultimate truth' that can be arrived at)... nothing left but the perfect, complete, luminous-empty-appearance appearing naturally and spontaneously according to conditions.<br><br>However having said so much, even an intellectual understanding of emptiness through understanding the teachings is important prior to the insight/direct experience of emptiness, in that it prevents false views from arising and counters some of our dualistic assumptions so that we'll be on the right path. If one holds onto false views of self, eternalism, etc.. or any dualistic or inherent views... true experience cannot arise.<br><br>Also with false views, a sincere practitioner though he practices hard can get stuck in certain stage for a long time, even after having certain vivid experience of Presence... for example one may be stuck in the I AM/Eternal Witness stage... maybe 20 years or his entire life. Partly because there is no right views. In this case having right views can really help him develop further insights into the nature of presence. Our moderator Longchen is an example, as he was stuck in the I AM stage for many years... our moderator Thusness also, prior to encountering Buddhism. But Longchen was able to progress, after Thusness introduced him to the nature of non-duality and emptiness.</p>
              <p>In a rather recent advise to Longchen, Thusness said <strong>"In Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate ourselves non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of Emptiness. It is a raft but it is the antidote for the conventional mind to orientate itself in a non-dual and non-local context. It also led to the amazing insight that ‘duality’ is really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’ (You may want to the take up the challenge of re-engaging in thoughts penetrating this viewless view of Emptiness and thoroughly understand how this affect us into seeing things dualistically )."</strong></p>
              <p>This has provided Longchen with the condition to realise Emptiness about a week back... this couldn't have happened without the teachings of Buddha or Thusness pointing out the subtleties to him. So understanding Buddhist teachings is important.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately sometimes, there are some practitioners (not referring to anyone in particular) who are too attached to non-conceptuality [and may have the skewed thought that sustaining thoughtless awareness is important while words and teachings are useless] and refuses to look into the teachings of Buddha and understand them, or thinks he understood but actually misunderstood them.</p>
              <p>They may prefer to simply remain non-conceptual and in naked awareness... but nevertheless he fails to see the subtle karmic propensity and momentum at work distorting his experience and forming subtle views. <strong>It is so subtle that the practitioner can't see it himself by his own wisdom</strong>, so the teachings by Buddha [with his omniscience and skillful means] will definitely help, and is actually necessary factor to give rise to insights. That is why proper understanding of Dharma teachings is important also -- it is an important factor to give rise to true insights.</p>
              <p>Like Thusness said, <strong>"It is not uncommon to find practitioners totally giving up this attempt to synchronize "views" and experience and conclude that it is an absolute futile endeavor to do that. They prefer to rest fully in naked awareness.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><br>By doing so, the practitioner will miss something valuable -- the insight of the importance of "non inherent existence".</span>"</strong></p>
              <p>That, you can't realise it by yourself without the help/teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha... unless you're a Pratyekabuddha, one who realised dependent origination/emptiness by himself without the teachings by another Buddha.... but it's said that a Pratyekabuddha can only exist in an era without Buddhadharma. ;) And furthermore, a Pratyekabuddha has trained under previous Buddhas and Buddha-sassana... just that when enlightenment occurred in that lifetime, it occurred at a time without other Buddhas or Buddhadharma.</p>
              <p>Anyway I guess, for the people I just mentioned (attached to non-conceptuality but missed the essence), the remedy is for them to let go of their clinging to non-conceptuality. And get him to have proper understanding of the teachings.</p>
              <p><em><strong>To know the pathless, see words and wordlessness as one.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Non-conceptuality is just the beginning, it is far from the totality of our marvelous nature's manifestation. Use words and engage in speeches, dirty your hands and walk on!</strong></em></p>
              <p>Milarepa said: <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Conceptual thoughts are in nature great awareness.</span></strong></p>
              <p>[great awareness here referring to the pristine awareness of our true nature]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But we're talking about practitioners with transcendental experiences, how is it relevant to beginners? Why should we bother.</p>
              <p>Thusness:<br><strong><br>Knowing this, right and firm establishment of view of the dharma seals is most crucial. Through diligent practice of mindfulness and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">together with the right views from start will help to prevent unnecessary pitfalls</span>. Any transcendental experiences and insights that occurred during our journey will then be correctly understood. The experiences will in turn re-enforce our understanding instead of misleading us into the sense of 'Self' and further strengthen the bond.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and btw, in case you forgotten, Right View is the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st of the 8 Fold Path</span></strong> to enlightenment.</p>
              <p><br>But in the end for all practitioners there is nothing to be understood, nothing to be grasped, teachings are there only to clarify and destroy our dualistic views and views of inherency, to point us to and allow the revelation of the nature of mind, our true nature/buddha nature, an unfabricated reality that is empty and ungraspable by thought and concepts.</p>
              <p>It is an insight, a quantum shift in perception, not a conceptual understanding. I believe this is what is known as the 'Right View Without Taint'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway for people like me who are too intellectual and conceptual and lacking experience and having strong karmic propensities/momentum... the remedy would be to prolong and sustain non-conceptuality.</p>
              <p>Practice this in daily lives but also very important to find time to meditate. And stop talking and thinking so much. LOL</p>
              <p><br><br>Also, to have an initial direct experience of Buddha Nature is the most important and precious, the first step. Only then can we begin to understand the teachings by experience, otherwise all the knowledge we acquire about our true nature, we can't truly relate to them... so what use is there. Nevertheless, an initial awakening still does not contain all the insights yet. Our Buddha-Nature could be mistaken as "I AM". And the teachings can still remain a mystery or an intellectual/conceptual understanding (such as emptiness and non-duality) and may even be misunderstood.</p>
              <p><strong>Thusness:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Of all teachings, no teaching is more important than a direct ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness as antidote.</strong><br><br><br>But first, what is important is that any and all intellectual grasping, "knowledge" and the mind's desire and "need" to know, and all apparent "confusions", needs to go as well. Otherwise it becomes a hindrance, "shuo zhi zhang". We need to pause all conceptualising processes.<br><br>An initial awakening to presence can occur only when there is NO thoughts, not a single thought arising. That is a momentary, total suspension of thinking, but yet being fully awake and present. Then one may realise one's real 'identity'/true 'face' [which is the no-face awareness before your parents gave birth to you] as an all-pervading presence; it is not induced through meditation but naturally revealed -- like the sun or the clear blue sky (our buddha-nature) that has always been shining and clear and boundless but obscured by the clouds (our thoughts and concepts), but now it is as if every fleck of cloud had been wiped from the vast sky and it is finally revealed. The shining sun or the vast sky is always present and not induced but simply revealed.</p>
              <p>Hence achieving total non-conceptuality is vital. This cannot be achieved by force or suppression, but by letting go and following a correct method of practice, one can gradually arrive at it.</p>
              <p>But, later it will be realised and experienced that the clouds floating in the vast open sky never obscures the clarity of the shining sun or the boundlessness and freedom of the sky, and even later it is realised that the clouds and the sky are inseparable from the beginning... the cloud is the sky.</p>
              <p>But even then, non-attachment to thoughts is still important.</p>

              <p>I have no time to reply right everything now, will do later. But the statement of military force isn't true.</p>
              <p>Buddha has made rules to prevent people in military from renouncing as monk.</p>
              <p>Also, the Buddha recommends the kings to have a powerful military force for defence, saying that it is one of the factors for a successful nation. He personally gave a list of advises for the kings to lead a successful country, so don't think that he doesn't care about the welfare of state.</p>
              <p>But, he is against using military for aggressive purpose.</p>
              <p>BTW, military service in Singapore is compulsory. I'll be serving 2 years national service in 2 years time.</p>
              <p>Even though non-(aggressive)violence is emphasized, Buddhism is not a sissy pacifist religion ;)</p>

              <p>mahayana is not the same as "talk without practice". In fact, it is the spirit of mahayana that ensured the continuity of buddhism in china and entire eastern asia.<br>There was no India during the invasion from middle east, there are only many small kingdoms. So the issue is not soft of strong. A hard country that pays too much attention on military development will have no money in long term.<br>China is spared from this ill fate because there is a ç§¦å§‹çš‡ that unite the country and most importantly å­”å­�that unite the culture.<br>King Asoka unite India as a country but not as a culture that's why India only unite for a short while then breaks apart.<br>Same religion buddhism end up having 2 different development in the 2 countries.

              is important ,but some times ,fall into meditation criteria
              only,someone critisize that,seems meditation(æ‰“å��) is the only way to
              awaken,seems that who can meditate longer who claim to be superior,make

              </div>
              <p>Hi
              rokkie, meditation is important but we should also understand that
              grounding in reality in daily activities and remaining still,
              undistracted, calm, and aware is equally important. Even after we have
              some meditation experience we have to bring it to our daily lives,
              otherwise there will be a gap and separation between meditation and
              living. We have to learn how to fully engage in activities and yet be
              fully authenticated with Reality. This gap is not easy to bridge
              especially prior to certain levels of insights and experience but we
              should do our best.</p>
              <p>Also, on the other hand, it is possible
              to have certain experience (of non-duality, or of I AM/Eternal Witness)
              and extend the experience/practice to daily living, but this does not
              mean we can forgo sitting meditation. Some practitioners with certain
              realisation (of what I mentioned above) thought they can forego
              meditation, but they are mistaken. Because sitting meditation allows us
              to experience certain aspects that cannot be experienced by daily
              living practice alone... for us to progress. Hence, both are equally
              needed.</p>
              <p>I have pasted an article, written by my local dharma teacher many years ago on practicing in movement. Hope it helps.</p>
              <p>But
              do note that we should discipline ourselves and find time to sit and
              meditate, in fact my local dharma teacher started to meditate at least
              1 hour <strong>without fail</strong> everyday (or more) after my taiwanese
              teacher emphasized the importance of it... of course, he equally
              emphasize practicing in daily lives and said there should be no gap and
              separation between movement and stillness. And he often said that the
              bodhisattva has no time to sit around (fully engages in activities
              selfless service for sentient beings)... but yet he still sits many
              hours a day <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> Of course he doesn't mean literally that bodhisattvas cannot meditate, but that we must equally practice in daily living.</p>
              <p>For us, after my Taiwanese Teacher comes to Singapore and<span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-size: normal;">ä¼ 
              æ³•, we are advised to meditate at least 1/2 hour a day or more. My
              Taiwanese teacher would make his students sit more than 1 hour with
              him. He himself sits, if I remember... something like 4 or 6 hours
              everyday, because he has now moved into his dharma center and has much
              time to himself. He is a lay person, though.</span></span></p>
              <p>Our
              moderator longchen recently left his job and increased his meditation
              hours. This provided the conditions that gave rise to his recent new
              and deepening experiences and insights.</p>
              <p>I remember our
              moderator Thusness told me years back that after his retirement (this
              or next year) he want to have at least 4 hours a day to meditate. He
              even thought of retreating to somewhere in China (some mountains? lol)
              for a period of time...</p>
              <p><strong>But do also take note that after the awakening of non-duality is stabilized, meditation takes secondary role and
              is not seen as a means to enter a stage of experience -- because
              non-duality is the ever-present nature of reality, not a stage. There
              is no entry and exit. Nevertheless, it is still 'healthy' to meditate
              -- just like exercising is healthy for the body, but still we don't
              need to become super muscle builders. The Buddha, even after attaining
              full enlightenment, still spends some time each day meditating.</strong></p>
              <p>Anyway
              back to Thusness... he's only 40... but he has a stable financial
              status... can't reveal so much in public! LOL. I think he is like
              Vimalakirti ;) That's why you seldom see him post here, he's always so
              busy. Fully engaged in activities yet non-dual! So non-dual certainly
              isn't just experienced in meditation :)</p>
              <p>(p.s. Vimalakirti: <em>a bodhisattva of the highest order, on par with such figures as
                                  Manjushri, who, in order to develop living beings, lives as a layman in
                                  the crowded metropolis of Vaishali, participating in business and
                                  government and teaching the dharma in accordance with conditions.</em>)</p>

              <p>And I certainly agree with Display Name that 'mahayana is not the same as "talk without practice".'</p>
              <p>I wonder how much more wrong can such a view be! (that mahayana is talk without practice) Where on earth did one get such an idea?? lol</p>
              <p>And if you understand what I wrote above (click Show), you'll have a glimpse of what Mahayana practice is like.</p>
              <p>BUT... only my conceptual understanding... I'm not a Bodhisattva, you have to be a Bodhisattva to really know!</p>

              <p>Just start with 20 minutes. Or 30 minutes. As you get comfortable and start to like meditation, you can lengthen the time naturally and easily.</p>
              <p>When you experience the great effects of meditation, you will start to like it. People do meditation partly because it's fun. Of course, it is much more than that! The ultimate purpose is to derive fundamental insights, both on the ultimate and relative level.</p>
              <p>But get proper instructions.</p>

              <p>This is our moderator Thusness's views about sudden awakening.</p>
              <p><strong>The occurence for the first few glimpses of our nature is commonly refered to as 'sudden', like flashes of lightnings because these insights into our nature are out of the conventional routine dualistic views.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But for these glimpses to occur, it is a long process.</span>  After dissolving to certain degree the 'sense of self', 'sudden' will become irrelevant.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Zen school utilizes koans to lead to a sudden awakening. But you still have to practice it for some time before you realise the truth.</p>
              <p>There is no one who can make you enlightened in one day -- unless you are of high capacity. If things were that easy, everyone will be enlightened by now. So don't think fantasies, practice hard.</p>
              <p>It's not the dharma that is the problem, it's YOUR problem... your 'gen qi' is not there :) Even if you meet a Zen master who teaches you the sudden path, it will not 'click'... until you have prepared a lifetime's practice for that very moment.</p>
              <p>Some masters however, they can become enlightened very fast. Their 'gen qi' is there. My Taiwanese teacher became enlightened 4 days after meeting my Master, because he has practiced and followed my Master for many lifetimes, including in the immediate past life he was my Master's successor and abbot of a Zen temple in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
              <p>BTW, my Taiwanese teacher teaches the sudden method. But ours is 'Dun4 Chao1', not 'Dun4 Wu4'.</p>
              <p>He said if meet the right person, he will be enlightened on the spot... and there are such persons. But how many have the 'gen qi' these days? Very few. I have been transmitted the dharma, but I'm not yet enlightened.</p>
              <p>But this should not be a let down, but should turn into a strength, because you know that if you practice what is taught, the goal can surely be achieved.</p>
              <p>But here's an advise: if you meet someone you're confident is a Ming2 Shi1 (one who is enlightened)... follow him and practice hard.</p>
              <p>Also what you mean by "æœºé”‹æ£’å–�"</p>

              <p>I have no time to reply right everything now, will do later. But the statement of military force isn't true.</p>
              <p>Buddha has made rules to prevent people in military from renouncing as monk.</p>
              <p>Also, the Buddha recommends the kings to have a powerful military force for defence, saying that it is one of the factors for a successful nation. He personally gave a list of advises for the kings to lead a successful country, so don't think that he doesn't care about the welfare of state.</p>
              <p>But, he is against using military for aggressive purpose.</p>
              <p>BTW, military service in Singapore is compulsory. I'll be serving 2 years national service in 2 years time.</p>
              <p>Even though non-(aggressive)violence is emphasized, Buddhism is not a sissy pacifist religion ;)</p>

              <p>Some hindus always think that way, but they fail to see that buddhism and hindusm teaching are so....much different.</p>
              <p>mahayana is not the same as "talk without practice". In fact, it is the spirit of mahayana that ensured the continuity of buddhism in china and entire eastern asia.<br>There was no India during the invasion from middle east, there are only many small kingdoms. So the issue is not soft of strong. A hard country that pays too much attention on military development will have no money in long term.<br>China is spared from this ill fate because there is a ç§¦å§‹çš‡ that unite the country and most importantly å­”å­�that unite the culture.<br>King Asoka unite India as a country but not as a culture that's why India only unite for a short while then breaks apart.<br>Same religion buddhism end up having 2 different development in the 2 countries. So, it is not the buddhism teaching that cause the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't see much difference between "original buddhism" and "mahayana buddhism" other than the culture and custom.<br>One as a buddhist should understand dharma is about ways to purify our minds and make us more compassionate and wise. What food to eat, use fork or chopstick, where to sleep is something that is not the core of dharma and can change from culture to culture.<br>Kuanyin is a maha bodhisatva that can manifest in anyform, not just female or male, he can even manifest as a wrathful deity depends on the needs of the sentient beings.<br>When there is any doubt on dharma, we can always refer to the sutra and the 4 dharma seals. If you can't understand the ancient language, then ask your dharma teacher.</p>

              <p>Of course buddhism and hinduism are different ,because they are totally difference religions ,hindusim worship shiva,vinshnu.buddhism worship buddha,But they have a lot connections.</p>
              <p>thx for letting me know the history of india ,i appreciate it.</p>
              <p>The core of the buddhism of different sects are similiar,but the path of awaking is different.But u know a lot of buddhist strickly follow their own tradition ,no compromise to others.I think we really need to go beyond the apprearance,but see the core of the different sects are same.So ppl could see beyond it,and follow the ultimate path to awaken easily</p>
