              <p>Moved over from metta lounge 2, just some of my thoughts and understanding and I understand some may find it too long, repetitive and confusing (I'm not a good writer) though I guess sometimes being repetitive and elaborative makes a subject clearer to the reader (like the sutras being repetitive) and those who have no glimpses of awareness/presence/non-duality may find the subject incomprehensible and even 'boring' because it makes no sense (but those who have certain glimpses, which i'm sure most of us interested in spirituality will have had, may recognise some of what is being said...):</p>

              <p>But it should also be noted that all 'stages of experience' are just relative truths, the ultimate reality is like what Zen Master Huang Po always said, that both enlightened and sentient beings are only One Mind, One Reality... and in his usual 'sudden' style he would throw out all ideas of stages of enlightenment, including the 10 Bodhisattva bhumis. I think with correct understanding that is not necessary but there is a very important message behind this. That there is only One Reality/One Mind and it always is! Degrees of clarity are all relative Appearances of What Already Is, all Appearances is the Source, and so to explain some of what Huang Po said, <strong>in my own words and understanding only</strong>... whether you are a sentient being or a Bodhisattva having traversed the ten bhumis, you will only arrive at this One Mind - ever - that which is ever-present and has never left 'you' because it IS You or rather, it is All There Is already, and find that all your efforts in practicing to 'attain' something is all but a dream... you will never arrive at reality or a 'higher reality' because reality is all there Is, already. Everything is already empty and luminous.</p>

                  thousand things come to completion. It is the Way of the emperor to
                  keep moving and to allow no piling up - hence the whole world
                  repairs to his court. It is the Way of the sage to keep moving and
                  to allow no piling up - hence all within the seas bow to him.
                  Comprehending Heaven, conversant with the sage, walker in the six
                  avenues and four frontiers of the Virtue of emperors and kings -
                  the actions of such a man come naturally; dreamily, he never lacks
                  stillness.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><span>The sage is still
                  not because he takes stillness to be good and therefore is still.
                  The ten thousand things are insufficient to distract his mind -
                  that is the reason he is still. Water that is still gives back a
                  clear image of beard and eyebrows; reposing in the water level, it
                  offers a measure to the great carpenter. And if water in stillness
                  possesses such clarity, how much more must pure spirit. The sage's
                  mind in stillness is the mirror of Heaven and earth, the glass of
                  the ten thousand things.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><span>Emptiness,
                  stillness, limpidity, silence, inaction - these are the level of
                  Heaven and earth, the substance of the Way and its Virtue.
                  Therefore the emperor, the king, the sage rest in them. Resting,
                  they may be empty; empty, they may be full; and fullness is
                  completion.1 Empty, they may be still; still, they may move;
                  moving, they may acquire. Still, they may rest in inaction; resting
                  in inaction, they</span></span></p>

                      leaves the confusion and muddle as it is, and looks on slaves as exalted. 
                      Ordinary men strain and struggle; the sage is stupid and blockish. He takes part 
                      in ten thousand ages and achieves simplicity in oneness. For him, all the ten

              <p>Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and
                      fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He
                      didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was,
                      solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi
                      who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was
                      Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some
                      distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr.

                                              'me' that we speak of? You dream you are a bird, and soar to
                                              heaven, or dream you are a fish, and dive into the ocean's depths.

                                              smiles before he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to

              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">But I
                                              have to add, the religion of taoism nowadays is very different.
                                              i.e. religious Taoism. As Longchen said before, "There is some
                                              similarities in the beginning as the Founders expound on certain
                                              fundamental truths.<br> <br> But what the various religions have become is utterly different
                                              now."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">This is
                                              the same for ALL other religions including even Christianity. (the
                                              general Christianity, with exception of certain
                                              contemplative/mystical Christian groups which emphasize on
                                              self-realisation or rather in their terms realising union with god
                                              or ultimate reality)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">With
                                              regards to religious Taoism IMHO there are many elements related to
                                              spirit mediumship etc which imho are best to be avoided... they are
                                              very different from the teachings of lao tzu, unrelated in that
                                              sense... but rather are dealings with spirit realm... and other
                                              related superstitions all brings us no closer to enlightenment and
                                              simply increases superstition, dependency and our affinity with the
                                              spirit/lower realms.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">As my
                                              Master said Taoism starting from Zhang Tian Shi has deviated so
                                              much from the original teachings of Lao Tzu... it is not the 'Tao'
                                              that Lao Tzu is speaking of. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, just my
                                              honest opinion on these matters. :)</p>

              <p>Thanks, interesting. But some forummers may be very against such ideas... (oh, and last year one forummer even complained my comments on lao tzu as being 'enlightened' to my dharma teacher, among a number of other things including my comments on Jesus... lol) so I'll just give it benefit of doubt. So anyway whether Lao Tzu is bodhisattva emanation is not that important, it's the content of his wisdom that matters... and how do we know if he "got substance"? I think in the end we still have to practice sincerely as a Buddhist to see for ourselves, then we'll know what is spoken by experience... no need to convince anyone.</p>
              <p>Whatever my Master (Ven Shen Kai), some other masters or our moderator Thusness have spoken are out of their own experience... when my Master said that Lao Tzu is a Pratyekabuddha he is not making a statement for the purpose of labelling and comparing Lao Tzu with Buddha or anything like that, but he sincerely sees the truth in what is spoken, and my master have commented that Tao Te Ching is a great work of 'qing jing wu wei'. He wouldn't have said anything like that if he didn't see the subtance of the teachings. So anyway, they are not forcing us to believe but just a reference for us to consider... when we have true experience we'll know. But we don't have to follow Tao Te Ching because we're Buddhist, so all these are not that important after all. Being a Buddhist, I have no intentions of promoting Taoism as well.</p>
              <p>In Taoism there's the saying that Lao Tzu went to India to teach Shakyamuni Buddha, which is ridiculous in our eyes... so in the eyes of Taoists it may be the same when we talk about Lao Tzu as this or that... so not to overemphasize anything.</p>

              <p><strong>Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)</strong></p>

You dream you are a bird, and soar to heaven, or dream you are a fish, and dive into the ocean's depths. And you cannot tell whether the man now speaking is awake or in a dream. A man feels a pleasurable sensation before he smiles, and smiles before he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to the sequence of things, forgetting the changes of life, and you shall enter into the pure, the divine, the One."</em></p>

              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">But I have to add, the religion of taoism nowadays is very different. i.e. religious Taoism. As Longchen said before, "There is some similarities in the beginning as the Founders expound on certain fundamental truths.<br><br>But what the various religions have become is utterly different now."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">This is the same for ALL other religions including even Christianity. (the general Christianity, with exception of certain contemplative/mystical Christian groups which emphasize on self-realisation or rather in their terms realising union with god or ultimate reality)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">With regards to religious Taoism IMHO there are many elements related to spirit mediumship etc which imho are best to be avoided... they are very different from the teachings of lao tzu, unrelated in that sense... but rather are dealings with spirit realm... and other related superstitions all brings us no closer to enlightenment and simply increases superstition, dependency and our affinity with the spirit/lower realms.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: arial;">As my Master said Taoism starting from Zhang Tian Shi has deviated so much from the original teachings of Lao Tzu... it is not the 'Tao' that Lao Tzu is speaking of. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, just my honest opinion on these matters. :)</p>

              <p>No, it isn't. Zhuangzi is just thinking conceptually in this case.</p>
              <p>Non-duality is the basis of Reality. Non-duality means that there is no-self. Because that there is no-self, there is just the experience without the experiencer(self). Self is a false impression is that superimposed into the flow of phemomena.</p>
              <p>Non-dual means 'no two thing'. Two things refers to the conventional understanding of 'self'(first thing) experiencing the 'world'(second thing). This self experiencing the world is a false impression (ignorance). Because the 'self' thinks it is a separate thing from the world, it keep trying to modify it(extra arising desire)... to its fulility. This is the basis of suffering.</p>

              <p>No, this is not entirely correct also</p>
              <p>Right in the very beginning, there is no-self. There is no small self that is in the 'Fa Shen' (Dharmakaya).</p>
              <p>There is just the experiences based on conditioned arising.</p>

              <p>Alayavijnana actually designates an impure consciousness, and is the source of samsara through the seeds it contains of affliction and action. It is designated from the point of view of containing the traces of
                                                  action and affliction. When these traces are exhausted, the basis for
                                                  the designation "alaya" is exhausted. Or rather, transformed.</p>
              <p>Transformed to what? It transforms into the great round mirror wisdom, through insight into non-duality. Thusness said in an old post to Longchen at <a href="/forums/1728/topics/225462">Non-dual and karmic patterns</a>, "it is a wisdom that transformed totally the wrong view of phenomena as Ãâout 
                                                      there or in hereÃâ to all as the manifestation of our pristine awareness due its 
                                                      emptiness nature. It is the experience of Dharmakaya." Dharmakaya = Ã¦Â³â¢Ã¨ÂºÂ«</p>
              <p>So not to mistake Ã¦Â³â¢Ã¨ÂºÂ« dualistically as if it is a separate self, such ideas are false. Ã¦Â³â¢Ã¨ÂºÂ« is talking about a Non-Dual reality in which the 'Self' experiencing the 'World' is seen as false, there is only One Reality/One Mind, and it is inseparable from the world in its entirety... usually we think we are the experiencer of the world... but in reality it's more like the universe experiences itself by itself, and "we" are all of that. The "universe" is the 5 skhandas arising or 18 dhatus according to causes and conditions, its true nature is empty and luminous. And our true nature is empty of any separation/self -- Ã¨â¡ÂªÃ¦â¬Â§ is like an ocean, it is all-pervading, omnipresent and boundless.</p>
              <p>This is the meaning of Ã©ï¿½âÃ©ï¿½âÃ§Â¿Â Ã§Â«Â¹Ã¯Â¼ÅÃ¥Â°Â½Ã¦ËÂ¯Ã¦Â³â¢Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¯Â¼âºÃ©Æï¿½Ã©Æï¿½Ã©Â»âÃ¨Å Â±Ã¯Â¼ÅÃ¦âÂ Ã©ï¿½Å¾Ã¨ËÂ¬Ã¨â¹Â¥</p>

              <p>BTW when I said 'universe experience itself by itself'
                  it should not be taken that universe has inherent existence, in fact
                  all are mere appearances due to dependent arising, there is no "the
                  universe" out there... as Longchen would say there is "no solidity"...
                  only sensations and perceptions arising due to conditions, giving rise
                  to appearance of solidity and form and location but are actually just appearances
                  empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, form or location. That is the empty universe.</p>

              <p>Hi Rokkie,</p>
              <p>This is very hard to explain.</p>
              <p>This 'sense of self' or 'I', 'me', 'mine' are concepts learnt.</p>
              <p>With or without the arising sense of an 'I', the experience of perception, sensation and thinking will arising on its own accord. This arising is due to conditions or factors.</p>
              <p>That means it is not the 'I' that is thinking. The thinking is self-arising based on conditions.</p>
              <p>When this insight is seen, a practitioner will not invest too much effort in controlling or modifying what is seen as the world and others. This change in perception will lead to the clearer experience of non-duality.</p>

              <p>Hi Rokkie,</p>
              <p>He he... Thanks for the post. Sorry but i must clarify... this is not entirely true also.</p>
              <p>No-self as an experience of enlightenment is not the same as selflessness in the conventional sense.</p>
              <p>The 'selflessness' is a concept of sacrifice. 'No-self' means the you experience the world without a 'self'. You still can live in a house with property and do all the things conventionally. In fact, outwardly there may be no difference.... except at time, in non-dual, one may stare into blank space (ha ha), especially when the mind comes into a deep rest.</p>

              <p>Hi Rokkie,</p>
              <p>Heh heh... Thanks so much for the post. I gets me to clarify things better.</p>
              <p>So sorry for all the confusion that i have created.</p>
              <p>A person still can be experiencing vivid non-duality (no-self) even when doing things. I can walk, eat and do many things without the sense of a separate self. It is possible.</p>
              <p>When I meants as a blank stare is when mind goes into a deep rest. This is a deeper level of non-duality. Here, the mind cease to register impressions.</p>
              <p>As for alaya, it is not a separate thing. Rather it is the subconscious aspect that is normally not noticed. All the various 'state' are just concepts. There is really no separate state, all are experienced due to conditioned arising. That meants, there is no object anywhere or elsewhere, not even a separate alaya. Alaya is experienced when the conditions arises.</p>
              <p>just a sharing</p>

              <p>Yes, something like that.</p>
              <p>However, what we see is not an illusion.. But the solidity of what appears as object is not solid at all.</p>
              <p>What we experience and even think of as solid is not solid at all. Our mind is used to focus the attention only on certain portion of its experience. This give rise to the false impression of solidity.</p>
              <p>Solidity can mean anything even concept. For example the concept of failure can feel 'solid' when we think it is real and important.</p>

              <p>Alaya Vijnana is not real (i.e. it's empty). Also, Alayavijnana is known as impure and conditioned.</p>
              <p><em>It's called impure because it is the container of traces. When
                          those traces are removed, there is no more alaya-vijanana. There is
                          instead the consciousness of the transformed basis, which is pure.</em></p>
              <p><em>~ Loppon Namdrol</em></p>
              <p>It is the 'storehouse' or tendencies of action and affliction. When this conditioning is removed through the awakening of insight, alaya is transformed into the great round mirror wisdom.</p>
              <p><br><em>Know then that the foundational consciousness and its
                          permeations are reciprocal causes in a similar fashion, for this
                          consciousness is the cause for defiled states and defiled states are
                          the causes for this consciousness. Why is this so? Because no other

              <p>Something about the idea of storage... in Thusness's opinion we
                                                  must get rid of the entire idea of there being a 'place' where
                                                  seeds are being 'stored'. 'Storage' is simply spoken out of
                                                  convention.</p>
              <p>There are always imprints and tendencies, nothing lost. It has
                                                  always been like that. 'Stored' actually means an on going process
                                                  to mean that the tendencies are there. But not to see it as a place

              Maybe unrelated, but just found something by Thusness in an old post... it's about dependent origination and emptiness and related to spontaneous arising.
              
              
              "By the way, over the years I have refined the term "naturalness" into "spontaneously arise due to conditions". When condition is, Presence Is. Not bounded within a space-time continuum. It helps to dissolve the centricity."
              
              
              "Since appearance is all there is and appearance is really the source, what gives rise to the diversities of appearances? ÃâSweetnessÃâ of sugar isnÃât the ÃâbluenessÃâ color of the sky. Same applies to ÃâAMnessÃâÃâ¦Mr. Green all are equally pure, no one state is purer than the other, only condition differs. Conditions are factors that give appearances their ÃâformsÃâ. In Buddhism, pristine awareness and conditions are inseparable.
              
              Although there is non-dual in Advaita and no-self in Buddhism, Advaita rest in an ÃâUltimate BackgroundÃâ (making it dualistic Question ), whereas Buddhism eliminates the background completely and rest in the emptiness nature of phenomena; arising and ceasing is where pristine awareness is. In Buddhism, there is no eternality, only timeless continuity (timeless as in vividness in present moment but change and continue like a wave pattern). There is no changing thing, only change."
