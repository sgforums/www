              <p>Chuang Tzu also talks about letting go of the 'self'/forgetting
              the self [dropping all concepts, sense of personality and
              fundamentally all constriction to the body/mind or the illusory
              sense of a center or a separate observer, experiencer or doer apart
              from observed/experience/deed] and 'surrendering to the sequence of
              things' through non-doing. It is also realising and surrendering to
              the 'force' of spontaneity, self-so, like the Tao/Buddha-Nature or
              the vitality/intelligence/luminous-awareness that allows you to
              move and walk but such action is not done by a 'doer' -- like when
              walking there is just walking without thinking about it or thinking
              "left foot" "right foot" -- everything is just natural, 'non-dual'
              and 'non-volitional' -- it is simply a mere happening. That is
              non-action (wu wei). Its a completely surrendering to whatever
              appears in that moment (a.k.a "the sequence of things") that 'self'
              and 'changes of life' are forgotten, there is no 'continuity of an
              entity', only fingers typing on keyboard, sound arising, the pure
              suchness of transiency. No movement, no coming from, no going to,
              only thus. Completely still yet ever flowing. Thusness just writes
              it perfectly: <em>"<span style="font-family: arial;">In non-dual
              experience, the true face of impermanence nature is experienced as
              happening without movement, change without going anywhere. This is
              the <span style="font-style: italic;">“what is”</span> of
              impermanence. It is just so.</span>"</em> Surrendering into
              nothingness, void of self, and everything is simply 'self-so'.</p>
              <p>Thusness:</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Unmanifested is the
              manifestation,<br> The no-thing of everything,<br> Completely still yet ever flowing,<br> This is the spontaneous arising nature of the source.<br> Simply Self-So.<br> Use self-so to overcome conceptualization.<br> Dwell completely into the incredible realness of the phenomenal
              world.</span></em></p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Chuang Tzu:<em><br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Besides, we all talk of 'me.' How do you know what is this
              'me' that we speak of? You dream you are a bird, and soar to
              heaven, or dream you are a fish, and dive into the ocean's depths.
              And you cannot tell whether the man now speaking is awake or in a
              dream. A man feels a pleasurable sensation before he smiles, and
              smiles before he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to
              the sequence of things, forgetting the changes of life, and you
              shall enter into the pure, the divine, the One."</em><br> ----</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just found another quote by Thusness, so nicely said!</p>
              <p>"http://now-for-you.com/viewtopic.php?t=2470&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=45</p>
              <p>Yes it is and the power of propensities is grossly underestimated. The momentum resulted in creating separation and subtle intentionality. Just don't get too 'stilled'... big 
              grin <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even stillness is movement. Just that movement is effortless and spontaneous. It is the sensation as if nothing is moving due to effortlessness and spontaneity. In 
              essence, everything flows, nothing remains.</strong></span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have glimpses of "forgetting self" and "forgetting changes", surrendering to spontaneity and it's like being the flow without movement or volition. But to forget and 
              surrender into no-self (as in void of self, not refering to the dharma seal) is not that easy, takes practice. The tendency to grasp and abide is strong.</p>

              <p>Hi Rokkie,</p>
              <p>Actually all these words are very clumbersome. And I am not a good explaner.</p>
              <p>The experience is much more direct.</p>
              <p>I invite you to experience no-self and no-solidity for yourself. :)</p>
              <p>To help you break the belief of solidity and the absolute-ness of what we see... you may want to consider about this:</p>
              <p>As human beings we see in term of a range of colour. Other types of mammals see in black and white... they are colour blind. To the animal, 'colour'  never existed at all. Since young, they never see colour.</p>
              <p>To us humans, the grass is green. To the animal, the grass is grey. So, is the human or the animal see the correct grass. Is the grass really green or is it gray? If it is green, is the green-ness belonging to the grass or is it just the colour that is seen by the vision of a human?</p>
              <p>Another thing to consider... There are so many things that we see. All of them are positioned in some place wthin 3D space. What if 'space' is only seen by the eye. And behind the eyesight vision there is no 'space'.</p>
              <p>You play a video game... the game got 3D space. But it is not really 3D space. You are playing the game on a flat screen! Imagine the flat LCD screen is your eye sight vision...</p>

              <p>All teachings by Buddha is an expedient means, but it may not be what you are thinking of. That is, No-Self is not a teaching just so that you can "let go of self"... it is not about letting go of self, but realising the nature of reality that there is No Self all along, already is so... that means the dualistic way we experience, as a separate self, experiencer, doer, observer, is an illusion.</p>
              <p>This is the seal of no-self and can be realized and experienced in all moments; not just a mere concept.</p>
              <p>But it is not a stage of achievement, it is not about "attaining non-attachment" or "dropping ego"... it is the thoroughness of seeing through
                                      the illusionary views of the sense of self, the entire mechanism that
                                      causes the split and the mechanism of how it ‘blinds’.</p>
              <p>Also Taoism may teach no-self but it may have a different meaning, in the case of Chuang Tzu... for Chuang Tzu it is more like forgetting self (wang wo)... he wasn't talking about it as a dharma seal, a characteristic of reality. It is an important practice for us (especially prior to realisation)... but for a non dualist that has gained sufficient stability after <strong>realisation of the pathless non-dual reality</strong>, practice takes a very different role.</p>
              <p>After knowing the real cause and conditions (the entire mechanism that
                                      causes the split and the mechanism of how it ‘blinds’), a non-dualist
                              cannot resort back to a dualistic approach towards liberation and
                              practice and meditation take very different roles. It becomes instant,
                              dynamic, spontaneous and direct.</p>
              <p>No-Self is seen as not a stage to enter, but is an ever-present nature of reality. All along, thought thinks, sound hears, scenery sees, there is no separate seer, hearer, thinker, doer, etc. The realisation of this is enlightenment.</p>
              <p>p.s. I have explained this in the first post but it was kinda long and the way I wrote maybe difficult to understand so thanks for letting me clarify this again.</p>

                                          conceptual/non-conceptuality for the thinking mind to realize the
                                          possibility of going pre-symbolic thereby loosening its stubborn
                                          grips of a dualistic framework.</p>
              <p><br> Sustained bare attention also gave rise to the realization that
                                          ‘inner’, ‘outer’, ‘space’, ‘time’ and even ‘body’ and ‘mind’ are
                                          all mere constructs. Freeing from these constructs, also give rise
                                          to the condition for non-dual insight to arise.<br> For the first 3 stages, practice takes the form of striving towards
                                          a certain stage of perfection whereas stages 4 onwards, practice
                                          moves from ‘efforting’ to natural luminosity and spontaneity."</p>

              <p>Alaya Vijnana is just a designation refering to the storehouse of afflictions and actions/karma producing delusory defiled states of our mind, the only way to deal with it is to transform it with insight/awakening so that it transform into the great round mirror wisdom. When the traces are exhausted, there is no more 'alayavijnana'.</p>
              <p>Alaya Vijnana is not 'real', it is really just name, a
                                                  designation, a convention refering to the tendencies of afflictions
                                                  and action giving rise to delusory state of consciousness --
                                                  <em>this consciousness is the cause for defiled states and defiled
                                                  states are the causes for this consciousness.</em>,
              our tendencies of affliction and action. Our karmic seeds/momentum
              [i.e. of our 8th consciousness] which 'contains' all our ignorance
              gives rise to our delusory, 'defiled' samsaric vision, and the
              samsaric, dualistic delusory vision perpetuates our
              action/karma/affliction [i.e. of our 8th consciousness]. It's like an
              endless cycle. But insight allows us to break this chain by realising
              the non-dual, empty nature of reality.</p>
              <p>But, whether we experience samsaric vision or pure vision, all along the nature of reality/all phenomena is empty-luminous.</p>
              <p>BTW transforming Alaya Vijnana is nothing to do with being smart, spiritual realisation is not about becoming smart... as I have posted before, the stupid monk Chunda attained enlightenment, liberation also... even though he was low IQ.</p>
              <p>And btw, it is truly possible for people to 'jump out of samsara'... I personally know of a number of people, both inside and outside the forum who have achieved the 'goal' of liberation, others are close (enlightened, but not reached the end of the journey yet). :)</p>
              <p>Knowing this possibility, plus our opportunity to practice dharma and attain human birth is so rare... we should take this opportunity seriously, and like the Buddha said we should "practice like our hair's on fire", because such is our condition and this endless cycle of samsara is just full of suffering.</p>

              <p>However, there is a timeless state of pure rest. When the mind cease to register anything , it rest in the present moment. The present moment is timeless.</p>
              <p>Before having any transcendent experience, the typical human mind never can keep still in the present moment at all. The timeless present moment experience or rather non-experience is profound.</p>

                      <p>&lt;&lt; I've just read 'The end of time' by Julian Barbour which presents a
                      fairly convincing theory that time is just an illusion and really the universe
                      is just made up of infinite seperate 'instants', or different configurations of
                      the Universe. Has anyone else read it and if so what do you think the
                      implications are on Buddhism and the mind. The theory has got me quite depressed
                      and so I would appreciate any replies.</p>
                      <p>Remmy&gt;&gt;</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>I haven't read it, but I just saw an ad for it in the new issue of <em>Science
                      News</em> and decided to browse the web for more info. As for time being illusory
                      and the universe being nothing but a series of separate "instants,"
                      like frames in a movie, that's basically correct. Everything we call "the
                      past" is, literally, <em>nothing</em> but present memories. Likewise,
                      everything we call "the future" is <em>nothing</em> but present memories
                      <em>inverted</em>, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The
                      appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the <em>Avatamsaka
                      Sutra</em> (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for
                      yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and
                      "the future." You will discover that it is <em>nothing but thoughts</em>--nothing
                      but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's
                      "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time.
                      There is really only <em>Now</em>--an eternally present Present with no beginning
                      and no ending. Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every
                      instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all. The
                      mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot
                      step in the same river twice."</p>
                      <p>Zen Buddhism, in particular, stresses this very significant insight. Here's
                      the Sixth Patriarch, Ch'an Master Hui-neng:</p>
                      <p>"In this moment there is nothing that comes to be. In this moment there
                      is nothing that ceases to be. Thus there is no birth-and-death to be brought to
                      an end. Thus the absolute peace in this present moment. Though it is at this
                      moment, there is no limit to this moment, and herein lies eternal delight."</p>
                      <p>Zen Master Seung Sahn elaborated on this topic in his excellent book <em>The
                      Compass of Zen</em> (p. 143):</p>
                      <blockquote> <blockquote>
                      <p>"Everyone thinks that this is extremely difficult teaching,
                          something beyond their reach or experience. How can things appear and
                          disappear, and yet there is, originally, even in this constantly moving
                          world, no appearing and disappearing? A student once asked me, 'The <em>Mahaparinirvana-sutra</em> seems very confusing. Everything is always moving. And yet everything is not
                          moving? I don't understand this Buddhism . . .' But there is a very easy way
                          to understand this: Sometime you go to a movie. You see an action movie
                          about a good man and a bad man--lots of fighting, cars moving very fast, and
                          explosions all over the place. Everything is always moving very quickly. Our
                          daily lives have this quality: everything is constantly moving, coming and
                          going, nonstop. It seems like there is no stillness-place. But this movie is
                          really only a very long strip of film. In one second, there are something
                          like fourteen frames. Each frame is a separate piece of action. But in each
                          frame, nothing is moving. Everything is completely still. Each frame, one by
                          one, is a complete picture. In each frame, nothing ever comes or goes, or
                          appears or disappears. Each frame is complete stillness. The film projector
                          moves the frames very quickly, and all of these frames run past the lens
                          very fast, so the action on-screen seems to happen nonstop. There is no
                          break in the movement of things. But actually when you take this strip of
                          film and hold it up to the light with your hands, there is nothing moving at
                          all. Each frame is complete. Each moment is completely not-moving action.</p>
                      <p>"Our minds and the whole universe are like that. This world is
                          impermanent. Everything is always changing, changing, changing, moving,
                          moving, moving, nonstop. Even one second of our lives seems full of so much
                          movement and change in this world that we see. But your mind--right <em>now</em>--is
                          like a lens whose shutter speed is one divided by infinite time. We call
                          that moment-mind. If you attain that mind, then this whole world's movement
                          stops. From moment to moment you can see this world completely stop. Stop.
                          Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Like the film, you perceive every frame--<em>this</em> moment--which is infinitely still and complete. In the frame, nothing is
                          moving. There is no time, and nothing appears or disappears in that box. But
                          this movie projector--your <em>thinking</em> mind--is always moving, around
                          and around and around, so you experience this world as constantly moving and
                          you constantly experience change, which is impermanence. You lose
                          moment-mind by following your conceptual thinking, believing that it is
                          real."</p>
                      </blockquote> </blockquote>
                      <p>When you transcend your thinking mind in the realization of your own pure,
                      timeless, ever-present Awareness, then the illusion of time completely
                      collapses, and you become utterly Free of the samsaric cycle of time, change,
                      impermanence, and suffering. This, my friend, is nothing at all to be
                      "depressed" about! Rather, the fact that your own Buddha Mind exists <em>beyond</em> time, in THIS very moment, is itself the key to your permanent and <em>eternal</em> (timeless) Liberation.</p>

                      <p>"To no longer resist the present is to see that there is nothing but the
                      present--no beginning, no end, nothing behind it, nothing in front of it. When
                      the past of memory and the future of anticipation are both seen to be present
                      facts, then the slats to this present collapse. The boundaries <em>around</em> this moment fall <em>into</em> this moment, and then there is nothing but this

                      <p>&lt;&lt; Thanks for all that info Soulplex, I found it very helpful. There's
                      just a couple of things I'm not too clear on. If I've missed the point somewhere
                      please tell me. When you used the movie analogy, do you mean we see the whole of
                      our lives at once which is 'played as a movie' to us so that the impression of
                      impermenance and change appears, so that in effect impermenance does exist for
                      someone who hasn't attained Nirvana? Or am I frozen in time? The latter scares
                      me quite a bit - is there still a ten year old version of me in frozen agony
                      after falling out of a tree? Or are only fully enlightened people 'frozen'
                      contentedly in time?</p>
                      <p>Remmy &gt;&gt;</p>
                      <p>Okay, that's a good question, and I'll try to answer it as clearly as
                      possible. First, impermanence does indeed exist for someone still trapped in
                      Samsara (as well as suffering, attachment, death, etc.--all just names for the
                      same condition), but it doesn't exist in Nirvana (and neither does its opposite,
                      "permanence"). Nirvana is beyond the duality of motion and stillness,
                      and the way that's experienced is that you feel that you (Buddha Mind) are <em>absolutely
                      still</em> in the midst of a world of <em>absolute motion</em>, but the two don't
                      feel different or separate. That's the nondual, Mahayana Nirvana, in which the
                      relative dualities of nirvana-and-samsara, life-and-death, subject-and-object,
                      matter-and-consciousness, form-and-spirit are seen to be nondual or
                      "one," an inseparable unity. (In the dualistic, Theravadin, relative
                      nirvana, the two--Buddha Mind and the world of form--are felt to be different
                      and separate, which is why the Mahayana criticizes the Theravadin view as
                      limited and incomplete.)</p>
                      <p>Let me break that down a bit: The whole world of form (samsara) is totally
                      full of various degrees of motion and movement, so that even its
                      "stillness" isn't <em>absolutely</em> still. It's only relatively
                      still--relative to other movements, like the "stillness" you feel now
                      sitting on a chair, even though you're zipping through space on a planetary body
                      at thousands of miles per hour. The world of formlessness (nirvana), on the
                      contrary, <em>is</em> absolutely still and tranquil, with no relative movement <em>or</em> relative stillness at all. So you have the relative world of relative
                      stillness-and-motion (samsara), on the one hand, and the absolute world of
                      absolute Stillness (nirvana), on the other. In the realization of nondual,
                      Mahayana Enlightenment, these two worlds (relative samsara and relative nirvana,
                      or relative form and relative emptiness) merge into a perfect Unity of Absolute
                      Emptiness or Absolute Nirvana, and then there is <em>neither</em> motion nor
                      stillness, or you can say that there is <em>both</em> of them together (as I
                      explained in the first paragraph), or you can say neither of those and give the
                      logically precise answer: silence. The <em>Madhyamika Shastra</em> (XV.3) put it
                      best:</p>
                      <blockquote> <blockquote>
                      <p>"It cannot be called void or not void,<br> Or both or neither;<br> But in order to point it out,<br> It is called ï¿½the Void.ï¿½ "</p>
                      </blockquote> </blockquote>
                      <p>As for the filmstrip analogy . . . Yes, you do experience the whole of your
                      life as "played at once," but all that really means is that your life
                      only happens <em>right now</em>, always in this single, eternal context called Now
                      (which is really just another name for the Absolute or Buddha Mind). The
                      "now" when the Big Bang happened, the "now" when Gautama
                      Buddha died, the "now" when you were born into this life, and the
                      "now" when you'll be reading these words--these are <em>one and the
                      same moment</em>, the same motionless Now.</p>
                      <p>You can picture this "Now"--which is your own Buddha Mind, your own
                      natural Awareness--as a vast blue sky, and the world of time and change is just
                      a little tiny cloud passing within it. The "Now" is eternal and still;
                      it never changes or moves, since it is the infinite clearing or space in which
                      all change and movement happens. The cloud arises, the cloud stays a bit, and
                      the cloud goes, but the vast empty sky remains untouched by it.</p>
                      <p>This is exactly how your present experience is: you are the vast empty sky
                      and this whole universe is a tiny cloud within you. Through the blinding power
                      of innate ignorance, however, you have forgotten your true nature as the
                      motionless sky and mistakenly identified yourself as the ever-changing cloud (or
                      a small part of the cloud). A Theravadin-level enlightenment will reverse this
                      mistake by showing you that you are really the empty sky, and a Mahayanin,
                      nondual Enlightenment will show you that the sky and the cloud are not separate
                      or different. The cloud arises out of, and within, the sky, and is ultimately
                      made of "sky essence," so to speak. (It's the same as the old
                      "mirror" analogy: your mind is perfectly clear mirror, and the world
                      is reflected in it. You first must discover that you are the mirror and become
                      free of the reflections; then you must discover that the reflections are not
                      separate from the mirror. At that point you become Free <em>as</em> the Absolute
                      Unity of mirror-and-reflections together.)</p>
                      <p>Now, to use the movie analogy, imagine that Awareness is a movie screen and
                      this world of form is a projected display of light that appears on the screen.
                      The frames appear on the screen, one at a time, in rapid succession, and the
                      screen contains each of them as they appear. One frame of light appears on the
                      screen, stays a fraction of a second, and disappears--and the screen only
                      reflects one frame at a time.</p>
                      <p>Now here's where the analogy gets complicated (and where you got confused):
                      The movie screen and filmstrip reel all occur <em>in time</em>; Awareness and the
                      appearance of the world, however, are the genesis of time. There's really no
                      "reel" or "strip" of film appearing on the screen all at
                      once, but rather a single frame every instant, with each instantly replacing the
                      previous one--even though its the same motionless screen they all appear on. So
                      when you become identified with the screen (Awareness), you don't experience
                      every single frame that ever appeared on the screen--they've all long since
                      disappeared back into the nothingness from which they sprang. No, what you
                      experience is the realization that <em>this very screen</em> is the same screen
                      that has been reflecting frames of movie light since the beginning of the movie
                      itself (and that the screen, naturally, also exists before and after the movie).
                      You become identified with Awareness--which is completely beyond time--and you
                      realize that it is eternal, that it is ever-present, that it has no beginning
                      and no end, that it is the same "Now" in which <em>all</em> experiences
                      have previously come and gone, presently come and go, and will in the future
                      come and go, eternally so.</p>
                      <p>And then, if you break through to complete, nondual Enlightenment, you
                      discover that the frames of movie light ARE the screen--that the two aren't
                      separate, or even essentially different in any way--and then you see that <em>there
                      is only Now</em>, only the screen-and-present-frame Unity, and so whatever frame
                      happens to be present <em>is the only frame there is</em>. "Past" and
                      "future" are revealed to be mental fantasies--<em>present</em> mental
                      fantasies--and the only reality is always the present reality, with no real
                      "frames" existing anyway before or after it. So there's no frame
                      somewhere of a ten-year-old version of you falling out of a tree; that's only a
                      memory now, and that's <em>all</em> it is. It exists nowhere but in your mind.
                      (For this analogy we've done away with the projection booth, the projector, the
                      reel of film, the viewer of the movie, etc.) That's what Zen Master Seung Sahn
                      meant by his "you see the whole world stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. . .
                      ." When there is really ONLY the present moment, the present frame, then
                      that's all you can see. And the present frame is always completely motionless,
                      even though the frames give an illusion of sequential continuity (and your
                      conceptual mind superimposes an illusion of movement and change). Enlightened
                      people don't live "'frozen' contentedly in time," as you suggested,
                      but rather <em>fluid</em> and alive <em>beyond</em> the illusion of time altogether!</p>
                      <p>There's nothing extraordinary about this. In fact, whether you feel you're
                      Enlightened or not, you're experiencing it right now (when else could you
                      experience it? when else could you experience <em>anything?)</em>. Right now, as
                      you sit here reading these words, the whole world is completely motionless,
                      completely new, and completely silent. Nothing is changing. Nothing is moving.
                      Nothing is happening at all. In fact, <em>nothing has EVER happened!</em> Not now,
                      and therefore not ever. The world is totally silent, and everything is at peace.</p>
                      <p>And yet--how can this be? It seems absurd, doesn't it? You can move your
                      hands and arms around, perhaps you can crank up some loud rock music to drown
                      out the supposed "silence," and it all seems perfectly obvious that
                      things are happening, things are changing. But look a little closer. Hold your
                      hand in front of you. Now clench your hand into a fist. Now release the fist and
                      move your fingers around. It certainly <em>appeared</em> as though the hand were
                      moving, didn't it? But we're not interested in appearances, here; we want the
                      reality. And the reality of your hand-moving experiment is that <em>it was a
                      completely different hand every instant</em>, even when "you" weren't
                      moving it!</p>
                      <p>On the surface, maybe this seems obvious: electrons in the hand were spinning
                      at the speed of light; blood was flowing through the veins and capillaries;
                      neurotransmitters were zipping instructions across the synapses, thereby
                      engaging muscles to move. Lots of things about your supposedly static
                      "hand" were changing. Of course, people can brush this off and say,
                      "Yeah, okay, but it's still the same hand, even if it changes
                      constantly." But take it even further: <em>Were</em> electrons really
                      spinning, causing that subtle change in your "hand" every fraction of
                      a nanosecond? Weren't the electrons themselves <em>also changing</em>, with quarks
                      spinning and such, so that, going all the way down, to the level of universal
                      gravitational influences or quantum nonlocality, <em>everything</em> even remotely
                      related to your hand was changing? This leads to a rather shaky image of your
                      outwardly static "hand," but perhaps we can solidify it somewhat if we
                      analyze exactly what we mean by "change."</p>
                      <p>Basically, change means a transformation of some kind, of a single phenomenon
                      transforming into a different arrangement of that same phenomenon. But are there
                      any single phenomena? Didn't we just show, with the example of the quantum hand,
                      that everything is interconnected, somehow affecting everything else in some
                      manner, no matter how subtly? And, even if there are distinct and separate
                      phenomena, do any of them actually <em>change?</em></p>
                      <p>Take that same hand, for example. If we didn't have the mental concept
                      "hand," how would we describe it? If we could see that the phenomenon
                      is actually <em>completely new</em> and <em>distinct</em> every instant, with no
                      static mental symbol (to say nothing of memories) to hold the distinct
                      appearances together, would we perceive these new and distinct appearances as a
                      changing phenomenon? With no concepts and no memories superimposed on the world,
                      does anything really change? Are there even any separate "things" that
                      <em>could</em> change? Isn't it all really just one seamless display--like, say, a
                      movie frame--of a completely new and distinct universe, arising and disappearing
                      in an <em>infinitely</em> rapid succession? (With a shutter speed of "one
                      divided by infinite time," as Zen Master Seung Sahn says.)</p>
                      <p>"A man cannot step in the same river twice," said the Greek mystic
                      Heraclitus, and the secret of life, the universe, and everything is contained in
                      that simple statement.</p>

                      <p>p.s. Here are some quotes that may clear up any lingering confusion:</p>
                      <blockquote> <blockquote>
                      <p>"This is not unchanging, yet it is not moving. It has never been
                          void; there is no question of inside or outside, no separation of absolute
                          and relative. Realize that this is your own original face: even if it
                          appears as ordinary or holy, even if it divides into objective and
                          subjective experiences, all comes and goes completely within it, all arises
                          and vanishes herein. It is like the water of the ocean making waves; though
                          they rise again and again, never is any water added. It is also like waves
                          dying away; though they die out and vanish, not a drop is lost."</p>
                      <p>--Zen Master Keizan, <em>Transmission of Light</em></p>
                      <p>"The life of a sentient being is a long dream. Existence only
                          appears to be real. When one finally awakens, or attains Buddhahood,
                          existence is seen for what it is--a sequence of illusions. Until that time,
                          people will remain obsessed by the body, mind, and external phenomena, not
                          realizing that they are illusory. You will live in a dream, thinking that it
                          is reality. . . .</p>
                      <p>"Sentient beings mistakenly view their moment-to-moment illusory
                          existence as a continuous, connected lifetime. Because they are unaware that
                          their life is unreal, they do not attempt to wake up."<br> <br> --Chï¿½an Master Sheng-yen, <em>Complete Enlightenment</em>, pp. 108-109</p>
                      <p>"If you are attached to your thinking, then everything has name and
                          form. This is the world of opposites. But name and form are always changing,
                          changing, changing. Because of this, everything is impermanent. Everything
                          is like a dream, is like dew, is like a bubble or a flash of lightning.
                          Nothing stays but is always in a process of change. Rather than being some
                          constant, fixed reality, this whole universe constantly appears and
                          disappears. But there is a way to experience the true nature of this
                          constantly changing universe. Simply do not become attached to any outside
                          world. Donï¿½t become attached to names and forms. If you keep that point,
                          then your mind is not moving. You attain that names and forms are
                          fundamentally empty. This whole universe is completely empty. You are
                          completely empty. Nothing ever comes or goes. Nothing ever appears or
                          disappears. When you keep this mind, you soon attain your true self."<br> <br> --Zen Master Seung Sahn, <em>The Compass of Zen</em>, pp. 127-129</p>
                      <p>"It is like a cinema-show. There is the light on the screen and the
                          shadows flitting across it impress the audience as the enactment of some
                          piece. If in the same play an audience also is shown on the screen as part
                          of the performance, the seer and the seen will then both be on the screen.
                          Apply it to yourself. You are the screen, the Self has created the ego, the
                          ego has its accretions of thoughts which are displayed as the world, the
                          trees and the plants. . . . In reality, all these are nothing but the Self.
                          If you see the Self, the same will be found to be all, everywhere and
                          always. Nothing but the Self exists."<br> <br> --Sri Ramana Maharshi</p>
                      <p>"To talk about the world as being made by God tomorrow or yesterday,
                          would be talking nonsense. God makes the world and all things in this
                          present now."<br> <br> --Meister Eckhart</p>
                      <p>"Waking up from the dream means realizing that nothing ever
                          happened. With Enlightenment there is no history. It has been burned out of
                          existence. Time itself has been destroyed."<br> <br> --Andrew Cohen</p>
                      <p>"It is like an image reflected in a mirror, it is seen but it is not
                          real; the One Mind is seen as a duality by the ignorant when it is reflected
                          in the mirror constructed by their memory. . . . The existence of the entire
                          universe is due to memory that has been accumulated since the beginningless
                          past but wrongly interpreted."<br> <br> --<em>The Lankavatara Sutra</em></p>
                      <p>"Just understand that things do not originate of themselves. All of
                          them come into existence from your own single mental impulse of imagination
                          mistakenly clinging to appearances.</p>
                      <p>"If you know that mind and objects fundamentally do not contact each
                          other, you will be set free on the spot. Everything is in a state of
                          quiescence right where it is; this very place is the site of
                          enlightenment."<br> <br> --Zen Master Pai-chang</p>
                      <p>"There is nothing to overcome and nothing to prepare forï¿½you cannot
                          prepare for where you already are.</p>
                      <p>"If you believe that some process in time will gradually release you
                          from the illusion of samsara, then you are in a very secure position. But if
                          you realize that the idea of time <em>is</em> the illusion of samsara then the
                          whole business is finished up very quickly. As long as there is any
                          investment in the future, you are a hundred billion miles away from
                          home."<br> <br> --Andrew Cohen, <em>Enlightenment is a Secret</em></p>
                      <p>"There is only now. Everything we call the ï¿½pastï¿½ is absolutely
                          nothing but present memory. Everything we call the ï¿½futureï¿½ is
                          absolutely nothing but fantasy and commentary, that is, <em>present memory
                          rearranged</em>. If we continue to pretend that there is some other time or
                          place to be, besides right here, right now, we are cruelly and
                          pathologically deluding ourselves."<br> <br> --Scott Morrison, <em>There Is Only Now</em></p>
                      <p>"Beginningless time and the present moment are the same. . . . You
                          have only to understand that time has no real existence."<br> <br> --Zen Master Huang Po</p>
                      <p>"Eternity is not, and cannot, be found tomorrow--it is not found in
                          five minutes--it is not found in two seconds. It is always already Now. The
                          present is the only reality. There is no other."<br> <br> --Ken Wilber, <em>No Boundary</em></p>
                      <p>"All temporal succession coincides in one and the same Eternal Now.
                          So there is nothing past or future."<br> <br> --Nicolas de Cusa</p>
                      <p>"If you want to know what eternity means, it is no further than this
                          very moment. If you fail to catch it in this present moment, you will not
                          get it, however many times you are reborn in hundreds of thousands of
                          eons."<br> <br> --Zen Master Seppo</p>
                      <p>"You examine the face of heaven and earth, but you have not come to
                          know the one who is in your presence, and you do not know how to examine the
                          present moment."<br> <br> --Jesus Christ, <em>The Gospel of Thomas</em>, saying 91</p>
                      <p>"The idea of time is only in your mind. It is not in the Self. There
                          is no time for the Self. Time arises as an idea after the ego arises. But
                          you are the Self beyond time and space; you exist even in the absence of
                          time and space."<br> <br> --Sri Ramana Maharshi</p>

              <p>Zen Master Seung Sahn:</p>
              <p>"Our minds and the whole universe are like that. This world is
                                                  impermanent. Everything is always changing, changing, changing,
                                                  moving, moving, moving, nonstop. Even one second of our lives seems
                                                  full of so much movement and change in this world that we see. But
                                                  your mind--right <em>now</em>--is like a lens whose shutter speed
                                                  is one divided by infinite time. We call that moment-mind. If you
                                                  attain that mind, then this whole world's movement stops. From
                                                  moment to moment you can see this world completely stop. Stop.
                                                  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Like the film, you perceive every
                                                  frame--<em>this</em> moment--which is infinitely still and
                                                  complete. In the frame, nothing is moving. There is no time, and
                                                  nothing appears or disappears in that box. But this movie
                                                  projector--your <em>thinking</em> mind--is always moving, around
                                                  and around and around, so you experience this world as constantly
                                                  moving and you constantly experience change, which is impermanence.
                                                  You lose moment-mind by following your conceptual thinking,
                                                  believing that it is real."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wow... now I think I can better grasp this. In the past when I read this I didn't really understand... but when there is glimpses through practice we can understand intuitively. (to realise and experience this all the time is another matter, though, but luckily time is an illusion... lol)</p>

              <p>Alaya Vijnana is just the delusory defiled states of our mind, the only way to deal with it is to transform it with insight/awakening so that it transform into the great round mirror wisdom.</p>
              <p>Alaya Vijnana is not 'real', it is really our delusory state of consciousness -- <em>this consciousness is the cause for defiled states and defiled states are the causes for this consciousness.</em>, our tendencies of affliction and action. Our karmic seeds/momentum gives rise to our samsaric vision. But, all are empty and mere appearances.</p>
              <p>BTW transforming Alaya Vijnana is nothing to do with being smart, spiritual realisation is not about becoming smart... as I have posted before, the stupid monk Chunda attained enlightenment, liberation also... even though he was low IQ.</p>
              <p>And btw, it is truly possible for people to 'jump out of samsara'... I personally know of a number of people, both inside and outside the forum who have achieved the 'goal' of liberation, others are close (enlightened, but not reached the end of the journey yet). :)</p>
              <p>Knowing this possibility, plus our opportunity to practice dharma and attain human birth is so rare... we should take this opportunity seriously, and like the Buddha said we should "practice like our hair's on fire", because such is our condition and this endless cycle of samsara is just full of suffering.</p>

              <p><br>just now i type a lot line ,but dispear.</p>
              <p>My experience show me the alaya ,vijjinana is ture,as some lecturer said u got to feel it ,then testify the teaching,i have read a lot taosim text,and i found a lot coincide with buddhism,both emphasize on empty ,nil,no self.But in china,most of ppl would not accept buddhism totally ,because in essence ,buddhism carry same core as christianity ,æ— çˆ¶æ— æ¯�ï¼Œit can not be accepted by mainstream of chinese culture,although ,after buddhism arrived in china ,some part have been amended.Some monk in southern part could marry,buddhism come into china,and form the buddhism with chinese flavour.</p>
              <p>the word i used smart ,really is a projection into secular world of wisdom,i mean wisdom,after i practice Taoism or buddhism ,mainly Taoism as foundation.I become smart and mature,that's the benefit i get from ancient culture.If i didnt' touch the real truth of buddhism ,it's because the cause and condition is not yet,and i am doinng well now.So i don't really hurry into this buddhism experience.</p>

              <p>Yes it is and the power of propensities is grossly underestimated. The momentum resulted in creating separation and subtle intentionality. Just don't get too 'stilled'... big grin <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even stillness is movement. Just that movement is effortless and spontaneous. It is the sensation as if nothing is moving due to effortlessness and spontaneity. In essence, everything flows, nothing remains.</strong></span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have glimpses of "forgetting self" and "forgetting changes", surrendering to spontaneity and it's like being the flow without movement or volition. But to forget and surrender into no-self (as in void of self, not refering to the dharma seal) is not that easy, takes practice. The tendency to grasp and abide is strong.</p>

              <p>Alaya Vijnana is just a designation refering to the storehouse

                                                                  of our mind, the only way to deal with it is to transform it with

              <p>Alaya Vijnana is not 'real', it is really just name, a
                                                                  designation, a convention refering to the tendencies of afflictions

                          our tendencies of affliction and action. Our karmic seeds/momentum
                          [i.e. of our 8th consciousness] which 'contains' all our ignorance
                          gives rise to our delusory, 'defiled' samsaric vision, and the
                          samsaric, dualistic delusory vision perpetuates our
                          action/karma/affliction [i.e. of our 8th consciousness]. It's like an
                          endless cycle. But insight allows us to break this chain by realising
                          the non-dual, empty nature of reality.</p>
              <p>But, whether experiencing samsaric vision or pure vision, all along the nature of reality/all phenomena is empty-luminous.</p>

              <p><br> just now i type a lot line ,but dispear.</p>
              <p>My experience show me the alaya ,vijjinana is ture,as some
                      lecturer said u got to feel it ,then testify the teaching,i have
                      read a lot taosim text,and i found a lot coincide with
                      buddhism,both emphasize on empty ,nil,no self.But in china,most of
                      ppl would not accept buddhism totally ,because in essence ,buddhism
                      carry same core as christianity ,æ— çˆ¶æ— æ¯�ï¼Œit can not be accepted by
                      mainstream of chinese culture,although ,after buddhism arrived in
                      china ,some part have been amended.Some monk in southern part could
                      marry,buddhism come into china,and form the buddhism with chinese
                      flavour.</p>
              <p>the word i used smart ,really is a projection into secular world
                      of wisdom,i mean wisdom,after i practice Taoism or buddhism ,mainly
                      Taoism as foundation.I become smart and mature,that's the benefit i
                      get from ancient culture.If i didnt' touch the real truth of
                      buddhism ,it's because the cause and condition is not yet,and i am
                      doinng well now.So i don't really hurry into this buddhism
                      experience.</p>

              <p>Confucius teaching I think is good, but never had much reading of it yet.</p>
              <p>But the Middle Way that Nagarjuna is talking about here is a different matter...</p>
              <p>The Middle Way is the viewless view of Emptiness, beyond all extremes and conceptual notions of existence, non-existence, both, neither, eternity, nihilism and so on. Basically any dualistic, inherent views are 'extremes'.</p>
              <p>Sinweiy posted in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/291164">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/291164</a>:</p>
              <p>See ok...found this...<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">...dependent origination as an
                                      expression of the Middle Way. During one of our earlier lectures,
                                      we had occasion to refer to the Middle Way, and on that occasion we
                                      confined ourselves to only perhaps the most basic meaning. We have
                                      said that the Middle Way means avoiding the extreme of indulgence
                                      in pleasures of the senses and the extreme of self-mortification.
                                      In that context the Middle Way is synonymous with moderation. Now
                                      in the context of dependent origination, the Middle Way has another
                                      meaning which is related to the earlier meaning but deeper. In this
                                      context the Middle Way means avoiding the extremes of eternalism
                                      and nihilism. How is this so? The flame in the oil lamp exists
                                      dependent upon the oil and the wick. When either of these are
                                      absent, the flame will be extinguished. Therefore, the flame is
                                      neither permanent nor independent. Similarly, this personality of
                                      ours depends upon a combination of conditions - defilements and
                                      actions. It is neither permanent nor independent. Recognizing the
                                      conditioned nature of our personality, we avoid the extreme of
                                      eternalism, of affirming the existence of an independent, permanent
                                      self. Alternatively, recognizing that this personality, this life
                                      does not arise through accident, or mere chance, but is instead
                                      conditioned by corresponding causes, we avoid the extreme of
                                      nihilism, the extreme of denying the relation between action and
                                      consequence. While nihilism is the primary cause of rebirth in
                                      states of woe and is to be rejected, eternalism too is not
                                      conducive to liberation. One who clings to the extreme of
                                      eternalism will perform wholesome actions and will be reborn in
                                      states of happiness, as a human being or even as a god, but he will
                                      never attain liberation. Through avoiding these two extremes,
                                      through understanding the Middle Way, we can achieve happiness in
                                      this life and in the future life by performing wholesome actions
                                      and avoiding unwholesome actions, and eventually we can achieve
                                      liberation.</span><br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm</a><br> <br> /\</p>

              <p>BTW I agree regarding Alaya Vijnana, you said "My experience show me the alaya ,vijjinana is ture,as some
                                                                                        lecturer said u got to feel it ,then testify the teaching,"</p>
              <p>This is very true :) Alaya vijnana is empty but emptiness has nothing to do with the nihilistic view of non-existence. It's like saying Mind, Alaya, and everything has no location (i.e. empty), you can't find it... like what is taught in Chapter 1 of Shurangama Sutra or the encounter with Bodhidharma that led to 2nd Patriarch's awakening (Bodhidharma asked 2nd Patriarch to show him his Mind, 2nd Patriarch couldn't find it, and was awakened).</p>
              <p>But you can't say Mind or propensities 'doesn't exist'! You can't deny the Presence of Mind and all its manifestation including our Alaya. It's only the wrong view of location and 'entities' that is the problem, nothing is experientially denied.</p>
              <p>What is important is to <strong>fully experience</strong> our 8th consciousness but without forming concepts of entity, location, existence over it. As Thusness said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Propensities, Source, Forms, everything
                                      exhibit this Emptiness nature, but it can be
                                      known.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>How? Quiet our minds, be fully aware and sense/experience our momentum and seeds that bond us lifetime after lifetime. Be aware of the workings of our 8th consciousness. <strong>Not just to testify the teaching, it is actually important for our liberation and awakening.</strong></p>
              <p>Both our moderators Thusness and Longchen said very similar things from their own personal experiences:</p>
              <p>Thusness:</p>

              <p><br>..."The third thing is to know about the power of the momentum. Now,
                                              the momentum will seem to react very fast only when your mind is
                                              really not focused, when your mind is chattering, when your mind is
                                              very busy. Your momentum will seem to be very fast. But when you
                                              are able to settle your thoughts and see in raw, the momentum seems
                                              to be very slow. They arise slowly, and then you can see that they
                                              subside. This means that the speed of arising and subsiding becomes
                                              very slow. Ok, only when you are able to see this momentum, you'll
                                              know what "oh, I made this decision and this way of perception
                                              because this momentum is reacting". Then, the condition is present
                                              for you to see what reality is all about. Otherwise, reality will
                                              always be mistaken as perception, or as an objective world, or as
                                              an Eternal Witness. Do you all get what I mean?"</p>

              <p>Yes, I too feel that meditation is very important.</p>
              <p>IMO, it is almost impossible to make any progress without meditation.</p>
              <p>You know, in Dzogchen, the practice is said to be no meditation involved. However, those accomplished practitioners must have been great meditators before. Is just that we do not get to see them do it so often in the current life.</p>
              <p>Also, ... the followings are just my pure opinion with no affiliation to any buddhist teaching.... so please read with discernment...</p>
              <p>The grips and control of unconscious and subconscious karmic pattern is extremely strong and incredibly numerous. Without meditation, this tendencies are almost 100% controlling the behaviour of a person. It is that strong.</p>
              <p>Also, the events that happen in your life are 'controlled' by the subconscious impulses that are 'held' very deeply into the consciousness. You can call this the karma effects.</p>
              <p>That is why dreams can be used to foretell events that are about to happen. In the dream state, the physical 'realm' is momentarily suspended to allow for a different type of conditions to arise... in this case the dream state. The dream state is a symbolic representation of the karmic and intention imprints and tendencies that are held within the deepest subsconscious. This deepest subconscious should be the same as the alaya consciousness.</p>
              <p>What happen is that the dream plays a story with all the karmic influences symbolically represented. These karmic influences are actually about to surface and manifest soon... that is why they manifest as dreams first. Next, within a few weeks or months, the karma consequence manifest in the 'physical realm'.</p>
              <p>From my understanding and experience, the deepest subconscious (alaya consciousness?) is not accessible without meditation. In the deepest subconscious is 'held' the original state of the 'imprints' and 'intentions'. The deepest subconscious with its pure imprints can actually be very different from the manifested personality. The 'reasons' for the rebirth are also felt in that realm.</p>
              <p>just my opinion only.</p>
              <p>PS: when i use the word 'realm' please understand that it is not any place elsewhere. It is mainly for easy explanation.</p>
