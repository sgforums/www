              <p>The Question: "You comment that Awareness or consciousness
               is                         simply observing the various arisings...as 
              though there are two                         things:  one called 
              Awareness or consciousness and the other                         called 
              arisings. Why would you posit such a dualistic notion in an             
                          effort to share the wisdom of non-dual experience?"</p>
              <p>Here is Rupert's answer, worth the time to 
              completely                         digest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This
               is said to one who                         believes him or herself to 
              be a person, located in and as the body,                         looking
               out at a world of objects that are considered to have an               
                        existence that is separate from and independent of their being
                                       known.<br> <br> The terms in which such a person expresses his or her 
              question                         (that is, the belief in a separate 
              entity, separate bodies, objects                         made of matter,
                a world that has independent existence etc.)                         
              are granted provisional credibility in order that we may proceed        
                               from what, at least appears to this person, seem to be 
              the facts of                         the current experience.<br> <br> In other words we start with the
               conventional formulation that ‘I,’                         inside the 
              body, am looking out at an objective and independent                    
                   world of objects. This is a position of dualism, that is, ‘I,’ the 
                                      body (the subject) am experiencing the world, 
              objects and others                         (the object).<br> <br> From here our attention is drawn to 
              the fact that the body                         (sensations) and the mind
               (thoughts and images) are in fact                         experienced 
              in exactly the same way as the world (perceptions). In                  
                     other words, the body/mind is not the subject of experience and 
              the                         world the object of experience, but rather 
              the body/mind/world are                         all objects of 
              experience.<br> <br> We then 
              ask what it is that experiences the body/mind/world. What               
                        is it that is referred to as ‘I?’ It is obviously not the     
                                  body/mind, because at this stage the body/mind has 
              been seen to be                         the experienced rather than the 
              experiencer.<br> <br> What 
              then can we say about this perceiving ‘I?’ It cannot have any           
                            objective qualities because any such qualities would, by  
                                     definition, be objects and therefore experienced.
               However, it is                         undeniably present and it is 
              undeniable conscious or aware or                         knowing. For 
              this reason ‘I’ is sometimes referred to as                         
              Consciousness, Awareness or Knowing Presence.<br> <br> At this stage the Knowing Presence that I know 
              myself to be (that                         is, that knows itself to be) 
              is conceived of as being ‘nothing,’                         ‘empty’ or 
              ‘void’ because it has no objective qualities, and could                 
                      be formulated by saying simply, ‘I am nothing.’ It is the 
              position                         of the ‘witness.’<br> <br> This position is still a position of 
              dualism in that there is still                         a subject 
              (Knowing Presence) and an object (the body/mind/world).                 
                      Yet it is one step closer to a truer formulation of an          
                             understanding of the true nature of experience than was 
              the                         previous formulation in which separate 
              entities were considered to                         be existent and 
              real.<br> <br> If we explore 
              this Knowing Presence that we know ourselves to be,                     
                  we discover from direct experience that there is nothing in our     
                                  experience to suggest that it is limited, located, 
              personal, time                         or space-bound, caused by or 
              dependent upon anything other than                         itself.<br> <br> Now we look again at the 
              relationship between Knowing Presence and                         the 
              objects of the body/mind/world: How close is the world to our           
                            knowing of it? How close is the world to ‘experiencing?’<br> <br> We find that there is no
               distance between them. They are, so to                         speak, 
              ‘touching’ one another.<br> <br> Now we can go deeper. What is our experience of the border between   
                                    them, the interface where they meet or touch? If 
              there was such an                         interface, it would be a place
               where Consciousness ended and the                         object began.
               We find no such place.<br> <br> Therefore we can now reformulate our experience based upon our       
                                actual experience, not just theoretical thinking. We 
              can say that                         objects do not just appear TO this 
              Knowing Presence but WITHIN                         it.<br> <br> At this stage Knowing Presence is 
              conceived (based on experience)                         more like a vast
               space in which all the objects of the                         
              body/mind/world are known and experienced to appear and                 
                      disappear.<br> <br> However, it is still a position of dualism, a position in which         
                              this vast knowing space is the subject and the world is 
              the object                         that appears within it.<br> <br> So we again go deeply into the 
              experience of the apparent objects                         of the 
              body/mind/world and see if we can find in them a substance              
                         that is other than the Presence that knows them or the space 
              in                         which they appear.<br> <br> This is a very experiential exploration that 
              involves an intimate                         exploration of sensations 
              and perceptions and which is difficult to                         detail
               with the written word. It is an exploration in which we come           
                            to FEEL not just understand that the body/mind/world is 
              made out of                         the substance that knows them.<br> <br> However, in this 
              formulation there is still a reference to a                         
              body/mind/world, albeit one known by and simultaneously made out of     
                                  Knowing Presence. It is a position in which the 
              body/mind/world                         doesn’t just appear WITHIN 
              Presence but AS Presence.<br> <br> But what is this body/mind/world that is appearing as Presence? We 
                                      explore experience more deeply again and find 
              that it is this very                         Presence itself that takes 
              the shape of the body/mind/world.<br> <br> Knowing Presence takes the shape of thinking and appears as
               the                         mind. It takes the shape of sensing and 
              appears as the body. It                         takes the shape of 
              perceiving and appears as the world, but never                         
              for a moment does it actually become anything other than                
                       itself.<br> <br> At 
              this stage we not only know but FEEL that Presence or                   
                    Consciousness is all there is. It could be formulated as, ‘I,     
                                  Consciousness, am everything.’ At the same time we 
              recognise that                         this has in fact always been the 
              case although it seemed not to be                         known 
              previously.<br> <br> So we 
              have moved from a position in which we thought and felt that            
                           ‘I’ am something (a body/mind) to a position in which we 
              recognised                         our true nature of Knowing and Being 
              (Presence) and which we                         expressed as ‘I, 
              Consciousness, am nothing.’ And we finally come to                      
                 the feeling/understanding that I, Consciousness, am not just the     
                                  witness, the knower or experiencer of all things, 
              but am also                         simultaneously their substance. In 
              other words, ‘I, Consciousness                         am everything.’<br> <br> Even this is to say too 
              much, for what is this ‘everything’ that is                         
              referred to? Language collapses here. Instead of saying                 
                      ‘Consciousness is all,’ we should say just ‘Consciousness is.’ 
              But                         then what is this Consciousness that is 
              being framed....again it is                         to say too much.<br> <br> To summarize we move 
              from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing,’ from                         ‘I
               am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’ and from ‘I am everything to          
                              ‘I,I,I....’<br> <br> We fall silent here.<br> <br> <br> As we abide knowingly as this Knowing 
              Presence we discover that it                         is not a void, an 
              emptiness. Rather it is the fullness of Love. In                        
               other words, Love is the substance of all things.<br> <br> The movement in understanding from ‘I am 
              something’ to ‘I am                         nothing’ could be called the
               Path of Wisdom or                         Discrimination.<br> <br> The movement in understanding from
               ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am                         everything’ could be 
              called the Path of Love.<br> <br> The abidance in/as this Love is simply to abide as the Self that we 
                                      are and that we know ourselves to be. Love is 
              known to be the                         substance of every appearance 
              and to be solely present throughout                         all the 
              apparent stages of its revelation. It is the origin, the                
                       substance and the goal of our enquiry.<br></span></p>

              <p><em>Dear Rupert,</em></p>
              <p><em>The recognition of Consciousness as myself seems to have limited 
              value....However, even if I can continuously watch from this position of
               consciousness as witness, it seems a passive position and a potential 
              source of frustration from being stuck on this single channel (analogy 
              to tv). If I prefer to experience something different, I seemingly have 
              no ability to carry out actions towards this preference, as I'm simply a
               watcher.<br><br>I must be misunderstanding something....I realize that I
               have set-up a new separate entity -- the witness -- "behind" my 
              experience...I acknowledge this, but that's where I seem to be stuck.</em></p>

              <p>Dear James,</p>
              <p>It is not so much a misunderstanding as a partial understanding. You 
              have seen that it is 'I,' Consciousness, that witnesses the mind, body 
              and world, rather than your previous understanding that 'I,' the 
              body/mind, witnesses the world.<br><br>This understanding is, as it 
              were, a half-way house between the belief that we are a body/mind and 
              the experiential understanding that we are unlimited, unlocated Presence
               which is at once the source and substance of all things.<br><br>The 
              watcher that you refer to is still, as you rightly observe, a separate 
              entity. However, such an entity must be on the 'watched,' not the 
              'watching' side of experience, because as an entity it must, by 
              definition, have observable (watchable) characteristics.<br><br>See in 
              this way that whatever it is that is 'watching' cannot by itself have 
              any 'watchable' characteristics. So, once it is clear to you that you 
              are this watching Consciousness see if there is anything in your 
              experience to validate the belief that it is limited or located.<br><br>Take
               any thought, image, sensation or perception and ask yourself if there 
              is any distance between the thought, image, sensation or perception and 
              Consciousness itself. See in this way that all experience is equally 
              intimate. Nothing is any closer or further away from 'that which knows 
              it' than anything else.<br><br>Now go more deeply into every thought, 
              image, sensation or perception and see if you can find any substance 
              there other than Consciousness itself.<br><br>In other words, as we go 
              more deeply into our experience, we find that this watching or knowing 
              Presence that stands, as it were, in the background of all experience 
              is, at the same time, the foreground, the very substance of that 
              experience.<br><br>As the background it is independent, impartial, 
              untouchable, unmovable, unchangeable and indifferent, but as the 
              foreground it is the very substance of experience. As such it is known 
              as love.<br><br>Or we might say that as peace we are the background of 
              experience whilst as love we are the heart of experience.<br><br>As such
               there is no question of being frustrated because of the inability to 
              'change channels.' Such a frustration would require one to imagine 
              oneself as a separate entity that is apart from experience with the 
              potential to change or manipulate it to suit such an entity. <br><br>In 
              the absence of such an entity there is an absence of frustration. 
              However, this doesn't mean that we are simply passive - that would be an
               inverted version of the same. <br><br>Rather everything is seen as an 
              expression of the freedom of the totality, and our self is known as the 
              very substance of that totality, simultaneously the knowing of it, the 
              being of it and the loving of it.<br><br><br>With kind regards,<br><br>Rupert</p>

              <p>Duality is imagination only.  THAT there is a world of things in 
              existence, with "you" only a small, insignificant and limited "part", is
               part and parcel of this dualistic equation.<br> <br> The instant a label is applied, reality is seemingly split up.  We talk 
              about awareness, then the world arises in awareness.  From that 
              platform, awareness is apparently owned, possessed, contained, limited. 
               It's an unresolvable paradox - why is this so?  Because a "thing" 
              cannot BE another "thing".  A "thing" stands apart and IS only a thing 
              BECAUSE it ISN'T another "thing".  In asserting it's "thingness", it 
              must stand alone in space and time.<br> <br> So we have awareness and experience - subjective and objective - and in 
              even calling them as such, their duality is forever solidified.  Their 
              separate reality is seemingly solid and true.  Yet we're still 
              spellbound by words, still caught in the labels, which project reality 
              as separate.  Yes?<br> <br> What is experience?  Sensation.  Perception.  What is awareness?  
              Experienc-ING.  Sens-ING.  Perceiv-ING.  <br> <br> So here is a sensation - breathing.  It's a familiar sensation.  What is
               the relationship of the sensation called "breathing" and the awareness 
              OF that sensation?  Where is that sensation at?  Where is that awareness
               at?  Where does the sensation start and end?  Where does awareness 
              start and end?  Where is the boundary or dividing line between 
              sensation/experience and awareness?<br> <br> Aren't "sensation" and "awareness" two words for the SAME REALITY?  Two 
              words for the same nondual reality?  Two words for "what IS"?  Two words
               which seemingly split up "what IS" into subject and object?  <br> <br> And from there, that "subject" is given a name,  that "object" is given a
               name, and the story is woven.  Separate reality is projected, imagined.
                 <br> <br> The word "object" is just a concept.  There is no such thing.  And 
              without an object, can there be a "subject"?  <br> <br> No.  There is only WHAT IS, and then that is broken up in concepts to 
              create this imaginary story called "My Life".  You're entire life is 
              nothing but this false story, built on the shakiest of platforms.<br> <br> You ARE this nondual reality.  The "real" YOU - IS the totality.</p>
