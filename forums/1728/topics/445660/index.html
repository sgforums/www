              <p>
              </p><p>Another teaching from the same collection recounts the story</p>
              <p>of a wanderer named Baμhiya. He stopped the Buddha on the</p>
              <p>street in Saμvatthiμ and said, “Venerable Sir, you are the Saman|a</p>
              <p>Gotama. Your Dharma is famous throughout the land. Please</p>
              <p>teach me that I may understand the truth.”</p>
              <p>The Buddha replied, “We’re on our alms round, Baμhiya. This is</p>
              <p>not the right time.”</p>
              <p>“Life is uncertain, Venerable Sir. We never know when we are</p>
              <p>going to die; please teach me the Dharma.”</p>
              <p>This dialogue repeats itself three times. Three times over, the</p>
              <p>Buddha says the same thing, and Baμhiya responds in the same</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>way. Finally, the Buddha says, “When a Tathagμ ata is pressed</p>
              <p>three times, he has to answer. Listen carefully, Baμhiya, and</p>
              <p>attend to what I say:</p>
              <p>In the seen, there is only the seen,</p>
              <p>in the heard, there is only the heard,</p>
              <p>in the sensed, there is only the sensed,</p>
              <p>in the cognized, there is only the cognized.</p>
              <p>Thus you should see that</p>
              <p>indeed there is no thing here;</p>
              <p>this, Baμhiya, is how you should train yourself.</p>
              <p>Since, Baμhiya, there is for you</p>
              <p>in the seen, only the seen,</p>
              <p>in the heard, only the heard,</p>
              <p>in the sensed, only the sensed,</p>
              <p>in the cognized, only the cognized,</p>
              <p>and you see that there is no thing here,</p>
              <p>you will therefore see that</p>
              <p>indeed there is no thing there.</p>
              <p>As you see that there is no thing there,</p>
              <p>you will see that</p>
              <p>you are therefore located neither in the world of this,</p>
              <p>nor in the world of that,</p>
              <p>nor in any place</p>
              <p>betwixt the two.</p>
              <p>This alone is the end of suffering.” (ud. 1.10)</p>
              <p>Upon hearing these words, Baμhiya was immediately enlightened.</p>
              <p>Moments later he was killed by a runaway cow. So he was</p>
              <p>right: life is uncertain. Later Baμhiya was awarded the title of</p>
              <p>“The Disciple Who Understood the Teaching Most Quickly.”</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>“Where” Does Not Apply</p>
              <p>What does it mean to say, “There is no thing there”? It is talking</p>
              <p>about the realm of the object; it implies that we recognize that</p>
              <p>“the seen is merely the seen.” That’s it. There are forms, shapes,</p>
              <p>colors, and so forth, but there is no thing there. There is no real</p>
              <p>substance, no solidity, and no self-existent reality. All there is,</p>
              <p>is the quality of experience itself. No more, no less. There is just</p>
              <p>seeing, hearing, feeling, sensing, cognizing. And the mind naming</p>
              <p>it all is also just another experience: “the space of the</p>
              <p>Dharma hall,” “Ajahn Amaro’s voice,” “here is the thought,</p>
              <p>‘Am I understanding this?’ Now another thought, ‘Am I not</p>
              <p>understanding this?’”</p>
              <p>There is what is seen, heard, tasted, and so on, but there is no</p>
              <p>thing-ness, no solid, independent entity that this experience</p>
              <p>refers to.</p>
              <p>As this insight matures, not only do we realize that there is</p>
              <p>no thing “out there,” but we also realize there is no solid thing</p>
              <p>“in here,” no independent and fixed entity that is the experiencer.</p>
              <p>This is talking about the realm of the subject.</p>
              <p>The practice of nonabiding is a process of emptying out the</p>
              <p>objective and subjective domains, truly seeing that both the</p>
              <p>object and subject are intrinsically empty. If we can see that both</p>
              <p>the subjective and objective are empty, if there’s no real “in</p>
              <p>here” or “out there,” where could the feeling of I-ness and meness</p>
              <p>and my-ness locate itself? As the Buddha said to Baμhiya,</p>
              <p>“You will not be able to find your self either in the world of this</p>
              <p>[subject] or in the world of that [object] or anywhere between</p>
              <p>the two.”</p>
              <p>There is a similar and much lengthier exchange between the</p>
              <p>Buddha and AÂnanda in the Shurangama Sutra, which is a text</p>
              <p>much referred to in the Ch’an school of the Chinese tradition.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>For pages and pages the Buddha asks AÂnanda, in multifarious</p>
              <p>ways, if he can define exactly where his mind is. No matter how</p>
              <p>hard he tries, AÂnanda cannot establish it precisely. Eventually</p>
              <p>he is forced to the conclusion that “I cannot find my mind anywhere.”</p>
              <p>But the Buddha says, “Your mind does exist, though,</p>
              <p>doesn’t it?”</p>
              <p>AÂnanda is finally drawn to the conclusion that “where” does</p>
              <p>not apply.</p>
              <p>Aha!</p>
              <p>This is the point that these teachings on nonabiding are trying</p>
              <p>to draw us to. The whole concept and construct of where-ness,</p>
              <p>the act of conceiving ourselves as this individual entity living</p>
              <p>at this spot in space and time, is a presumption. And it’s only by</p>
              <p>frustrating our habitual judgments in this way that we’re forced</p>
              <p>into loosening our grip.</p>
              <p>This view of things pulls the plug, takes the props away, and,</p>
              <p>above all, shakes up our standard frames of reference. This is</p>
              <p>exactly what Ajahn Chah did with people when he asked, “If you</p>
              <p>can’t go forward and you can’t go back and you can’t stand still,</p>
              <p>where can you go?” He was pointing to the place of nonabiding:</p>
              <p>the timeless, selfless quality that is independent of location.</p>
              <p>Interestingly enough, some current scientific research has</p>
              <p>also reached a comparable conclusion about the fundamental</p>
              <p>nature of matter. In the world of quantum physics, scientists</p>
              <p>now use such terms as “the well of being” or “the sea of potential”</p>
              <p>to refer to the primordial level of physical reality from</p>
              <p>which all particles and energies crystallize and into which they</p>
              <p>subsequently dissolve. The principle of non-locality in this realm</p>
              <p>means that the “place where something happens” cannot truly</p>
              <p>be defined, and that a single event can have exactly simultaneous</p>
              <p>effects in (apparently) widely separated places. Particles can</p>
              <p>The Place of Nonabiding</p>
              <p>accurately be described as being smeared out over the entirety of</p>
              <p>time and space.</p>
              <p>Terms like “single place” and “separate places” are seen to</p>
              <p>apply only as convenient fictions at certain levels of scale; at the</p>
              <p>level of the ultimate field, the sea of quantum foam, “place” has</p>
              <p>no real meaning. When you get down into the fine, subatomic</p>
              <p>realm, where-ness simply does not apply. There is no there there.</p>
              <p>Whether this principle is called nonabiding or non-locality, it’s</p>
              <p>both interesting and noteworthy that the same principle applies</p>
              <p>in both the physical and mental realms. For the intellectuals and</p>
              <p>rationalists among us, this parallel is probably very comforting.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>I first started to investigate this type of contemplation when I</p>
              <p>was on a long retreat in our monastery and doing a lot of solitary</p>
              <p>practice. It suddenly occurred to me that even though I might</p>
              <p>have let go of the feeling of self—the feeling of this and that</p>
              <p>and so on—whatever the experience of reality was, it was still</p>
              <p>“here.” There was still here-ness. For several weeks I contemplated</p>
              <p>the question, “Where is here?” Not using the question to</p>
              <p>get a verbal answer, more just to illuminate and aid the abandonment</p>
              <p>of the clinging that was present.</p>
              <p>Recognizing this kind of conditioning is half the job—</p>
              <p>recognizing that, as soon as there is a here-ness, there is a subtle</p>
              <p>presence of a there-ness. Similarly, establishing a “this,” brings</p>
              <p>up a “that.” As soon as we define “inside,” up pops “outside.”</p>
              <p>It’s crucial to acknowledge such subtle feelings of grasping; it</p>
              <p>happens so fast and at so many different layers and levels.</p>
              <p>This simple act of apprehending the experience is shining the</p>
              <p>light of wisdom onto what the heart is grasping. Once the defilements</p>
              <p>are in the spotlight, they get a little nervous and uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>Clinging operates best when we are not looking. When</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>clinging is the focus of our awareness, it can’t function properly.</p>
              <p>In short, clinging can’t cling if there is too much wisdom around.</p>
              <p></p>
