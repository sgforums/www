              <p><strong>“If you believe there is a thing called mind, it is just a 
              thought. If you believe there is no thing called mind, it’s just another
               thought. Your natural state, free of any kind of thought about it—that 
              is buddhanature. Mind is similar to space, in that it is insubstantial, 
              not material. Isn’t it quite amazing that something that is 
              insubstantial is also able to experience?” </strong></p>
              <p>Whatever practice you do, please do so while embracing it
               with the Three Excellences.</p>
              <p>The first is the excellent preparation of bodhichitta 
              [Skt., lit. “awakened heart”]. The bodhisattva resolve is to form the 
              thought, “I will attain complete enlightenment for the sake of all 
              beings.” Engendering that motivation is a superb way to begin one’s 
              practice.<br> This excellent preparation is indispensable for all Buddhist
               practitioners, because we all have had many lifetimes other than this 
              one. The pure vision of the fully enlightened ones sees that we have 
              been through countless lifetimes. In every one of these, we had a father
               and a mother. We have had so many lifetimes that every sentient being, 
              without a single exception, has been our own father and mother. Thus we 
              are connected to all other beings, and to merely wish enlightenment and 
              liberation for ourselves is far too limited. To achieve enlightenment in
               this way would mean abandoning all our parents.</p>
              <p>Please understand that all sentient beings, all our 
              parents, want nothing but happiness. Unfortunately, through their 
              negative actions they only create the causes for further pain and 
              suffering. Take this to heart and consider all our parents, wandering 
              blindly and endlessly through painful samsaric states. When we truly 
              take this to heart, out of compassion we feel motivated to achieve 
              enlightenment to truly help all of them. This compassionate attitude is 
              indispensable as a preparation for practice.</p>
              <p>The excellent preparation also includes the taking of 
              refuge. Do we actually have the ability to genuinely help other beings? 
              Do we have the power, the wisdom, the boundless compassion to do so? At 
              present we don’t. Who does? Only the fully awakened Buddha actually 
              possesses the power to protect others, as well as the pure teachings on 
              how to attain enlightenment. In addition to these two, there are those 
              beings who uphold these teachings in an unbroken lineage. These three, 
              the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, are the only true protection and rescue 
              for unenlightened beings.</p>
              <p>We should regard these Three Precious Ones as our 
              shelter, our refuge and our escort, from now on until complete 
              enlightenment. They embody a reliable and authentic source of 
              protection. To entrust ourselves and place our confidence in the Three 
              Jewels from this point until we ourselves become truly able to benefit 
              others is called “taking refuge.” Together with bodhichitta, taking 
              refuge is the excellent preparation. Taking refuge essentially embodies 
              all hinayana teachings, while all the mahayana teachings are contained 
              within forming the bodhisattva resolve.</p>
              <p>The second of the three excellences is called the 
              “excellent main part beyond concepts.” This has two aspects, development
               stage and completion stage. This excellent main part beyond conceptual 
              focus is a synonym for vajrayana, the vajra vehicle of Secret Mantra.<br> Development stage is usually understood as visualizing the 
              support, which is the buddha field and the celestial palace, and what is
               supported therein—the form of the deity. The palace and deity are 
              considered to be the pure world and pure being. We may think that this 
              is a product of our imagination, but in fact it is an exact replica of 
              the original state of all things. It is how things already are in 
              actuality—also called the great mandala of the manifest ground.</p>
              <p>Thus, visualization is ultimately not a matter of 
              imagining something to be what it isn’t, but rather, of seeing it as it 
              actually is. It is acknowledging things as they already are. This is the
               essential principle of vajrayana. Within this principle is contained 
              both development stage and completion stage.</p>
              <p>Development stage is not like imagining a piece of wood 
              to be gold. No matter how long you imagine that wood is gold, it never 
              truly becomes gold. Rather, it’s like regarding gold as gold: 
              acknowledging or seeing things as they actually are. That is what is 
              meant by training in deity, mantra and samadhi. The body, speech and 
              mind of the deity is contained within the three aspects of vajrayana 
              practice called development, recitation and completion.</p>
              <p>All appearances are the mandala of the deities, all 
              sounds are the mandala of mantra, and all thoughts are the mandala of 
              enlightened mind. The nature of all apparent and existing things—of this
               entire world and all its beings—is the great mandala of the manifest 
              ground, our basic state. These three mandalas are present as our ground.
               The practice of a sadhana is based on manifesting from this ground. 
              Sadhana practice is also based on some very essential principles: that 
              the tantras are contained within the statements, the statements within 
              the oral instructions, and the oral instructions within the application 
              of the sadhana itself.</p>
              <p>Let me rephrase this vital point. In vajrayana, a sadhana
               is the act of manifesting what is originally present in the form of the
               threefold mandalas of deity, mantra and samadhi. When practicing a 
              sadhana, we are not superimposing something artificial atop the natural 
              state of things. Rather, it is a way of acknowledging our original 
              state, in which the nature of all forms is deity, the nature of all 
              sounds is mantra, and the nature of mind is samadhi. This is the basic 
              principle of development stage. And the differences in profundity 
              between the teachings of sutra and tantra lie in how close the teachings
               are to the original nature. The closest, the most direct, are the 
              Vajrayana teachings.</p>
              <p>What are the reasons for the development and completion 
              stages? The profound development stage enables us to attain 
              enlightenment in one lifetime and in one body through deity, mantra and 
              samadhi. And completion stage means that the deity is none other than 
              our originally enlightened buddhanature. Its essence is present as Body,
               its nature radiates as Speech, and its capacity is pervasive as Mind.</p>
              <p>Our originally enlightened essence contains within itself
               the awakened state of all buddhas as the three aspects of vajra body, 
              vajra speech and vajra mind. Training in these three vajras is 
              intrinsically contained within the profound state of samadhi, which is 
              none other than one’s own nature. That is the starting point or source 
              of the excellent main part beyond concepts.</p>
              <p>Deity, mantra and samadhi are the enlightened body, 
              speech and mind. Vajra body means the unchanging quality which is the 
              identity of the deity. The unceasing quality is the identity of the 
              mantra, while the unmistaken or undeluded quality is the identity of the
               deity’s mind. These three vajras are complete in our buddha nature. 
              They are also called dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya [Skt.: the
               three bodies, or kayas, of the Buddha; respectively, the dharmakaya 
              level of absolute, primordial mind; the sambhogakaya level of energy, 
              emotions and symbols, and the nirmanakaya level of manifested form].</p>
              <p>These profound methods of Vajrayana—practicing a sadhana,
               meditating on the deity, reciting its mantra, and training in 
              samadhi—are called a quick path. The essence of this is the nature of 
              mind. This is the unfailing, unmistaken vajra speech of the perfectly 
              enlightened Buddha, which can enable us to attain complete enlightenment
               in one lifetime. This teaching has been passed through an unbroken 
              lineage of great masters all the way down to my own root guru. While my 
              ears have been very fortunate to receive this teaching, I myself am 
              nothing special. Although I may take great words in my mouth, please 
              understand that I am merely repeating what I have been fortunate enough 
              to receive.</p>
              <p>It is very difficult to really learn something or to be 
              educated in it without a teacher. You probably all know this very well, 
              having gone to school so many years. The education we have received is 
              something that we can make use of our entire lives. Even so, our 
              education has not brought us even one inch closer to the state of 
              perfect enlightenment. Our years of effort in school are ultimately of 
              no real benefit.</p>
              <p>Because you are all intelligent, I think you can 
              understand why I am saying this. No matter what we do in this life, all 
              the information we gather and all the knowledge we accumulate and all 
              the effort we make to amass wealth through work and business—when the 
              time comes for us to leave this life, all of it is futile and in vain. 
              It will not help us in any way whatsoever. I can easily say this since I
               am not educated at all! So I can smile and act big about this. Don’t be
               angry, please.</p>
              <p>What I’m trying to say is that we may well succeed in 
              becoming extremely rich and gain great material profit. We can buy the 
              most expensive clothes or manage to be famous in this world so that 
              everyone knows our name. That is quite possible. We can pursue these 
              worldly attainments very enthusiastically and think that there is plenty
               of time to enjoy them while we are in the first half of our lives.</p>
              <p>However, in the second half of our lives, as we age and 
              become elderly, life starts being less fun. I speak from experience 
              here. It begins to be difficult to stand up and to move around. You get 
              sick more often and you start to ail in different ways. What lies ahead 
              of you is only further sickness and finally death.</p>
              <p>All these disasters are lined up in front of us, and we 
              will meet them one after the other. What comes after death is not clear 
              to us right now, because we cannot see our next rebirth. We cannot even 
              see if there is anything after this life. When we look down at the 
              ground we don’t see any lower realms; when we look up in the sky we 
              don’t see any heavens or buddhafields. With these eyes we have now, we 
              don’t see that much.</p>
              <p>Please consider this: right now, you have a body, a voice
               and a mind, don’t you? Of these, mind is the most important. Isn’t it 
              true that your body and voice are the servants of mind? Mind is the 
              boss, and here comes more about mind. The five physical elements of 
              earth, fire, water, wind and space do not perceive. Mind, in contrast, 
              means that which can experience; that which perceives. The five sense 
              organs of eyes, ears, tongue, nose and body do not perceive and 
              experience. A corpse possesses the five sense organs, yet a corpse does 
              not perceive, because it doesn’t have a mind.</p>
              <p>The term corpse means that the mind has departed. We say 
              that the eyes see, that the ears hear, that the tongue tastes, the nose 
              smells and so forth—but it is only possible for this to happen when 
              there is a mind to experience through the senses. The moment what we 
              call consciousness, mind or spirit leaves the body, the five sense 
              organs are still there; but there is no experience taking place through 
              them.</p>
              <p>Mind means that which knows pleasure and pain. Of all the
               different things in this world, only mind experiences and perceives; 
              nothing else. Therefore, mind is the root of all states—all samsaric as 
              well as all nirvanic states. Without mind there would be nothing to feel
               or perceive in this world. If there were nothing that feels or 
              perceives in this world, the world would be utterly empty, wouldn’t it? 
              Mind is completely empty, but it is at the same time able to perceive, 
              to know.</p>
              <p>The three lower realms are arrayed according to the 
              degree of pain experienced in each, just as the three higher realms are 
              arrayed according to degrees of pleasure. Everything is based on that 
              which feels pleasure and pain, which is mind. In other words, mind is 
              the basis or root of everything.</p>
              <p>Mind is empty, and while being empty, it still knows or 
              experiences. Space is empty and does not know anything. That is the 
              difference between space and mind. Mind is similar to space, in that it 
              is insubstantial, not material. Isn’t it quite amazing that something 
              that is insubstantial is also able to experience?</p>
              <p>There is mind, but it is not tangible or substantial. You
               cannot say that there is no mind because it is the basis of everything;
               it is that which experiences every possible thing. You cannot say 
              really that there is a thing called mind, and yet at the same time you 
              cannot say that there is no mind. It lies beyond both extremes of being 
              and not being. That is why it is said, “Not existent, since even a 
              buddha does not see it; not nonexistent, since it is the basis of both 
              samsara and nirvana.”</p>
              <p>If we were without a mind, we would be corpses. You are 
              not corpses, are you? But can you say that there is a mind that you can 
              see, hear, smell, taste or take hold of? Honestly, you can continue to 
              search for it exactly like this, scrutinizing for a billion years, and 
              you will never be able to find mind as something that either exists or 
              doesn’t. It is truly beyond both extremes of existence and nonexistence.</p>
              <p>The absence of contradiction between these two is the 
              principle of the Middle Way—that mind is beyond conflict between 
              existence and nonexistence. We do not have to hold the idea that there 
              is a concrete mind or that there isn’t. Mind in itself is natural 
              “thatness,” meaning that it is an unformed unity of being empty and 
              cognizant. The Buddha called this unformed unity shunyata, emptiness. 
              Shunye means empty, while the -ta in shunyata, the ‘-ness’ in emptiness,
               should be understood as meaning “able to cognize.” In this way, mind is
               empty cognizance. Natural thatness means simply what is by itself. Our 
              nature is just like that. Just recognize that fact, without coloring it 
              with any kind of idea about it.</p>
              <p>If you believe there is a thing called mind, it is just a
               thought. If you believe there is no thing called mind, it’s just 
              another thought. Your natural state, free of any kind of thought about 
              it—that is buddha nature. In ordinary sentient beings, this natural 
              state is carried away by thinking, caught up in thought. Involvement in 
              thinking is like a heavy chain that weighs you down. Now it is time to 
              be free from that chain. The moment you shatter the chain of thinking, 
              you are free from the three realms of samsara.</p>
              <p>In this entire world, there is nothing superior to or 
              more precious than knowing how to break this chain. Even if you were to 
              scan the entire world, or piece by piece put it through a sieve in an 
              attempt to find something more precious, you’d come up with nothing. 
              None of the buddhas of the past, present and future have discovered an 
              instruction that is more profound or more direct in attaining 
              enlightenment. To ask for teachings on the nature of mind means to 
              understand how to recognize mind nature.</p>
              <p>The traditional way of receiving the instruction on how 
              to realize the nature of mind involves first going through the training 
              of the preliminary practices of the “four times hundred thousand.” After
               that, you would carry out the yidam [Tib.: deity] practice, staying in 
              retreat and completing the set number of recitations.</p>
              <p>Finally, after all this, this teaching would be given. 
              But nowadays we live in different times. People are so busy that they 
              have no time to actually sit down and go through all this training. My 
              root guru told me once that different times were coming. He said, “If 
              you happen to be in front of people who ask about and want to hear about
               the nature of mind, explain it to them. If they have the karmic 
              readiness, they will understand, and if they do understand, they are 
              benefited. To benefit beings is the purpose of the Buddha’s teachings. 
              It’s all right.”</p>
              <p>When I was young, I often tried to do that. It’s like 
              someone pointing out the sunrise. Often people look towards the west and
               see that the sunlight has hit the mountain top; that’s how they know 
              the sun has risen. But actually what they have to do is turn around and 
              see the sun rising in the east. When someone tells them to do so, they 
              turn around and say, “Well, yeah, the sun is actually rising in the 
              east!” That is how I have been teaching, and that is how I will continue
               to teach now.</p>
              <p>So: you have heard that our mind is actually empty, 
              meaning it is not a concrete thing, and that at the same time it is able
               to perceive, to understand, to experience. When you hear this and think
               about this, can you trust it? Is it clear? Can you decide on this 
              point?<br> Our mind is empty, and yet it does think. That it is empty 
              means there is no concrete substance with any definable attributes. And 
              yet, mind does think. Isn’t it true that we are always thinking about 
              the past, present or future? And aren’t we so busy thinking that we have
               one thought after the other, day and night, incessantly?</p>
              <p>This is not something that has suddenly happened. It has 
              been going on for a long time, through countless past lives in samsara. 
              We have been spinning around involved in one thought after another in 
              different realms in samsara. That is the essence of samsaric existence. 
              And if we carry on in the same way, we will be busy thinking one thought
               after the other until the very end of this life.</p>
              <p>It doesn’t stop there. Of course there is no body in the 
              bardo [Tib.: the intermediate state between death and rebirth], but mind
               continues churning out one thought after the other due to habit. After a
               new rebirth, regardless of whether it’s in the lower realms or the 
              higher realms or the deepest hell, everything is simply one thought 
              after the other. Yet all the time, the very nature of all this thinking 
              is buddha nature—the enlightened essence.</p>
              <p>Let me give you an example for the relationship between 
              thinking and the nature of mind. The nature of mind is like the sun in 
              the sky, while thinking is like the sun’s reflection in water. Without 
              water, it’s difficult for the sun to reflect, isn’t it? Water here is 
              the analogy for all perceived objects, for anything held in mind. If you
               drained the water from a pond, where does the reflection go? Does it 
              run out with the water? Does it stay suspended in mid-air?</p>
              <p>Holding subject and object, perceiver and perceived in 
              mind, is symbolized by the reflection of the sun in the pond. Without 
              the sun in the sky, would there be any light in this world? No, of 
              course not. And yet, one single sun is able to illuminate the entire 
              world. This single sun is like the nature of mind, in that it functions 
              or operates in many different ways: it has great warmth and brilliance, 
              and through its heat it sets wind in motion. In comparison to this, the 
              reflection of the sun is nothing. Is the reflection of the sun able to 
              illuminate the entire world? Can it even illuminate a single pond?</p>
              <p>Our enlightened essence, the buddhanature, is like the 
              sun itself, present as our very nature. Its reflection can be compared 
              to our thoughts—all our plans, our memories, our attachment, our anger, 
              our closed-mindedness, and so on. One thought arises after the other, 
              one movement of mind occurs after the other, just like one reflection 
              after another appears. If you control this one sun in the sky, don’t you
               automatically control all its reflections in various ponds of water in 
              the whole world? Why pay attention to all the different reflections? 
              Instead of circling endlessly in samsara, recognize the one sun. If you 
              recognize the nature of your mind, the buddhanature, that is sufficient.</p>
              <p>Understand the difference between buddhanature and its 
              expression, which is thoughts. Thoughts appear in many types. There is 
              attachment, anger and stupidity; there are the fifty-one mental events, 
              the eighty innate thought states, the eighty-four thousand disturbing 
              emotions.</p>
              <p>No matter how many different types of content the mind 
              can manifest as, they are all simply expressions of the nature of mind. 
              The eighty-four thousand different types of disturbing emotions are like
               eighty-four thousand different reflections of the sun in different 
              ponds of water. If you take the sun and put it in your pocket, you 
              automatically control all eighty-four thousand reflections. Similarly, 
              the very moment that you recognize your natural state, the buddha mind, 
              your enlightened essence—in that same moment, all eighty-four thousand 
              types of disturbing emotions are simultaneously vanquished.</p>
              <p>All the different thoughts we can have are either of the 
              past, present or future, so they can be called past thought, present 
              thought, or future thought. The Tibetan word for thought is namtok. Nam 
              means the perceived forms of the five senses and the mental objects. 
              Tokpa means the concept formed about what is perceived. Sentient beings 
              are constantly busy producing namick, making one idea after the other 
              about what is experienced. This thinking of your own mind’s thoughts is 
              exactly what hinders and obstructs liberation and enlightenment.</p>
              <p>If we try to stop thinking it only gets worse. You cannot
               shake off or throw away the thinking. Can you throw away your shadow? 
              Can you somehow cut the flow of thought created by your own mind, maybe 
              by detonating a nuclear bomb? Will this stop the mind from thinking? It 
              will kill you, sure, but your thoughts will continue in the bardo and 
              into the next life. Is there anything else in this world that can stop 
              the mind from thinking?</p>
              <p>To stop thinking, you need to recognize your essence. 
              It’s like seeing the sun in the sky just once—forever after, you know 
              what the sun looks like. If you chase one reflection of the sun after 
              the other, you’ll never be able to see all possible reflections. There 
              is no end to that. The sun in the sky is the real sun, and without it, 
              there would be no reflections. Its reflection in the water is only an 
              imitation.</p>
              <p>In the same way, all thoughts are only expressions or 
              displays of your essence; they are not your essence itself. Without 
              being free of thought, without the thinking having dissolved, vanished, 
              disappeared, there is no way to be liberated or enlightened. There is a 
              saying: “Use the thought as its own antidote.” In the same way, the 
              reflection of all suns comes from the original, real sun. If you 
              recognize the real sun in the sky, there is no need to chase around 
              after all its reflections in this world in order to see the sun.</p>
              <p>The most important thing is your empty, cognizant mind. 
              Its natural emptiness is dharmakaya, also called empty essence. Your 
              natural ability to know and to perceive is cognizant nature, 
              sambhogakaya. This being empty and being cognizant are an original 
              unity. The famous statement “unity of empty cognizance suffused with 
              awareness” refers to your own nature, the essence of your mind.</p>
              <p>After having been pointed out your nature and recognizing
               your essence, you see that there is no “thing” to see. As I have 
              repeatedly said, “Not seeing a thing is the supreme sight.” We need to 
              see that. It is seen the moment you look, and in the moment of seeing it
               is free, liberated.</p>
              <p>This seeing may last no longer than a few seconds, 
              perhaps no longer than three snaps of your fingers. After that brief 
              period of time, we either get carried away by the thought of something, 
              or we become forgetful. This happens to all ordinary sentient beings. 
              From beginningless lifetimes until now, we have been continuously 
              carried away by forgetfulness and by thinking.</p>
              <p>The moment you recognize, it is already seen. There is 
              nothing extra remaining that you missed. This is not like space looking 
              at itself, because space does not see anything. When your mind, which is
               cognizant, recognizes itself, you immediately see that there is no 
              “thing” to see. It is already seen in the same moment. At that very 
              moment there is no thought, because the present thought has naturally 
              vanished.</p>
              <p>The moment of recognizing mind nature is called ordinary 
              mind, whether you talk about Mahamudra, Dzogchen or the Great Middle 
              Way. When recognizing, don’t do anything to it; don’t try to correct or 
              improve it; don’t alter it by accepting one thing and rejecting another,
               motivated by hope or fear—don’t do anything to it. An ordinary person 
              is involved in conceptualizing with the present thought. Don’t 
              conceptualize with a present thought. Present thought means wanting or 
              not wanting, with hope or fear. Just disconnect from the present 
              thought; don’t follow it up. The moment you are free from thoughts of 
              the three times, that is the buddha mind.</p>
              <p>You don’t have to try not to think the present thought. 
              We need to train in just letting go of what is thought of; that is the 
              practice. In this letting go there is not even a dust mote to imagine, 
              so it is not an act of meditating. At the same time, do not be 
              distracted from this for even one second. It’s like trying to imagine 
              space, because there’s nothing that needs to be imagined or meditated 
              upon. Do you need to imagine anything to imagine space?</p>
              <p>When we hear “Don’t be distracted,” we may think that we 
              have to do something in order to be undistracted. People usually think 
              that trying to remain undistracted is some kind of deliberate act. This 
              would in fact be so, if the aim was to maintain a particular state of 
              concentration for a long time. Deliberate action would be necessary in 
              that case. But I am not telling you to do that. The moment of natural 
              empty cognizance doesn’t last very long by itself, but that’s perfectly 
              okay. You don’t have to try to prolong that moment; rather, repeat it 
              many times. “Short moments, many times”—this is the training in 
              uncontrived naturalness. Uncontrived naturalness means you don’t have to
               do anything during that state. It’s like ringing a bell. Once you ring 
              the bell there is a continuity of sound; you don’t have to do anything 
              in order for the sound to continue. Simply allow that continuity to 
              endure by itself until at some point the sound fades away.</p>
              <p>At the moment of recognizing your mind essence leave it 
              in naturalness, simply as it is. If you keep striking the bell, the 
              sound is interrupted by the effort. Just leave that recognition be 
              without altering it. That is the way to not lose the continuity. Soon 
              enough the recognition will vanish by itself. As beginners, naturally we
               will forget after a bit. We don’t need to try to prevent that or guard 
              against it with great effort. Once distracted, again recognize. That is 
              the training.</p>
              <p>Every level of teaching has its own purpose, and even 
              though the very heart of the Buddhadharma is to recognize mind essence 
              and train in that, still, there are obstacles and hindrances that need 
              to be cleared away and enhancement practices that need to be done.<br> An obstacle is something that prevents us from remaining in 
              the natural state. These can be cleared away by certain practices. There
               are also ways to improve or enhance our practice and to deepen our 
              experience. These two—clearing hindrances and enhancing—are extremely 
              useful.</p>
              <p>Outer obstacles are connected with our environment; inner
               obstacles with our physical body, and innermost obstacles with our 
              thought patterns. To dispel these, it’s extremely beneficial to do the 
              preliminaries and the inner practice of deity, mantra and samadhi. 
              Hindrances need to be removed, as they are the result of negative deeds 
              that obscure our nature. Relying on the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha and on
               the guru, yidam and dakini as support quickly clears away hindrances.</p>
              <p>Enhancement practices, for instance, are to develop 
              devotion to the enlightened ones and compassion for sentient beings. 
              Devotion and compassion strengthen the recognition of mind nature. Other
               practices also further enhance mind essence; however, the Third Karmapa
               stated the most essential point when he said: “In the moment of love, 
              the empty essence dawns nakedly.”</p>
              <p>In the moment that either devotion or compassion is felt 
              sincerely, from the core of our heart, there is really nothing to 
              obscure us any longer. The more we train in devotion to all enlightened 
              masters, buddhas and bodhisattvas, the more our progress in recognizing 
              mind essence will be enhanced. In exactly the same way, generating 
              loving kindness and compassion for all sentient beings will also help 
              tremendously to enhance our realization of buddhanature.</p>
              <p>Let us conclude this teaching by engaging in the last of 
              the Three Excellences, the excellent dedication. As a result of having 
              studied these teachings, please dedicate the merit and make aspirations 
              for the benefit of all sentient beings.</p>
              <p><em>Tulku Urgyen Ripoche (1920-1995) was one of the great Dzogchen 
              masters of this era. He studied and practiced both the Dzogchen (Skt.: 
              Maha Ati) teachings of the Nyingma school and the Mahamudra teachings of
               the Kagyu school, and was the Dzogchen teacher of the late sixteenth 
              Karmapa. Over the course of his life he spent more than twenty years in 
              retreat, including four three-year retreats. Tulku Urgyen established 
              six monasteries and retreat centers in the Kathmandu region, where today
