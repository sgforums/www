In reality, most cases of being able to see ghosts are due to 1) Other ghosts aiding them in the ability to see ghosts. 2) Past lives, the are ghosts. (not uncommon) Both of them are 'spirit eyes'. Some people become very attached to these abilities and obstruct their own dharma practise. They may become attached to say, communicating with the other realm. Of course those who have deep samadhi, attained high jhanas, these people can see other realms.. but this is actually relatively very rare and does not constitute most of the cases of being able to see ghosts.<br><br>Please read this article about the Five Eyes, which differentiates normal eye, spirit eye, deva eye, and other enlightened/wisdom eyes: <a href="http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chan1.org/ddp/channews/10-1987.html</a></div>

So whether or not they are reborn somewhere else, it's good to dedicate merits to your father and other relatives every Ullambana Dharma.<br><br><blockquote>I donate money annually in prayer sessions for deceased organized by the Buddhist temple in which my father's tablet was housed.

And yes the merits of donating money whether for dharma or sangha can also be dedicated to the deceased..</div>
