              <p>THE EGO IS A FICTION<br>Our problems arise from the idea of a separate entity, a me that we learn at about the<br>age of about two or two-and-a-half years old. What can you do with the word, me or<br>I? You can’t do much with it. So what we do is add events, experiences and<br>conditioning – the things that have happened to us. The energy of belief goes into that<br>and it seemingly concrete-ises. It seems to become real. And that’s what we call the<br>self-centre or the ego. It becomes the reference point that I believe myself to be.<br>Something comes up and I like it. How would I know I liked it? Well if something’s<br>happened previously and I'm relating it to a past image, I say, “This is good.”<br>Then what happens when the good things tend to move away after a while, and I don’t<br>want them to go? When I really like them, what do I do? I try to resist them from<br>going, and what is resistance? Resistance is conflict, and conflict is dis-ease. If you're<br>in conflict, you're uneasy – not at ease. That’s disease. If something comes up and I<br>don’t like it, I’m referring to this me of memory again, and if I don’t like it, what do I<br>do? I try to push it away and get rid of it. Again, there is resistance, conflict and disease.<br>In nature, the pairs of opposites are constantly functioning and there couldn’t be any<br>dualism without that constant functioning of the opposites. These opposites are not in<br>conflict with one another. There is nothing taking a stance against the other. If it is<br>spring now, soon it will be summer. Spring’s not saying, “I wish it were summer.” It<br>moves on naturally, without any conflict. The incoming tide doesn’t fight the<br>outgoing tide. A storm will come through and blow things apart. After a while it<br>dissipates and nature gradually renews itself. The pairs of opposites are constantly<br>there, but there is no conflict.<br>With us, the pairs of opposites are constantly in conflict because we're constantly<br>relating or referring to this mental image of the way we think or believe things should<br>be; not leaving things as they are, but wanting them to be the way we think they<br>should be. So, all our problems are really problems of relationship - not just the malefemale<br>relationship. Problems are problems of relationship – relative to, and it’s<br>always relative to this self-image we've got. When you see it’s a fictitious image<br>based on past events and past experience, you see the trap we put ourselves in.<br>And you'll hear that in the great traditions, too. They’ll tell you the same thing.<br>It’s selfishness, selfâ€�centredness and selfâ€�will that is the problem. They say you<br>have to sublimate this ego and destroy it. You have to do all sorts of things with it<br>and in that struggle to do that, what happens? What are you doing it with? It’s<br>the ego fighting against the ego. Have a look at it closely and you’ll see that the<br>ego is a fiction. It never existed. It never could.<br>It can be pointed out quite simply right now. Everybody is seeing right now. You’re<br>seeing quite effortlessly. The seeing is going on. Everybody is also hearing right now.<br>The seeing is happening, the hearing is happening. Ask yourself, “Is my eye telling<br>me I see?” Well my eye is not saying, “Look at this, Bob, or look at that.” The seeing<br>is happening through the eye, but it’s translated by the thought, I see; I see this, I see<br>that.</p>
              <p>The hearing is happening through the ear. The ear is not telling me, I hear. Again it’s<br>translated by the thought, I hear. So the eye is not telling me I see and the ear is not<br>telling me I hear, but the thought comes up and translates it. Now ask yourself this:<br>Can the thought, I see actually see? Look closely and you'll realise that the thought is<br>not seeing. Can the thought, I hear, actually do the hearing? All the thought is doing<br>is translating. This ego is thought up and has no power to see, to hear or to be aware.<br>The thought, I choose can’t choose. The thought, I'm aware is not your awareness.<br>So this fictitious ego is an idea to which we have been in bondage for all these<br>years. The belief that it is an entity that can choose, has selfâ€�will, selfâ€�awareness,<br>is having a bad trot, etc. is just a thought. In seeing it’s a fiction, what’s going to<br>happen then? Isn’t the natural livingness going to carry on the way it’s been<br>carrying on any way. It’s breathing you, it’s beating your heart, it’s growing your<br>hair and fingernails, digesting your food, replacing cells, causing the thinking,<br>feelings, emotions and everything to happen quite effortlessly.<br>If all of the functioning is not being related to a me, then what’s the problem? Is good<br>or bad a problem unless it’s related to an entity that thinks it should be some other<br>way? It doesn’t mean to say problems won’t come up. They’ll come up, sure, because<br>as in nature, the pairs of opposites are constantly functioning, but when they are<br>coming up, they are seen for what they are. With un-fixated awareness, they move on.<br>When we're fixating on something, clinging to something, attaching to something, it<br>keeps it there. There’s a resistance going on and it’s not free to move.<br>That’s why we say that all our problems come from the belief in a separate<br>entity. See that it was never real and you realise things have just happened that<br>way.<br>Questioner: The ego seems to be an extraordinary construction – a notion, a kind of<br>bundle of ideas?<br>Bob: It’s uncreated. It’s all so-called mind stuff. And all ‘mind’ is, is thought. The<br>Buddhists call it all minds. They’re not discriminating between mind and awareness.<br>It’s all mind in their point of view – all consciousness. That natural innate knowingness<br>is there – it’s not born, doesn’t have any beginning, doesn’t have any end. It’s<br>not bound by time and it can’t be grasped from any point because there’s no point, no<br>centre and no circumference to it. It just is.<br>Questioner: You link thoughts, feelings and emotion together and say they are the<br>same thing?<br>Bob: And what’s emotion about? Isn’t it about the image being affected by the<br>thought? If thought hangs around long enough it becomes feeling. Then if feeling<br>hangs around, it becomes emotion. It moves from subtle thought into feeling then<br>emotion. It’s one and the same thing really – it stirs up this body pattern which is just<br>another form of energy. To a certain extent, you need the thoughts, feelings and<br>emotions to function. But when we’re bound into them so that we believe it, then it<br>becomes self destructive. That’s all time - mind is the past, mind is time. Mind is all<br>these things. It’s all mind stuff. ……</p>
              <p>Questioner: What you seem to say is that when you understand that the construction,<br>the reference point, identity, ego – call it what you like – is not real, then a dissolution<br>happens and you fall into the seeing.<br>Bob: It’s un-fixated awareness, where it’s not fixating on the no-thing or anything<br>else. It’s just free in the immediacy of the moment to go whichever way it goes. And<br>if it latches onto something, that’s not fixated on either. If it goes back in the other<br>direction, it’s not fixated on either.<br>Questioner: If you were to summarise the core of what you are on about, how would<br>you express that?<br>Bob: I suppose you could call it wakefulness … just like daylight. Space-like<br>awareness-like space. It’s seemingly light now, but is space light? It isn’t. Is space<br>dark? The light comes, the light recedes and darkness comes. Clouds come and<br>clouds go, and they’re appearing in that light. In the dark night you don’t see the<br>clouds.<br>Questioner: So you say that reference points come and reference points go.<br>Bob: Everything comes and everything goes. Choices are made - no choice maker.<br>No reference point holder. The preferences may come up - no preference holder.<br>These labels could all come up, you know. So it’s all there and it’s really always free<br>to move in whatever direction it likes.<br>Questioner: So it dissipates because it’s seen for what it is?<br>Bob: Yes, it’s recognised again for what it is. It’s the thinking or conceptualizing that<br>is the only problem we've ever had. But it needn’t be a problem if it’s understood.<br>And that’s what the ancients point out. There is nothing either good or bad, but the<br>thinking makes it so…. and nothing can trouble you except your own imagination.<br>Questioner: There seems to be an expectation that stopping the thinking would halt<br>the pain?<br>Bob: Nothing wrong with thinking. But if it is divided into a thinker and a thought,<br>then it’s problematic. There’s nothing wrong with experiencing. When it’s divided into an<br>experience – this experience and that experience, it becomes a problem. It’s the mental<br>division that causes the problem. There is nothing wrong with seeing. In the seer and the<br>seen, the division is only conceptual. It’s just made up of concepts, thoughts and ideas. I<br>see this, that and the other, whatever you're seeing – is a label you've got for what you're<br>seeing. And so it’s a thought always in conflict with a thought … and there’s resistance to<br>it all. If it’s understood that the two are both ends of the same stick, then it really doesn’t<br>matter.</p>

              <p>Following from different author. <a href="http://justperception.net">http://justperception.net</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Just Perception</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One of the difficulties that comes about
               in attempting to convey truth is the oft discussed nature of language, 
              and the inherent qualities therein which work to splinter and slice.  
              Perhaps the most obvious and long observed tenets of this situation is 
              the very use of pronouns – which I am not going to revisit here, except 
              to say that reverting to “I” statements, or even a third-person stance, 
              is simply the way it appears language must unfold, even in attempts to 
              get across the ineffable.  This is being brought up simply because it 
              appears that, even with such disclaimers, room is still left wide open 
              for the inevitable trap of latching onto any sense of ownership. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For example, the way truth is most often
               put in these writings is through the application of the term 
              ‘perception’.  Just perception.  If this term is placed into sentences 
              attempting to illuminate truth with only slight modifications, the 
              snares of dualistic language become obvious.  If the statement given is 
              “I perceive”, then there is an “owner” conveying that ownership (which 
              is faulty), and that “owner” is implied in the basic subjective stance. 
               In other words, there is an “I” that is privy to the perception.  This 
              is false.  There is no “I” – be it a relative “I” or even an absolute 
              “I” to “take in” this perception.  Both are fiction.  If the term 
              perception in another case is being used as the supposed ‘object 
              beholden unto the subject’ – i.e., the field of perception, as in “I <em>perceive</em>”,
               this is still not truth.  The “I”, it has already been determined, does
               not exist.  So through linguistics there is now a shifting of the 
              burden of ownership right onto perception, as well as to supposedly 
              “what arise within” perception.  Or even more cunningly, this stance 
              allows for the claiming of ownership and identity to be merged with the 
              very supposed “ground”, “space”, or “field” into which it is “felt and 
              believed” by the “I” that perception “occurs”.  This is a total 
              misidentification.  One which can be so subtly introduced and harbored 
              that its eradication is essential, and can not be stressed enough.  
              There is to be no ownership at all.  Even the tenses of the word 
              ‘perception’ work toward perpetuating this ownership:  ”<em>perceiving</em>”
               – an implied “I” in the act, taken by the action, actively “doing” what
               needs to be “done”; ”<em>perceived</em>” – an implied “I” which in “the
               past” was in the act, was taken by the action, was actively “doing” 
              what needed to be “done”, etc. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In mystical literature this is 
              heightened by descriptions of the nature of union, or the unitive state –
               these words in themselves implying the sense of “two” having been fused
               together.  A union which, of course, some writings then report later 
              meld into what is typically referred to as nondualty, or oneness.  Yet 
              even here, before either is “experienced” (and perhaps even arising as 
              thought or misunderstanding afterward) it may appear from reading such 
              texts that there are still “I”s in union; I-i, or I-I, or what have you.
                Or perhaps even  in the case of nonduality, a oneness between an 
              absolute “I” and all form.  Misidentity, misownership, and 
              misrepresentation – mostly the fault of the language mechanism – can 
              therefore still occur.  In both cases, the result is that, potentially, 
              an identity might even be “projected” onto the absolute – which is 
              totally transcendent of any such labeling, identification, or “I”-ness 
              whatsoever.  What enlightenment reveals is perception.  Just perception.
                Not any perceiver hither or yonder, not even any object of perception.
                Just perception.  The dissolving (and not by anyone – there is no 
              “one” to “do” the dissolving) of all attempts, or modes, or habitual and
               conditioned moves toward ownership of any kind, in any form, brings 
              clarity to truth.</span></p>
