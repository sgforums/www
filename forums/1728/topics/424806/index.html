              <p>Lopon P. Ogyan Tanzin Rinpoche is the great-great-grandson of the 
              treasure-revealer Terton Jigme Kundrol, one of the four supreme disciples of the 
              famous master Jigme Lingpa (1730-93).Terton Jigme Kundrol was born in Wangdar Lung, Bhutan. In his youth he 
              trained in the Drukpa Kagyu lineage. While serving as the manager for his 
              monastery, he witnessed the killing of animals for meat and deep compassion 
              arose within him.</p>
              <p>Thereupon he left his monastery and went to Tibet, where he 
              received a complete monastic education at the renowned Mindrolling monastery. 
              When he heard that the great master Jigme Lingpa was residing at Samye, he 
              decided to go there. He was fortunate enough to be accepted as a personal 
              disciple by Jigme Lingpa, from whom he received all the precious lineage 
              transmissions. Practicing under Jigme Lingpa’s guidance, he obtained 
              accomplishment and was recognized as one of the latter’s four supreme disciples.Following his master’s orders, he returned to Thawa Drak in Bumtang, 
              Bhutan, where he established his residence. He then went on to Dungsam and built 
              a monastery called Yongleg Gon.</p>
              <p>He was especially powerful in the practice of Dorje Phurba and was able 
              to offer protection to the people, the Buddhist doctrine and the kingdom of 
              Bhutan. Due to his blessings and loving kindness, he became very famous and his 
              name is frequently found in the religious histories of the Kingdom of 
              Bhutan.</p>
              <p>Lopon P. Ogyan Tanzin Rinpoche is the son and lineage holder of Pema Rapten 
              Rinpoche. Hence, he is the fourth lineage holder. Unfortunately, his father 
              passed away while he was still quite young, so he received most of his father’s 
              lineage from his uncle Jamyang Kunga Rinpoche. He also received the complete 
              lineage transmissions of H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche. Moreover, he received teachings 
              and empowerments from Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, 
              Changchak Rinpoche, Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche and Taklung 
              Tsetrul Rinpoche.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rinpoche, originally from Pemako, was born into a family of ngakpas with an 
              unbroken lineage of inherited spiritual gifts and accomplishments descended from 
              the Terton Pema Lingpa. He resides in Varanasi and frequently visits his school 
              in Arunachal Pradesh.Rinpoche has studied with many of the greatest lamas of his generation. 
              His root lama was HH Dudjom Rinpoche. His retreat master was Changchak Rinpoche. 
              He holds the Nyingma lineages of Pema Lingpa, Jang Ter, Mindrolling, Dudjom 
              Tersar and Longchen Nyingthig. He received initiations from Minling Trichen 
              Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Padma Norbu Rinpoche, 
              Khordong Tulku Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche and Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche. He holds 
              Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche and Chatral Rinpoche as his highest living rôle 
              models.</p>

              <p>Really the story begins many years ago when four friends, all Lamas, and I left Tibet. Upon reaching to India we made a vow together that one of us would someday start a school to preserve the special teachings and yogic practices of the Nyingma lineage. We made this promise to Dudjom Rinpoche. Now, many years later not all of us are alive and others are engaged in important work and so it has fallen to me to undertake this project. Really I am very lucky because to do such auspicious work in a sacred land such as Pemako makes one very fortunate. We are all very fortunate to be able to help the Buddha's teachings to flourish.</p>
              <p>In many Terma Padmasambhava spoke of the special characteristics of Pemako as a sacred hidden land. To go there, to help the Buddha's teachings there, brings great merit. Two years ago when I began this work I went to the Supreme Head of the Nyingma Lineage, H.H. Minling Trichen Rinpoche, and he blessed our school with the name Lhundrup Topgye Ling. This year while in America my root Lama, Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche's son, also gave very strong blessing for this project. So I am very lucky indeed to be doing this work.</p>
              <p>When I came to the west I met many people who wished to help and now people from three continents and more than 7 countries have contributed to our noble project. We have built a school where there has been no school. We have built a nursery for small children and also a kitchen, which provides food for children and parents. We offer clothing and medical care as well. Just this year we have arranged for a medical camp to come to the region with doctors and supplies from the west. This sacred area of Pemako is so remote that it receives very little aide and these resources are much needed.</p>
              <p>My goal was not to merely start a school but to help the whole community there thrive. Our vision must be holistic it must be very broad because we must make the whole community strong in order to save these precious teachings. As Buddhist we must have impartial compassion and love for all beings not only those who look like us or have our nationality. For this reason we offer the school, the nursery, the aide, to all people in the region both Tibetan refugees and local children. In this way the school will be built on a strong foundation and continue into the future after we are all gone.  Guru Rinpoche's tradition is for everyone!</p>
