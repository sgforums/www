              <p> </p>
              <p>Many people think that
              Right Speech has something to do with Free Speech and its related
              Constitutional rights and responsibilities. This confusion frequently
              allows political activism to contaminate religious life; and,
              unfortunately for the heroic crusaders who dwell within our breast, few
              things are as harmful to a person's spiritual practice than political
              activism.</p>
              <p>When government is immoral, society looks to its religious leaders to
              promote change. Sometimes, as is often the case in undeveloped
              countries, a religion is the only organization available to form an
              opposition. Sometimes, ironically, it was the unwarranted intrusion
              into secular matters by the religion, itself, which engendered the
              poverty, oppression and corruption which the people are engaged in
              opposing. But no matter, whether trying to change conditions for which
              they are largely responsible or whether trying to change conditions for
              which they are entirely blameless, religions seem always to get
              involved in politics.</p>
              <p>Unripened religious professionals, believing it incumbent upon themselves to set 
              society straight on moral issues, frequently can be found marching in protest lines or 
              parades. They do not realize that by publicly protesting injustices of one sort or another 
              they are practicing Six-Worlds' Chan.  Don't warn them that if they expend all their 
              energy correcting the misconduct of others, they'll have no strength left to root lust or 
              greed out of their own hearts. They are prepared to make the sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Charge that their devotion to the issue far exceeds their understanding of the 
              issue and they will rebuke you, gnashing their teeth in vehement denial. They are 
              authorities on Good and Evil. They have studied the issue (nuclear energy, alien rights, 
              ozone depletion, military draft, toxic waste, abortion, endangered species, organized 
              labor strikes, offshore drilling, etc.) and they know that they are on the side of Good.</p>
              <p>How do religious organizations really determine which side of an issue
              is the good one? Do they automatically assume that the good side is the
              side the government is not on? No. They do not study issues that
              carefully. If we interview the protesters, we usually learn that they
              determined the good side by having it described to them by the
              administrators of their temples at whose instigation they also picked
              up their placards. And how did those astute beings arrive on the side
              of Good? Either they found in the 'evil' side a fit receptacle for
              their congregation's collective hate (common enemies being the
              nutritive umbilical cord of fellowship) or, what is more frequently the
              case, they simply differentiated good from evil according to the quid
              pro quo, "I'll march in your protest if you'll march in mine"
              accommodations which religious groups make with each other.</p>
              <p>According to this arrangement, one religious group calls another to
              solicit help in protesting the deployment of Multiple Warhead
              Intercontinental Nuclear Missiles (their Roshi's pet peeve). The
              solicited organization complies and contributes a few dozen bodies to
              the march. Then, a month later when this organization wants to protest
              Offshore Drilling (the bane of their Guru's existence), they call upon
              the first which reciprocates. Often, the people on the line don't know
              anything at all about the issue except what they have been told by
              their religious leaders. Not exactly a think-tank operation.</p>
