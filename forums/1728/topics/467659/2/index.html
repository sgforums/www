In this parable a scenario is presented where children are in great danger in a house on fire :-<br><br>One day, a fire broke out in the house of a wealthy man who had many children. The wealthy man shouted at his children inside the burning house to flee. But, the children were absorbed in their games and did not heed his warning, though the house was being consumed by flames. <br><br>Then, the wealthy man devised a practical way to lure the children from the burning house. Knowing that the children were fond of interesting playthings, he called out to them, "Listen! Outside the gate are the carts that you have always wanted: carts pulled by goats, carts pulled by deer, and carts pulled by oxen. Why don't you come out and play with them?" The wealthy man knew that these things would be irresistible to his children.<br><br>The children, eager to play with these new toys rushed out of the house but, instead of the carts that he had promised, the father gave them a cart much better than any he has described - a cart draped with precious stones and pulled by white bullocks. The important thing being that the children were saved from the dangers of the house on fire.<br><br>In this parable the father, of course, is the Buddha and sentient beings are the children trapped in the burning house. The Burning House represents the world burning with the fires of old age, sickness and death. The teachings of the Buddha are like the father getting the boys to leave their pleasures for a greater pleasure, Nirvana.<br><br>A further interpretation is to see the the goat, deer, and ox carts as representing the early teachings of Buddhism, as the teachings of Hinayana Buddhism (the Mahayana term for the Buddhism that preceded it), and the cart pulled by white bullocks to 'The Lotus Sutra' which, when followed, leads to Buddhahood.</span><br><br></td>

              <p>the lie is false, but that does not mean it's ineffective to lure one from danger. the Buddha dharma is also in this manner. </p>
              <p>the word "Right" in Buddhism simply mean, don't harm yourself and others.  </p>

              <p>If I may add a Christian perspective to this. The issue of sexual misconduct is addressed in the Bible too. The Bible has a lot to say about sex!</p>
              <p>Firstly, God created the first man and first woman. It was thus heterosexual relationship. It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. This is the basis for marriage between one man and one woman. Neither did God make one man and many women, for that would imply polygamy. It was one man one woman.</p>
              <p>Secondly, marriage is the closest union because Eve was taken from the side of Adam, thus the notion of husband and wife as "one flesh" union. It was so historically and thus so now.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the body is supposed to be the temple of God, which is why God restrict sexual relations to husband and wife.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, the Bible is silent on the issue of remarriage, and Christians have differing views on this.</p>
              <p>Fifthly, the notion of sexual misconduct presupposes that there is right conduct in terms of sexuality. What is this right conduct? Where do we get the notion of right conduct from?</p>

              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 14pt;  '>It is certainly very tempting to put forward one’s point of views, perspectives when one disagreed or have a different set of opinions on an issue with another party. But there should come a time when one or both parties should realize that they are getting nowhere due to irreconcilable differences. In such cases, it would be best for either party to remain silent instead of continuously dragging on with an endless debate. </span></p>

It could just mean the gap on what is being discussed is too wide to be bridged. It would than be better to move on to other more meaningful issues.</span></p>

              <p>For the case of the multiple body, how would that work? So, if one body experiences pain, the others also expererience it? Do each of the body has a mind of its own, or there's a central mind that control of of the bodies? What if there're confrontation among the bodies, where one hurts the other, then you're hurting your own self??? </p>
