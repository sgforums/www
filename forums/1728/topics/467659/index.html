              </p><p>Hello all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have an issue that's been bothering me lately, that is, per Master Hsuan Hua below remarriage is a sexual misconduct? Been looking into this matter and came across several source that said remarriage is allowed in Buddhism, but that seems contradicting to what was said here. Anyone has insight on this?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>http://www.dharmasite.net/bdh59/whatghostsare.html</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: small; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">Sexual misconduct: In terms of causes and effects, sexual misconduct is the most serious offense. It’s punishment is the most severe. If a married couple gets divorced and each one remarries, then according to the law of cause and effect, their bodies will be cut in half after they die. This is because when they were alive, they had two relationships. So after they die, their karmic retribution manifests. A huge saw slices people in half from head to toe. Their bodies are sawed into as many pieces as the number of offenses they committed. If they were married a hundred times, they are sawed into a hundred pieces, so each of their former partners can have a tiny share of them. What’s so bad about being divided into pieces? If the soul becomes fragmented like that, it’s very difficult to make it whole again. Probably those people won’t regain a human body again for billions of eons. When their nature is split and their souls are incomplete, they become dull and insentient, like plants. When their inherent nature is scattered, it’s hard to become a sentient being again. Even if they became a sentient being, they might be a mosquito. But one human body can transform into 84,000 mosquitoes, and it’s not easy to get all those mosquitoes back into one being. Most of the time, mosquitoes are reborn as mosquitoes. So they bob up and down in the cycle of birth and death, not understanding how to turn away from the dust and unite with enlightenment, or how to renounce confusion and return to the proper. It’s said, "Once the human body is lost, it cannot be regained in ten thousand eons." If you truly understand this principle, how could you not be afraid?</span></p>

              <p>interesting about the plant and slit <span style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: small; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">84,000 mosquitoes body. it also prove the concept of non-self. </span></p>
              <p>i think different era or society have different karmic effect. how a person/mind being affected by the <span style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: small; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">divorce, the </span>society, the previous partner 's attitude etc, all are involve in the result. and also, the heaviness depend on the mind set. karma is very complex.</p>
              <p>just like the poor lady who donated one cent is more virtue than a rich lady donating more money. same story below:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">During the Buddha's time, in the city of Sravasti there lived a poor woman named Nantuo. The only possessions she had were the clothes on her back, and in order to survive she relied on begging for food or spare change. One day, in the midst of a fiercely cold wind, using her weak, trembling hands, she begged for an entire day, finally receiving one small coin. With this coin she could afford to buy a small morsel of food to support her life.<br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">At this moment, she heard news about people going to make a light offering to the Buddha. She observed all of the city's residents devoutly purchasing numerous kinds of exquisite perfumed oils and candles to give as offerings to the Buddha. Seeing this, she couldn’t help but joyously praised all the devotees as the wish to make an offering to the Buddha arose in her mind. She thought, “The manifestation of the Buddha in this world is so rare and precious, I should really take hold of this opportunity to make an offering to the Buddha. But because in my past I did not cultivate any merit, so in this life I am poor and miserable. Even if I would really like to make an offering, I don't have anything special to offer, which is so shameful!” As she looked at the lone coin sitting in her hand, she knew that if she didn't spend it on food for herself she would have to pass another long, endless night in hunger and cold. And yet, her vow to make a light offering to the Buddha remained strong and resolute.<br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">Using that one small coin, she could only afford to buy the smallest amount of the crudest oil, but her sincerity was much brighter than the light emitted from any lamps. When the shopkeeper who was selling the oil saw how Nantou was willing to suffer through another long, cold night in order to make an offering to the Buddha, he became so moved that he couldn't resist giving her several times more oil than what she had paid for, to help her achieve her dream. As dark descended upon the city, all the townsfolk, from the lords up in the imperial palace down to the commoners on the streets, with their hearts full of sincerity, illuminated their lamps for the Buddha. The lamps dazzled like a sparkling river, and lit up the entire city of Sravasti. The penniless Nantuo was in the midst of that crowd, respectfully lighting her oil lamp. <br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">When this very ordinary oil lamp of hers became lit up in the middle of the night, it was as if her own low and insignificant life was also being lit up. At this moment Nantuo experienced an extraordinary feeling of richness and happiness. As she knelt down to give her offering to the Buddha, Nantuo reflected back not only on her life, full of destitution and suffering, but also thought about all the sentient beings wandering about in the endless darkness of the birth and death cycle. Because of this, she made a great wish: “I wish that this light may pervade through the ten directions, guiding every sentient creature out of the miserable sea of birth and death, to the path of supreme peace and happiness.<br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">With the arrival of dawn, an unimaginable thing happened! All the oil lamps, no matter how precious, were extinguished from burning through the night, or were blown out by Maudgalyayana, who was in charge of keeping watch on the lamps. But the lamp of the poor Nantuo was still shining brightly. Even after exhausting every type of method for extinguishing the light, Maudgalyayana, who had the greatest supernatural powers out of all Buddha's disciples, still could not put it out. He was astonished: “Whose lamp is this that is still burning? Even with my supernatural powers, I cannot put it out!”<br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">The Buddha, who was present at the time, pointed to the lamp of the poor girl, and with a smile relieved Maudgalyayana's uncertainty. “Maudgalyayana, the person who offered this lamp made a great vow to save all sentient beings. Even if you used all the water in the four great oceans, you would still not be able to extinguish this lamp. This candle was lit using a great, compassionate vow, and because she was full of sincerity, the light radiating from this lamp is inexhaustible.”<br></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">At this moment, Nantuo once again came to the temple, and devoutly paid her respects by prostrating to the Buddha. The Buddha received her and spoke the Dharma to her: “Twenty kalpas from now, you will become a Buddha who would guide an immeasurable number of sentient beings. Your name would be Lamplight Buddha.” With tears of gratitude falling down from the corners of her eyes, thinking about how rare it is to be able to encounter a Buddha in this world, the poor girl knelt down and brought her palms together, requesting permission to leave home and enter the monastic life. After becoming a nun, she thoroughly dedicated herself to progressing on the path, and was deeply respected for her diligence and high moral conduct. <br></p>
              <h1 style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium'; font-size: 14px; color: #996600; line-height: normal;">Reflection</h1>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #4c4c4c; line-height: 26px;">The meaning of alms-giving cannot be found within the amount of money donated, but only within the genuine and sincere heart in which it is given with. When our lives are happy and free from worry, it can be difficult for us to bring rise to this fearless mind of giving as well as making firm vows. We should learn from this poor girl Nantuo, that in life we need to diligently cultivate the ways of virtue, and even in our greatest periods of hardship or stress, we still should try to give to the best of our abilities, and to make offerings and show our respect towards all sentient beings. With a heart of charity, we can light the bright lanterns not only for ourselves, but for all sentient beings.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,
                                                          
                                                  <br><br>I find Venerable Hsuan Hua's views on a number of issues somewhat extreme and traditional. It is very obvious that Venerable Hsuan Hua is a traditionalist. I respect his opinions but I think putting forth such 'threats and fears' is not appropriate. <br><br>In Dharmawheel there is another thread about how Venerable Hsuan Hua thought that homosexuals will be in hell. Obviously, such are very traditionalist views. Buddha did not say anything about homosexuality for lay person, so I don't think he had any basis to make such claims. It is purely his opinion and he should not put it out as if it is fact or Buddha's teaching.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=9638&amp;sid=1b1271f870a0791044f0d4ba71a91414">http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&amp;t=9638&amp;sid=1b1271f870a0791044f0d4ba71a91414</a><br><br>I wouldn't take such sayings seriously even if it comes from Buddhist masters. Sometimes Buddhist masters are also plain wrong. Don't let popularity of someone affect your judgment and reasoning. Buddhism is not about blind following of some monks. Read kalama sutta. It is unfortunate that many Buddhists nowadays are naive and blind faith followers of monks.<br><br> I am very liberal, even ok with the idea of gay marriage. And I am 100% sure you will not have bad karmic effect for remarriage. Sometimes we must relinquish traditional, outdated thinking and embrace progress.<br><br>Just 50 years ago many societies still cannot accept multiracial mixing like in U.S. the whites and blacks are seggregated. Nowadays if you suggest they should be seggregated, you will be laughed at and labelled racist. The same with 'gay marriage' in the future. The same with 'remarriage'.<br><br>Don't be dogmatic and traditionalist!</p>

              <p>Personally, I don't think remarriage is a sexual misconduct at all.</p>
              <p>My views on sexual misconduct:</p>
              <p>1) uncontrollable addiction to sex</p>
              <p>2) forced sex</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I'm on the border line about prostitution. It depends. Forced into prostitution (sold etc) or one's freewill. </span></p>

              <p>Thanks all for your input. I would like to not believe what Master Hsuan Hua said, but I heard he is known for his spiritual penetration and that he observed things in meditation that are beyond our grasp. Not sure if his statement about the remarried person was something he also saw in meditation or it's just something he believed in... The post below was something that bothered me.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">What he did state, apparently based on what he had actually observed in meditation, was that the lowest levels of animal ghosts (as I recall, I believe he was referring to low-level animal ghosts who were in the process of falling yet farther down into the abyss of bad karma) might manifest as swarms of insects, which would help discharge the karmic retribution accumulated by the very low level animal. Presumably, after a time then there would be rebirth again as one of these very low level animals and then gradual ascent back up towards the human realm, a process which could even take kalpas.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">Another instance: He spoke of instances of a single being taking rebirth as a small group of animals, this involving apparently a paying off of some of the heaviest karma, apparently followed by a re-integration either into a higher animal or a preta or eventually, a person.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">The above cases are indeed controversial. But Master Hua's meditative experiences were not what you or I encounter on the meditation cushion. He would not have spoken of these sorts of cases if he had not personally observed them to be the case.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">You may have encountered yet other sorts of reports in his writings that I wasn't around at the time to hear. Can't imagine though that he would ever state this to be the case of one human being reborn as multiple humans.</span><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">Dharmamitra</span></p>

              <span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda in his paper titled
              â€˜A Happy Married Life - A Buddhist Viewâ€™, gives some useful advice
              on the subject of sexual misconduct. Quote:</span></span></p>
              <p class="" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">
              <span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;">.....</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Laymen are advised in the Buddha's Teaching to
              avoid sexual misconduct. That means if one wants to experience sex,
              he must do so without creating any violence or by using any kind of
              force, threat or causing fear. A decent sex life, which respects
              the other partnerâ€¦â€¦.</span></span></p>

              <span style="font-size: 13pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">.....To the question of whether Buddhists
              can keep more than one wife, the direct answer is not available in
              the Buddha's teaching, because as mentioned earlier, the Buddha did
              not lay down any religious laws with regard to married life
              although he has given valuable advice on how to lead a respectable
              married lifeâ€¦..</span></span></p>

              <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">.....</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Although the Buddha did not mention anything
              regarding the number of wives a man could have, he explicitly
              mentioned in His discourses that should a married man go to another
              woman out of wedlock, that could become the cause of his own
              downfall and he would have to face numerous other problems and
              disturbancesâ€¦â€¦</span></span></p>

              if a husband and wife really cannot live together, instead of
              leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy, anger and
              hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live

              <p>If I may add a Christian perspective to this. The issue of sexual misconduct is addressed in the Bible too. The Bible has a lot to say about sex!</p>
              <p>Firstly, God created the first man and first woman. It was thus heterosexual relationship. It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. This is the basis for marriage between one man and one woman. Neither did God make one man and many women, for that would imply polygamy. It was one man one woman.</p>
              <p>Secondly, marriage is the closest union because Eve was taken from the side of Adam, thus the notion of husband and wife as "one flesh" union. It was so historically and thus so now.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the body is supposed to be the temple of God, which is why God restrict sexual relations to husband and wife.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, the Bible is silent on the issue of remarriage, and Christians have differing views on this.</p>
              <p>Fifthly, the notion of sexual misconduct presupposes that there is right conduct in terms of sexuality. What is this right conduct? Where do we get the notion of right conduct from?</p>

              Christians have differing views on this.</p>
              <p>Fifthly, the notion of sexual misconduct presupposes that there
              is right conduct in terms of sexuality. What is this right conduct?
              Where do we get the notion of right conduct from?</p>
