              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 22.45pt; text-align: justify;">I
              tell two different stories about how I discovered Buddhism. One of them is that
              I started meditating to relieve anxiety and came to Buddhism just from learning
              more about meditation. The other is that I learned about Buddhism when I took a
              class in college and something about it inspired me to become a Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I’ll
              tell them both here. If I’m honest, I have to tell you that I don’t remember
              which one is true.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">As
              a kid I had some spiritual experiences. I experienced what Dogen calls, </span><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/bodhisattvaroad/2016/04/kensho/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #509ac9;'>“the
              dropping away of body and mind.” </span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Not in any special situation. It
              just happened to me a few times.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              hadn’t heard of anything like the path to awakening, so in my mind I thought of
              it in different ways. But, I think deep down it was always the path to
              awakening, the mystic’s path, that I was thinking of. I just made up metaphors
              to fill in the gaps.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              sometimes imagined I would step through a doorway and enter another world—a
              pure land of wonder. But, the truth was I didn’t need to look for a pure land
              of wonder, because I’m already in one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And
              so are you. The pure land is right here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Anyway,
              by the time I started college I felt alone in the universe. I had lost both my
              parents to cancer. My brother—my only sibling—and I were never really close. He
              is eight years older than me, so I didn’t really grow up with him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              fell into a deep dark hole, as can be imagined. My parents left me an
              inheritance. It wasn’t a substantial inheritance. We weren’t wealthy, but it
              was enough for me to go to college. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my
              life, so I went to college. That’s what I thought I was supposed to do. I can
              remember as a very young child wanting to be a writer, but at some point
              between childhood and young adulthood I just let that dream go. I decided it
              was unrealistic, which it was. It still is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">A
              lot of people try a lot of different things in college. A lot of people have a
              lot of fun and remember it as the best time in their life. I was essentially
              grieving the whole time. College was certainly not the best time of my life. I
              suffered from anxiety and depression. It was a very very bad time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              can remember one time that I was sad and I contemplated suicide. I was just so
              sad and I felt so very alone. I stood on a bridge overlooking a busy highway,
              I-35, and I thought about jumping. I stood at the edge and really considered
              it. What a gruesome way to go! The fall wasn’t very far. The fall wouldn’t kill
              me. It would be the cars zooming by at eighty miles an hour. I’d land in front
              of one that wasn’t able to stop and it would run me over. Then there would be
              tires screeching, cars would collide in their efforts to avoid hitting this
              young man laying in the street. What a mess! Now I know there’s a chance that I
              wouldn’t even die from that if I had jumped. Needless to say, I didn’t do it.
              But I stood on that bridge overlooking that highway for a long time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              saw a therapist. I didn’t open up to him much, but I told him I was anxious and
              depressed. He prescribed me an SSRI medication. I know medication works really
              well for some people. It didn’t work for me, or it worked too well. It made me
              a crazy person. I would do things like give strangers great big hugs and I
              would always say what I was thinking instead of having any sort of filter. And
              a couple of times I groped women that I didn’t know very well. It’s fortunate
              that I realized these pills were a problem and stopped taking them before
              anything bad happened to me. Things could have gone south very easily.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              quit taking them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              was grasping at straws, trying to figure out how to get through life. I went
              back to that therapist and told him that I couldn’t take the pills anymore. He
              asked if I had heard of meditation, that it was a technique to manage anxiety.
              I had never heard of it, but I became interested. I wanted to learn more. I
              never saw that therapist again. I wish I could thank him, but I don’t remember
              his name.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              went to the library to look for books on meditation. If I was in the modern
              world I might have looked it up on the internet. But it was 1999. If there even
              was an internet back then, I wasn’t on it. The first book I read was
              “Meditation in Action” by Chogyam Trungpa. Soon after that I read “The Miracle
              of Mindfulness” by Thich Nhat Hanh.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              tried it. I started meditating every day and after a while it worked. I could
              focus. I could manage my anxiety and stop ruminating all the time. Anxiety
              became something I could manage. It was really really good for me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In
              these books I learned a little bit about Buddhism. There wasn’t all that much
              information in these books, but they laid a foundation for me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And
              I read “The Dharma Bums” by Jack Kerouac. I had read “On the Road” in high
              school and I had enjoyed it a great deal. It was his followup to “On the Road”.
              It was on a list of books about meditation, but it probably didn’t belong
              there. It’s a fictionalized account of his life as a Buddhist in America in the
              middle of the twentieth century. There’s a few things Kerouac didn’t exactly
              get right in writing about Buddhism. This is because at the time they really
              didn’t have the amount of scholarship that we have now. But, in spite of this
              it’s a work of genius. It’s my favorite book, by far. I think it’s more
              responsible than anything else, with the possible exception of my parents
              deaths, for the path that I’m on now. It’s not a very good introduction to
              Buddhism, but it presents a level of enthusiasm for the path that few books can
              match.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">One
              more really significant thing happened during my college years. I took a World
              Religions class. We had a unit on Buddhism. It was actually one of the main
              units in the class. That’s where I was pulled in. I got to learn about it in a
              classroom setting instead of simply reading about it. I learned about the
              different traditions and lineages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The
              Four Noble Truths really spoke to me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">I
              had learned a lot about </span><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/bodhisattvaroad/2016/04/the-buddha-and-the-truth-about-suffering/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #509ac9;'>suffering</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> and
              impermanence at an earlier age than most. And the Buddha taught the truth of
              suffering and the way out of suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It
              was what I really needed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Something
              about the Zen tradition really spoke to me too. I started for looking for more
              information. I started reading everything could find about Buddhism, along with
              continuing my daily meditation practice.</span></p>

              the end of college I was calling myself a Buddhist.</span></p>
