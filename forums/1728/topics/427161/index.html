              <p>
              </p><p>True Emptiness for all Seekers</p>
              <p>What is the state of Emptiness and how can it be perceived?</p>
              <p>It is sometimes assumed that the state of “being?” termed emptiness is uniquely</p>
              <p>associated with Buddhist thinking. This appears to be primarily due to the Buddha’s</p>
              <p>insistence to the effect that no true Self or super-Self can be detected anywhere</p>
              <p>beyond the false personal self. That is, no self of any kind exists in human</p>
              <p>consciousness or beyond and that furthermore, all appearances that give rise to the</p>
              <p>idea of a self are merely chimera’s arising as the result of exercises in personal</p>
              <p>gratification.</p>
              <p>Yet it can readily be observed that the world of name and form certainly appears to</p>
              <p>exist as an externality to ordinary human consciousness. This leads to the</p>
              <p>proposition that either the world truly exists as an externality or it arises as a direct</p>
              <p>projection of mind, at some deeper level of consciousness (at least). If the world</p>
              <p>arises as the result of such a mind-dependent projection or, if the proposition to the</p>
              <p>effect that form is emptiness and emptiness is form is allowed then a dependency</p>
              <p>on either the act of discrimination or of mind alone must be admitted</p>
              <p>If success is achieved following the systematic attempt to deconstruct the ego or</p>
              <p>personal s self (as by raising the question “who am I?”)the very first realization</p>
              <p>(recollection really) that the ground-consciousness will experience is the</p>
              <p>“observation” that the entire infrastructure comprising the world immediately “falls</p>
              <p>away”. By this I mean the physical world disappears (dissolves) and the observing</p>
              <p>identity realizes that both the attributes of the personal self and those of the world</p>
              <p>exist only in consciousness. The realized observer is then conscious, aware that</p>
              <p>both foregoing categories (personal self and the world) are non-substantial, existing</p>
              <p>only in consciousness and can be reassembled “at will”. And that furthermore, the</p>
              <p>realized identity alone has been (was) responsible for assembling both the personal</p>
              <p>self and the infrastructure that supported it.</p>
              <p>If the process of self-realization proceeds further three additional spiritual facts</p>
              <p>emerge (are remembered). The first such recollection is that the subject identity is</p>
              <p>alone and ever has been so. The second is that the figment of “time” has been</p>
              <p>dispensed with and has been superseded by the identity “now only” and third that a</p>
              <p>nearly infinite array of personal lives exist simultaneously in consciousness along</p>
              <p>with the recently vacated “current life”.</p>
              <p>It is the realization, recollection of this seemingly endless array of “alternate” lives</p>
              <p>that coalesces into the state of being-consciousness-bliss. Thus, there is indeed a</p>
              <p>state of being-consciousness-bliss but it is nowhere near to being an “absolute”. For</p>
              <p>one thing it is a state of consciousness – it can be and is “known” but it does not</p>
              <p>itself know that it is the source of all that exists (so to speak) and nor does it</p>
              <p>directly claim to be such although the creative capacity is none-the-less inherent in</p>
              <p>each incarnation that it has undertaken to produce. It only knows itself to be a</p>
              <p>“state of grace” hence the term: being-consciousness-bliss. It knows beyond itself</p>
              <p>only that it is the true (but not absolute) source of the constantly reincarnating</p>
              <p>personal self. Hence, upon reaching this state, the fusion therewith is equivalent to</p>
              <p>“homecoming” one might say. This is the timeless reality known as the Atman, the</p>
              <p>direct source of the array of reincarnating personalities.</p>
              <p>This state of being-consciousness-bliss however, can be immediately banished by</p>
              <p>the query “from whence being-consciousness-bliss”? The instantaneous result</p>
              <p>thereof being visitation into the profound, a state that cannot be recalled into</p>
              <p>consciousness for the simple reason that it entails no trace of consciousness and is</p>
              <p>thus prior to “being-consciousness-bliss” (which itself, as detailed above, is a</p>
              <p>consciously achieved state). What claim could possibly be raised to justify this?</p>
              <p>Simple really, the conscious consequence there-from is a subsequently emergent</p>
              <p>identity which can be characterized as “I am that from which all derives”. This state</p>
              <p>is termed Brahman, the divine reality and it is the underlying ground of the world.</p>
              <p>However, although it appears subjectively as the support of all, it is properly the</p>
              <p>intermediate source of the world of name and form. It is a mistaken identity in that</p>
              <p>although it is the primary appearance in/as consciousness (issuing from the</p>
              <p>profound) and it does see itself as source of all that follows, it none-the-less</p>
              <p>emerges from the profound (from emptiness itself) and is therefore not the true</p>
              <p>source, even if it is a fully formed identity i.e. a “capacity” in consciousness. Being a</p>
              <p>“first appearance” it considers itself the “originator” of all that is and all that there</p>
              <p>is to be.</p>
              <p>If emptiness is truly outside of consciousness how can such a state be</p>
              <p>apprehended? Careful inspection reveals that there is a “gap” in experience</p>
              <p>between the question “wherefrom being-consciousness-bliss” as raised within</p>
              <p>“being-consciousness-bliss” and the emergence of the identity “I am that from</p>
              <p>which all derives”. This gap (or reflection sphere, for want of a better term than</p>
              <p>“emptiness”) can be alluded to as constituting “true emptiness”.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is thus something "solitary", unspeakable, un-knowable, un-reportable</p>
              <p>into which consciousness disappears as soon as discrimination ceases and this</p>
              <p>immediately follows the query "where-from being-consciousness-bliss?" The seed of</p>
              <p>the creator and the creator's universe subsequently emerges (from emptiness)</p>
              <p>under the false (deluded) identity "I am that from which all derives" but the true</p>
              <p>"source" (reflection point/sphere) ever remains as "emptiness" the condition that</p>
              <p>arises as when discrimination ceases............unknowable in consciousness because</p>
              <p>(it is) beyond (prior to) the capacity which supports consciousness which latter, in</p>
              <p>turn possesses the ability to know itself and thereby (to manifest) manifests "the</p>
              <p>world of name and form" and all therein. The term “Para-Brahman” the formless</p>
              <p>aspect of Divinity beyond Brahman is equivalent to “true emptiness”.</p>
              <p>So, how may we seek to explain elemental Advaita (non-duality) in relation to its</p>
              <p>“single-minded” insistence that "There is only ever the non-dual reality and, from</p>
              <p>the vantage point of the person in the world, there is either knowing this or not</p>
              <p>knowing it" or again "All is presence in which all apparent thoughts and concepts,</p>
              <p>events and actions, arise spontaneously" and so forth. Well, once again, the answer</p>
              <p>to this question is simple, such advocates have overlooked the aspect of</p>
              <p>“emptiness” simply because they have not “seen or detected” it and have projected</p>
              <p>themselves directly into the erroneous and deluded identity being the state of “I am</p>
              <p>that from which all derives” and this is rephrased as “all is presence in which all</p>
              <p>apparent thoughts and concepts, events and actions, arise spontaneously” and</p>
              <p>again “there is only ever the non-dual reality” and so forth.</p>
              <p>Emptiness is a state of (presumed) being about which nothing can be said. It is</p>
              <p>known to exist by consciousness only as a gap therein. It is the gap between beingconsciousness-</p>
              <p>bliss (Atman) and the immediately emergent identity or "being that</p>
              <p>knows itself as 'that from which all derives'"(the manifest Self or Brahman).</p>
              <p>However, although the state of “I am that from whence all derives” sees itself as</p>
              <p>instigator, when fully realized it is also immediately aware of the pain and suffering</p>
              <p>experienced by all sentient beings which it posits against the pure nature of the</p>
              <p>perfection which it conceives of as being consonant with its origin. Compassion does</p>
              <p>not arise de novo from emptiness but as the result of emptiness scanning the</p>
              <p>effects of its emergent creative impulse. The Heart Sutra speaks clearly and</p>
              <p>decisively to this.</p>
              <p>Similarly the statement , roared by the Upanishads, to the effect "That Thou Art" is</p>
              <p>a definite state but it is not the "Absolute" and one can know that because it can be</p>
              <p>recalled as “I am that from which all derives”. The absolute state cannot be recalled</p>
              <p>because it is "void", Nirvana (all sense of small self and of Higher Self (Atman-</p>
              <p>Brahman) "blown out" as the Buddha said, "something solitary...") - so how can it</p>
              <p>possibly be "recalled"?</p>
              <p>The “Awakening of Faith” (a Mahayana root-text) speaks of final enlightenment in</p>
              <p>the following terms: to be fully enlightened is to have reached the fountainhead of</p>
              <p>the mind. Such a designation refers to those free from deluded thought, able to</p>
              <p>perceive that which is beyond thought, and to have thus awakened to the</p>
              <p>perception that ALL THOUGHT can be likened to "dream only”.</p>
              <p>I could go on in detail but you will get the point. It’s all one ....thing man! One thing</p>
              <p>that is a no-thing or everything depending entirely on the attainment achieved by</p>
              <p>the observer/reporter – from the comparative simplicity volunteered by the plethora</p>
              <p>of those that adhere to the creed currently trumpeted by neo advaita to more</p>
              <p>discerning and sophisticated versions of nirvana-emptiness- compassion and so</p>
              <p>forth coupled with the intellectual and practical infrastructure provided by modes of</p>
              <p>practice in one form or another, some conservative some seemingly otherwise.</p>
