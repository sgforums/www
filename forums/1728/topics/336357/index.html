              <p class="MsoNormal">As
                                          a student of clinical psychology in the 1960s, I found myself intrigued
                                          by the question: “What allows for real personality changes in people,
                                          and how does that change come about?” At that time, I was involved with
                                          my teacher Eugene Gendlin at the University of Chicago in his early
                                          attempts at developing the Focusing method. The term that Gendlin
                                          (1981, 1996) used to describe therapeutic movement was <em>felt shift -- </em>that
                                          moment when a change in feeling resonated concretely in the body,
                                          revealing a new sense of meaning and direction. In this critical moment
                                          of experiential unfolding – which is correlated with various
                                          physiological and cognitive changes – an old fixation gives way, like a
                                          flower opening, providing a person with a new experience of themselves
                                          and their situation. When I first learned about this, and experienced
                                          it myself, it seemed quite mysterious and profound, almost like a
                                          mini-mystical experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At
                                          the same time, I was delving into Zen, and had become interested in the
                                          relationship between the felt shift and satori, the sudden awakening
                                          that was at the heart of Zen. I was particularly intrigued by the Zen
                                          stories where just by hearing the cry of a bird, sweeping the floor, or
                                          being slapped by one’s teacher, the disciple woke up and saw reality in
                                          an entirely new way. Satori seemed like an immense, cosmic felt shift,
                                          where one’s whole life suddenly changed, and one walked away a new
                                          being. I wondered how the felt shift and satori were related. Were they
                                          relatives of each other, two versions of the same thing or something
                                          different altogether?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As a budding student of
                                          both Buddhism and psychotherapy, this was not an academic question for
                                          me, but one that had important personal and professional implications.
                                          If the felt shift was a kind of mini-satori, or even a step in that
                                          direction, then perhaps Western psychological work could provide a new
                                          way to approach the kind of realizations that had been previously been
                                          the sole province of mystics and monastics.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Psychological Reflection </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Later,
                                          when I began to practice as a psychotherapist, this question took a new
                                          turn. By then I had done a fair degree of both psychological and
                                          meditative work, and had experienced powerful impacts from each.
                                          Although both types of work required inner attention and awareness, I
                                          was also struck by how different they were in their ways of approaching
                                          the flow of experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">On the one hand, the
                                          therapeutic process involved stepping back from one’s felt experience
                                          in order to inquire into it in a dialogical manner. In the course of
                                          the therapeutic dialogue – with the therapist and with one’s own
                                          feelings – felt experience would open up, hidden felt meanings would
                                          unfold, and feelings would shift, leading to important cognitive,
                                          affective, and behavioural changes (Gendlin, 1964; Welwood, 1982).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At
                                          the same time, I was also studying the Mahamudra/Dzogchen meditative
                                          tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, which presented a very different
                                          approach. The method here involved a more radical opening to whatever
                                          experience was at hand, instead of stepping back from it, unfolding
                                          felt meanings from it, or engaging in dialogical inquiry. Working with
                                          experience in this way could lead to more sudden, on-the-spot kinds of
                                          revelation, described variously in terms of <em>transmutation, self-liberation, </em>or <em>spontaneous presence </em>(Trungpa, 1973; Welwood, 1979; Norbu, 1982, 1986).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                          this approach, one directly recognizes and meets one’s experience as it
                                          is, without concern for what it means, where it comes from, or where it
                                          leads. There is no reinforcement of an observing self trying to grasp,
                                          understand, or come to terms with some observed content of
                                          consciousness. The early stages of Dzogchen/Mahamudra meditation teach
                                          the student to let go of fixation on whatever arises in the mind, and
                                          this eventually develops the capacity to relax and abide wakefully in
                                          the mist of whatever experience is arising. When there is no
                                          identification either with the observer or what is observed, awareness
                                          remains undisturbed by any divisions, and a new freedom, freshness,
                                          clarity, and compassion become available. This nondual awareness, in
                                          the words of the Indian teacher, H.L.Poonja (1993, p. 33), “is your
                                          very own awareness, and it is called <em>freedom from everything.</em>”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">While
                                          psychotherapy and meditation both led to a freeing of mental and
                                          emotional fixations, the meditative approach struck me as the more
                                          profound and compelling of the two, because it was more direct, more
                                          radical, more faithful to the essential nature of awareness as an open
                                          presence intrinsically free of grasping, strategizing, and the
                                          subject-object split altogether. At the same time, the reflective
                                          dialogical process of psychotherapy provided a more effective and
                                          accessible way to work on the issues, concerns, and problems of
                                          personal and worldly life – which meditators often tend to avoid
                                          dealing with. Yet I had doubts about the ultimate merits of an approach
                                          that did not address, and was not designed to overcome, the
                                          subject-object struggle that lay at the root of most human alienation
                                          and suffering.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Two therapeutic devices I
                                          found useful in my early years as a therapist were a particular focus
                                          of these doubts. Long before “inner child” work became popularized by
                                          John Bradshaw, I discovered that many people who could not relate to
                                          their feelings of hurt, fear, helplessness, anger, or sorrow in a
                                          helpful way, compassionate way <em>could </em>do so when they
                                          imagined these feelings as belonging to the child still alive within
                                          them. Since I had stumbled on this device on my own, rather than
                                          adopting it from a preconceived theoretical framework, it seemed all
                                          the more impressive to me. Yet I also remained aware of its
                                          shortcoming: It left the person inwardly split between an observing
                                          “adult” and an observed “child.” With most of the feeling-energy
                                          seeming to belong to the child.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“Finding the
                                          right distance from a feeling” was another useful device, and a central
                                          feature of the Focusing method I taught for many years. Many clients
                                          who get too close to threatening feelings either became overwhelmed by
                                          them or else reject them in order to defend themselves from their
                                          intensity. So establishing a certain reflective distance from strong
                                          feelings makes it easier to relate to them, just as a stepping back
                                          from someone who is speaking loudly makes it more possible to hear what
                                          they are saying. Finding the right distance involves situating one’s
                                          attention “next to” the feeling, on the edge of it, close enough to be
                                          in contact with it, yet far enough away to feel comfortable. This
                                          stepped-back position is a useful therapeutic device that allows an
                                          interactive dialogue with feelings that might not otherwise be
                                          possible. However, if this is the only way one relates to one’s
                                          experiences, it can also maintain and reinforce an inner separation –
                                          between observing ego and the observed flow of experience – that can
                                          eventually become a limitation in its own right.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                          further I went with meditation, the less satisfied I was only drawing
                                          on reflective methods that maintained this inner division. From the
                                          perspective of contemplative practice, the root source of human
                                          suffering is this very split between “me” and “my experience.”
                                          Suffering is nothing other than the observer judging, resisting,
                                          struggling with, and attempting to control experiences that seem
                                          painful, scary, or threatening to it. Without that struggle, difficult
                                          feelings can be experienced more simply and directly, instead of as
                                          dire threats to the survival and integrity of “me.” Conventional
                                          psychotherapy teaches clients to understand, manage, and reduce the
                                          suffering that arises out of identification with a separate ego-self,
                                          but rarely questions the fundamental inner setup that gives rise to it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Divided and Undivided Consciousness</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Although
                                          reflective methods are certainly essential for therapeutic work, my
                                          experience with Dzogchen/Mahamudra meditation lets me see how they were
                                          still an expression, in Eastern terms, of divided consciousness. The
                                          Sanskrit term for the ordinary, mundane state of consciousness is <em>vijnana. Vi </em>could be translated as <em>divided</em> and <em>jnana </em>as <em>knowing. Divided </em>here
                                          refers to the subject/object split, in which the divide between
                                          observer and observed, perceiver and perceived is a primary determinant
                                          of how and what we perceive. All conventional knowledge, including what
                                          we discover in psychotherapy, happens within the framework of divided
                                          consciousness, as phenomenologist Peter Koestenbaum (1978) observes:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>All
                                          knowledge is of this dual sort, and psychotherapeutic intervention is
                                          no exception... Psychotherapy, like all other forms of knowledge, is
                                          reflection on self; it is self-knowledge and self-consciousness. (pp.
                                          35, 70)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When we reflect on self, self becomes divided – into an object of reflection and an observing subject. This is <em>vijnana</em> at work. Dividing the field of experience into two poles is a useful
                                          device for most purposes and yields relative self-knowledge. We learn
                                          about our conditioning, our character structure, our particular ways of
                                          thinking, feeling, acting, and perceiving. While these discoveries can
                                          be relatively liberating, <em>who we are</em> can never be
                                          identical with the mind/body patterns we discover through reflective
                                          discernment. Nor are we identical with the perceiver that stands back
                                          from those patterns and reflects on them. Both these poles are
                                          creations of the conceptual mind, which operates by dividing the
                                          experiential field in two and interpreting reality through concepts
                                          based on this division.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Precise attention to
                                          the nature of experiencing reveals that most of our perception and
                                          cognition is conditioned by this conceptual divide. For example, we
                                          generally do not see a tree in its unique and vivid immediacy – in its
                                          suchness. Instead, our experience of the tree is shaped by ideas and
                                          beliefs about a category of objects called “tree.” Krishnamurti (1976),
                                          by contrast, describes what it is like to see a tree in a more direct,
                                          unalienated way:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>You look at this
                                          magnificent tree and you wonder who is watching whom and presently
                                          there is no watcher at all. Everything is so intensely alive and there
                                          is only life, and the watcher is as dead as that leaf... Utterly
                                          still... listening without a moment of action, without recording,
                                          without experiencing, only seeing and listening... really the outside
                                          is the inside and the inside is the outside, and it is difficult,
                                          almost impossible to separate them. (p. 214)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just
                                          as “the news” pretends to be an accurate and neutral presentation of
                                          world events, while concealing its hidden biases, so we imagine that
                                          conventional divided consciousness gives us an accurate portrayal of
                                          what lies before us, while failing to see how our conceptual
                                          assumptions usually produce a distorted picture of reality. In this
                                          way, we do not experience “things as they are” – in their rich and
                                          vivid experiential immediacy. As the great Dzogchen yogi Mipham put it:
                                          “Whatever one imagines, it is never exactly like that” (Kunsang, 1993,
                                          p. 114).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This habitually distorted perception – where we unconsciously mistake our cognitive schema for reality – is, in Buddhist terms, <em>samsara, </em>“delusive
                                          appearance.” The basis of samsara is the ongoing habit of dividing the
                                          field of experience in two and imaging that the observing self is
                                          something set apart from the rest of the field. Meditative experience
                                          reveals a different kind of knowing, a direct recognition of “thatness”
                                          or “suchness”—the vivid, ineffable newness of reality, as disclosed in
                                          the clarity of pure awareness, free from the constraints of conceptual
                                          or dualistic fixation. When this kind of knowing is directed inwardly,
                                          it becomes what is called in Zen “directly seeing into one’s own
                                          nature.” In this case, “one’s own nature” is not an object of thought,
                                          observation, or reflection. Mind in its objectifying mode cannot grasp
                                          the immediate beingness of anything, least of all its own nature.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">We
                                          can only perceive the suchness of things through an awareness that
                                          opens to them nonconceptually and unconditionally, allowing them to
                                          reveal themselves in their as-it-is-ness. As the poet Basho suggests:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>From the pine tree</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Learn of the pine tree</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>And from the bamboo</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>of the bamboo.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Commenting on these lines, the Japanese philosopher Nishitani (1982) explains that Basho does not mean</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>That
                                          we should ‘observe the pine tree carefully.’ Still less does he mean
                                          for us to ‘study the pine tree scientifically.’ He means for us to
                                          enter the mode of being where the pine tree is the pine tree itself, and
                                          the bamboo is the bamboo itself, and from there to look at the pine
                                          tree and the bamboo. He calls on us to betake ourselves to the
                                          dimension where things become manifest in their suchness. (p. 128)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                          the same vein, Zen Master Dogen advises: “You should not restrict
                                          yourselves to learning to see water from the viewpoints of human beings
                                          alone. Know that you must see water in the way water sees water”
                                          (Izutsu, 1972, p. 140). “Seeing water in the way water sees water” means
                                          recognizing water in its suchness, free of all concepts that spring
                                          from an observing mind standing back from experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Extending
                                          these lines from Basho and Dogen into the arena of self-realization, we
                                          might say, “if you want to find out who you are, open directly to
                                          yourself right now, enter into the mode of being where you are what you
                                          are, and settle into your own nature. Just as a snapshot of the bamboo
                                          is not the bamboo itself, how can the mental snapshots you have of
                                          yourself – the ideas and conclusions about yourself you have come to
                                          through reflective observation – be an accurate rendering of who you
                                          really are?” Divided consciousness – <em>vi-jnana – </em>can never yield <em>jnana – </em>direct, unmediated knowing, undivided consciousness, self-illuminating awareness, self-existing wisdom. <em>Jnana </em><span> </span>is
                                          a different type of self-knowing, primarily discovered through
                                          contemplative discipline, where freedom from the subject-object setup
                                          allows direct “seeing into one’s own nature.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Stretched
                                          between the disciplines of psychotherapy and meditation, I found myself
                                          continually revisiting these questions: How might psychological
                                          reflection serve as a stepping-stone on the path of awakening? Or since
                                          psychological reflection by its very nature was a form of divided
                                          consciousness, could it subtly perpetuate a permanent state of inner
                                          division in the name of healing? I knew certain spiritual teachers and
                                          practitioners who advanced a critique of therapy to this effect. They
                                          argued that psychotherapy was a palliative, a way of making the prison
                                          of ego more comfortable, because it did not address, but instead
                                          reinforced, the error at the root of all suffering: identification with
                                          a separate self that was always trying to control or alter its
                                          experience. At the other extreme, many therapists I knew regarded
                                          spiritual practice as an avoidance of dealing with the personal and
                                          interpersonal knots that interfered with living a full, rich, engaged
                                          life.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">While psychological and spiritual work
                                          can certainly have these pitfalls, I could not side with either of
                                          these extreme views. I respected psychotherapy as a domain in its own
                                          right, using methods and perspectives that were valid in their own
                                          context, without necessarily having to conform to the highest standards
                                          of nondual realization. And I also felt that it was possible to build a
                                          bridge between psychological reflection, which yields valid relative
                                          self-knowledge, even though mediated by divided consciousness, and the
                                          deeper, undivided awareness and wordless knowing discovered in
                                          meditation. I wanted to see how these two kinds of self-knowing might
                                          work together as part of a larger dialectic of awakening that could
                                          include and bring together the two poles of human existence –
                                          conditioned and unconditioned, relative and absolute, psychological and
                                          spiritual, personal and universal.<em></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It
                                          was through pursuing these questions that my own therapeutic approach
                                          evolved in the direction of what I now call “psychological work in a
                                          spiritual context” or “presence-centered psychotherapy.” By providing
                                          an intermediate step between conventional psychological reflection and
                                          the deeper process of meditation, this way of working has proved to be
                                          more congruent with my meditative experience than the way I first
                                          practiced therapy. In the remainder of this chapter, I will situate
                                          this intermediate step within a larger dialectic of awakening as it
                                          unfolds through psychological reflection and spiritual presence.</p>

              <p><strong>The Basic Problem: Prereflective Identification</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What
                                          makes our ordinary state of consciousness problematic, according to
                                          both psychological and spiritual traditions, is unconscious
                                          identification. As young children, our awareness is essentially open
                                          and receptive, yet the capacity to reflect on our own experience does
                                          not fully develop until the early teenage years, during the stage that
                                          Piaget termed “formal operations.” Until then, our self-structure is
                                          under the sway of a more primitive capacity – identification.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Because
                                          we lack self-reflective awareness in childhood, we are mostly dependent
                                          on others to help us see and know ourselves – to do our reflecting for
                                          us. So we inevitably start to internalize their reflections – how they
                                          see and respond to us – coming to regard ourselves in terms of how we
                                          appear to others. In this way we develop an ego identity, a stable
                                          self-image composed of self-representations, which are part of larger
                                          relations – self/other schemas formed in our early transactions with
                                          our parents. To form an identity means <em>taking ourselves to be something, </em>based on how others relate to us.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Identification
                                          is like a glue by this consciousness attaches itself to contents of
                                          consciousness – thoughts, feelings, images, beliefs, memories – and
                                          assumes with each of them, “That’s me,” or “That represents me.”
                                          Forming an identity is a way consciousness objectifies itself, makes
                                          itself into an object. It is like looking into a mirror and taking
                                          ourselves to be the visual image reflected back to us, while ignoring
                                          our more intimate, lived experience of embodied being. Identification
                                          is a primitive form of self-knowledge – the best we could do as a
                                          child, given our limited cognitive capacities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">By
                                          the time our capacity for reflective self-knowledge develops, or
                                          identities are fully formed. Our knowledge of ourselves is indirect,
                                          mediated by memories, self-images, and beliefs about ourselves formed
                                          out of these memories and images. Knowing ourselves through
                                          self-images, we have become an object in our own eyes, never seeing the
                                          way in which we are a larger field of being and presence in which these
                                          thought-form arises. We have become prisoners of our own mind and the
                                          ways it has construed reality.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Reflection: Stepping Back for Identification</em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                          first step in freeing ourselves from the prison of unconscious
                                          identification is to make it conscious, that is, to reflect on it. We
                                          cannot move from prereflective identification directly into nondual
                                          awareness. But we <em>can </em>use divided consciousness to
                                          reflect on divided consciousness. The Buddha likened this to using a
                                          thorn to remove a thorn from one’s flesh. All reflection involves
                                          stepping back from one’s experience in order to examine and explore its
                                          patterns, its feeling textures, its meanings, its <em>logos, </em>including
                                          the basic assumptions, beliefs, and ways of conceiving reality that
                                          shape our experience. By comparison with identification, this kind of
                                          self-reflection represents a giant step forward in the direction of
                                          greater self-understanding and freedom. As Gabriel Marcel (1950) put
                                          it, “reflection... is one of life’s ways of rising from one level to
                                          another (p. 101).”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are different ways
                                          of reflecting on one’s experience. Some are cruder; others subtler;
                                          depending on the rigidity of the dualism and the size of gap they
                                          maintain between observer and observed. I would like to distinguish
                                          three levels of reflective method: conceptual reflection,
                                          phenomenological reflection, and mindful witnessing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Conceptual Reflection: Cognitive and Behavioral Analysis</em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                          way most of us begin to reflect on our experience is by thinking about
                                          it – using theories and concepts to explain or analyze what is
                                          happening. Concepts allow us to step out of prereflective immersion in
                                          experience, so that we can see it in a new light or from a new angle.
                                          Most psychological and spiritual traditions draw on conceptual
                                          reflection at first, introducing certain ideas that help people take a
                                          new look at their experience. Buddha’s four noble truths, for example,
                                          are a way of helping people step back from their unconscious suffering
                                          in order to consider its nature and cause, as well as antidotes for it.
                                          In Western psychology, developmental theories, maps of consciousness,
                                          and character typologies serve a similar purpose, providing frameworks
                                          that help people analyze, organize, and understand their experience in
                                          more coherent ways.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some kinds of therapy are based primarily on conceptual reflection. They seek to explain or change the problematic <em>contents </em>of a client’s experience, rather than working with the client’s overall <em>process </em>of
                                          experiencing. This is a relatively crude approach, in that there is no
                                          direct encounter with immediate, lived experiencing. Instead, the
                                          relation to experience is always <em>mediated </em>by
                                          theoretical constructs. The therapist draws on some theory of human
                                          development or behaviour to interpret the client’s experience, while
                                          the client’s main activity is <em>thinking </em>and <em>talking</em> about his or her experience, at one remove from the experience itself.
                                          The therapist might also draw on preformulated techniques to operate on
                                          the client’s behaviour, applying certain cognitive (e.g., reframing,
                                          positive affirmations) or behavioural (e.g., desensitization, emotional
                                          catharsis) strategies to alter the undesirable contents of experience.
                                          This type of approach is often most useful with clients who lack the
                                          ego strength or the motivation to encounter their experience in a more
                                          direct, immediate way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Spiritual traditions
                                          often formulate the contemplative realizations of great teachers of the
                                          past into a “view” that is transmitted to new students in order to help
                                          them discover the essence of spiritual realization for themselves. In
                                          the Mahamudra tradition, for example, the view of awareness as
                                          intrinsically vast and boundless helps point students in that
                                          direction, so that they can discover this for themselves. In the words
                                          of Lodro Thaye, a great Mahamudra master of the eighteenth century:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>When one meditates with this view</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is like a garuda soaring through space</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Untroubled by fear or doubt.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>One who meditates without this view</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Is like a blind man wandering the plains.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">(Nalanda, 1980, p. 84)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Yet such a view can have no transformative effect if it remains only conceptual. Therefore Lodro Thaye adds:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>One who holds this view but does not meditate</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Is like a rich man tethered by stinginess</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Who cannot bring fruition to himself or others.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Joining the view with meditation is the holy tradition.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">(p. 84)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                          danger of any view is that we would start to substitute theory for the
                                          reality it points to. Therefore, in the Mahamudra/Dzogchen tradition,
                                          the master presents the view along with “pointing-out instructions” –
                                          which transmit or experientially reveal to the student the actual state
                                          that the view describes. Then the view becomes the ground of a
                                          contemplative path whose goal is to realize the view in a full
                                          experiential way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Phenomenological Reflection: Meeting Experience Directly</em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Conceptual
                                          reflection that provides a map of where we are or a strategy for how to
                                          proceed gives a general orientation, but has limited value in helping
                                          us relate to where we are right now, more immediately. Conceptual
                                          mapping and analysis – thinking and talking about experience – must
                                          eventually give way to an approach that helps us work directly with
                                          experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Phenomenological reflection is
                                          the putting aside of habitual conceptual assumptions in order to
                                          explore experience in a fresher, looser way. Because it does not impose
                                          preconceived concepts or strategies on experience, it is a more refined
                                          approach. The concepts it uses are “experience-near”: they grow out of,
                                          describe, and point back to what is directly felt and perceived. In
                                          this way phenomenology narrows the gap between observer and observed.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Phenomenological
                                          approaches to psychotherapy regard experiencing as a complex, living
                                          process that cannot be neatly controlled or predicted. Here the
                                          observing consciousness stays close to felt experience, inquiring into
                                          it gently, and waiting patiently for responses and insights to come
                                          directly from there, rather than from some cognitive schema.
                                          Experiencing itself is the guide, revealing directions for change that
                                          unfold in the course of exploring it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For
                                          example, a tension in the chest might first reveal itself as anxiety,
                                          then upon further reflection, as a sense of helplessness, then as an
                                          uncertainty that you are worthy of love. Perhaps you started out
                                          feeling judgmental toward the anxiety, or threatened by it, but as it
                                          reveals itself as an uncertainty about being lovable, a softer
                                          tenderness might arise. And this new way of relating to what you are
                                          going through allows it to unfold further, as the anxiety relaxes and
                                          you feel more compassionate toward yourself. In this kind of
                                          reflection, observer and observed becomes reciprocal poles of a mutual
                                          dance. This stepping-back from habitual reactions and assumptions in
                                          order to come into a fresher relationship with lived experience is the
                                          essence of what is called, in philosophical terms, “the
                                          phenomenological reduction.”</p>

                                          mindfulness meditation, where one is simply attentive to the ongoing
                                          flow of the mindstream, without concern about particular contents of
                                          experience that arise. In this approach the gap between observer and
                                          observed narrows further, in that there is no interest in operating on
                                          the mindstream in any way – through understanding, unfolding,
                                          articulation, or moving toward any release or resolution. In the
                                          context of meditation, any of these aims would indicate the operation
                                          of some mental set or attitude, and thus an interference with the
                                          process of freeing oneself from identification with all mind-states.
                                          While phenomenological reflection is an attempt to find new meaning,
                                          new understanding, new directions, meditation is a more radical path of
                                          <em>undoing – </em>which involves relaxing any tendency to
                                          become caught up in feelings, thoughts, and identifications. Yet
                                          mindfulness practice is not yet the totally relaxed undoing of
                                          Dzogchen, for it still requires some effort of stepping back (from
                                          identification) and witnessing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mindfulness
                                          practice provides a transitional step between reflection and nondual
                                          presence, incorporating elements of both. Directing mindful attention
                                          toward thinking allows us to notice a crucial difference – between
                                          thought and awareness, between the contents of consciousness, which are
                                          like clouds passing through the sky, and pure consciousness, which is
                                          like the wide open sky itself. Letting go of habitual identifications
                                          allows us to enter pure awareness, which is intrinsically free of the
                                          compulsions of thought and emotion. This is an important step in
                                          starting to free ourselves from the prison of dualistic fixation. In
                                          the Dzogchen tradition, this is spoken of as distinguishing the mind
                                          caught in dualism (Tibetan: <em>sems</em>) from pure nondual awareness (<em>rigpa</em>). As the Tibetan teacher Chokyi Nyima (1991) describes this distinction:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Basically
                                          there are two states of mind. Sems refers to the state of conceptual
                                          thinking, involving fixation on some “thing.”... Rigpa means free from
                                          fixation. It refers to a state of natural wakefulness that is without
                                          dualistic clinging. It is extremely important to be clear about the
                                          difference between these two states of mind.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Pure Presence: Awakening Within Experience</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Before
                                          becoming self-reflective, we remain identified with thoughts, beliefs,
                                          feelings, and memories arising in consciousness, and this keeps us
                                          imprisoned in conditioned mind. With reflection, we can start to free
                                          ourselves from these unconscious identifications by stepping back and
                                          observing them. Yet as long as we are stepping back, we remain in a
                                          state of divided consciousness. A further step would be to go beyond
                                          reflection and, without falling back into prereflective identification,
                                          become at-one with our experiencing – through overcoming all struggle
                                          with it, through discovering and abiding in the deep, silent source
                                          from which all experience arises. This third level of the dialectic,
                                          which takes us beyond conventional psychological models and
                                          philosophical frameworks, is postreflective – in that it usually
                                          follows from a groundwork of reflective work – and <em>trans-reflective –</em> in that it discloses a way of being that lies beyond divided consciousness.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Even
                                          phenomenology, which, in emphasizing subject-object interrelatedness,
                                          is one of the most refined, least dualistic Western ways of exploring
                                          human experience, usually fails to go this further step. Peter
                                          Koestenbaum (1978), for example, whose work <em>The New Image of the Person </em>is
                                          a worthy attempt to develop a phenomenological clinical philosophy, and
                                          who is generally sympathetic to meditation and transpersonal experience,
                                          describes meditation only in terms of stepping back. He considers
                                          meditative presence – what he calls the Eternal Now – to be the
                                          ultimate phenomenological reduction:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>“There
                                          is no end to the repressive process of reflection because the field of
                                          consciousness is experienced to be infinite. Specifically, </em>there is infinity in stepping back...<em> The Eternal Now is an experience in which we are no longer inside space and time </em>but have become an observer<span> </span><span> </span>space and time... In meditation, <em>the individual takes a spectatorial attitude towards all experiences... </em>the meditator follows the flow of the body, of a feeling, or of the environment. In this way individuals, can train <em>themselves to become observers rather than participants in life. </em>(pp. 73, 82, 100, 101, my italics)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Koestenbaum’s
                                          words are accurate and scored up through the early stages of reflective
                                          witnessing in mindfulness practice. However, meditation that only goes
                                          this far does not lead beyond divided consciousness. The ultimate
                                          purpose of meditation goes far beyond raining us to be “observers,
                                          rather than participants,” as Koestenbaum claims. Its aim is full
                                          participation in life, but <em>conscious </em>participation,
                                          rather than the unconscious participation of prereflective
                  
                                          identification. What finally replaces divided consciousness is pure
                                          presence.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Of all the phenomenologists,
                                          Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty have perhaps gone their farthest in
                                          acknowledging a mode of awareness beyond subject and object, as well as
                                          its sacred import. Borrowing a term from Meister Eckhart, Heidegger
                                          (1977) speaks of <em>Glassenheit</em>, letting-be, using language reminiscent of Buddhist reference to suchness:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>To </em>let be <em>–
                                          that is, to let beings be as the beings which they are – means to
                                          engage oneself with the open region and its openness into which every
                                          being comes to stand, bringing that openness, as it were, along with
                                          itself. (p. 127).</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Merleau-Ponty (1968) suggests the need to develop what he calls <em>surreflection – </em>which might be translated as “higher reflection” –</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>That
                                          would take itself and the changes it introduces into the spectacle into

                                          descend toward it such as it is... so that the seer and the visible
                                          reciprocate one another and we no longer know which sees and which is
                                          seen. (pp. 38-39, 139)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">These
                                          attempts by two great philosophers to point the way beyond traditional
                                          Western dualistic thought are admirable. Yet even at its best,
                                          phenomenology can point to, but does not provide a true <em>upaya, </em>or path, for fully realizing nondual presence.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                          the practice of Mahamudra/Dzogchen, meditators discover nondual
                                          awareness, at first in glimpses, as the focus on objects of
                                          consciousness gradually drops away and they learn to rest in open
                                          presence, in what rankling Merril-Wolff (1994) called
                                          “consciousness-without-an-object.” This nondual presence could be
                                          described in terms of qualities such as depth, luminosity, or
                                          spaciousness, yet in its immediacy there is no self-reflection on any such
                                          attributes. Instead, one simply rests in the clarity of wide open,
                                          wakeful awareness, without any attempt to alter or fabricate one’s
                                          experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here there is direct
                                          self-knowing, direct recognition of one’s nature as pure being, without
                                          self-reflection. When attention is turned toward, perception as pure
                                          being, without self-reflection. Mutually coemerge When attention is
                                          churned outward, perception is clear and sharp, since it is not clothed
                                          in concepts. The world is not seen as something separate form
                                          awareness, nor is it any less vivid and immediate than awareness
                                          itself. Nor is awareness seen as something subjective, “in here,”
                                          separate from appearance. Awareness and what appears in awareness
                                          mutually coemerge in one unified field of presence.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                          this unified field of presence, neither perceptions nor awareness can
                                          be objectified as anything for the mind to grasp. This ungraspable
                                          quality of experience is the basic meaning of the Buddhist term <em>emptiness. </em>The
                  
                                          Mahamudra tradition speaks of the inseparability of emptiness and
                                          awareness, emptiness and clarity, emptiness and appearance, emptiness
                                          and energy. We could also speak of the inseparability of emptiness and
                                          being. Pure presence is the realization of being-as-emptiness: being
                                          without being some <em>thing. </em>Being is empty, not because
                                          it lacks anything, but because it cannot be comprehended in terms of
                                          any reference point outside itself. Being is precisely what which can
                                          never be grasped or contained in any physical boundary or conceptual
                                          designation. In Nishitani’s (1982) words, “being is only being if it is
                                          one with emptiness. In that sense, emptiness might be called the field
                                          of ‘be-ification’.” (p. 124).<em></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Emptiness
                                          in this sense is not some “attribute” belonging to awareness,
                                          appearance, or being, but their utter transparency when apprehended in
                                          pure presence, beyond the subject-object division. This realization is
                                          called by many different names, such as self-illuminating awareness, <em>jnana, </em>Buddha-nature,
                                          wisdom mind, great bliss, great perfection. As self-illuminating
                                          awareness that simultaneously illuminates the whole field of
                                          experience, pure presence is intimately engagement, rather than
                                          stepped-back detachment. In contrast to reflection, it does not involve
                                          any “doing” at all, as the great Dzogchen Longchenpa indicates when he
                                          says: “Instead of seeking mind by mind, let be” (Guenther, 1977, p. 244)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Once
                                          awareness extricates itself from the fetters of conceptual mind,
                                          through reflection and mindfulness, it can self-realize its intrinsic
                                          nature as pure freedom, relaxation, openness, luminosity, and presence.
                                          This happens, in Mahamudra terms, through “settling itself in its own
                                          nature.” Since this resting in presence goes beyond effort,
                                          one-pointedness, and witnessing, it is called <em>nonmeditation. </em>Although
                                          analogies can suggest what this is like, no word or image can describe
                                          its radiant immediacy, as Lodro Thaye points out:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is space, ungraspable as a thing.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is flawless precious clear crystal.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is the lamp-like radiance of your own self-luminous mind.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is inexpressible, like the experience of a mute.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is unobscured, transparent wisdom.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>The luminous dharmakaya, Buddha-nature,</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>Primordially pure and spontaneous.<br>It cannot be demonstrated through analogy,</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>And cannot be expressed in words.</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>It is the space of Dharma,</em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">(Nalanda, 1980, p. 84)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                          the state of nonmeditation it is no longer necessary to make a
                                          distinction between conceptual mind and pure awareness, in that all
                                          mind-states are recognized as forms of awareness and presence. It is
                                          more of a question of being fully awake within thought, feeling,
                                          perception when they arise, no longer maintaining a hair’s breadth of
                                          separation from whatever arises.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This quality
                                          of pure presence reveals spontaneous clearings in the experiential
                                          stream, without any strategy or intention to create change. There are
                                          two closely related ways in which these changes may occur:
                                          transmutation and self-liberation.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                      Tantric tradition of Vajrayana Buddhism is known as the path of
                                      transformation, in which “impure” experience – marked by ignorance,
                                      dualism, aggression, grasping – is transmuted into “pure” experience –
                                      illumined by awareness, openness, nongrasping, and spontaneous
                                      appreciation. The basic Vajrayana methods of visualization, mantra,
                                      mudra, and symbolic ritual eventually leads to the more advanced,
                                      utterly direct approach of Mahamudra/Dzogchen, where the practitioner
                                      finally cuts through the separation between pure and impure by
                                      completely meeting and opening to the raw immediacy of experience on
                                      the spot.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this direct encounter, the
                                      thick, heavy, fixated quality of experience falls away, revealing a
                                      deeper, living intelligence contained within it. Chogyam Trungpa (1973)
                                      describes this kind of change:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>At
                                      this point whatever is experienced in everyday life through sense
                                      perception is a naked experience, because it is direct. There is no
                                      veil between [you] and “that.”... Tantra teaches not to suppress or
                                      destroy energy but to transmute it; in other words, go with the pattern
                                      of energy... When [you] go with the pattern of energy, then experience
                                      becomes very creative... You realize that you no longer have to abandon
                                      anything. You begin to see the underlying qualities of wisdom in your
                                      life-situation... If you are highly involved in one emotion such as
                                      anger, then by having a sudden glimpse of openness... you begin to see
                                      that you do not have to suppress your energy... but you can transform
                                      your aggression into dynamic energy... If we actually feel the living
                                      quality, the texture of the emotions as they are in the naked state,
                                      then this experience also contains ultimate truth... We discover that
                                      emotion actually does not exist as it appears, but it contains much
                                      wisdom and open space... Then the process of... transmuting the
                                      emotions into wisdom takes place automatically. (pp. 218-219, 221, 222,
                                      234, 235-236)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here there is no
                                      deliberate effort to transmute the emotions; rather, transmutation
                                      happens spontaneously through opening fully to them:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em>You
                                      experience emotional upheaval as it is but... become one with it... Let
                                      yourself be in the emotion, go through it, give in to it, experience
                                      it. You begin to go toward the emotion rather than just experiencing
                                      the emotion coming toward you.... Then the most powerful energies
                                      become absolutely workable... Whatever occurs in the samsaric mind is
                                      regarded as the path; everything is workable. It is a fearless
                                      proclamation – the lion’s roar. (Trungpa, 1976, pp. 70-71)</em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As
                                      a student in this tradition, with a few budding glimpses of what the
                                      previous words might actually refer to, I began to feel that even
                                      Focusing – which was the simplest, most penetrating, experience-near
                                      therapeutic method I knew – still did not go far enough.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Focusing
                                      involves attending to an unclear bodily-felt sense, while remaining
                                      extremely respectful, gentle, and attentive toward every nuance of
                                      experience that arises from it. Seeing how concrete steps of
                                      experiential change can emerge from attending to a felt sense is an
                                      important discovery – something that people who use spiritual practice
                                      to avoid their feelings and personal experience would do well to learn.
                                      Yet as Focusing is commonly practiced, there is often a bias toward
                                      unfolding meaning from a felt sense, toward resolution, toward looking
                                      for a felt shift. In this way, it can become a form of “doing” that
                                      maintains a subtle I-It stance toward one’s experience. The bias here
                                      can be very subtle. Wanting our experience to change usually contains a
                                      subtle resistance to what is, to newness, to what I call <em>unconditional presence – </em>the
                                      capacity to meet experience fully and directly, without filtering it
                                      through any conceptual or strategic agenda (Welwood, 1992).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                      subtle spiritual pitfall of psychological work is that it can reinforce
                                      certain tendencies inherent in the conditioned personality: to see
                                      ourselves as a doer, to always look for the meaning in experience, or
                                      to continually strive for “something better.” Although psychological
                                      reflection can certainly help people move forward in important ways, at
                                      some point even the slightest desire for change or improvement can
                                      interfere with the deeper letting go and relaxation that are necessary
                                      for moving from the realm of personality into the realm of being, which
                                      is only discoverable in and through nowness – in moments when all
                                      conceptualizing and striving cease.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When we
                                      let experience be as it is, instead of seeking to alter it in any way,
                                      the focus of inner work shifts in an important and powerful way. No
                                      longer is our experience something apart from us that we need to change
                                      or resolve; instead, the focus widens to a larger field: <em>how-we-are-with-our-experience.</em> And when we relate to our experience in a more spacious, allowing way,
                                      it becomes less problematic, because we no longer exist in an I-It,
                                      subject-object tension with it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Although the
                                      main aim of psychotherapy is to reduce psychological distress and
                                      increase self-understanding, rather than to overcome divided
                                      consciousness, I nonetheless felt a need to practice therapy in a way
                                      that was more congruent with the nondoing quality of meditative
                                      presence. I was also inspired in this vision by moments in my own
                                      personal work when opening to my experience just as it is has brought
                                      me into a fuller sense of presence – a kind of “being-without-agenda,”
                                      which led to a powerful sense of stillness, acceptance, and aliveness.
                                      Such moments afforded a glimpse of what lay on the other side of
                                      divided consciousness: being at-one with myself in a new and deeper way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Of
                                      course, there is a time for actively trying to penetrate the veils of
                                      experience, as well as a time for allowing experience to be as it is.
                                      If we are unable or unwilling to actively engage with our personal life
                                      issues, then letting-be could become a stance of avoidance, and a
                                      dead-end. Yet if we are unable to let our experience be, or to open to
                                      it just as it is, then our psychological work may reinforce the
                                      habitual tendency of the conditioned personality to turn away from
                                      nowness. While Focusing showed me a way out of the first pitfall,
                                      meditation – which taught me about the wisdom of nondoing – showed me
                                      beyond the second pitfall.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In training
                                      professionals I also found that the investment in change can introduce
                                      a subtle bias into therapists’ responses, thereby communicating to
                                      their clients: “You’re not all right the way you are.” And this can
                                      reinforce the alienated attitude most people already suffer from: “I
                                      should be having a better experience from the one I’m having – what’s
                                      wrong with me?” When clients pick up this bias from their therapists,
                                      it can create a fundamental obstacle in the therapeutic process and
                                      relationship. Clients either try to go along with the therapist’s
                                      agenda, which can disconnect them from their own being, or else they
                                      resist the therapist’s agenda, which keeps them stuck.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The
                                      more I trained therapists, the clearer it became that the most
                                      important quality in a therapist was the capacity for unconditional
                                      presence – which, oddly enough, is hardly mentioned or taught in most
                                      therapy training. When therapists are present with a client’s
                                      experience in this way, something inside the client can begin to relax
                                      and open up more fully. What I have found, again and again, is that
                                      unconditional presence is the most powerful transmuting force there is
                                      – precisely because it is a willingness to be there with our
                                      experience, without dividing ourselves in two by trying to “manage”
                                      what we are feeling.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The nondoing of
                                      unconditional presence is compatible with a wide range of therapeutic
                                      methods, both directive and nondirective. It is not a passive stance,
                                      but rather, an active willingness to meet and inquire into felt
                                      experience in a totally unbiased, nonreactive, noncontrolling way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In
                                      teaching unconditional presence, I have found it helpful to delineate
                                      different stages of this coming-into-contact. First of all, there needs
                                      to be a <em>willingness to inquire, </em>to face directly into our felt experience and see what is there. Then we can begin to <em>acknowledge</em> what is happening inside us: “Yes, this is what I’m experiencing right
                                      now. I’m feeling threatened...hurt...angry...defensive.” Acknowledging
                                      involves recognizing and naming what is going on, seeing how it feels
                                      in the body, and inviting it more fully into awareness. The power of
                                      bare acknowledgment should never be underestimated. To help clients
                                      linger here and not rush on toward some hoped-for resolution, I often
                                      say something like, “Notice what it’s like right now <em>just to acknowledge </em>what
                                      you’re feeling.” Attending to the felt quality of this recognition cuts
                                      through the impulse to react to the content, allowing the client to be
                                      more present with it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Once we acknowledge what is there, it becomes possible to meet it more fully by <em>allowing </em>it
                                      to be there as it is. This does not mean wallowing in feelings or
                                      acting them out. Instead, allowing means giving our experience space
                                      and actively letting it be as it is, putting aside any urge to manage
                                      or judge it. Often what interferes with this is either identifying with
                                      the feeling (“this anger is me”) or resisting it (“this anger is not
                                      me”). A certain amount of time and concentration is often necessary
                                      before we can let our experience be there in this more allowing way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Having allowed our experience to be as it is, we can then let ourselves <em>open to it</em> more fully, no longer maintaining any distance between it and ourselves
                                      as observer, judge, or manager. This is the point where unconditional
                                      presence diverges from Focusing and other reflective methods. There is
                                      a complete opening to, entering into, and becoming one with the felt
                                      experience, without any attempt to find meaning in it, or to do
                                      anything with it, to it, or about it. What is most important here is
                                      not so much <em>what </em>we are feeling, but the <em>act of opening </em>to it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For
                                      example, a client fears that he is nothing – that if he looks inside,
                                      he won’t find anything there. Although I first ask him to pay attention
                                      to this “Fear of being nothing” in this body and we discuss how it
                                      relates to situations from his past (this is still reflective inquiry),
                                      eventually I invite him to open directly to the sense of being nothing
                                      – to enter into it and let himself <em>be </em>nothing. (Here
                                      reflection gives way to presence.) After a while he says, “It feels
                                      empty, but there’s also a fullness, and a kind of peace.” He feels full
                                      because he is present now, rather than disconnected. It is his being
                                      that feels peaceful and full. And he starts to realize that his sense
                                      of nothingness was actually a symptom of being cut off from himself – a
                                      disconnection reinforced by stories and beliefs he had about the
                                      dreaded void at his core. Of course, feelings don’t always transmute
                                      this easily. It depends entirely on the client and our relationship.
                                      Yet for clients who have experienced this a number of times, it can
                                      happen more and more readily.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Feelings in
                                      themselves don’t necessarily lead to wisdom, but the process of opening
                                      fully to them can. When we no longer maintain distance from a feeling,
                                      it cannot preserve its apparent solidity, which only crystallizes when
                                      we treat it as an object separate from ourselves. In the example, the
                                      client’s fear of being nothing only persisted as long as he resisted
                                      that experience. But when he opened unconditionally to being nothing,
                                      this inner division ceased, at least for a while, as he stepped out of
                                      the fixed stance/attitudes/associations he held power toward “being
                                      nothing,” with their long history dating back to childhood. In becoming
                                      present in a place where he had been absent, he experienced his being,
                                      rather than his nothingness. “being nothing” transmuted into the empty
                                      fullness of being – where the fear of being nothing no longer had a
                                      hold on him.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When the focus of awareness
                                      shifts from a feeling – as an object of pleasure or pain, like or
                                      dislike, acceptance or rejection – to our state of presence with it,
                                      this allows us to discover new resources and wisdom hidden within it,
                                      as we move from the stream of personality into the larger space of being.
                                      Out of presence with anger, strength often emerges; out of presence
                                      with sorrow, compassion; out of presence with fear, courage and
                                      groundedness; out of presence with emptiness, expansive spaciousness
                                      and peace. Strength, compassion, courage, spaciousness, peace are
                                      differentiated qualities of being – different ways in which presence
                                      manifests.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In this way, being fully present
                                      with ourselves overcomes the inner war, at least for a moment, between
                                      self and other, between “me” and “my experience.” And from there,
                                      everything looks and feels different. A felt shift happens, but this is
                                      more than the “content mutation” that Gedlin (1964) describes as a
                                      result of reflective unfolding. An example of content mutation would be
                                      anger unfolding to reveal fear, which in turn might unfold further,
                                      revealing itself as a desire to be loved, and then a sense of relief at
                                      realizing that one’s anger was pushing away the love one wanted. I call
                                      these “horizontal” felt shifts, because even though deeper feelings and
                                      realizations may unfold, the process remains mainly within the realm of
                                      personality. But the transmutation that often occurs through
                                      unconditional presence is a “vertical” shift, where one moves from
                                      personality into a deeper quality of being, as a fixed constellation of
                                      observer/observed dissolves, along with all reactivity, contraction, or
                                      striving.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, this kind of deepening
                                      may not happen quickly or easily, or by itself lead to lasting personal
                                      transformation. Often a long sequence of horizontal unfolding must
                                      occur before a vertical shift happens, and a long period of integration
                                      is necessary before these shifts can lead to real differences in the
                                      way one lives. Nor am I suggesting that Focusing and other reflective
                                      methods cannot also lead to vertical shifts. But when someone opens
                                      completely to what they are experiencing – the personality – which is
                                      an activity of judgment, control, and resistance – disappears for a
                                      moment. Therapists without some background in meditation may have
                                      difficulty fully appreciating this or allowing it to unfold.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I
                                      make a point of helping clients recognize the nature and significance
                                      of this shift into being when it occurs. I encourage them to rest
                                      there, appreciate the new quality of presence that has become
                                      available, and let it move freely in their body, without having to go
                                      on to another problem or anything else. The sense of presence might
                                      deepen and new aspects or implications might reveal themselves. Or
                                      perhaps the client starts to feel uneasy, resist, or dissociate. In
                                      that case, we might move back into reflective inquiry, to see what is
                                      going on – what old beliefs, object relations, or identities may be
                                      interfering. We might then explore these obstacles reflectively until
                                      at some point, I again invite the client to be present with his or her
                                      experience in the way just described. In this way, the capacity for
                                      presence expands, while obstacles standing in its ways are also worked
                                      through.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This contemplative approach to
                                      psychological work differs from conventional therapy in being more
                                      concerned with recovering the presence of being – accessed through
                                      opening directly to experience – than with problem-resolution. The
                                      problem-solving mentality reinforces the inner division between
                                      reformer self and a problematic “me” it wants to change. By contrast,
                                      the vertical shift facilitated by unconditional presence is a change of
                                      context that alters the whole way a problem is held. People often
                                      discover that their alienated, controlling, or rejecting attitude
                                      toward the problem at hand is in fact a large part of the problem
                                      itself. This allows them to see and consider new ways of relating to
                                      the problematic situation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Unconditional presence is more radical than psychological reflection in that it involves <em>giving into our experience </em>(as
                                      in Trungpa’s statement, “Let yourself be in the emotion, go through it,
                                      give in to it...”), while learning to ride the energy mindfully,
                                      without becoming overwhelmed by it. This approach is clearly not for
                                      people lacking in ego strength – those who are unable to step back and
                                      reflect on their feelings, or whose primary task is to establish a
                                      stable, cohesive self-structure. Focusing, by contrast, helps
                                      strengthen the observing ego by helping clients find the right distance
                                      from their emotional upheaval. But here one simply dives in, radically
                                      erasing any separation from one’s experience.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Transmutation
                                      through unconditional presence happens somewhat differently in
                                      psychological and in meditative practice. In therapy, it is part of a
                                      dialogical process, and therefore always develops out of and return to
                                      a reflective interchange. Reflecting on what has happened in a vertical
                                      shift also helps integrate the new quality of presence into ongoing
                                      daily functioning. In meditative practice, by contrast, mind-states can
                                      transmute in a more immediate, spontaneous way, without reference to a
                                      prior or subsequent reflective process. By not engaging in reflective
                                      articulation, the meditator can often move beyond divided consciousness
                                      in a deeper, more sustained way. The challenge here, however, lies in
                                      integrating this deeper awareness into daily life and functioning.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Transmutation,
                                      as just described, still involves a slight sense of duality, at least
                                      initially, in that one makes some effort to go toward experience, go
                                      into it, open oneself to it. Beyond transmutation lie still subtler
                                      possibilities of nondual presence, usually only realized through
                                      advanced meditative practice. In the Mahamudra/Dzogchen tradition, this
                                      is the way of self-liberation. Here one learns to remain continually
                                      present within the movement of experience -- whether thought,
                                      perception, feeling or sensation. In the words of a great Dzogchen
                                      master, Paltrul Rinpoche, "It is sufficient to simply let your mind
                                      rest in the state of whatever takes place, in whatever happens"
                                      (Kunsang, 1993, p. 120). This kind of naked awareness -- where there is
                                      no mental or emotional reaction to whatever arises -- allows each
                                      experience to be just what it is, free of dualistic grasping and
                                      fixation, and totally transparent. Pure presence makes possible the
                                      self-liberation of the mindstream. This is Mahamudra -- the supreme
                                      mudra, the ultimate seeing that "lets beings be as the beings which
                                      they are."<br><span> </span><br>What is this supreme mudra? In
                                      the words of Tilopa, one of the grandfathers of Mahamudra, "When mind
                                      is free of reference points, that is Mahamudra." Not to rely on
                                      reference points -- attitudes, beliefs, intentions, aversions,
                                      self-concepts, object relations -- to interpret our experience or
                                      evaluate who we are in relation to it is to rest in the "core" of
                                      being, "at the still point of the turning world, neither from nor
                                      towards." This sense of "resting in the middle of one's experience" is
                                      not a "position" in any determinate "place." This use of the term
                                      middle is taken from Nishitani (1982), who describes it as the<br><span> </span><br><em>mode
                                      of being of things as they are in themselves -- namely the mode of
                                      being wherein things rest in the complete uniqueness of what they
                                      themselves are... It is immediately present -- and immediately realized
                                      as such -- at the point that we ourselves actually are. It is 'at hand'
                                      and 'underfoot'... All actions imply an absolute immediacy. And it is
                                      there that what we are calling the 'middle' appears (pp. 165-66)<br></em><span> </span><br>Resting in the middle means standing in pure presence.<br><span> </span><br>Normal
                                      divided consciousness places us on the perimeter of the field of
                                      experience, stepped back from whatever we are observing. When resting
                                      in the middle, by contrast, "the standpoint of the subject that knows
                                      things objectively, and likewise knows itself objectively as a thing
                                      called the self, is broken down" (Nishitani, 1982, p. 154). The
                                      self-knowing that arises here is immediate and nonobjectifying.<br><span> </span><br>"It
                                      is not a 'knowing' that consists in the self's turning to itself and
                                      refracting into itself. It is not a 'reflective' knowing... This
                                      self-awareness... is a knowing that comes not as a refraction of self
                                      bent into the self but only on a position that is, as it were,
                                      absolutely straightforward... This is because it is a knowing that
                                      originates in the 'middle.' It is an absolutely nonobjective knowing of
                                      the absolutely nonobjective self in itself; it is a completely
                                      non-reflective knowing... On all other fields the self is at all times
                                      reflective, and caught in its own grasp in the act of grasping
                                      itself... and caught in the grasp of things in its attempt to grasp
                                      them... It can never be the 'straight heart' of which the ancients
                                      speak. (pp. 154-55)"<br><span> </span><br>The ultimate
                                      practice here is learning to remain fully present and awake in the
                                      middle of whatever thoughts, feelings, perceptions, or sensations are
                                      occurring and to appreciate them, in Mahamudra/Dzogchen terms, as
                                      Dharmakaya -- as an ornamental display of the empty, luminous essence
                                      of awareness. Like waves on the ocean, thoughts are not separate from
                                      awareness. They are the radiant clarity of awareness in motion. In
                                      remaining awake in the middle of thoughts -- and recognizing them as
                                      the luminous energy of awareness -- the practitioner maintains presence
                                      and can rest within their movement. As Namkhai Norbu (1986) suggests:<br><span> </span><br>"The
                                      essential principle is to ... maintain presence in the state of the
                                      moving wave of thought itself ... If one considers the calm state as
                                      something positive to be attained, and the wave of thought as something
                                      negative to be abandoned, and one remains caught up in the duality of
                                      grasping and rejecting, there is no way of overcoming the ordinary
                                      state of the mind.” (p. 144)<br><span> </span><br>It is a
                                      dualistic fixation, the tension between "me" -- as self -- and "my
                                      thoughts" -- as other -- that makes thinking problematic, tormenting,
                                      "sticky," like the tarbaby to which Brer Rabbit becomes affixed by
                                      trying to push it away. Thoughts become thick, solid, and heavy only
                                      when we react to them. Each reaction triggers further thought, so that
                                      the thoughts become chained together in what appears to be a continuous
                                      mind-state. These thought-chains are like a relay race, where each new
                                      thought picks up the baton from the previous thought and runs with it
                                      for a moment, passing it on again to a subsequent thought. But if the
                                      meditator can maintain presence in the middle of thinking, free of
                                      grasping or rejecting, then the thought has nothing to pass the baton
                                      on to, and naturally subsides. Although this sounds simple, it is
                                      advanced practice, usually requiring much preliminary training and
                                      commitment.<br><span> </span><br>When one can rest in presence
                                      even in the midst of thoughts, perceptions, or intense emotions, these
                                      become an ongoing part of one's contemplative practice, as
                                      opportunities to discover a pervasive quality of even awareness in all
                                      one's activities. As Tarthang Tulku (1974) describes this:<br><span> </span><br>"It's
                                      possible to make thought itself meditation... How do we go into that
                                      state? The moment you try to separate yourself from thought, you are
                                      dealing with a duality, a subject-object relationship. You lose the
                                      state of awareness because you reject your experience and become
                                      separate from it.... But if our awareness is in the center of thought,
                                      the thought itself dissolves... At the very beginning... stay in the
                                      thoughts. Just be there... You become the center of the thought. But
                                      there is not really any center -- the center becomes balance. There's
                                      no 'being,' no 'subject-object relationships': none of these categories
                                      exist. Yet at the same time, there is... complete openness... So we
                                      kind of crack each thought, like cracking nuts. If we can do this, any
                                      thought becomes meditation... Any moment, wherever you are, driving a
                                      car, sitting around, working, talking, any activities you have -- even
                                      if you are very disturbed emotionally, very passionate, or even if your
                                      mind has become very strong, raging, overcome with the worst possible
                                      things and you cannot control yourself, or you feel depressed... if you
                                      really go into it, there's nothing there. Whatever comes up becomes
                                      your meditation. Even if you become extremely tense, if you go into
                                      your thought and your awareness comes alive, that moment can be more
                                      powerful than working a long time in meditation practice. (pp. 9-10,
                                      18)"<br><span> </span><br>Here no antidote need be applied: no
                                      conceptual understanding, no reflection, no stepping back, no
                                      detachment, no witnessing. When one is totally present in the thought,
                                      in the emotion, in the disturbance, it relaxes by itself and becomes
                                      transparent to the larger ground of awareness. The wave subsides back
                                      into the ocean. The cloud dissolves into the sky. The snake naturally
                                      uncoils. These are all metaphors that say: It self-liberates.<br><span> </span><br>Self-liberation
                                      is not a dialogical process, but a "straight heart" realization of
                                      being-emptiness. It makes possible an intimate knowing of reality, as
                                      Nishitani suggests when he writes that "Things reveal themselves to us
                                      only when we leap from the circumstance to the center, into their very
                                      [suchness]" (1982, p. 130). This "knowing of not-knowing" is a complete
                                      openness and attunement to the self-revealing qualities of self, world,
                                      and other beings.<br><span> </span><br>For one who can remain
                                      fully present even in the middle of deluded thoughts and emotions, the
                                      distinction between samsara and nirvana, conventional and awakened
                                      consciousness, duality and nonduality is no longer of great concern.
                                      This is known as the awareness of 'one taste'. When one is no longer
                                      trapped in divided consciousness, the relative duality, or play of self
                                      and other, in daily life is not a problem. One can play by the
                                      conventional ground rules of duality when appropriate, and drop them
                                      when they're not useful. The interplay of self and others becomes a
                                      humorous dance, an energetic exchange, an ornament rather than a
                                      hindrance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Most
                                      of us live caught up in prereflective identification most of the time,
                                      imagining that our thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and viewpoints are an
                                      accurate portrayal of reality. But when awareness is clouded by
                                      prereflective identification, we do not yet fully <em>have </em>our experience. Rather, <em>it has us: </em>We
                                      are swept along by cross currents of thoughts and feelings in which we
                                      are unconsciously immersed. Driven by these unconscious identifications
                                      – self-images, conflicting emotions, superego commands, object
                                      relations, occurring thought-patterns – we remain asleep to the deeper
                                      import of our experience. We remain angry without even knowing we are
                                      angry, anxious without understanding why we are anxious, and hungry
                                      without realizing what we are truly hungry for. This is the condition
                                      that Gurdjief called “the machine.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Reflective
                                      attention helps us take a major step forward from there. Conceptual
                                      reflection allows us to make an initial assessment of what is going on
                                      and why. Beyond that, subtler, more direct kinds of phenomenological
                                      reflection can help us finally start to <em>have </em>our experience. In psychotherapy, it is a major advance when clients can, for example, move from just being angry to <em>having </em>their
                                      anger. This means that their awareness can hold the anger and reflect
                                      on it, instead of being overwhelmed or clouded by it. Beyond that,
                                      mindful witnessing allows us to step back from our experience and let
                                      it be, without being caught up in a reaction or identification.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A further step on the path of awakening involves learning to <em>be with </em>our experience in an even more direct and penetrating way, which I call <em>unconditional presence.</em> Here the focus is not so much on <em>what </em>we are experiencing as on <em>how we are with it. </em>Being
                                      fully present with our experience facilitates a vertical shift from
                                      personality to being. Being-with anger, for instance, involves opening
                                      to its energy directly, which often affects a spontaneous transmutation.
                                      The anger reveals deeper qualities of being hidden within it, such as
                                      strength, confidence, or radiant clarity, and this brings us into
                                      deeper connection with being itself. From this greater sense of inner
                                      connectedness, the original situation that gave rise to the anger often
                                      looks quite different.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Beyond transmutation
                                      there lies the still subtler potential to self-liberate experience
                                      through naked awareness. Instead of going into the anger, this would
                                      mean simply resting in presence as the anger arises and moves while
                                      recognizing it as a transparent, energetic display of
                                      being-awareness-emptiness. This possibility is discovered not through a
                                      dialogical process like psychotherapy, but through contemplative
                                      practice.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To summarize the progression
                                      described here: It is a movement from unconscious, prereflective
                                      immersion in our experience (identification), to thinking and talking
                                      about experience (conceptual reflection), to having our experience
                                      directly (phenomenological reflection), to nonidentified witnessing
                                      (mindfulness), to being-present-with experience (unconditional
                                      presence, leading to transmutation), to a trans-reflective resting in
                                      open presence within whatever experience arises, which is no other than
                                      pure being/emptiness (self-liberation).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If we
                                      use the analogy of awareness as a mirror, prereflective identification
                                      is like being captivated by and lost in the reflections appearing in
                                      the mirror. Reflection involves stepping back from the appearances,
                                      studying them, and developing a more objective relationship with them.
                                      And transreflective presence is like being the mirror itself – that
                                      vast, illuminating openness and clarity that allows reality to be seen
                                      as what it is. In pure presence, awareness is self-illuminating, or
                                      aware of itself without objectification. The mirror simply abides in
                                      its own nature, without either separating from its reflections or
                                      confusing itself with them. Negative reflections do not stain the
                                      mirror, positive reflections do not improve on it. They are all the
                                      mirror’s self-illuminating display.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Psychotherapy
                                      as a dialogical process is essentially reflective, although when
                                      practiced by a therapist with a contemplative background, it can also
                                      include moments of nonreflective presence that facilitate a shift into
                                      a deeper dimension of being. In the spiritual traditions, disciplined
                                      reflection also serves as a stepping-stone on the way toward greater
                                      presence. In gurdjieff’s teaching, for instance, focused
                                      self-observation is what allows people to step out of “the machine” and
                                      become available to the more pointed presence that he terms
                                      “self-remembering.” While psychotherapy and spiritual practice may both
                                      incorporate reflection and presence, the home base of therapy is
                                      reflection and the home base of spiritually is presence.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I
                                      would like to close with a few final considerations for Western
                                      students of the further reaches of contemplative awareness. From
                                      anecdotal evidence, stabilizing the pure presence of <em>rigpa</em> in the ongoing realization of self-liberation appears to be quite rare,
                                      even among dedicated students of Dzogchen/Mahamudra. This tradition
                                      flowered in Tibet, a far simpler and more grounded culture than ours,
                                      which also provide a social mandala, or cohesive cultural context, that
                                      supported thousands of monasteries and hermitages where meditation
                                      practice and realization could flourish. Yet even there, years of
                                      preliminary practice and solitary retreat were usually recommended as
                                      the groundwork for full nondual realization which was sometimes
                                      described as the golden roof that crowns the entire spiritual
                                      enterprise.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The question for modern
                                      Westerners, who lack the cultural support found in traditional Asia and
                                      who often find it hard to spend years in retreat or even to complete
                                      the traditional Tibetan preliminary practise, is how to build a strong
                                      enough base on which this golden roof can rest. What kind of
                                      preliminary practices or inner work are most relevant and useful for
                                      modern people as a groundwork for nondual realization? What special
                                      conditions may be necessary to nurture and sustain nondual presence
                                      outside of retreat situations? And how can this spacious, relaxed
                                      quality of presence be integrated into everyday functioning in a
                                      speedy, complex technological society like ours, which requires such
                                      high levels of mental activity and mental abstraction?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Since
                                      unresolved psychological issues and developmental deficiencies often
                                      present major hurdles to integrating spiritual realizations into daily
                                      life, spiritual aspirants in the West may also need to engage in some
                                      degree of psychological work, as a useful adjunct to their spiritual
                                      work, and perhaps as a preliminary practice in its own right. (Welwood,
                                      1984, 2000). Perhaps for Westerners genuine nondoing and letting-be can
                                      only be fully embodied in a healthy, integrated way once one has
                                      learned to attend to bodily feelings and grapple with one’s personal
                                      experience in a Focusing-style reflective manner. That is why it is
                                      important to understand the uses and limitations of psychological
                                      reflection, and to study its role as a stepping-stone both toward and
                                      “back” from nondual presence – as a bridge, in other words, that can
                                      begin to unlock deeper qualities of being and help to integrate them
                                      more fully into everyday life.</p>

Just like, you post this article to enlighten us, i think reading sutras could be very helpful, for who could read chinese sutras, that's the best, very refined, with being equipped by the basic buddhism knowledge, i now like  to read various aspects of buddhism history, different sects.</p></div>

              <p>Don't dismiss this article too quickly before understanding what it is saying. It contains very important points and the essence and different levels of practice (the problems of pre-reflective identification, to the practice of conceptual reflection, to pure witnessing, to transformation and self-liberation -- and the difference between dualistic and non-dualistic mode of cognition, and the differences and links between psychotherapy and spirituality) and their differences. He has clearly pointed out all the subtleties. With this rare depth of clarity the writer is obviously writing from deep levels of awakening. The article is long but definitely worth reading because it is very rare to have someone write so clearly.</p>
              <p>The essence of liberation (which is the goal of all Buddhadharma) is being taught but as what my Taiwanese teacher and Thusness would often say -- few people would recognise what's being said, and it's sad that the majority of people can't recognise jewels (dharma) when they're right in front of them and think they're stones or pieces of glass.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.3em; color: #800000; font-size: 78%;">Essentially
                  what happens is layer by layer of your consciousness and experience-
                  you begin to notice that those things are not split up in the way that
                  we thought they were. There’s not the independent, discrete, steady,
                  continuous, controlling, observing, isolated entity in the center of it
                  all that is either thinking or observing thoughts or doing or, you
                  know, being done to or, you know, whatever it is. That sense of things
                  progressively begins to be weakened until finally the last hints of
                  that illusion just suddenly stop.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.3em; color: #800000; font-size: 78%;">And
                  the knot of perception that was clouding things and making us think that
                  we were a subject or a doer or an independent entity or a continuous
                  person is gone. That said, all the processes that were there making us
                  think that - to use paradoxical language. All those processes of
                  identification of thought, of emotional life, of psychology, of
                  thinking the word I, of intention, all the sensations of the body,
                  thoughts, and everything that went into that are still there

              <p>yes liberation is not easy, but at least, most people trying to find something useful for them in buddhism, they are not looking for liberation, at least not to that extent, there are many jushi in china right now, even alot of them are celebrities.</p>
              <p>i think most of them are trying to help to erase the distraction in their mind, that's also one of my goal i want to get from buddhism, to get a full liberation, i think obeying precepts is a must,but not for most ordinary people.</p>

              <p>It's not all written Dr. John Welwood, instead it's a book containing a collection of articles by a number of authors on their experience of awakening, and talks about the topic of transpersonal and transcendental experiences.</p>
              <p>I typed the whole article out from National Library. That's the only place they got the book in Singapore. They don't allow borrowing of the book so I typed it on the spot. It's a long article but I type fast, so no problem for me.</p>

              <p>Don't dismiss this article too quickly before understanding what it is saying. It contains very important points and the essence and different levels of practice (the problems of pre-reflective identification, to the practice of conceptual reflection, to pure witnessing, to transformation and self-liberation -- and the difference between dualistic and non-dualistic mode of cognition, and the differences and links between psychotherapy and spirituality) and their differences. He has clearly pointed out all the subtleties. With this rare depth of clarity the writer is obviously writing from deep levels of awakening. The article is long but definitely worth reading because it is very rare to have someone write so clearly.</p>
              <p>The essence of liberation (which is the goal of all Buddhadharma) is being taught but as what my Taiwanese teacher and Thusness would often say -- few people would recognise what's being said, and it's sad that the majority of people can't recognise jewels (dharma) when they're right in front of them and think they're stones or pieces of glass.</p>

              <p><br>Ha…this is a very late reply and yes what you said is very true.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to have someone that is so-trained academically and scientifically to provide us such deep insight in the spiritual discipline.  The article is very clear, well structured and organized.  We should learn how to treasure good stuff. :)</p>
              <p>I will just jot down some of my thoughts after reading it.<br> <br>Although much is mentioned in the article about divided consciousness, the ‘strength’ of making a practitioner sink back to a divided consciousness is overlooked.  We should never underestimate the power of this bond.  That is, given a1000 practitioners that has sufficient glimpses of the pristine-ness or even awaken to the non-dual nature of Awareness, the tendency for these practitioners to fall back to ’divided consciousness’ remains surprisingly strong.  Why despite all the blissful experiences, the tendency to fall back to a divided state continues to be powerfully strong?  In transpersonal psychology, holotropic breathwork is one technique that deals with the deeply held bond of the subconscious and unconscious mind.  Unleashing these deeply held bonds can cause transpersonal experiences that include communication with mythic deties, recalling past life memories, OBEs and memories of perinatal events.  Regardless of whether these experiences are delusional or hallucinatory, we must not overlook the vast impact of ‘bonds’ on consciousness.</p>
              <p>Next, I will just touch a little on the importance of the relationship between the view, path and fruition as I think to experience the therapeutic effect from a particular form of practice, “sync-ing” the view, path and fruition is crucial.  The significance of the relationship surfaced while I was reading this article and was triggered by your question 2 days back about whether Genpo Roshi is talking about anatta in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0LiCh9eZEo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0LiCh9eZEo</a>. </p>
              <p>While Dr. John Welwood outlined the different path of practices from pre-reflective identification, to the practice of conceptual reflection, to pure witnessing, to transformation and self-liberation, his focus is mainly on the aspect of how direct and effective each method is in narrowing the gap of subject-object duality.  To me it is more important to have clarity on the exact experiential fruition that can be derived from adopting a particular view and path of practice.</p>
              <p>For example if someone were to ask will dissolving ‘personality’ results in a non-dual experience?  We need to know what the experience of “impersonality” is like and what methods of practice that will lead to the experience of “impersonality” and the role “impersonality” plays in non-dual presence.</p>
              <p>To illustrate, let’s take the question you asked about Genpo Roshi.  There is no doubt that Genpo Roshi is speaking about anatta -- “there is witnessing, there is no witness”.  However the ‘path’ he uses is clearly a ‘desync’ from his ‘views’ of  anatta.  He uses a ‘stepping back witnessing method’ which is essentially a reflective process; frankly using the “stepping back technique” to experience anatta is quite contradicting and can be counter-productive.  I must say it is not an effective way to bring about an experiential non-dual insight of anatta. </p>
              <p>In Zen tradition, different koan were meant for different purposes.  For example the experience derived from the koan “before birth who are you?” is not the same as the Hakuin’s koan of “what is the sound of one hand clapping?”  The five categories of koan in Zen ranges from hosshin that give practitioner the first glimpse of ultimate reality to five-ranks that aims to awaken practitioner the spontaneous unity of relative and absolute.</p>
              <p>Similarly different techniques can also be devised to allow a practitioner to experience the different qualities of Awareness.  The experience of “impersonality” is not the same as the experience of the “pristineness” of our nature; the experience of “oneness” is also not the same experience as spontaneity; the experience of non-dual without a subject and object split does not necessary result in the thorough insight of anatta; the experience of anatta is also not the same experience when a practitioner thoroughly sees the emptiness nature of phenomena.  Thus, the master that prescribes the medicine must have deep clarity and wisdom of the view, path, fruition and conditions of the students. It is not a one for all sort of medicine.</p>
              <p>Lastly no one religion has monopoly over Truth much less a tradition.  The techniques of spontaneous perfection in Mahamudra and self-liberation in Dzogchen that are described by Dr. John Welwood will naturally be realized by a Zen practitioner that passes the five-rank koan.  Even in the basic teachings of Buddha, as long as we have complete and thorough insight of anatta and the principle of Dependent Origination, practitioners will also naturally enters the pathless path of self-liberation.  :)</p>

              <p>Yes Longchen, what you said is very true  -- The most subtle obscurations are the most normal and natural ones to us. So natural that it is transparent  or invisible to us.</p>
              <p>Because it is difficult to see, that makes its arising precious.  The past few months have been very challenging for my business too but I will take it as a golden opportunity for my practice.  :)</p>
              <p>In whatever case, whenever we are thrown out of non-dual, it is always due to the imaturity of insight of our non-dual and empty nature.  To conciousness, it is always insights that liberates.  Spontaneous perfection is not about the path we adopt, it is that ultimate and thorough insight that allows us to willingly, fearlessly and unreservedly open to whatever that arises; for whatever arises is always to liberate itself when experienced as non-dual and empty awareness.</p>

              Roshi.  There is no doubt that Genpo Roshi is speaking about
              anatta -- “there is witnessing, there is no witness”.  However
              the ‘path’ he uses is clearly a ‘desync’ from his ‘views’ of 
              anatta.  He uses a ‘stepping back witnessing method’ which is
              essentially a reflective process; frankly using the “stepping back
              technique” to experience anatta is quite contradicting and can be
              counter-productive.  I must say it is not an effective way to
              bring about an experiential non-dual insight of anatta. </p>
              <p>In Zen tradition, different koan were meant for different
              purposes.  For example the experience derived from the koan
              “before birth who are you?” is not the same as the Hakuin’s koan of
              “what is the sound of one hand clapping?”  The five categories
              of koan in Zen ranges from hosshin that give practitioner the first
              glimpse of ultimate reality to five-ranks that aims to awaken
              practitioner the spontaneous unity of relative and absolute.</p>
              <p>Similarly different techniques can also be devised to allow a
              practitioner to experience the different qualities of
              Awareness.  The experience of “impersonality” is not the same
              as the experience of the “pristineness” of our nature; the
              experience of “oneness” is also not the same experience as
              spontaneity; the experience of non-dual without a subject and
              object split does not necessary result in the thorough insight of
              anatta; the experience of anatta is also not the same experience
              when a practitioner thoroughly sees the emptiness nature of
              phenomena.  Thus, the master that prescribes the medicine must
              have deep clarity and wisdom of the view, path, fruition and
              conditions of the students. It is not a one for all sort of
              medicine.</p>
              <p>Lastly no one religion has monopoly over Truth much less a
              tradition.  The techniques of spontaneous perfection in
              Mahamudra and self-liberation in Dzogchen that are described by Dr.
              John Welwood will naturally be realized by a Zen practitioner that
              passes the five-rank koan.  Even in the basic teachings of
              Buddha, as long as we have complete and thorough insight of anatta
              and the principle of Dependent Origination, practitioners will also
              naturally enters the pathless path of self-liberation.  :)</p>

              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>Thank you so much for the detailed explanation. It is very clear.</p>
              <p>To me, 'whatever arises already is' is a distinctive stage and insight. It allows me to maintain non-dual in activities... as there is the realisation that  no 'need/effort' can be done to acheive non-dual.</p>
              <p>Prior to this insight, there was the effort to drop the 'sense of self'. .. but the mind didn't realise that the effort was the split.</p>
              <p>After a while, it gets really clear 'why' there wasn't a split in the first place... and therefore 'how' a split(subject-object division) can never occur in reality.</p>
              <p>Before 'whatever arises already is' insight there was much unconscious/habitual effort to fix the split. After the insight, the experience is that no-split have ever occured at all... which enable no-self experience to be better 'integrated' with activities. With this, the benefits of the practice is more clearly experienced.</p>
              <p>Financially and physically 2008 was a bad year for me too... as i quitted the full time job and got injured. Many a times, the worries contract and make one get lost in the contents and lose sight of the 'indestructable ...' At the same time, the experiences have been 'educational'. </p>
              <p>Once again thank you so much for your advices and help.</p>

              <p>Indeed challenging but not to lose sight of "this already is non-dual and empty nature" of awareness.  Be bold and make great commitment vow that we will never lose sight in whatever life and whatever realm we are in.</p>
