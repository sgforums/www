            <div class='col-md body'>Service staff has to put up tons and tons of nonsense from our own fellow Singaporeans bad attitude and mentality every day 24/7, no wonder not many are keen to take up service jobs, which are also low in pay isn't it.<br><br>sg mentality as customers is : I am king, you are here to serve me and bash by me verbally and if I am in a bad mood, thats 2 bad for you mate! I am paying your company for services, so its natural that I demand quality service as I am paying for your salary. Whatever I want, you provide for me and there are no excuses for not providing it as I am the almiighty king customer.<br><br>Anyway if you are in service line, I am sure you are putting up with alot of nonsense from sg customers, not your fault also becomes your fault isnt it.<br>I agree wth PM Lee that service in SG needs to improve incrementally, but what about customer's behaviour themselves? Most are outright rude, and some are even outrageous with their demands to say the least.<br><br>I pity service staff who have to put up with these customers day in day out, week in week out, year in year out, not to mention the pathetic pay and benefits.<br><br>It's time sg look at themselves as customers, how they behave badly towards service staff if their demands are not met, as they are not an outlet of your frustrations and anger over a small tiny insignificant issue. Service staff are also humans, they have their own families and problems to solve, not to mention the anger inside waiting to be exploded when they are scolded by nasty and rude customers over a small matter. Even if the service staff makes a mistake, no big deal as they are also humans, prone to error. to err is human isn't it, but to forgive is divine.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh how come in this forum?<br><br>anyway, true, the mentality is that if they pay for anything, they expect the service staff to be slaves the next moment, sigh...<br><br>besides, people tend to forget that professionals like policeman or nurses are above all, law enforcement officers or health service provider, they arent service staff in our everyday sense<br><br>meaning, they arent and shouldnt be nice if they have to carry out their duties, or if needed tied up the patients if he get agitated and pose danger to himself and others...<br><br></div>
