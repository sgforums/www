            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add on:<br><br>According to Buddhism, there are five orders or processes (niyama) which operate in the physical and mental realms.<br><br>They are:<br><br>1. <strong>Utu Niyama</strong> - physical inorganic order, e.g. seasonal phenomena of winds and rains. The unerring order of seasons, characteristic seasonal changes and events, causes of winds and rains, nature of heat, etc., all belong to this group.<br>2. <strong>Bija Niyama</strong> - order of germs and seeds (physical organic order), e.g. rice produced from rice-seed, sugary taste from sugar-cane or honey, peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific theory of cells and genes and the physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order.<br>3. <strong>Karma Niyama</strong> - order of act and result, e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely as water seeks its own level so does Karma, given opportunity, produce its inevitable result, not in the form of a reward or punishment but as an innate sequence. This sequence of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon.<br>4.<strong> Dhamma Niyama </strong>- order of the norm, e.g., the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth. Gravitation and other similar laws of nature. The natural reason for being good and so forth, may be included in this group.<br>5. <strong>Citta Niyama</strong> - order or mind or psychic law, e.g., processes of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness, constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc., including telepathy, telaesthesia, retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, thought-reading and such other psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science.<br><br>Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by these all-embracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselves.<br><br>Karma as such is only one of these five orders.<br>Like all other natural laws they demand no lawgiver.</div>

It covers all that is included in the phrase "thought, word and deed". Generally speaking, all good and bad action constitutes Karma.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Karma</strong><br><br>Today I am going to talk about the Buddhist concept of karma. Karma is a Sanskrit word, which means action. Any action that is generated, or created from, our body, speech, or mind, definitely gives fruit or resolve in this lifetime or in next lifetime. So this is also the meaning, or definition, of Karma.<br><br>Primarily, there are three types of karma: 1) Positive karma, 2) negative karma, and 3) unmoving, or unchanging Karma.<br><br>Positive karma gives wholesome or positive or happy results and negative karma gives unwholesome or unhappy or undesirable results. Happiness cannot come from negative karma and unhappiness cannot come from positive karma. According to my understanding, even Catholicism presents the idea or concept of karma but not in detail like in Buddhism and Hinduism. For example, in the Bible, there are two statements: First, as you sow, so you reap, and second, one can understand the nature of seed and the tree from its fruit. This is very similar to the concept of Buddhist karma. The third type of karma, the unmoving or unchanging type of karma, is also a positive karma, but this karma can be only created or generated by certain practices of meditation. This karma will lead oneself to be reborn as celestial being.<br><br>Let's go back to negative and positive karma. Negative karma can be generated by performance of ten negative actions, such as killing, stealing, lying and so on. Positive karma can be created by engaging or cultivating the ten positive actions, like abstaining from killing stealing, lying and so on.<br><br>Within karma, there are two categories: a) Completed karma, and b) incomplete karma. The question is what makes the difference between complete and incomplete karma. There are some factors that have to come together to make a complete action or karma. When one or two of these factors are missing, then the action becomes incomplete. The complete action, or karma, produces very heavy, or serious, negative consequences. Whereas incomplete karma, produces light consequences.<br><br>The factors that are necessary to make complete karma are motivation, intention, effort (or attempt) and satisfaction. For example, killing: When these four factors are present at the time of the killing action then the action of killing becomes complete. When one or two factors are missing the karma is incomplete. If we carefully examine, most of our actions become complete because when we are engaging in any negative actions first we have a very strong motivation or desire to kill someone, and this thought or desire is influenced by attachment, hatred anger or jealousy; then we make some effort, or attempt to kill, such as buying weapons or poison; then, after we kill someone, we have a sense of satisfaction, joy, or contentment. This is how most of our negative action becomes complete, it is really hard to find, or see, that one of these factors are missing at the time we engage in certain negative actions, especially if we have hardly a sense of regret, right after killing or stealing, etc., instead there is joy or satisfaction.<br><br>The other side, positive karma, there are three or four factors that are necessary to make complete positive karma: 1) Proper motivation, 2) right thought, 3) right effort, and 4) satisfaction. If you carefully examine the way we are engaging in the positive actions or karma, most of our positive karma becomes incomplete because of lack of bringing these factors together. Proper motivation refers to motivation which is not influenced by a self-cherishing attitude, or material reward out of self interest. Right effort refers to effort that should be joyous. Once positive karma is created we immediately dedicate this positive action, or deed, for the welfare of every sentient being, without expectations of self interest. If we think in this way , most of our positive karma, becomes complete.<br><br>Now IÂ’ll discuss the fruits of karma. Each karma brings forth four different results: 1) Maturation result, 2) the result corresponding to its initial act, 3) the result corresponding to the initial experience, and 4) environmental results. For example the karma of killing, The maturation of killing karma is to be born as an unfortunate being such as a hell being, hungry ghost, or animal. The result corresponding to the initial act is to have short life, and frequent disease or illnesses. The result corresponding to the initial experience is to have mental impulses or a propensity to joy, pleasure or delight in killing. The last one, environmental result, resolves that one has to face living in the place where destructive climate and natural disasters are. Here, the important thing to understand is, the second, the result corresponding initial act, act is the most serious result because one will not only suffer in the next lifetime but it will cause suffering in many, many lifetimes since we have the mental impulse to take pleasure in the action, and we repeat the same actions, thus leading to further undesirable consequences. Therefore, one should consciously try to abstain from repeating the same action by means of cutting these unhealthy mental impulses.<br><br>According to Buddhism, living in a sound, ethical way, restraining from the ten negative actions, and cultivating the ten positive actions, is the healthiest way of living. This is we call living with spiritual discipline, or law. One becomes oneÂ’s own policeman.<br><br>Karma can be further divided into additional categories: Propelling karma, and completing karma. Every karma comes under these two categories. Propelling karma refers to karma that propels existence. Completing karma refers to karma that brings different conditions (desirable or undesirable), in oneÂ’s lifetime. Let me clarify about these two karmas, what it exactly means. For example: For someone born as human it could be possible that he or she faces very undesirable circumstances and conditions in this lifetime, such as poverty, poor health, loneliness, hearing unpleasant words and groundless rumors about oneself, and so on. These circumstances are said to be the results of completing karma. Also, someone born as a human in fortunate circumstances such as good health, wealth, power, fame, having good friends and a faithful, pleasant partner, praised by everybody, infantile, attractive, generous, and successful in every step is considered to be the results of completing karma. These conditions can be clearly seen in our human society.<br><br>If we are lacking in understanding of these degrees of karma and their consequences then we are confused when we see others with more fortunate circumstances and successes. If we see something we are lacking then there is a danger of having self hatred, and depression that may lead us to suicidal thoughts, jealousy and so on, which is again very destructive. Gaining a proofed and stable understanding of karma its effects and results can help protect us from confusion and mentally one can live undisturbed, calmly and peacefully.<br><br>By Gesha La<br><br>_/\_<br><br><a href="http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Geshe%20Dakpa%20Topgyal/On%20Karma/Charleston%20Tibetan%20Society%20-%20Karma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Geshe%20Dakpa%20Topgyal/On%20Karma/Charleston%20Tibetan%20Society%20-%20Karma.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mahawarrior:</div><div class="quote_body">I think that's one of the problem I have with Buddhism. In life there's actually much grey areas everywhere, but we may not have the wisdom to know what kind of decision we should make. Buddhism don't really make life easier for me when the time to make such tough decision comes up.<br><br>Killing a few people to save more people. I think a truely compassionate person would not bother about what karma he/she will receive for killing that few people so that more people can be save. Even if that person is to enter hell for such an action, I think a truly compassionate person would not mind.<br><br>But what about just war in general? If your country is attack, do you kill your 'enemies' so that you can save your own people? If your country is the attacker, would you obey the authorities and enter the battlefield? Or will you kill yourself so that you will not have to kill others (and thereby saving their lifes), neither would the authorities have to kill you for 'treason' (thus saving them from hell)? Or will you assasinate the authority so that your country's aggression can be prevented?<br><br>I have many more questions like this, but it seems that all that the Buddhist can tell me to do is to 'use my wisdom' and 'follow my heart'. Well...</div></blockquote>If our country is under attack in a war, as citiczens we must fight back to proctect our people n land. If our country is the attacker, then I think we sld voice our concerns or rebuttals to advert such war. And if we r  citizens of a tyranny government, which is most unfortunate, then we shld try to let the world know such situation so as to help our countymen fr futher sufferings.<br><br>To "use wisdom'  n " to follow the heart" finally comprises a basic direction, that is to always see what is the motive of your actions, n the outcome of such actions. Of cos it is not easy for most people like us who are defiled, or most young ppl like you as life experiences are limited. But doesn't mean this is the "fault' or limitations of Buddhism. It may only shows that our understanding of the Buddhadharma is limited n need futher guildence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
