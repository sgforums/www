In life there's actually much grey areas everywhere, but we may not have the wisdom to know what kind of decision we should make. Buddhism don't really make life easier for me when the time to make such tough decision comes up.<br><br>Killing a few people to save more people. I think a truely compassionate person would not bother about what karma he/she will receive for killing that few people so that more people can be save. Even if that person is to enter hell for such an action, I think a truly compassionate person would not mind.<br><br>But what about just war in general? If your country is attack, do you kill your 'enemies' so that you can save your own people? If your country is the attacker, would you obey the authorities and enter the battlefield? Or will you kill yourself so that you will not have to kill others (and thereby saving their lifes), neither would the authorities have to kill you for 'treason' (thus saving them from hell)? Or will you assasinate the authority so that your country's aggression can be prevented?<br><br>I have many more questions like this, but it seems that all that the Buddhist can tell me to do is to 'use my wisdom' and 'follow my heart'. Well...</div></blockquote> I have the same thoughts and doubts as you, mahawarrior. If my country is the attacker, how do I justify myself when killing people out in the battlefield?

Dilemma really, serious dilemma.<br><br>Advice like 'use my wisdom' and 'follow my heart' from fellow Buddhists and Venerable Masters alike are just too vague or profound for someone as average as I am in the practice of Buddhist teachings.<br><br>Hence, now, I find the need to explore more layman's perspective about the dilemmas of war, be it from the side of the attacker/defender/allies of either.<br><br>'Use your wisdom' is simply not applicable for someone like me, who's so ordinary in intelligence and love for life, that I don't have any 'wisdom' to use at all.<br></div>

Therefore by getting rid of the latter we can stop a war that has already happened.<br><br>The question might be hypothetical but it questions how we define morality. The chances of that situation occuring might not be high. But how we answer the question reflects on the way we think and of course, how Buddhism can come into play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following questions are taken from the 'Times' magazine. I was wondering how I can use Buddhism to answer these questions:<br><br><blockquote>You are adrift in a life raft after your cruise ship has sunk. There are too many survivors for the lifte rafts, and yours is dangerously overloaded. The raft is certain to sink, and even with the life vests on, all the passengers are sure to die because of the frigid temperature of the water. One person on the boat is awake and alert but gravely ill and will not survive the journey no matter what. Throwing that person overboard would prevent the raft from sinking. Could you be the one who tosses the person out?</blockquote><blockquote>A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five workmen who can't be warned in time. You are standing near a switch that would divert the trolley onto a siding, but there is a single unsuspecting workman there. Would you throw the switch, killing one to save five? Suppose the workman was on a bridge with you and you could save the men only by pushing him onto the tracks? (He's large enough to stop the train; you're not.) Suppose you could throw a switch dropping him through a trapdoor-thus not physically pushing him?</blockquote><blockquote>It's wartime, and you're hiding in a basement with your baby and a group of other people. Enemy soldiers are outside and will be drawn to any sound. If you're found, you will all be killed immediately. Your baby starts to cry loudly and cannot be stopped. Smothering him to death is the only way to silence him and save the lives of everyone in the room. Could you do so? Assume the baby is not yours, the parents are unknown and there will be no penalty for killing him. Could you be the one who smothers this baby if no one else would?</blockquote>Again, these questions are hypothetical and it's unlikely that we'll run into such situation. But these questions serves to question what we define as 'morality', 'right action' or even 'right motivation'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too many hypothetical questions no good. I was once creating more and more hypothetical questions for myself to analyse.<br><br>Supposedly , a tiger is starving for many days , would you slice your flesh for the tiger ? We are no arhats , Bodhisattvas or buddhas. Even if the ' correct ' and most compassionate standard is to slice your flesh , how many could do it ? What is the ' right action ' ?<br><br>Both your friends are drowning , which one should you save , assuming both are sinking fast ?<br><br>From i , not a great practitioner's point of view  , it is best to focus on worldly daily problems.</div>
