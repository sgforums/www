So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same , the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.</p>

              I do have my reservation the discuss took place in the University level. As the premises of HELL as a place is not possible. It need to be a visible, physical place where empirical observation and test can be repeated. To discuss on it will be a laughing stock in the chemistry or physicist academic world.

              <p>Well reborn76,</p>
              <p>It doesn't really matter but the question and logic behind the answer is quite good and quite compelling. However, that is in assumption that hell is eternal and beings only take rebirth there and one can never leave it. No matter how distant the concept is, it does not mean that hell does not exist because the Buddha spoke about it quite extensively and so, it must exist and the Buddha also spoke up what would create the cause to take rebirth there. May no one create such powerful negative karma of taking rebirth in hell. </p>
