Whoever destroys, damages or defiles any place of worship, or any object held sacred by any class of persons, with the intention of thereby insulting the religion of any class of persons, or with the knowledge that any class of persons is likely to consider such destruction, damage or defilement as an insult to their religion, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.<br><br>Disturbing a religious assembly.<br>296.

To him, he would have genuinely believe in it but to the buddhist, he might feel insulted. The definition becomes subjective and difficult to draw because the bottomline of the various religion are fundamentally different to begin with.</div>
