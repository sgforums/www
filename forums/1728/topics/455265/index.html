              </p><p>The word 'buddha' refers to all realized beings. It is not that only one</p>
              <p>particular enlightened being is known as Buddha. Those who realized their true</p>
              <p>nature in the past are known as Buddhas, those who realize it now may be called</p>
              <p>Buddhas and those who come to this realization in the future will be known as</p>
              <p>Buddhas. 'Buddha' is a general term which does not merely refer to a single</p>
              <p>individual but to every realized being.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The whole purpose of enlightened beings is to benefit sentient beings. In order</p>
              <p>to do this, they appear in many different forms or bodies. The principle</p>
              <p>emanations are known as the three kayas; Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and</p>
              <p>Nirmanakaya. There are even four and five kayas, divided further to qualify</p>
              <p>other manifestations of enlightened being, but it is all one Buddha. 'Kaya' is a</p>
              <p>Sanskrit word which means body in the sense of many qualities gathered together,</p>
              <p>joined and united as one. Kaya here refers to the embodiments of</p>
              <p>loving-kindness, compassion, wisdom and skillful means which appear in the world</p>
              <p>to help sentient beings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DHARMAKAYA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Sanskrit word 'dharma' means phenomena, both external and internal,</p>
              <p>subjective and objective. Dharmakaya refers to the primordial or true nature of</p>
              <p>phenomena which is beyond conception or dualistic thought. It is not partial. </p>
              <p>It does not discriminate. It is Great Equanimity. This embodiment of wisdom is</p>
              <p>known as Dharmakaya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are all aware of a great variety of phenomena. There are many things which</p>
              <p>we know and feel. However, they all can be summarized into two categories;</p>
              <p>subjective phenomena and objective phenomena. Both develop through the</p>
              <p>interaction of the elements. If we look carefully at the elements, each of them</p>
              <p>are aggregations of many sub-units. Every element is composed of individual</p>
              <p>atoms and these consist of many subatomic particles bound together as the atomic</p>
              <p>structure of that element. None of these particles are independent things. </p>
              <p>Each is dependent upon others for its existence. If we look deeply and</p>
              <p>carefully into any single element, we will find our investigation in terms of</p>
              <p>subject and object ultimately dissolves in the intuition of Great Emptiness. </p>
              <p>This is the ultimate examination we can make. To go further is beyond our</p>
              <p>dualistic conceptions. Understand the real nature of the external world to be</p>
              <p>no other than Great Emptiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we look at subjective phenomena, we find that it is similar to the elements. </p>
              <p>Mind can be conceptually divided into eight categories or many more but it</p>
              <p>functions as a single aggregate. If we search for where our present thought</p>
              <p>comes from, we will not find an exact source. If we look to where it goes, we</p>
              <p>cannot know it's destination. We cannot even find the spot where it exists. In</p>
              <p>this way, we can see that mind, the subject, is arising in Great Emptiness,</p>
              <p>inexpressible by mundane conceptions or speech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both the internal and external are based in one primordial nature. Outer or</p>
              <p>inner, there is no distinction, all are one Emptiness beyond dualistic thought,</p>
              <p>beyond existence and non-existence, both and neither. It goes far beyond the</p>
              <p>conventional notion of emptiness or vacuity. It is not some 'thing' to which we</p>
              <p>can cling. It is always here, never increasing or decreasing, but remaining as</p>
              <p>it is, as it was and how it will be all the time. Circumstances cannot change</p>
              <p>the primordial nature. Perfect realization of this nature is realization of</p>
              <p>Dharmakaya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAMBHOGAKAYA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Great Emptiness is our primordial nature. This Emptiness is not like a black</p>
              <p>hole or a state of nothingness. Emptiness is more like a state of fullness. By</p>
              <p>means of the primordial nature, everything is arising without effort, without</p>
              <p>thought, spontaneously appearing with clarity. That is the sign of Emptiness.</p>
              <p>If there were no Emptiness or primordial truth, everything would be blocked,</p>
              <p>nothing could move, nothing could develop and nothing could manifest. This</p>
              <p>spontaneous radiance of unceasing clarity is the meaning of the Sanskrit term,</p>
              <p>'Sambhogakaya' .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Sam' means perfect, 'bhoga' means enjoyment and kaya is roughly translated as</p>
              <p>body. Thus, 'the body of perfect enjoyment' is the radiant wisdom aspect of our</p>
              <p>original nature. The Sambhogakaya is displayed as the Five Wisdoms. The first</p>
              <p>of these is Dharmadhatu Wisdom. The second is known as Mirror-like Wisdom. The</p>
              <p>third is the Wisdom of Equality. The fourth is Discriminating Awareness Wisdom.</p>
              <p>The fifth is known as All-Accomplishing Wisdom. These Five Wisdoms are the</p>
              <p>clarity aspect of our true nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While we are in the world of samsara or as long as we are not realized, these</p>
              <p>wisdoms are known as the eight consciousnesses. When you purify the</p>
              <p>obscurations, these eight are transformed into the Five Wisdoms. Therefore, the</p>
              <p>nature of our present consciousness is based upon these Five Wisdoms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE EIGHT CONSCIOUSNESSES</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will name the eight consciousnesses for people who don't know them. The first</p>
              <p>five are the eye consciousness, ear consciousness, tongue, nose and body</p>
              <p>consciousness. These five consciousnesses function through the organs to</p>
              <p>perceive the five external objects of sense. In themselves, these five are very</p>
              <p>partial and limited. The eye consciousness is only for form. It cannot taste</p>
              <p>or hear sounds or smell. Similarly, the ear is only for sound, not for seeing,</p>
              <p>tasting and so forth. Now how can these scattered consciousnesses be brought</p>
              <p>together into one united state? That is the function of the sixth consciousness</p>
              <p>which is like the driver or a judge who makes decisions. It receives and</p>
              <p>organizes the input of the five external consciousnesses and gives meaning to</p>
              <p>our experience. The sixth combines and integrates the sense consciousnesses</p>
              <p>into one. It is known as mind consciousness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first five consciousnesses are very immediate. They have no continuity. </p>
              <p>They only refer to the present. They cannot sense the past or the future. They</p>
              <p>only communicate directly with the present. They are very exclusive and</p>
              <p>one-sided. The sixth consciousness not only unites these five, it can also</p>
              <p>refer to the events and activities of the past and future. It is actually</p>
              <p>structuring our sense of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A closer look reveals that the mind has two sides. One, which we have called</p>
              <p>the sixth consciousness, is dealing with the business of the past, present and</p>
              <p>future; making decisions based on the information received from the first five</p>
              <p>consciousnesses. It is very neutral and rational. There is another side to</p>
              <p>this mind, the seventh consciousness, which is basically very emotional and</p>
              <p>gives rise to ego-clinging. On the basis of ego-clinging, ignorance, anger,</p>
              <p>attachment, jealousy, pride and doubt develop. All this arises in that singular</p>
              <p>aggregate we call the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All seven of these minds are based upon an eighth consciousness which is known a</p>
              <p>'kun-gzhi' in Tibetan, the ground of mind. It is sometimes translated as</p>
              <p>'subconscious storehouse'. In Sanskrit, it is called 'alaya'. The nature of</p>
              <p>the eighth consciousness is neither positive nor negative; it is neutral. Alaya</p>
              <p>retains every basic habit-pattern of individuals. Everything is stored there;</p>
              <p>our good karma, bad karma, and neutral karma. All kinds of habits and whatever</p>
              <p>actions we perform during our lifetimes are registered there. This is why it is</p>
              <p>known as a 'storehouse'. Alaya is a consciousness, but it is very subtle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When these eight consciousnesses are transmuted or transformed, they become the</p>
              <p>Five Wisdoms. The Five Wisdoms are symbolized by the five Dhyani Buddhas. They</p>
              <p>are the radiant spectrum of clarity qualifying the Dharmakaya. The central</p>
              <p>Buddha of Dharmadhatu Wisdom is Vairocana. The eastern Buddha of Mirrorlike</p>
              <p>Wisdom is Akshobya. The Wisdom of Equality is embodied in the Buddha of the</p>
              <p>southern direction, Ratnasambhava or Rinchen Jungnay in Tibetan. The western</p>
              <p>Buddha of Discriminating Awareness Wisdom is Amitabha or Opagme in Tibetan and</p>
              <p>the northern Buddha of All Accomplishing Wisdom is known as Amogha Siddhi. </p>
              <p>These are the principle Buddhas of the Sambhogakaya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NIRMANAKAYA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All Buddhas are emanations of one Buddha. The different levels, aspects or</p>
              <p>kayas of Buddha exist only for the purpose of benefiting sentient beings. Each</p>
              <p>Buddha can appear in any of these three kayas. Dharmakaya Buddhas such as</p>
              <p>Samantabhadra appear only to highly realized beings, such as tenth bhumi</p>
              <p>Bodhisattvas who can also receive teachings from the five Dhyani Buddhas. </p>
              <p>Beginning practitioners, or those with dualistic thoughts and conceptions, would</p>
              <p>have difficulty perceiving and receiving teachings from Sambhogakaya and</p>
              <p>Dharmakaya Buddhas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The third Buddha, is known as the Nirmanakaya Buddha. Nirmana is a Sanskrit</p>
              <p>term which means manifest in form. Not just in one style or form but in all</p>
              <p>kinds of ways, in order to benefit all sentient beings whether they are highly</p>
              <p>realized, beginners or even heavily obscured. The Nirmanakaya Buddha is for</p>
              <p>everyone. The Nirmanakaya can be divided into four groups:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Supreme emanations</p>
              <p>2. Birth emanations</p>
              <p>3. Artisan emanations</p>
              <p>4. Emanations of various things</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Supreme emanation takes birth in the world as a unique person. Buddha</p>
              <p>Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava are examples of this kind. They have special</p>
              <p>forms of body, speech and mind. The special qualities of the body are known as</p>
              <p>the thirty-two major marks and the eighty minor marks. For instance, their</p>
              <p>bodies have a radiant glow and are free from old age and sickness. They also</p>
              <p>have a subtle blue light called akanistha going up from the crown chakra and</p>
              <p>merging into the sky as well as special patterns of the wheel of Dharma on their</p>
              <p>palms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have sixty qualities of speech which most people do not have. For example,</p>
              <p>when Buddha gave teachings, as soon as his voice was heard, it would give a</p>
              <p>soothing, relaxed, peaceful feeling. At the same time, whatever words he spoke</p>
              <p>could be heard at once in many different languages. Students from other lands</p>
              <p>would hear the Buddha's voice in their native tongues. Also, his speech was not</p>
              <p>affected by distance. An audience of hundreds or thousands had no problem</p>
              <p>hearing even though they were very far away. Buddha's voice could reach to ten</p>
              <p>thousand students as clearly as to those sitting right in front of him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mind of realization has the three qualities of love, compassion and wisdom,</p>
              <p>as well as the ten powers and eight kinds of fearlessness. Altogether there are</p>
              <p>thirty-two qualities of mind. A Buddha has no obstruction to seeing the past,</p>
              <p>present or future. Everything is clear to the eye of wisdom. A Buddha's speech</p>
              <p>and body qualities are somewhat more obvious, but many people doubt such wisdom.</p>
              <p>They think it cannot be exactly as it says in the sutras. Even in Shakyamuni</p>
              <p>Buddha's time they investigated this. They closely examined whether Buddha was</p>
              <p>totally enlightened and perfectly clear in relation to objects or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha renounced his father's kingdom and went to the jungle where he did six</p>
              <p>years of ascetic practice. Upon becoming enlightened, he turned the wheel of the</p>
              <p>Dharma many times for many students and so became very famous in India. After</p>
              <p>awhile, his family invited him to come back to his homeland to teach. Buddha</p>
              <p>said he would not come to the palace, but that he would stay outside the main</p>
              <p>city. So the Buddha's father and a local ruler named Zangdon who was under his</p>
              <p>dominion, had a special retreat built for the Buddha and his students. Buddha</p>
              <p>came and stayed there and began giving regular teachings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha was already known as 'The Omniscient One', being knowledgeable about</p>
              <p>every aspect of the past, present and future. But King Zangdon had his doubts</p>
              <p>about that. In order to test him, Zangdon collected one grain of rice from each</p>
              <p>of two thousand five hundred families. Each grain was wrapped individually,</p>
              <p>numbered and put into a common basket which was brought before the Buddha. King</p>
              <p>Zangdon wanted to see if the Buddha could tell him which grain came from which</p>
              <p>family So one by one, the Buddha examined the grains and told him which</p>
              <p>households they had come from. The king observed his list of numbers and names</p>
              <p>and saw that the Buddha's answers were all correct. There were no mistakes. He</p>
              <p>bowed respectfully to the Buddha and declared, "Now, I know you are omniscient. </p>
              <p>You are obviously enlightened." Finally, Zangdon became very devoted. This is</p>
              <p>just an example of the qualities of the mind of a supreme emanation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The second Nirmanakaya or birth emanation incarnates even in the animal and</p>
              <p>non-visible realms, using different names and forms, male or female as they are</p>
              <p>needed. There are many Jataka stories of Buddha taking birth in animal worlds</p>
              <p>as a fish, a turtle, a bird, a monkey, a bear and a lion, as well as among</p>
              <p>humans and even in the god realms. These are all birth emanations or tulkus. </p>
              <p>They may or may not appear in the traditional way, wearing robes and all. </p>
              <p>Tulkus may not even necessarily be recognized as Buddhas but in every case, they</p>
              <p>are born to remove obstacles and dualistic conceptions, to free sentient beings</p>
              <p>from ignorance and bring about the perfect understanding of primordial wisdom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The third Nirmanakaya is called the artisan emanation. These appear as objects</p>
              <p>of art and the artists who make them for the benefit of sentient beings. </p>
              <p>Thangkas, statues and even music are some of the forms these emanations take. </p>
              <p>Beautiful, inspired works of art which bring clarity, peace, joy and something</p>
              <p>special which seems to touch the heart center, are all known as artisan</p>
              <p>emanations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was a famous musician called Rlanga who felt that he was the supreme</p>
              <p>guitarist. And he was a very special musician, but he was also proud and</p>
              <p>arrogant. He thought he was incomparable to anybody in the world. He was</p>
              <p>always playing his music and never had any opportunity to see Buddha or receive</p>
              <p>teachings. He appreciated the Dharma but he was attached to playing music and</p>
              <p>felt he should spend his time practicing. He really thought he was the</p>
              <p>greatest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rlanga heard the Buddha was going to enter Mahaparinirvana and thought that he</p>
              <p>should visit him soon to receive teachings and have some contact. But he was</p>
              <p>still very involved in music and maintaining his pride. So right before he</p>
              <p>entered Mahaparinirvana, the Buddha thought, "Now what is it I still have to</p>
              <p>give sentient beings with this body? Who may I serve? Who is left?" Through</p>
              <p>his wisdom he saw Rlanga in his present condition. So Buddha emanated one very</p>
              <p>special musician and went to the door of Rlanga with a thousand-stringed</p>
              <p>mandolin. When Buddha started to play and the famous musician heard that music,</p>
              <p>he began to listen closely and thought, "Who could that be?" He had to come</p>
              <p>outside and bring his mandolin. Soon, he noticed Buddha hardly even moved his</p>
              <p>fingers. Plucking one string resonated all the others. Rlanga was unable to do</p>
              <p>this. The vibration of the music seemed to separate out the whole of space into</p>
              <p>many different voices of the Dharma which were of real benefit to this famous</p>
              <p>musician. He thought, "So there is someone more accomplished than myself! I am</p>
              <p>not the best..." At that moment his arrogance and pride dissolved. He felt</p>
              <p>very grateful to hear the Dharma through that mandolin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any kind of art which provides temporary or ultimate help for sentient beings by</p>
              <p>awakening love and compassion is known as an artisan emanation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The emanations of various things manifest in a variety of ways. These can</p>
              <p>appear as rain, fire or wind. During times when sentient beings are troubled</p>
              <p>with diseases, they may come in the form of special herbs and medicines for</p>
              <p>healing or perhaps when beings are in danger of losing their lives, suddenly</p>
              <p>something miraculous occurs and saves them. All of these things are various</p>
              <p>forms of the Nirmanakaya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is really just one Buddha. Every person who becomes enlightened has the</p>
              <p>ability to transform or emanate in these three kaya states. So basically again,</p>
              <p>Buddha means one who has fully developed love, compassion, wisdom and skillful</p>
              <p>means, one whose obscurations and habit patterns have been purified, one who has</p>
              <p>realized a totally free, devotional state. That sentient being, that person,</p>
              <p>that individual is known as an enlightened being or a Buddha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the teaching of the Three Kayas.</p>
