              <h1>Dharma Assembly: "Tada!"</h1>
              <h3>Dharma Talk Presented by Ven. Jinmyo Renge osho<br> Dainen-ji, October 24th, 2009</h3>
              <hr style="width: 80%;">
              <div id="teachingContent">
              <p>People have all kinds of expectations, not only about how their lives
                       will be, but how today will be, or how this moment will be. But reality
                       is not an idea. It is what it is. Tada.</p>
              <p>In the colder autumn air, the trees are changing colour and fallen 
                      leaves line the gutters of the streets. And seeing this, we know winter 
                      is coming. But although most of us sitting here today have seen this 
                      happen again and and again, year after year after year, we don't really 
                      know what the cold of winter will actually be like. We have memories of 
                      cold fingers, the sound of snow crunching underfoot, memories of having 
                      to put on many layers to protect ourselves from an icy wind. But 
                      memories of cold are not the reality of cold. It is what it is and we 
                      will know cold when it is...cold. Tada. And now, before the snow comes, 
                      we see the colour fading from our immediate world as the trees lose 
                      their leaves and bare branches stand out black against a graying sky. 
                      And mixed into, and swirling along with the leaves in the street, are 
                      discarded paper cups, gum wrappers, used Kleenex and the odd sandwich 
                      wrapper. All swirling in the wind. Is it beautiful? Is it ugly? Neither.
                       Is it good or bad? Neither. It is Tada.</p>
              <p>"Tada" is a Japanese word that means "Just, exactly, of course, just 
                      as it is." It is sometimes, as in the Teachings of Eihei Dogen zenji and
                       Anzan Hoshin roshi, used as a synonym for the more techincal term 
                      "immo" or "tathata" in Sanskrit, which means Suchness. Suchness is the 
                      reality of all dharmas, all things or experiences. The "actual nature" 
                      is another technical term for this. It means that each thing is sunya or
                       empty of all of our ideas about and knowledge of anything, that it is 
                      impermanent, that it is the radiance of the Luminosity of experience.</p>
              <p>Impermanence is so blatantly obvious. We see our grandparents die, 
                      and as we ourselves age,we see our parents die. We see other people 
                      around us die. We know that all around the world countless people die 
                      every day. But when someone close to us dies, we are so surprised. We 
                      are surprised when our relationships change, when the economy changes, 
                      when our environment changes and we are surprised that we have to change
                       and that what we do has to change because of these changes. We are 
                      surprised when we become sick, surprised when we let things slide and 
                      difficulty ensues. And most of this surprise is due to a conflict that 
                      comes about when our ideas about reality do not match up with what 
                      reality actually is. Reality is Tada: Things as they actually are. 
                      Suchness. Tada.</p>
              <p>That itch behind your ear? Tada. That's it. The sensation of your 
                      hands resting in the mudra? That's it. The moisture you feel on your 
                      tongue? That's it. The movement of the breath? Just as it is. The form 
                      of the person sitting next to you? That's it. The release in your neck 
                      and spine when you straighten your posture? That's it. The sound of my 
                      voice and the quiet pauses between words? Exactly so. In the moment of 
                      Waking up from a thought, the recognition that streaming thoughts that 
                      can never settle on any one definitive "truth" because all that they can
                       ever be is a continuously changing streaming? That's it. Tada.</p>
              <p>The details of each thing stand out clearly and distinctly just as 
                      they are and experiencing is new and fresh, moment-to- moment. There is 
                      no need to embellish, to ponder, to strategize or hold on to anything 
                      whatsoever because each thing that is known is simply being known as 
                      detail arising within the Knowing of it. Tada. So simple.</p>
              <p>But, of course, if you let attention narrow and focus, the distortion
                       that focusing will produce is far from simple. We make such a big deal 
                      out of our stuff....</p>
              <p>We can make a big deal out of a yawn: "Y-AAAAAAAAAAAAA-W-N".</p>
              <p>Out of a sneeze "Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-Choo!"</p>
              <p>Out of a sensation "I have a....headache"; "I'm tired", "My knee 
                      hurts".</p>
              <p>Out of a feeling tone (whiny, plaintive voice) "Oh but I thought I 
                      was supposed to....". "But you told me..."</p>
              <p>Out of a stance "I'm right and I know I'm right and that's all there 
                      is to it".</p>
              <p>Out of a petty memory: "I remember when you did that thing and how it
                       made me feel and I will never, ever forgive you".</p>
              <p>We can make a huge deal out of having to get up in the morning.</p>
              <p>Out of having to go to bed at night.</p>
              <p>Out of having to eat when it is time to eat.</p>
              <p>Out of having to go to work.</p>
              <p>Out of having to wait for a bus,</p>
              <p>Out of which seat we get on the bus,</p>
              <p>Out of simply having to sit down or stand up.</p>
              <p>We make a big deal over the simplest of tasks.</p>
              <p>Before we do them: "Ugh I have to do yada".</p>
              <p>While we are doing them: "Ugh, when is this going to be finished?"</p>
              <p>And even after we've done them "I did SUCH a good job of that. Never 
                      has such a good job been done of that thing by anyone, anywhere, and 
                      everyone else should acknowledge that."</p>
              <p>We make a big deal of how we look at other people and how they look 
                      at us because we think it all "MEANS" something. It "MEANS" something 
                      about "ME".</p>
              <p>"I am so sad. Look at my mournful eyes, so deep and full of feeling".</p>
              <p>"I am so angry, look how I GLARE at you". (that one can be pretty 
                      funny).</p>
              <p>"I am sick, look how haggard I am, how near death I am".</p>
              <p>Just stop with the "yada yada yada." Just tada. Just practise.</p>
              <p>But we can make a big deal out of anything and everything, including 
                      our practice. We can make such a big bloody deal out of being mindful 
                      that instead of just practising it's ME practising. Tadaaaaaaaa!</p>
              <p>But that's the wrong kind of tada. The richness, the dignity, the 
                      intimacy of our experience just as it is, without all of our 
                      fabrications and contractions and manipulations is inconceivable. It is 
                      literally and completely beyond concepts and ideas and stories. In order
                       to realize this, we need to just let go of our habits of attention in 
                      all of the ways they are manifested by body and mind.</p>
              <p>The Roshi has pointed out that a sense of a "me" is more directly and
                       basically a "sense of locatedness" and that along with it there is a 
                      directionality, as it can seem to us that attention moves from a central
                       point, a "me", out and towards experiences. When this sense of 
                      locatedness first begins to form, it is the wordless presumption that 
                      knowing moves from "here" to "there" in order to know. And yet, this 
                      sense of locatedness as a self can itself be known and so obviously 
                      cannot be a "knower" or a "self". It is a freezing or crystallization of
                       attention which is much like a frame and from this frame, attention 
                      seems to move out and towards what is known. This is why instead of just
                       practising, it can seem to us that there is a "ME" that is practising.</p>
              <p>In Rhythm and Song, a series of teisho on Dongshan Liangjie daiosho's
                       text the Hokyo Zanmai, Anzan roshi recounts many mondo-kien or 
                      encounter dialogues between Great Master Dongshan and his students. One 
                      student was Xuefeng, who much later became a great Teacher after 
                      receiving Transmission from Deshan who unlike Dongshan did not mind 
                      beating students with his staff. But while he was studying with 
                      Dongshan, Xuefeng was still full of himself and full of ideas about 
                      Suchness and emptiness. Here is one story:</p>
              <p>Once Xuefeng was carrying a bundle of firewood. When he arrived in 
                      front of the Master, he threw the bundle down.</p>
              <p>The Master asked, "How heavy is it?"</p>
              <p>Xuefeng said, "No one in the world can lift it!"</p>
              <p>Dongshan asked, "Then how did it get here?"</p>
              <p>Xuefeng didn't know what to say.</p>
              <p>Poor Xuefeng. What a tool. He was a tool because he was trying to use
                       everything around him as equipment to aggrandize himself. Even a bundle
                       of firewood. Even the simple act of carrying it. For him even samu, 
                      caretaking practice, was about the profundity of his idea of his 
                      understanding of emptiness. What a tool.</p>
              <p>In Rhythm and Song, Anzan Hoshin roshi calls out to us from what all 
                      of the Buddhas and Awakened Ancestors of our Lineage have realized and 
                      practised,</p>
              <p>Intimacy is revealed when we release. We release when we realize that
                       there is nowhere apart from us that we can drop away all of the things 
                      about ourselves that we wish were not the case; all of the thoughts and 
                      feelings and strategies that at times we are so tired of, and at others,
                       so convinced of.</p>
              <p>It is not as simple as that.</p>
              <p>It is much, much, easier than that.</p>
              <p>It is the simplest thing.</p>
              <p>Nothing is true about us. Our nice thoughts do not make us nice. Our 
                      devious thoughts do not make us devious. Our bad thoughts do not make us
                       bad.</p>
              <p>A thought cannot make anything.</p>
              <p>There is nowhere to hide because there is no need to hide.</p>
              <p>There is nothing that is true 'about' us because we are that which is
                       true. We are that which presents itself everywhere as everything and 
                      yet is itself nowhere at all, no thing at all.</p>
              <p>You are this deep intimacy.</p>
              <p>Where have you been?</p>
              <p>So please join me in not just saying, but in actually being: Tada.</p>

              characteristic of each  moment of experience or “dharma” is that it is 
              annica or impermanent and sunya  or empty, transparent and open. Another
               way of saying this is that everything  is “stainless”. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

                not only the fact that colours and forms are as they are or that 
              sensations are  as they are; the fact is that this moment cannot be 
              grasped. There is no  particular angle that you can take upon this 
              moment because it is too vast and  it is constantly changing. You arise 
              within it, I arise within it, we all arise  within it. When we realize 
              this through our practice then we realize that we  too are stainless.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              there  is nothing to hold on to. Even if you were to grab onto your zafu
               to try to  hold it firm or hold yourself firmly to it, there is still 
              the zabuton  underneath it and the floor beneath that, room all around 
              you and the air and  the light and the sounds drifting through the open 
              windows. The moment is  stainless, unconditioned, empty of boundary and 
              this is where you can release  whatever you are holding. There is no one
               who can possibly hold, nothing to be  held. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              things and  it is not theoretical. It is not something that happens to 
              things, let alone  something that might or might not happen to things. 
              It is how things always  are. Stainlessness is not a mystical shining 
              void, a special place, a special  experience. It is what each and every 
              moment already is. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              experience occurs as  mind-moments. How many details are presenting 
              themselves as you sit here facing  the wall? Your noticing of them, when
               you notice them, even if you are noticing  very few of them, is very, 
              very fast. Faster than you can think about them. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              text “The Heart of This Moment”, </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              be deluded about; we are not acting out our fabrications  and 
              self-deceptions and so we can see them very clearly.  Since there is 
              little for them to fix  themselves on, they don't have much weight and 
              so we find that they can shift  very quickly.  Seeing this shifting is 
              an  essential part of Investigation.  Seeing  how attention alights upon
               one object, and then upon another and another and  another.  Seeing how
               these are not one  thing and, although attention is continually being 
              disposed through habit and  impulse toward localizing, there is also a 
              quality of shifting present.  Despite the fact that attention is  
              continually pulling and pushing, there is no continuity to what is being
               held,  to what is being pushed.  There is only  this shifting, this 
              changing.  The  impermanence of dharmas displays itself openly.   In 
              each moment of mind, in the arising of whatever presents itself,  
              radical impermanence is revealed.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              the movements of attention towards habitual thoughts and feelings and  
              when we choose to open attention through mindfulness practice, when we 
              align  with Reality, our actions are more and more guided by Openness 
              itself. But when  we stop practising, the space of open experiencing 
              becomes cluttered with  storylines and feeling tones;  snippets  of past
               experiencing; bits and pieces of current storylines; lumps and chunks  
              of disjointed thoughts and feelings. Contraction leads to further 
              contraction.  Sometimes you get angry. You feel misunderstood.  You 
              think you know what everything is, what's  going on, what will happen. 
              One storyline leads into another and another.  It looks like “</span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">this</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">” and “this”. But you're  not seeing anything. It sounds like “</span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">this</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px;"> and “this”. But you're not hearing anything. It  feels like “</span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">this</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">” and “this”. But you're  not feeling anything. Except the state. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              infinite range of details you  could be noticing - why is </span><em><span style="font-size: 13px;">this </span></em><span style="font-size: 13px;">thought so important? Why </span><em><span style="font-size: 13px;">this</span></em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> feeling? Why </span><em><span style="font-size: 13px;">this</span></em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> state? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            It’s rather like this: Let’s say you are looking out 
              the  window on a beautiful spring day, and you are seeing the leaves and
               branches of  trees, sunlight and billowing clouds and birds. And then 
              you notice a fly on  the window screen. You begin to focus on it and the
               more you focus it, the  bigger it seems to you. You can narrow 
              attention so much that it can seem to  you that only the fly exists and 
              the world behind it and around it which you  were seeing previously 
              seems to disappear completely. But if you release the  focusing, the fly
               doesn’t disappear; instead you see the fly together with the  window, 
              the trees and sky and birds – you see the fly in context. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            Similarly,
               if you focus on a storyline, the world can seem  to disappear. If you 
              release the focusin</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">g, the world 
              seems to come </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">back into view. But 
              of  course, the world doesn’t really “come back into view”. It was and 
              is there all  along. And when you Wake Up from a thought, “you” don’t 
              make the world  reappear. You simply stop focusing and seeing sees. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            But 
              whether you choose to sit there focusing on a fly or a  thought, or 
              whether you choose to open around it to see that the fly is arising  
              together with the whole world, no matter how your attention is in that 
              moment,  the world, the fly, you, the room you are sitting in and a vast
               range of other  details are all already present, already occurring 
              simultaneously. Even if you  choose to fold attention down and make 
              yourself stupid, the moment is still  stainless. All you need do is let 
              go of the focusing and openness is simply how  things are. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            In reality, you can never be separate from Openness. 
              But  you can't make things open. What you can do is simply release 
              yourself,  whole-bodily into the stainlessness of this moment. You can't
               release yourself  into stainlessness by thinking about stainlessness. 
              If you are sitting around  thinking about impermanence, this is </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">“</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">gufu-shogyo-zen</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">”</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> or  
              “fool's zen”. Emptiness or stainlessness cannot be contained in a 
              thought  because not only is the thought empty, stainlessness itself is 
              empty. It's not  a some “thing” or a something “else”. It is how 
              everything is and all that you  can do is shut up, get out of the way, 
              and open to it. How do</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> you open to
               reality? By  practis</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">ing  reality 
              with, as and through the bodymind. Open to the reality of the  
              sensations of the breath, the seeing and hearing. Open to what you are 
              experiencing  in this moment. Release attention by opening to 
              whole-bodily mindfulness and by  opening to the details of the physical 
              space around the bodymind. Align with  reality.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              understanding of experience is simplistic and primitive because it takes
               what  is really a process of moments of knowing and constructs these

              self-image and  act from the three kleshas of passion, aggression and 
              stupidity, our perception  of ourselves and the world around us becomes

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              middle of the road,  talking to themselves, hitting themselves with a 
              rock, you might say “Stop  talking to yourself. Look where you are.” You
               would recognize very clearly that  such behavior is completely insane. 
              But when you are sitting on your zafu, you  are doing much the same 
              thing if you are not opening to reality and are instead  talking to 
              yourself, torturing yourself with your storylines. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              as a student of the Roshi  near 17 years ago, I saw someone on a crowded
               street who made quite a strong  impression. It was summer so he was 
              wearing shorts and a T-shirt. But in  addition he was wearing an 
              assortment of bags, many, many bags with many many straps  crisscrossing
               his body. And from these bags protruded an assortment of gadgets  and 
              wires. He had such things as phones, transistor radios, and many other  
              small items I couldn't identify – dozens of them. From these ran many 
              cables  and wires which were also looped around his body. He really was 
              quite an  alarming sight and people on the street gave him a wide berth 
              as he looked like  a walking bomb, armed and ready to go off at any 
              moment. Except that the  majority of his electronic devices were 
              obviously so dinged up that they  couldn't possibly work. Completely 
              oblivious to the reactions  of those around him, he stopped at a bench  
              and sat down. As I was waiting for a store to open I stood not far away 
               observing him for ten or fifteen minutes as he disconnected and 
              re-connected  wires, but it was apparent that nothing would or could 
              work.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            I remember being very struck by 
              this man and had various  thoughts about how he could have come to be in
               such a such a sorry state. I was  looking at him, and then looking at 
              me, and then looking at everyone else as it  dawned on me that through 
              focusing attention, he had become someone obsessed  with fixing his own 
              wiring. And that anyone, anywhere, can be equally  disconnected from 
              reality through focusing attention. And then I flashed on the  range of 
              thoughts, feelings, storylines that I had seen come up for me even  
              while sitting on the zafu and realized that these – these thoughts and 
              feelings  and storylines, propagating them, rehearsing them, going over 
              them again and  again and again was what caused “me” to crystallize into
               what I think of as  “me” and that all of this stuff must be questioned 
              and released. What seems  “normal” is simply what becomes habitual.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            As it says in the Jijiyu Zanmai 
              Doka, “Don't follow and  become the forms of attention.” </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            We begin practising because we 
              recognize that something  about us should change, though we're not 
              necessarily all that clear about what  that is. Regardless of what we 
              want to change or how we want it to change or  the fact that what we 
              want to change keeps changing, one thing is clear: we  want change. We 
              might start off practicing thinking that we want to change one  or two 
              details, a couple of things we don't like about ourselves, but we'll  
              keep the rest. So we try to practice on our own terms, try to bend the 
              practice  into a shape that is acceptable to us. We focus on what we 
              like or don't lik</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">e, but as we 
              continue to  practis</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">e,  what we 
              begin to discover is that it isn't just what we perceive to be the  
              ugly, gristly, uncomfortable bits that need change, everything needs to 
              change.  And as it changes, what it changes into also needs to be 
              released to allow a  space for further change The stuff we are 
              “comfortable” with is just as bizarre  as the stuff we are 
              “uncomfortable” with. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            Much of what we do when we first 
              start practising is  basically swapping one state for another. A state 
              comes up that we don't like  and then we pump up a feeling of openness 
              to counter it. We get lost in thought  and noticing that, don't like 
              what we see so we attempt to pump up a state of  silence (a jhana state)
               to counter that. But once in a while we actually  remember to practise 
              the instructions to actually feel the breath, the body,  open to seeing 
              and hearing. At first, we keep checking to see what the practice  is 
              doing for us, wondering how we are “progressing”, but eventually we 
              realize  that all of this self-considering must also be released. Trying
               to measure  one's practice is a bit like running around the back yard 
              with a wooden ruler  trying to measure the sun or the moon. If you 
              notice you are doing this, stop  talking to you</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">rself  about yourself and practis</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">e. Why? Because the moment is measureless but 
              fleeting and you are  wasting time.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            When the Roshi says “If it is 
              closed, open around it; if it  seems open, open further”, he is 
              instructing us to open to the stainlessness of  this moment in this 
              moment. This is real change. What does he mean by “open  around it”? He 
              means that you should use the noticing of any detail of  experiencing as
               a reminder to release the tendency to focus on that detail and  open to
               the context in which that detail is taking place. If you are focusing  
              on a thought, a feeling, one sound amidst countless sounds you are 
              hearing, one  aspect of the visual field amidst the countless details 
              you could be seeing,  open attention around that one thi</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">ng by coming back to the practis</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">e of whole-bodily  mindfulness, open seeing, 
              open hearing.   What the Roshi is talking about is releasing habitual 
              thoughts and  feelings and the movements of attention associated with 
              them into  stainlessness, opening and opening further, not stopping 
              anywhere, not  settling, not making yourself comfortable. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">            The truly odd thing is that when we
               become contracted, we  really think no one else can see how we are; 
              that no one else can see or feel  how we distort and crunch our 
              attention, that no one else can see or feel the  circle of sharp knives 
              we slash ourselves and others with. But the truth of the  matter is that
               we are broadcasting how we are all of the time and if we settle  into 
              and propagate a state, it will make itself known. Nothing is separate 
              from  anything else. Everything arises together, at the same time, and 
              each thing  interpenetrates every other thing in the stainlessness of 
              this moment. All  around the states you experience, the world extends in
               all directions, but when  you bask in a state all that you will let 
              yourself see is the state. Don't be  stupid. Open around it. Stop 
              talking to yourself about what you think and feel  about everything. If 
              you were as interesting as you think you are, you wouldn't  bore 
              yourself so much when you sit. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              the moon appears and  vanishes as the sun rises again. The sky is blue 
              and bright and then clouds  gather and shower the earth with rain or 
              snow or hail. The earth shifts,  mountain ranges grow and recede, 
              shorelines change. Beings are born and die,  wave after wave after wave 
              of beings coming and going. What could be solid in  any of this?  How 
              could you be solid when  your experience shows you the obvious 
              impermanence of all things? How could it  be possible that any state you
               experience could be solid in the midst of all of  this impermanence? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              about my father, now  long dead, about his life, the things he thought 
              important and commented on how  strange it is that we struggle and 
              endure and hope and fear and in the end  nothing remains. The Roshi said
               , “Like an equation written on water, vanishing  even as it's being 
              written”. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              changing this or that about  ourselves. It exposes us to and reveals the
               fact that change is what we always  already are.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              gone. You don't need to  chase after them because you've already 
              understood what you understood in the  moment they were spoken. You see 
              the wall, but there is no need for attention  to move out and towards 
              the wall, no need for you to try to “organize” the  seeing. Just see. 
              You don't need to look further into that moment of seeing  because that 
              moment is already gone and you've already seen. You don't need to  find 
              “meaning” in what was seen because meaning was already apparent and now 
               there is THIS moment of seeing. It is what it is. It IS the wall. Open 
              to  peripheral vision. Just see. You feel sensations, but attention does
               not need  to follow them. Just feel. You notice a thought and you don't
               need to look  further into it. Just open to the experience of whole 
              bodymind sitting on the  cushion. Now. And now. Pleasant sensations, 
              unpleasant sensations are felt,  bright, distinct, gone. And now? What 
              does it actually feel like to sit here in  this moment of stainlessness? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></span></p>

              attention is not distorted. All dharmas arise, dwell and decay  as one's
               world. Penetrate each moment of experiencing. Penetrate this moment of 
               breathing; penetrate this wall, this floor, this mind, this world. When
               you get  up from the zafu and walk, you are still walking in this 
              world. All beings are  met, all events are rising and falling and this 
              penetration into one's world is  the essence of our practice. Our 
              practice is not separate from the wo</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">rld. Our practice is the  practis</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">e of  mind stainlessly arising as world and world stainlessly

              <p>Thusness thinks the expression is really good, I posted it to my blog. He says the Tada article is very good and the Stainless article is also good but just to be picky... the 'it' must be eliminated... stainlessness is 
              the ungraspability of the arising and passing phenomena. Without essence and 
              locality of any arising... nothing 'within or without it'. He also says all the expessions in what u quoted are excellent and all those phases of insights are to get you to what is being expressed in 
              the Tada and Stainless articles. It is the place where anatta and emptiness 
              become obselete.</p>
