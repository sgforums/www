              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt;">Insight is not enough</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">November 12, 2016   Bodhipaksa wildmind</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">These
              days there’s an increasing interest in gaining insight. (Let’s just accept the
              loaded word “gaining” for now.) On the whole this is a good thing. For a long
              time many in the West have been doubtful about whether awakening is a realistic
              goal. “Maybe we’re too messed up,” and “Maybe the modern world isn’t conducive
              to awakening,” were common doubts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              the years have gone by, however, more and more practitioners have had insight
              experiences, and this has been very encouraging for others. More people now
              think not just that awakening is possible, but that they personally are capable
              of it. This is great! How can there be a downside to this?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              thing I’ve been concerned about recently is the narrowness of the goal many
              people set themselves. The ultimate aim of practice is often seen purely in
              terms of having insight into non-self. And while that is crucial to attaining
              the goal, simply having insights doesn’t turn you into the kind of person that
              the Buddha suggested we should take as our ideal. The Buddha’s concept of the
              ideal individual is someone who not only has insight, but who is an all-round
              excellent human being.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              one conversation about the ideal person, the Buddha outlines qualities such as:
              having calmness; being free from craving; being free of attachment to
              preferences, being free from fear, anger, and pride; being restrained in
              speech; having no longings about the future and no regrets about the past;
              having honesty and transparency; being free from envy; having no disdain for
              others; refraining from insults; and not thinking in terns of being superior,
              inferior, or even equal to others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Elsewhere
              the Buddha talks of this ideal individual very much in terms of gentleness,
              kindness, and compassion. He encourages us to be the kind of person who doesn’t
              act in ways that cause harm to others in any way, not even indirectly, if that
              can at all be avoided. He also encouraged us to be good friends to each other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is where we should conceive of our practice leading. This is the goal we should
              orient our lives around.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Inherent
              in the Buddha’s view of the goal is that it’s not just about losing the
              delusion of self, or even of gaining insight. It’s also about cultivating
              ethical, skillful qualities—especially positive emotions. This is why the
              Buddhist path is usually taught as starting with training in ethics, then in
              meditation (including the active cultivation of kindness and compassion), and
              only then, finally, culminating in the development of insight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              a small number of people, insight experiences are upsetting or even
              devastating, leading to a loss of meaning and a sense of despair. These cases
              are rare, and I don’t personally know anyone for whom this has been more than a
              passing disorientation before the positive aspects of insight have revealed
              themselves. But in the cases I’ve heard of where some kind of insight
              experience has lead to long-term problems, there seems to have been a narrow
              focus on mindfulness and insight, and a lack of emphasis on lovingkindness and
              compassion meditation. Many meditation teachers have an habit of trying to ignore
              these potential problems, but fortunately they are being studied and hopefully
              we’ll learn more about them in time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              of the benefits of modern neuroscience is that we now know that as we learn a
              new skill, the brain physically changes. Areas associated with that skill
              become larger, just as a muscle grows with exercise. The goal of practice
              doesn’t just involve a cognitive insight into impermanence or non-self, but
              requires that we strengthen our “muscles” of kindness and compassion.
              Developing insight removes certain barriers to the arising of skillful
              qualities and (often) to the dropping away of some of the grossly unskillful
              ones, but it takes effort to actually bring about growth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I’d
              encourage you, then, to develop, on the cushion and in daily life, the
              qualities I’ve mentioned. If we do that, then insight, when it arrives, is more
              likely to be an astonishing, liberating, and joyful surprise, and less likely
              to be a disorienting, upsetting, and painful shock to the system.</span></p>
