              <p>The Pith–Instruction on Looking Into the Mind</p>
              <p>A Guide to the Mind</p>
              <p>entitled</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liquid Gold Vomited from the Stomach of a Dog</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Mañjujñanasattva, Mañjushrî the Wisdom–being, essence of my own mind inseparable from the Lama, I bow down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The root of both samsara and nirvana is the mind. </p>
              <p>Apart from what is born of the mind, nothing else whatsoever exists. </p>
              <p>The manifold dance of illusory form </p>
              <p>Is overcome when its creator, mind the magician, is brought under control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not understanding this is the delusory mind of the six realms, </p>
              <p>And if you do understand, that is primordial awareness. </p>
              <p>That primordial awareness is, in itself, Buddhahood, </p>
              <p>And, as the quintessential buddha–nature (sugata–garbha ), resides in the heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HUNG  OM AH HUNG</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look this way. Look into your own mind. </p>
              <p>Wide the eyes that look out at everything, </p>
              <p>But, like a beloved child one has long known, </p>
              <p>What is it really like, this thing we call ‘my mind’?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today the time has come to look at it: </p>
              <p>Turning ones eyes from the manifold phenomena (dharma) of the external world, </p>
              <p>To look within is the one profound and supreme Dharma .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though you may enter into the primordial wisdom </p>
              <p>Where all things are wordlessly known to be illusory </p>
              <p>And of one taste with pure awareness, </p>
              <p>Simply looking into this mind, in a single instant and one fell swoop, </p>
              <p>You can burst open the cavern of object–craving mind </p>
              <p>And see directly into the quintessence of primordial awakenedness. </p>
              <p>This is why it is known as the short–cut path.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no need to unite the skilful means and insight of the realm of reality and its intrinsic awareness; </p>
              <p>The fact that reality and awareness cannot be added to or subtracted from each other </p>
              <p>Is now nakedly set forth, O fortunate one. A HO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The objective realm is the creative play of mind: </p>
              <p>Without mind, who would there be to know these objects? </p>
              <p>What is known and mind itself are inseparable: </p>
              <p>This coming into being of nothing as such is a magical self–manifestation. A HO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing whereby one could lay hold of the reality of mind: </p>
              <p>If there were, you could meditate on the presence of such a ‘something’. </p>
              <p>Similarly, if there were a (tangible) absence, you could meditate on the ‘absence’: </p>
              <p>Do not split it into such opposites. A HO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That which is not two dispels the idea of duality; </p>
              <p>That which cannot be definitely established as one, appears as a duality. </p>
              <p>This — which cannot be conceived of even as ‘this’ — </p>
              <p>Is the self–presencing of the King, Mind As Such. A HO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you don't know what to meditate on, </p>
              <p>Simply seeing it as something unattainable, </p>
              <p>(Although not as if you'd thrown something away), </p>
              <p>Is to see into the foundations of the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you allow this, too, to remain in the realm of the unattainable, </p>
              <p>Although there is no longer the smallest atom of concrete reality, </p>
              <p>You possess the creativity of all–illumining knowledge, </p>
              <p>The non–duality of reality and its intrinsic awareness inseparable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nothing as such, yet it has no essence of nothingness. </p>
              <p>Examined, there is nothing. Left to itself, it is clear and bright, </p>
              <p>Though — like the moon's reflection in water — not to be caught at by grasping for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Void of all essence of cause, effect, stillness or movement, </p>
              <p>The intrinsic nature of this Voidness being a self–existent radiance </p>
              <p>Whose compassionate response is never–ending, </p>
              <p>What arguments of being and non–being could comprehend it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When investigating, mind is an analogy for primordial awakenedness; </p>
              <p>In understanding, it is pure awareness — the self–arising of primordial awareness — </p>
              <p>What a miracle, this radiance of Mind–as–such!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What benefit is there in its openness and its appearing? </p>
              <p>Who is this in which there is no duality? What is it that is to be meditated upon? </p>
              <p>Leave it as it is in its self–settledness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to their various capacities, </p>
              <p>Individuals perceive this self–established primordial awakenedness beyond ordinary mentality </p>
              <p>Either gradually or instantaneously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In it, yogic practitioners </p>
              <p>Burn the seeds of the six realms </p>
              <p>In the fires of the vajras  of indestructible Body, Speech and Mind </p>
              <p>That are the innate creativity of the primordial awakenedness in the heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From them, the sun of support and strength blazes forth, </p>
              <p>And, holding wisdom in their hands and putting it into practice, </p>
              <p>In a single lifetime they realise primordial Buddhahood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAMAYA — Commitment. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the perfect occasion of the 15th. day of the 11th. month of the Iron Horse, while doing a meditation–retreat upon Pälchen Heruka, I was feeling like an old dog with one or two teeth chewing on a bone, when suddenly this prayer was vomited out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A swaggering youth, glancing about, </p>
              <p>Is looking everywhere for a beautiful girl dressed in her finery, </p>
              <p>But, when he finds her —the one he has chosen as his heart's desire— </p>
              <p>Suddenly the words pour forth freely and without contrivance.</p>
              <p>HA!</p>
