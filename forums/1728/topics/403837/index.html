              <p>In conjunction with Chokhor Duchen (merits multiplying day) and the birth anniversary of Guru Padmasambahava, our centre will conduct the 1.2 Million Vajra Guru Mantra Accumulation from 11th to 20th July 2010, lead by Samten Phuntchok Rinpoche together with our resident lamas.</p>
              <p>Chokhor Duchen (on 15th July) is known as the Anniversary of Lord Buddha’s Turning of the Dharma Wheel for the first time. It is one of the four great Duchens of the year during which the effects of positive or negative actions are multiplied by 10 million times. Devotees are strongly encouraged to engage in this wholesome activity with us!</p>
              <p>The general objectives of this program are to pray for:</p>
              <p>a Buddha Dharma to be ever-flourishing even during this degenerate age,<br>b Peace, happiness and harmony to prevail in this world, <br>c Warfare, famines and sicknesses to be eliminated.</p>
              <p>The core objectives of this program are:<br>a To pray for the longevity of all the great masters of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>The tenth day of the sixth Tibetan month, which falls on 20th July 2010, is the anniversary of Guru Padmasambhava’s birth from a lotus at Dhanakhosha Lake amid wondrous signs.  Also known as Guru Rinpoche and the second Buddha, he was the emanation of Buddha Amitabha, and whose coming was prophesised by Lord Buddha in the Sutras and Tantras. It is said that the more delusions and difficulties there are, the swifter and more powerful he is.  When the Tibetans need blessings or protection, their natural reflex is to invoke Guru Rinpoche, and when great masters face crises, even they call out to him as their ultimate source of refuge.In conjunction with the birth anniversary, our centre will conduct the 1.2 Million Vajra Guru Mantra Accumulation lead by Samten Phuntchok Rinpoche.</p>
              <p><br>In the month of July, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Padmasambhava, where we will conduct the 1.2 Million Vajra Guru Mantra Accumulation from 11th to 20th July and Guru Rinpoche Empowerment on 11th July. On 15th July is Chokhur Duchen, is merits multiplying day, where all positive and negative actions are mulitplied by 10 million times. Thus we will like to encourage all devotees to join us in Vajra Guru Mantra accumulation and at the same time accumulate virtuous merits during this period.</p>
