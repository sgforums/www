              <h1><span style="font-size: medium;">Thich Nhat Hanh on The Practice of Mindfulness<br><br></span></h1>
              <h2>“Breathing in, I know that I am breathing in.” It is such a simple
              practice, but it can transform your life. The great meditation master
              Thich Nhat Hanh teaches five mindfulness exercises to help you live
              with happiness and joy.<br><br></h2>
              <p>Our true home is not in the past.
               Our true home is not in the future. Our true home is in the here and 
              the now. Life is available only in the here and the now, and it is our 
              true home.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness is the energy that helps us recognize the 
              conditions of happiness that are already present in our lives. You don’t
               have to wait ten years to experience this happiness. It is present in 
              every moment of your daily life. There are those of us who are alive but
               don’t know it. But when you breathe in, and you are aware of your 
              in-breath, you touch the miracle of being alive. That is why mindfulness
               is a source of happiness and joy.</p>
              <p>Most people are forgetful; they
               are not really there a lot of the time. Their mind is caught in their 
              worries, their fears, their anger, and their regrets, and they are not 
              mindful of being there. That state of being is called forgetfulness—you 
              are there but you are not there. You are caught in the past or in the 
              future. You are not there in the present moment, living your life 
              deeply. That is forgetfulness.</p>
              <p>The opposite of forgetfulness is 
              mindfulness. Mindfulness is when you are truly there, mind and body 
              together. You breathe in and out mindfully, you bring your mind back to 
              your body, and you are there. When your mind is there with your body, 
              you are established in the present moment. Then you can recognize the 
              many conditions of happiness that are in you and around you, and 
              happiness just comes naturally.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness practice should be 
              enjoyable, not work or effort. Do you have to make an effort to breath 
              in? You don’t need to make an effort. To breathe in, you just breathe 
              in. Suppose you are with a group of people contemplating a beautiful 
              sunset. Do you have to make an effort to enjoy the beautiful sunset? No,
               you don’t have to make any effort. You just enjoy it.</p>
              <p>The same 
              thing is true with your breath. Allow your breath to take place. Become 
              aware of it and enjoy it. Effortlessness. Enjoyment. The same thing is 
              true with walking mindfully. Every step you take is enjoyable. Every 
              step helps you to touch the wonders of life, in yourself and around you.
               Every step is peace. Every step is joy. That is possible.</p>
              <p>During 
              the time you are practicing mindfulness, you stop talking—not only the 
              talking outside, but the talking inside. The talking inside is the 
              thinking, the mental discourse that goes on and on and on inside. Real 
              silence is the cessation of talking—of both the mouth and of the mind. 
              This is not the kind of silence that oppresses us. It is a very elegant 
              kind of silence, a very powerful kind of silence. It is the silence that
               heals and nourishes us.</p>
              <p>Mindfulness gives birth to joy and 
              happiness. Another source of happiness is concentration. The energy of 
              mindfulness carries within it the energy of concentration. When you are 
              aware of something, such as a flower, and can maintain that awareness, 
              we say that you are concentrated on the flower. When your mindfulness 
              becomes powerful, your concentration becomes powerful, and when you are 
              fully concentrated, you have a chance to make a breakthrough, to achieve
               insight. If you meditate on a cloud, you can get insight into the 
              nature of the cloud. Or you can meditate on a pebble, and if you have 
              enough mindfulness and concentration, you can see into the nature of the
               pebble. You can meditate on a person, and if you have enough 
              mindfulness and concentration, you can make a breakthrough and 
              understand the nature of that person. You can meditate on yourself, or 
              your anger, or your fear, or your joy, or your peace.</p>
              <p>Anything 
              can be the object of your meditation, and with the powerful energy of 
              concentration, you can make a breakthrough and develop insight. It’s 
              like a magnifying glass concentrating the light of the sun. If you put 
              the point of concentrated light on a piece of paper, it will burn. 
              Similarly, when your mindfulness and concentration are powerful, your 
              insight will liberate you from fear, anger, and despair, and bring you 
              true joy, true peace, and true happiness.</p>
              <p>When you contemplate 
              the big, full sunrise, the more mindful and concentrated you are, the 
              more the beauty of the sunrise is revealed to you. Suppose you are 
              offered a cup of tea, very fragrant, very good tea. If your mind is 
              distracted, you cannot really enjoy the tea. You have to be mindful of 
              the tea, you have to be concentrated on it, so the tea can reveal its 
              fragrance and wonder to you. That is why mindfulness and concentration 
              are such sources of happiness. That’s why a good practitioner knows how 
              to create a moment of joy, a feeling of happiness, at any time of the 
              day.</p>
              <p>First Mindfulness Exercise: Mindful Breathing</p>
              <p>The first
               exercise is very simple, but the power, the result, can be very great. 
              The exercise is simply to identify the in-breath as in-breath and the 
              out-breath as the out-breath. When you breathe in, you know that this is
               your in-breath. When you breathe out, you are mindful that this is your
               out-breath.</p>
              <p>Just recognize: this is an in-breath, this is an 
              out-breath. Very simple, very easy. In order to recognize your in-breath
               as in-breath, you have to bring your mind home to yourself. What is 
              recognizing your in-breath is your mind, and the object of your mind—the
               object of your mindfulness—is the in-breath. Mindfulness is always 
              mindful of something. When you drink your tea mindfully, it’s called 
              mindfulness of drinking. When you walk mindfully, it’s called 
              mindfulness of walking. And when you breathe mindfully, that is 
              mindfulness of breathing.</p>
              <p>So the object of your mindfulness is 
              your breath, and you just focus your attention on it. Breathing in, this
               is my in-breath. Breathing out, this is my out-breath. When you do 
              that, the mental discourse will stop. You don’t think anymore. You don’t
               have to make an effort to stop your thinking; you bring your attention 
              to your in-breath and the mental discourse just stops. That is the 
              miracle of the practice. You don’t think of the past anymore. You don’t 
              think of the future. You don’t think of your projects, because you are 
              focusing your attention, your mindfulness, on your breath.</p>
              <p>It 
              gets even better. You can enjoy your in-breath. The practice can be 
              pleasant, joyful. Someone who is dead cannot take any more in-breaths. 
              But you are alive. You are breathing in, and while breathing in, you 
              know that you are alive. The in-breath can be a celebration of the fact 
              that you are alive, so it can be very joyful. When you are joyful and 
              happy, you don’t feel that you have to make any effort at all. I am 
              alive; I am breathing in. To be still alive is a miracle. The greatest 
              of all miracles is to be alive, and when you breathe in, you touch that 
              miracle. Therefore, your breathing can be a celebration of life.</p>
              <p>An
               in-breath may take three, four, five seconds, it depends. That’s time 
              to be alive, time to enjoy your breath. You don’t have to interfere with
               your breathing. If your in-breath is short, allow it to be short. If 
              your out-breath is long, let it to be long. Don’t try to force it. The 
              practice is simple recognition of the in-breath and the out-breath. That
               is good enough. It will have a powerful effect.</p>
              <p>Second Mindfulness Exercise: Concentration</p>
              <p>The
               second exercise is that while you breathe in, you follow your in-breath
               from the beginning to the end. If your in-breath lasts three or four 
              seconds, then your mindfulness also lasts three or four seconds. 
              Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through. Breathing out, I
               follow my out-breath all the way through. From the beginning of my 
              out-breath to the end of my out-breath, my mind is always with it. 
              Therefore, mindfulness becomes uninterrupted, and the quality of your 
              concentration is improved.</p>
              <p>So the second exercise is to follow 
              your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through. Whether they are
               short or long, it doesn’t matter. What is important is that you follow 
              your in-breath from the beginning to the end. Your awareness is 
              sustained. There is no interruption. Suppose you are breathing in, and 
              then you think, “Oh, I forgot to turn off the light in my room.” There 
              is an interruption. Just stick to your in-breath all the way through. 
              Then you cultivate your mindfulness and your concentration. You become 
              your in-breath. You become your out-breath. If you continue like that, 
              your breathing will naturally become deeper and slower, more harmonious 
              and peaceful. You don’t have to make any effort—it happens naturally.</p>
              <p>Third Mindfulness Exercise: Awareness of Your Body</p>
              <p>The
               third exercise is to become aware of your body as you are breathing. 
              “Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body.” This takes it one step 
              further.</p>
              <p>In the first exercise, you became aware of your 
              in-breath and your out-breath. Because you have now generated the energy
               of mindfulness through mindful breathing, you can use that energy to 
              recognize your body.</p>
              <p>“Breathing in, I am aware of my body. 
              Breathing out, I am aware of my body.” I know my body is there. This 
              brings the mind wholly back to the body. Mind and body become one 
              reality. When your mind is with your body, you are well-established in 
              the here and the now. You are fully alive. You can be in touch with the 
              wonders of life that are available in yourself and around you.</p>
              <p>This
               exercise is simple, but the effect of the oneness of body and mind is 
              very great. In our daily lives, we are seldom in that situation. Our 
              body is there but our mind is elsewhere. Our mind may be caught in the 
              past or in the future, in regrets, sorrow, fear, or uncertainty, and so 
              our mind is not there. Someone may be present in the house, but he’s not
               really there, his mind is not there. His mind is with the future, with 
              his projects, and he’s not there for his children or his spouse. Maybe 
              you could say to him, “Anybody home?” and help him bring his mind back 
              to his body.</p>
              <p>So the third exercise is to become aware of your 
              body. “Breathing in, I’m aware of my body.” When you practice mindful 
              breathing, the quality of your in-breath and out-breath will be 
              improved. There is more peace and harmony in your breathing, and if you 
              continue to practice like that, the peace and the harmony will penetrate
               into the body, and the body will profit.</p>
              <p>Fourth Mindfulness Exercise: Releasing Tension</p>
              <p>The
               next exercise is to release the tension in the body. When you are truly
               aware of your body, you notice there is some tension and pain in your 
              body, some stress. The tension and pain have been accumulating for a 
              long time and our bodies suffer, but our mind is not there to help 
              release it. Therefore, it is very important to learn how to release the 
              tension in the body.</p>
              <p>In a sitting, lying, or standing position, 
              it’s always possible to release the tension. You can practice total 
              relaxation, deep relaxation, in a sitting or lying position. While you 
              are driving your car, you might notice the tension in your body. You are
               eager to arrive and you don’t enjoy the time you spend driving. When 
              you come to a red light, you are eager for the red light to become a 
              green light so that you can continue. But the red light can be a signal.
               It can be a reminder that there is tension in you, the stress of 
              wanting to arrive as quickly as possible. If you recognize that, you can
               make use of the red light. You can sit back and relax—take the ten 
              seconds the light is red to practice mindful breathing and release the 
              tension in the body.</p>
              <p>So next time you’re stopped at a red light, 
              you might like to sit back and practice the fourth exercise: “Breathing 
              in, I’m aware of my body. Breathing out, I release the tension in my 
              body.” Peace is possible at that moment, and it can be practiced many 
              times a day—in the workplace, while you are driving, while you are 
              cooking, while you are doing the dishes, while you are watering the 
              vegetable garden. It is always possible to practice releasing the 
              tension in yourself.</p>
              <p>Walking Meditation</p>
              <p>When you practice 
              mindful breathing you simply allow your in breath to take place. You 
              become aware of it and enjoy it. Effortlessness. The same thing is true 
              with mindful walking. Every step is enjoyable. Every step helps you 
              touch the wonders of life. Every step is joy. That is possible.</p>
              <p>You
               don’t have to make any effort during walking meditation, because it is 
              enjoyable. You are there, body and mind together. You are fully alive, 
              fully present in the here and the now. With every step, you touch the 
              wonders of life that are in you and around you. When you walk like that,
               every step brings healing. Every step brings peace and joy, because 
              every step is a miracle.</p>
              <p>The real miracle is not to fly or walk 
              on fire. The real miracle is to walk on the Earth, and you can perform 
              that miracle at any time. Just bring your mind home to your body, become
               alive, and perform the miracle of walking on Earth.</p>
