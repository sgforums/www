              <p>Newly Wedded PRC PDMM forces man to will over house to wife and step daughter, buy insurance, apply for PR, and opened massage parlour under his name ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span id="contentsText">"Obviously, she marries me not because she
              loves me. Not only did she secure all benefits to this marriage, she
              exploited me and opened a massage parlour," 48-year-old Su told Wanbao.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="contentsText">
              </span></p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Su is a factory operator, and this is his second marriage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He met his current wife at Chinatown in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<strong>She brought her daughter of about 10 years along to Singapore to
              pursue an education. She was working at a massage parlour in Chinatown,
              and had approached me on the street with massage services. We even went
              to a hotel together after that," says Mr Su.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">According to Mr Su, he was mesmerised by her beauty, and would frequently visit her in Chinatown every week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The two grew intimate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Early this year, his Chinese wife suggested that they register their marriage, and both decided on September.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He did not expect her to show her true colours just one month into their marriage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<strong>She even insists that I put her name as well as her daughter's in the housing deed. I regret marrying her," Mr Su expressed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span id="contentsText">
              </span></span></p><p><strong>Mr Su noted that his wife had used his name
              and documents to open a massage parlour, and hired female masseuses
              without work permits.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When he found out about her illegal acts, she threatened him with a knife.</strong></p>
              <p>He said that he was afraid that his wife was dragged into this
              business unknowingly, hence had gone to cancel the license of the shop.</p>
              <p>His wife got very angry.</p>
              <p>"Luckily, our argument was overheard by the neighbours, and they came just in time to stop us," Mr Su said.</p>
              <p>Ever since this incident, Mr Su reported that he was physically
              abused by his wife every night, resulting in a physical and mental
              breakdown.</p>
              <p><strong>She spent over $100,000 of his husband's money</strong></p>
              <p>In a rare streak of luck, Mr Su won the lottery four times in a
              year, winning over $100,000, but this sum had been squandered by his
              wife, he said.</p>
              <p>To sustain her infinite demands, he even applied for a credit card and a personal loan for his wife.</p>
              <p>As a result, he was now burdened with debts.</p>
              <p>"<strong>When we weren't married yet, I gave her $1,000 every month as
              allowance. I was also responsible for her daughter's school fees and
              all living expenses, spending over $4,000 on the mother and child.</strong>"</p>

              <p>maybe I've read too much of steinbeck, but really ... how often do men visit "pros" to get a bonk, but were really looking for something other than sexual gratification ? ....</p>
              <p>we human beings crave being close to another human being, to be close to another person ... that, is essentially what love is ... even if that is the short time, unsatisfying, sordid affair one gets from someone who sells her body for money ...... </p>

              <p>He could have gone to the police, annualled the marriage and done something to save himself. Now I only see what whatever he's saying as complain. I will not sympathize with the fellow but think that he's just giving himself excuses and whinning. He deserves what he is having for making bad choices.  I also wonder how his 1st marriaged dissolved. His actions and the current results points to me something in his character.</p>
