            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know much about the effectiveness of the ointments and such available to stem and reverse hair loss, but I've heard of a procedure, Hair Weaving, that helps to improve one's appearance immediately.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>OK, here's some info on Hair Weaving from this website, <a href="http://www.indianchild.com/hair/hair_weaving.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianchild.com/hair/hair_weaving.htm</a> :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>''Hair weaving is the science of addition of hair to the scalp by weaving or braiding of human hair or synthetic hair. It is also called Hair integration or Hair Intensification. The hair is woven to the root area of the client’s hair so that it grows naturally with the client’s hair. The drawback of the process is that it stresses existing hair and may cause it to fall out.<br><br>Also keeping the scalp and hair clean is a problem The American Hair Loss Council advises that only people with plenty of healthy hair should consider hair weaving. And even they should plan to keep the intensified hair for only a few weeks. The procedure is more cosmetic than surgical as it involves attaching extensions.<br><br>However the extensions must be repositioned every five to six weeks as the hair grows out. Some of the natural hair is woven or braided together to act as an anchor to which tufts are sewn, woven, knitted or glued. The anchoring needs to be tightened periodically as natural hair grows. Vigorous washing must be avoided as it may loosen the new hair.<br><br>A person going in for a hair weaving procedure must get a patch test done and be clear that he is not allergic to any adhesives used or other implants that may be used during the weaving operation. The choice of hair, whether human or synthetic depends on factors like the weaving technique followed and the life style of the individual. The weaving technique called the corn row is the oldest hair weaving technique, it has been around since the 1950s but the result is often lumpy hair. It should be avoided if you have fine thin lumpy hair.<br><br>Partial hair additions are increasingly becoming an option for people with pattern hair loss. However for people undergoing chemotherapy, partial hair addition is not recommended.<br><br>Hair weaving is seen as an option by people suffering from a wide range of hair and scalp illnesses like alopecia totalis, alopecia universalis, ectodermal dysplasia, bums, radiation etc.<br><br>Also a head with a healthy mop of hair is seen as an indicator of health and is an important factor for both prospective brides and grooms in the marriage market, in a country like India. However, since the cost is still high, the treatment is limited to the elite or upper class.<br><br>The chief reason why people go for hair weaving is baldness, and baldness bow a days seems to be setting in much early sometimes as early as 20 years due the modern life style of synthetic foods, medicines, vitamin deficiency and hypertension. .Author ~  F.
