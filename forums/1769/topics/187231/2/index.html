I'm just stating a fact that with proper oral care you won't suffer from gum problems and tooth decay and not so much on the product itself per se.<br><br>I'm also just stating in general about marketing tactics by advertisers and how consumers react in general. Why are you taking it so personally? It's also my reply on why am I not swayed by their ads.<br><br>At the same time, for someone who has yet to try the product, you seem to be pushing all the advertised points of Colgate to the point that it sounds like you are selling the product. That was why I asked if you are working for Colgate.<br><br>I'm not telling you that Colgate is better or Darlie is better. I'm telling you why I prefer Darlie over to Colgate and the common marketing tactics.<br><br>Anyway, how effectively can you measure the protection anyway? I would think that you won't see much difference anyway unless you have gum or tooth problems. I seriously doubt that changing the toothpaste brand will help or have a huge difference in effects.<br><br>Anyway back to the point of why I think you're selling Colgate. That's because you see to be pushing the product so hard <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just my point of view.</div>
