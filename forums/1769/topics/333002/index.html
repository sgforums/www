              <p>Â </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20081007-92178.html">Undergrad may have lost $66,000 to MLM scam</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SHE put $66,000 of her family's money into what she thought would give her quick and lucrative returns.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But a year on, the 20-year-old undergraduate could end up losing
              most of it because she has no idea what has happened to the
              controversial company in which she had invested - Sunshine Empire.</span></p>
              <p>
              
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">A
              check by The New Paper found that the company, which used to occupy a
              seventh-storey unit at the HDB Hub in Toa Payoh, is no longer there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In its place is another company called Niu Lifestyle, which was registered on 20 Mar this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">However, the corporate websites of Sunshine Empire, which is under
              investigation by the authorities, are still online, although details of
              its supposed property ventures have since been taken down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The undergraduate, who wanted to be known only as Pamela, does not
              have the faintest clue how to recover the $66,000 she put into the
              multi-level marketing company.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lured by the promise of cash rebates of up to $1,000 a month, Pamela
              bought a total of six packages called Gold Prime under the Sunshine
              Empire product line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She paid $11,000 for each package, using money she borrowed from her parents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She said: 'I don't know if I will ever see the money again. I was naive and foolish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I thought that was a smart way to earn money.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She said her father was hospitalised some time in the middle of last
              year and she was in need of money. 'My friend told me about Sunshine
              Empire, and how I should make my money work for me,' she recalled, and
              started buying through her friend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'At first, I thought it was too good to be true, but for the first two months, I got cash rebates of $4,000,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Convinced that the scheme worked, she borrowed another $44,000 from her parents to buy more packages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She even persuaded two more of her friends to buy packages with her,
              as by selling the packages, she could earn 'bonus points', which could
              supposedly be converted into cash.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I really thought it was easy money, and it wasn't wrong because I wasn't prostituting myself or cheating people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'We went for motivational talks at the company, which sold us not
              only the packages promising good rebates, but also the idea of being
              able to change our lives and live our dreams.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But in October and November last year, media reports were published
              about the Sunshine Empire's unsupported claims of grandiose investments
              in water theme parks in Malaysia and a wireless broadband project in
              Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'My parents were worried and started to warn me and told me to take
              my money out, but I was stubborn and refused to heed their advice,' she
              said, her voice tinged with regret.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'My friends in Sunshine Empire said that any media publicity is good
              publicity and it only showed that our company was famous. I believed
              them.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Only in November, when it was reported that the company was under
              investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), did Pamela
              start to panic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She called her 'upline' (the person who recruited her) asking to
              withdraw her cash, but was told that all accounts were frozen and there
              was no cash available.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hounded by friends</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then, she was hounded by her two friends whom she had recruited.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I feel very bad that I got them into the same situation as myself,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then in March, she was told by her 'upline' that a new company
              called Niu Lifestyle had been set up at the former office of Sunshine
              Empire.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I asked what was this company about, and I was told it was
              fengshui-related, but to find out more, I had to meet her there at the
              'office',' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'If it is a totally different company, why did my Sunshine Empire's
              upline tell me to meet at the same office, even when it is called Niu
              Lifestyle now?' she asked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I was sceptical by then, and it seemed that it was just a change in name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'When I asked about Sunshine Empire, I was only told my money was
              stuck, but I could transfer my account to another new company called Em
              Max.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Her 'upline' told her Em Max was a new start-up in Hong Kong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'By then, I didn't believe anything I was told anymore. I was
              furious but I was desperate. So I made the account transfer. I don't
              think I will see my money again, but I am just trying anyway,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I feel very stupid, and I felt I was brainwashed. The money I
              borrowed from my parents was hard-earned, and I feel guilty and that I
              let them down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'My relationship with my parents have become strained because of this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'There is no such thing as easy money,' she said ruefully.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When approached, the Monetary Association of Singapore declined to
              comment. It had put Sunshine Empire on its investor alert list on its
              website last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When contacted, the police said Sunshine Empire was still under investigation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Mr Seah
              Seng Choon, had earlier cautioned participants against transferring
              their money to Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside
              Singapore's jurisdiction.</span></p>
              <p>I suppose I should feel sorry for her ... but I think it says so much about the thinking of our youths today .....</p>
              <p>everyone's looking for that one get rich quick scheme that'll let them earn millions and retire before 30 .... do they honestly think that money can simply drop like manna from heaven onto their laps without the hardwork ? .... and she's an undergraduate somemore ..... shouldn't she be expected to know better ? ..... or it's something our text-book crunching education system failed to prepared the young for ? .... book smart but street-stupid ? .....</p>
              <p>something is wrong with many of the young of today I think .... they all want to wear shirt and ties, strut around looking important, and sit behind an aircon room all day ? ....</p>
              <p>no wonder we're being shafted by foreign "talents" over and over .....</p>
              <p>I do feel very sorry for her parents and the friends she's recruited though ...... $66000 !!! ... what was she thinking ? ..... if money can be made that easily, there'll be no poor people in Singapore by now .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Lessons to be learnt:</p>
              <p>1. If it's too good to be true, then chances are that it is. If it smells fishy, then it probably isn't chicken.</p>
              <p>2. Before you invest any money... make sure you know what you're investing in. If it has anything to do with magnetic bracelets or $2000 water filters or what not, stay well away.</p>
              <p>3. Do some homework into the company that you're putting your money into. If it's on the MAS Investor Alert list (which SE is on), stay well away!</p>
              <p>4. If you want to go into investments.... only use your own money. At least you only burn your own money and not other peoples' money.</p>
              <p>In the first place..... no one really knows what the heck Sunshine Empire is doing to earn money, to begin with. I keep asking that question in the thread in the MLM forum, and all I get are long convoluted tangents and siam-ing.</p>

              <p>Very good point tare</p>
              <p>But at least they will know what is income and expense, assets and liabilities.</p>
              <p>Before investing, they will try to probe into the company's finances and not invest blindly.</p>

              <p>But thats how they sucker people la. Like those nigeria scam or what nots ones cellphone what u win what prize. Its all about someone falling for the easy money. Greed. The modus operandi are all the same. There will always be people to sucker off, the question is whether you are gonna be the one to give them that satisfaction or not.</p>
              <p>Some company u invest in, it says buying stocks or investing in what mega projects, they are actually arms dealers and smugglers using the money to buy weapons sell off and return u some money to make u think its legit. I know of someone who does that.</p>
