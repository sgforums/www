However, I guess it's part of their cost-cutting measures to prolong the interval period between trains.<br><br>I've also noticed that during off-peak hours, the waiting time for buses has gone up too.  Worse, for some bus services, the waiting time can be long even during peak hours!<br><br>If we're going to have fare hikes imposed on us, they'd jolly well look into improving the services provided to justify the hike!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course they're going to raise the fares. Why else was the deadline pushed till after the elections?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Its justs nuts having to wait close to 10 minutes for the MRT during the so called off peak hours. This just leads to overcrowding and commuter stress. Try getting off at your station when you're packed like a fucking sardine far away from the fucking entrance! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Why the need to raise fares regularly? Well, to satisfy the fucking shareholders of course! And the bitch that took over SMRT. SMRT is the only company on this planet to keep raising fares despite posting record profits year after year. Its like they do not even allow for a fall in profits, much less losses. Fare hikes is the answer to all their problems. And the consumers are forced to bend over and just take it up the ass, assisted by the gahmen's rubber stamp unit, the PTC.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>How to improve? Well, the gahmen already threw out the baby with the bathwater by "privatising" our public transport. Now profit is the one and only thing on their minds, since there is no viable alternative for those of us who do not drive. Both SBS and SMRT have zero incentive to improve services to the commuters. All they have to do is to cut costs and raise prices.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>And that idiot we have for a transport minister whatshisname, he commented in a recent interview that things were "ok" and that he took a ride occasionally to see for himself.<br><br>Well, try taking crowded trains and buses twice a day for a year or two and see if you still think its ok you overpaid buffooon!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>

The train is always empty at this time, and surprisingly, not many people because they aren't patient enough to wait for this train. This train sometimes goes all the way to Pasir Ris, so it saves you the hassle of changing trains during peak hours also.<br><br>This train comes a few minutes after 7am in the morning.

So now, our currency has grown a tad stronger compared to that time.  Therefore, it's good news... unless it makes us less competitive compared to our neighbours cause it would mean that the Americans would now find our goods and services a tad more expensive than before.</div>

UK has high taxes is partly because of their free healthcare system. When you have this free, that free, something has to cover it. Their GST covers it. Singapore everything not free, yet taxes so high, will force people away.</div>
