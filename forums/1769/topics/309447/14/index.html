              <p>Australian Reds are alrite.. they are actually pretty good. however , the year will make the diference. soemtimes at a particular year , because of the weather , the sun  , water content etc just nice .. so produced just nice. Depends ar.Some ppl says good. I tell them tastes like socks. hahaha.. but u must know which kind u roughly like then u go from there. No harm trying more wines. So many in this world. lol but its our ability to differentiate the not so good ones with the better ones. lol!</p>

              <p>Australian Reds are alrite.. they are actually pretty good. however , the year will make the diference. soemtimes at a particular year , because of the weather , the sun  , water content etc just nice .. so produced just nice. Depends ar.Some ppl says good. I tell them tastes like socks. hahaha.. but u must know which kind u roughly like then u go from there. No harm trying more wines. So many in this world. lol but its our ability to differentiate the not so good ones with the better ones. lol!</p>
