              <p>There's a drinking epidemic here in Australia, and if you haven't  heard it from me yet, about two weeks ago, the headlines in The Age claimed that there's an "alcohol-fuelled Anarchy" in the streets of Melbourne City at night. </p>
              <p>Which got me wondering... WHY is it 'kewl' to drink?  Honestly, imbibing alcohol isn't as 'comfortable' (fiery sensation down the throat, bitter bitter bitter!) as, say, liking Hot Chocolate.  Drinking seems to be an acquired taste.  I mean, babies, with virgin palates, naturally like sweet things, and if you dab a little bit of something bitter / hot / sour, babies will immediately give you a facial expression that shows you what they think of it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  (OK, I am NOT advocating experimenting with babies, ok!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">)</p>
              <p>So, why is it 'sociable' or 'sexy' or 'macho' or 'cool' to be seen drinking?  What is the allure of drinking, besides the image that you get to project? </p>
              <p>Let's discuss this issue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I tolerated Beer because one of my ex b/f's said that as an adult, I HAVE to drink alcohol.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Ah Beng (not his real name) also claimed that it was more 'economical' to share a jug of beer whenever we went to the pubs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  And because beer IS bitter as all hell, I used to make a face drinking it, but he'd grumble about it and I had to kinda tolerate it without wincing and making faces.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Which got me thinking, WHY the hell would anyone drink something so unpleasant?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Now that I'm here in Alcohol Paradise, I did try two or three bottles of 'light' / fruity beer, but I think the foregone conclusion is, I dislike beer.  All beer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  At my age, I no longer feel the need to try to appear cool by pretending I like it.  So, here it is - I dislike it, always have, and always will.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Wine... I only like Choya.  And even then, I rarely, if ever, drink Choya neat.  It's always 30-45 mls mixed in a whole lotta goodness-knows-what strikes my fancy that night.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I love my Choya cocktails.  But even then, I love it enough to only have it once to thrice every quarter.  The rest of the time, I simply have no desire whatsoever to drink any alcohol. </p>
              <p>Reds I like, but I've never ever had my own bottle of Red.  White, I don't like because it's too strong and dry for me. </p>
              <p>I'm waiting for the alcohol joint near my place to sell the miniature set of Absolut Vodka again because I'd love to take one swig of it, but I imagine it'll be too strong and dry for me and I'd probably have to make a cocktail out of it. </p>
              <p>So yeah... when it comes to Wine Appreciation, I rank first... from the bottom!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>

              <p>Bubble Wine - Hell this is the WORST alcohol that I have ever tried.

              <p>Honey Choya - Ok I have to say this is on par with Green Tea &amp; whiskey. I can't stand the strong alcohol smell of it so I went to add some honey into it. Still remained same. Urrgh.</p>

              <p><br>An easy to drink average beer would be Heneiken</p>

              <p>But for Heneiken, must drink the ones you buy from DFS in Changi Airport. Ever since they switched to production in APB, the taste change :(</p>
