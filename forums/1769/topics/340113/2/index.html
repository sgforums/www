              <p>like i said.. i think it's all about circumstances. and risk levels. doctors will be examining you, and there might be blood or body fluid contact, so of course they should be informed, besides letting the doctor know doesn't compromise the patient's privacy, since there is a doctor - patient confidentiality.</p>
              <p>letting your lover know, because there will be physically intimate contact.</p>
              <p>does your colleagues need to know, if you're working in an environment where there is a low risk of injury - say... an office pencil pusher? the risk level of getting infected is so low, but if you let everyone know, the chances of everyone treating you like crap is so high, the trade off simply isn't fair. i feel that if the risks are low, like minimal to nearly impossible of getting infected, the patient has the right to his privacy and a life which is as normal as possible..</p>
              <p>as for... getting scratched up outside, how often do you see ppl helping others in singapore? lol. but that aside, when that happens, the patient can always be more careful and not allow ppl to be near them.</p>
              <p>if you're going to give an example like, if the patient is unconscious and others don't know and get "infected", so are you saying, that if a hiv patient is injured and unconscious, they shouldn't be helped because you're afraid of getting infected? that mentality - justifies all the more, why they should have their privacy protected.</p>

              <p>"<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">But that same year, researchers discovered that some gay men astonishingly remained uninfected despite engaging in very risky sex with as many as hundreds of partners. These men had inherited a mutation from both their parents that made them virtually immune to HIV.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">The mutation prevents a molecule called CCR5 from appearing on the surface of cells. CCR5 acts as a kind of door for the virus. Since most HIV strains must bind to CCR5 to enter cells, the mutation bars the virus from entering. A new AIDS drug, Selzentry, made by Pfizer Inc., doesn't attack HIV itself but works by blocking CCR5.</span>"</p>

              <p>Damn. Those gays are fucking lucky. Anyway, early treatment with currently existing drugs (albeit expensive) have been known to prolong the lives of HIV patients for up to decades. Also, with intensive research on HIV going on, a cure may be imminent for them too:</p>

              <p>some would, there was even an interview of a couple who had unprotected sex with each other even after finding out one of them had the virus(before they did anything)</p>
              <p>i'm with cathykitty on this issue, some people should be informed but it isn't necessary to let every know. as a society we're incredibly small minded, we all saw what happened during sars.</p>

                  <p>sometimes you don't know you're a carrier and you spread it around til you know, then you decide whether you're going to take revenge against society.</p>
                  <p> this was what i knew back from a while, was out for dinner in a group with mostly straight couples and 1 gay guy. when the topic suddenly turned into gay sex his description blew me away. he could do it anytime and anywhere, no protection. like just before crossing the causeway with a totally unknown stranger.(he said this stranger was straight but curious) other times it can happen just when you enter a carpark.(another stranger)</p>
                  <p>before leavingthe place, a group of his friends(all gays) came over to greet us and it was hinted they're all "together"</p>
                  <p>as for straight people... another guy i knew, and ex colleague has his whole life revolving around sex, i don't know if he uses protection but he usually likes to go clubbing to pick up girls and some days he looks for prostitutes.</p>
                  <p>and (this one's more like a rumour) one of my seconday school mates was said to like doing it without a condom with pros.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>why wouldn't HIV spread?</p>

              <p>--------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>As you can see from the data above, if you're 'recieving-end' male homosexual.. the chances of you getting HIV from receptive anal intercourse is 50 out of 10,000 exposures.</p>
              <p>If you're 'giving-end' male homosexual.. the chances of contracting HIV is significantly lower by 43.5 out of 10,000 exposures.</p>
              <p>My theory is that.. male homosexuals are more prone to contracting HIV due to blood caused by anal tear (sorry, a li'l crude here.. but entirely for discussion purpose)</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Again, from that data above. You can see that females generally stand a higher chance of contracting HIV than males. But in Singapore, 9 out of 10 of the new Aids sufferers are males and 1/3 of them are homosexuals.</p>
              <p>There're about 2000 recorded aids patients in sg now.</p>
