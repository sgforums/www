              her, telling Her World, "What's the point? The most important this is
              that I've moved on."<br> <br> The strong-willed teenager managed to
              secure a sales job at a company where no one knows about her illness
              and she has a doting boyfriend by her side. "He's in his 30s and I told
              him about my condition very early on. It surprised me that he still
              accepted me." The couple lead a normal life but are very careful when

              <p>this, and another recent article, about this infected kid in primary school telling his father not to tell the school he's HIV positive,got me thinking ....</p>
              <p>does the individual's right to privacy, his right to protect him or herself from discrimination, persecution, or ridicule because of his HIV status, supersedes the public's safety ? .... the public's need to protect themselves ? ....</p>
              <p>brought to mind the case of greg louganis, the olympic diver who conked his head against the diving board at seoul 88', the doctor who attended to him didn't know, and did not take precaution to protect himself at all ....</p>
              <p>now imagine a kid with HIV running around the school playground and falling down and hurting his leg .... and teachers running over, dabbing tissue paper over the graze ....</p>
              <p>where does one's right privacy ends, and the public's rights begins ?</p>

              <p>i think it depends on the situation.. i feel, until singaporeans stop having the witch hunt mentality, then it will be safe for the infected to come clean with the public.</p>
              <p>the problem now is, yea, the infected can come clean, and announce to the world, but everyone will start shunning him and ostracising him. until this mentality stops, then we can make another move forward, for the safety of the public.</p>

              <p>considering the stigma... and the fact tt nt many pple get infected thru normal contact... i think there are cases when it's fine not to tell if the patient doesn't want to.</p>
              <p>for the stories quoted, i think certain people in the boy's school shld be told, like the principal and vice principal... but dun need to tell the teachers... cos some young teachers may not know to handle the situation and may end up treating the child differently.</p>
              <p>employers dun have to be told. i personally think that it's ok.</p>
              <p>does anyone have statistics to share on how many pple have actually gotten infected by just being ard a HIV person, e.g. help the person clean a wound and kena infected? </p>
              <p>i've actually heard that the virus dies very easily once it's outside the body... so unless a person has sex, shares needles, or suay suay kena from blood transfusion, it's highly unlikely that he or she will get the virus too.</p>
              <p>in fact, i heard tt hepatitis is even more contagious than HIV. shld we start ostracising those patients too?</p>

              <p><br>actually, singaporeans quite jia lat... many pple jus discriminate agnst pple who have "taboo illnesses"...</p>
              <p>apart from HIV, even a cancer patient also gets discriminated against. and we all know cancer is not spread by air... :/</p>
              <p>when my mum had chemo and wore a cap, whenever we went to crowded eating places, i noticed tt some pple would avoid coming near us... or they wld try walk to further away fr us... even tho most other seats may be filled. they'd rather walk a longer way to share table wif other pple. especially true of middle aged to old aunties...</p>
              <p>once an auntie shared a table wif us cos she had no choice. really no more seats left. but immediately, when one chair at another table was empty, she quickly walked over, to share the table wif others who were still there.</p>
              <p>i tink it's time we try to gain more general knowledge on health. and maybe have more dramas abt health matters or smth. tt can help to slowly change the mentality on all the "incurable" diseases.</p>

              <p>i tink they can be told if the person trusts his or her employer. but i dun believe tt it shld be forced. unless of course the person is a doctor... or working in occupations that may really endanger other pple if they keep quiet. in these cases, like for medical students, the person applying will be made to go for HIV screening. so even if dun tell, also the prospective employers will know.</p>
              <p>i admit i'm more sympathetic towards pple who get ostracised... i tink since there is no evidence to suggest tt HIV patients pose threat to their coworkers in normal jobs... there is no need for them to reveal their status to their employers... if the employer really, really wants to know, i think the ball is in their court. they can always ask for hIV screening before hiring the person.</p>

              <p>I think it would be, any underlying health conditions may have a direct impact on a person's ability to perform his or her job.</p>
              <p>it may sound callous to say so, but any underlying medical conditions may also impact on the person's productivity, and the company's costs, (think medical benefits for example). sure, you can finger a company as heartless and callous if the company decides not to employ an infected person (or, by the same corrollary, say, a person with a previous criminal conviction, say a sex offender), but then for the person to deliberately withhold the facts from a prospective employer, is wilful mis-information I feel ...</p>
              <p>I can understand an infected person's desire not to be discriminated, or persecuted against, but I think it's selfish not to let the people around you, the people whom you come into contact with daily, know about your condition ...</p>
              <p>like greg louganis for example ... I wonder how would any person live with themselves if they unwittedly infected someone else because they elected to keep the knowledge of their infection from others ...</p>

              <p>apart from HIV, even a cancer patient also gets discriminated
                  against. and we all know cancer is not spread by air... :/</p>
              <p>when my mum had chemo and wore a cap, whenever we went to
                  crowded eating places, i noticed tt some pple would avoid coming
                  near us... or they wld try walk to further away fr us... even tho
                  most other seats may be filled. they'd rather walk a longer way to
                  share table wif other pple. especially true of middle aged to old
                  aunties...</p>
              <p>once an auntie shared a table wif us cos she had no
                  choice. really no more seats left. but immediately, when one chair
                  at another table was empty, she quickly walked over, to share the

              <p>i tink it's time we try to gain more general knowledge on

              <p>the problem now is, yea, the infected can come clean, and announce to the world, but everyone will start shunning him and ostracising him. until this mentality stops, then we can make another move forward, for the safety of the public.</p>

              <p>Most of us have this notion of "healthy is golden", and when we see people who are unwell, we naturally shun them. Yes, the word is fear. We fear getting infected, but importantly, we fear spreading it to our loved ones. So it is understandable why people react this way. I feel we can never say which side is in the right/wrong.</p>
              <p>I believe most of us thru many avenues do know the HIV can only be transmitted thru the exchange of blood, bodily fluids. Upfront, some of us may be able to handle but I do believe at the back of our mind, there is still a warning light blinking.</p>
              <p>For me, I feel it is irresponsible for the parent/boy not to disclose it to the school.But I emphathise with the boy cause thru no fault of his, he is faced with this, all this thru his life. In addition, Most teachers, principals are so young, how they will react, no one will know. But to keep quiet, I feel it is a lose-lose.How to make it win-win is a question I don't have any answers. I believe the authorities are also having a major headache. </p>
              <p>But as numbers increase, the risks increase, and I hope that there is an amicable solution that won't put this into a witchhunt exercise. cause I do believe they also need care, love, and care.</p>

              <p>it's a difficult question. ethically, the person has an obligation to inform his employer as there are questions on his medical benefits, his job scope and the possibilities of passing it on in this scope of work.</p>
              <p>But the moment this is made known, he is bound to be ostricise by others. It is just like the delimma of filling up the application form in questions like have you been jailed. How many would simply be sympathical on such employee?</p>
