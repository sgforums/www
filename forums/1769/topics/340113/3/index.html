              <p>sometimes you don't know you're a carrier and you spread it
              around til you know, then you decide whether you're going to take
              revenge against society.</p>
              <p> this was what i knew back from a while, was out for dinner
              in a group with mostly straight couples and 1 gay guy. when the
              topic suddenly turned into gay sex his description blew me away. he
              could do it anytime and anywhere, no protection. like just before
              crossing the causeway with a totally unknown stranger.(he said this
              stranger was straight but curious) other times it can happen just
              when you enter a carpark.(another stranger)</p>
              <p>before leavingthe place, a group of his friends(all gays) came
              over to greet us and it was hinted they're all "together"</p>
              <p>as for straight people... another guy i knew, and ex colleague
              has his whole life revolving around sex, i don't know if he uses
              protection but he usually likes to go clubbing to pick up girls and
              some days he looks for prostitutes.</p>
              <p>and (this one's more like a rumour) one of my seconday school
              mates was said to like doing it without a condom with pros.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why wouldn't HIV spread?</p>

              <p>A discussion-worthy thread should not be all guesswork, no? The statistics were put up purely for discussion and knowledge.</p>
              <p>If anyone should misuse the stats anyhow, it's their life, they choose how they want to live.</p>
              <p>Buying 4D is like betting against the house; the house wins hands down in every game. Here in this case, having unprotected intercourse (and trying to 'win' Aids) is akin to betting against the house - the probability of 'winning' is low.</p>
              <p>I for one, do not advocate such practices. But it's a discussion and I'm objective, just presenting facts and stats rather than prejudiced view.</p>

              <p>As for the Aids situation in subsahara Africa - imagine this. You got lotsa free time, you have unprotected intercourse repeatedly with multiple partners.

              <p> this was what i knew back from a while, was out for dinner in a group with mostly straight couples and 1 gay guy. when the topic suddenly turned into gay sex his description blew me away. he could do it anytime and anywhere, no protection. like just before crossing the causeway with a totally unknown stranger.(he said this stranger was straight but curious) other times it can happen just when you enter a carpark.(another stranger)</p>
              <p>before leavingthe place, a group of his friends(all gays) came over to greet us and it was hinted they're all "together"</p>
              <p>as for straight people... another guy i knew, and ex colleague has his whole life revolving around sex, i don't know if he uses protection but he usually likes to go clubbing to pick up girls and some days he looks for prostitutes.</p>
              <p>and (this one's more like a rumour) one of my seconday school mates was said to like doing it without a condom with pros.</p>

              <p>I got sian'ed immediately the moment I clicked on the link ... I guess I have left philosophy far behind after the one and only free elective in the uni ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I guess I have a "puritanical" view of such things, (despite my own personal record <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">)</p>
              <p>so yes, I do believe in telling people that they have a very good chance of contracting AIDS if they sleep with a sex worker (and probably a host of other nasty bugs too), I do believe in telling people that the best chance of NOT contracting HIV (and a host of other nasty bugs), lies not in using a condom while bonking like a rake, but in being faithful to their partners, I do believe that the majority (not all, of course) of HIV carriers, had no one but themselves to blame, be they wankers who farked around, or drug addicts who shared needles, they shouldn't have been unfaithful, or they shouldn't have been taking drugs in the first place. The biggest tragedy is not in those people dying, but them bringing down other people with them, wives who caught HIV from their unfaithful husbands, child who caught HIV from their parents, poor sods who caught HIV through the health system.</p>
              <p>since you agree that there is a serious problem here .... would the public be better served by tellling them</p>
              <p>1. that there's really a low risk of contracting HIV if you wantonly bonk around (which I dispute in any case)</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>2. there is a good chance that you'll catch it ... and it'll be something you'll regret for the rest of your short live, and you would not only be giving yourself a death sentence, but maybe, innocent people around you as well ? ....</p>
              <p>it's like telling people that the probability of catching lung cancer is actually very low if they smoke, isn't it ? ....</p>
