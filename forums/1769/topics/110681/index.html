            <div class='col-md body'>Sighhh.....I was a nice guy and when I was approached by a china girl I lent her my phone. (Pls hor, not that she is pretty, in fact she not at all) Anyway it happened inside the MRT station while I was waiting for my train. She said she was going to just make one phone call so I oblige. Then I realised that she was making more then just one phone call so I demanded for my phone back but she refused and said "one more one more". Luckily my train came and I just snatch it off from her and got on the train. What luck!<br><br>Once bitten, twice shy.

Could not find him after i came out of the washroom.

But i must say, I was really scared..the two most important possessions were not with me in time of need.<br><br>what would i do if someone approach me and want to borrow my hp?<br><br>I will see who's the person asking...expressions etc..<br><br>If i dun feel safe to lend him/her, I think i will give him/her coins to make a call at the public phone.</div>
