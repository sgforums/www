              <p>that colleague of mine is a super siao on worker, he's dirty
              because he's crawling around the floor to access the bottom of the
              aircraft, there's grease because he bothers to grease the
              aircraft.</p>
              <p>and he gets a lower grade from the management.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>ST is actually damn good for most of the technicians less WO's..cause their pay now with all the OT that they clock is like a WO pay..and they dont have this grading bullshit anymore..Sunday you work, your pay is doubled..So i think in a way, its a good thing that the airforce is commericalising, cause people will work for the money, a much better motivational tool then the PP1/PP2..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
