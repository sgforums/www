              <p>that's why I suggest putting the not safe for drinking sign. Most people will assume that anything that looks very edible in the fridge but is labelled unsafe should be very good to merit the "extra protection". + you have done more than due dilligience by warning the people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>In other news, I'm gonna friggin' hammer some undergrads next

              <p>I already made it clear to them.... hand in their assignments to
              their class rep, then the class rep consolidates and puts the
              assignments on my office table.....</p>
              <p>But instead, the majority of them didn't just hand in late, but
              they went to my office singly and ended up disturbing the other
              postgrads....</p>
              <p>If they had all given me MCs or something, I can still
              accept.... but written notes saying things like <em>'I'm sorry
              sir, I left my assignment in my dorm room'</em> is just asking for
              a chokeslam......</p>
