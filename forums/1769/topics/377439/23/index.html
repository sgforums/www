              <p>There was even a period of time I went home late at night everyday....because there was no other NSFs besides us to splice the ropes. The regulars were having their training so no one else could help.</p>
              <p>The others? Sorry....my back pain. I cannot do. (Ok fine...give benefit of doubt)</p>
              <p>Sorry....I dunno how to do. (Can learn right???)</p>
              <p>Sorry....can I go early? I got driving lesson. (Cpl asking us 3SGs.....we could say no, but then we are all NSFs....so we just LL and say yes)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the 3 of us ORD on the same day....we went to another regular's wedding....but the existing NSFs were not invited. In a ship that's only 100+m and what's supposed to be a close-knit family this is totally unthinkable and tells a lot about the immense problems given by the batch after us.</p>
              <p>And just before I ORD....one of the O lvl folk's parents complained about my unit "torturing" their son. The officer was so pissed he wanted to talk to the parents directly and make them "ashamed they ever had a son like that".</p>

              <p>i remember when i went in, PP1 / PP2 JUST started</p>
              <p>then they say "only the top 10% will get PP2"</p>
              <p>yeah. good.</p>
              <p>now the 10% are the ones who cmi outside so they stay.</p>
              <p>my hardworking squadron personnel have either ORD-ed, early
              release or waiting to go.  some even take PP2 then resign.</p>

              <p>the scholars thought they by saying only the top 10% will get it they thought they were motivating people to work harder outside of their regular job..</p>
              <p>cause maybe they themselves were the top 10% in their educational pursuits so they wanted to keep only the elites, but it backfired horribly.</p>

              <p>actually the airforce shouldnt even be taking in nsfs because of the nature of the work, the secruity complications..like last time according to the old enciks the airforce was all regulars, but those idiotic scholars cames up with plans like pp1/pp2 and started chasing all the regulars away..now there's even a new scheme to cover up for the failures called MDES.</p>

              <p>I dunno why some people can chaokeng without batting an eye. And
              they are the ones who's supposed to have "good" work ethics.</p>
              <p>There was even a period of time I went home late at night
              everyday....because there was no other NSFs besides us to splice
              the ropes. The regulars were having their training so no one else
              could help.</p>
              <p>The others? Sorry....my back pain. I cannot do. (Ok fine...give
              benefit of doubt)</p>
              <p>Sorry....I dunno how to do. (Can learn right???)</p>
              <p>Sorry....can I go early? I got driving lesson. (Cpl asking us
              3SGs.....we could say no, but then we are all NSFs....so we just LL
              and say yes)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the 3 of us ORD on the same day....we went to another
              regular's wedding....but the existing NSFs were not invited. In a
              ship that's only 100+m and what's supposed to be a close-knit
              family this is totally unthinkable and tells a lot about the
              immense problems given by the batch after us.</p>
              <p>And just before I ORD....one of the O lvl folk's parents
              complained about my unit "torturing" their son. The officer was so
              pissed he wanted to talk to the parents directly and make them
              "ashamed they ever had a son like that".</p>

              <p>only the hardworking NSFs get invited to our Regular meet up sessions.</p>
