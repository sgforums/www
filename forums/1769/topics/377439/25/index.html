              <p><strong>Bride and gloom: Newlyweds win £1,500 compensation after disastrous wedding photographs ruin their big day</strong></p>
              <p><span>Marc and Sylvia Day don't spend much time flicking through their wedding album. </span></p>
              <p><span>And looking at these pictures, you can see why. </span></p>
              <p><span>Heads are chopped off, angles are askew and in many shots you would be hard pressed to spot the bride.</span></p>
              <p><span>Add unfortunate positioning and poor lighting and you have a day that is unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>If that wasn't bad enough, thankyou cards provided for the newlyweds
              to send to their guests are emblazoned with their misspelled names. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>This was the work of photographer Gareth Bowers from Fresh Images who charged them £1,450 for the privilege. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>The results were so dire that the Days sued him for damages.</span></p>
              <p><span>Last week a judge in the county court in Pontefract, West
              Yorkshire, agreed, saying Bowers's service was 'woefully inadequate'. He
              was ordered to reimburse the couple £500 and pay £450 damages, £170 court fees and £100
              compensation. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Bowers refused to comment after the case. The Days, however, have
              plenty to say. 'Some of those memories we will never get back again,'
              Mr Day said. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>'He is the Don Quixote of wedding photography - he just doesn't believe that he can't do it.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The Days examined the work of photographers at 11 wedding fairs
              before choosing Bowers to photograph and video the wedding on August 24
              last year. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>But the day was one disaster after another. </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>'The videographer missed us turning up at the reception so he filmed
              the driver opening the car door with nobody inside it,' Mrs Day said.
              'Bowers also missed the cutting of the cake and you can see how angry
              I'm getting on the wedding video - I even do a psycho slashing knife
              action, which I can't believe they left in.' </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>But nothing could compare to the moment the couple sat down to look
              through the 400 photographs taken. They managed to find a mere 22 they
              didn't mind too much. </span></p>

              <p>All this wouldn't have happened if she had just been upfront and honest from the very beginning at the point of signing up.... if anything, it would have won her a lot of goodwill and support for a truly reformed and repentant ex-offender.</p>
              <p>Even after the news broke, she still had her supporters, and they stood by her after she stepped down.... but no, she just had to open her big mouth and slime the runner-up openly. That sure piled a lot of sh*t on all that goodwill.</p>
              <p>And now, this allegation of academic dishonesty.... sigh.... don't tell me she can't even just be a bit paranoid to avoid breaking exam rules.</p>
              <p>If she seems hellbent on walking down the path of destruction, then all we can really do is sit back and enjoy watching someone go boomz by their own hand.... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
