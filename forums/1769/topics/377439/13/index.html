              <p>I try as much as I can to avoid ntuc unless absolutely no choice. cold storage is a much more pleasant place to shop and the crowd there is different too.</p>
              <p>ntuc, I'm sorry to say has a lot of nasty old people(as well as the not so old) shopping there and you constantly see really weird behaviour from these people. there will be loud grumbling, quarelling, sometimes fights, and people kicking their (full) baskets from one end of the aisle to another instead of carrying them. I'm not making this up. it doesn't help that the way they layout the goods in ntuc is really fucked up, causing congestions all over the place. </p>
              <p>I feel happy shopping at cold storage. when shopping at ntuc I feel like I'm in some 3rd world shithole! </p>

              <p>That's a really low BP. Especially the diastolic BP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>That's pretty worrying - I'm thinking that you lost enough water to make your blood more viscous. This leads to increased pressure losses in your bloodstream from increased pipe friction, which may account for the depleted BP reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>When I reported sick during reservist, another medic took my BP. Twice.</p>
