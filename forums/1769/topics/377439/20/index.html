              <p>Really, I fail to see their relevance at all. It seems that their entire mandate is based on that little article in the Consitution about Malays being the indigenuous people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>If they really were agitating for Malay rights, then they'd be doing things like fighting for fair employment policies, providing bursaries for less well-off Malay families, upgrading courses for lower-skilled Malay workers, that sort of thing.....</p>
              <p>But I haven't heard them do any of that sort.</p>
              <p>Heck, I knew that PKMS existed (I walk past their building regularly), but I always thought it was just some little Malay writers' organization or something....</p>

              <p>past 2-3 years ? ..... I reckon it's stayed roughly the same from the time BEFORE I entered poly !!! .....</p>
              <p>at that time, a mechanical or electronics grad gets around 1.6 to 1.8k starting ........ at that time, a 3 room flat costs around 110k .... and a plate of chicken rice cost $2 .....</p>
              <p>it's still around that figure now ... and going downwards ... cos you can employ a foreign degree holder to do the same job for 1.5k a month ....</p>
              <p>one of the agents in my team transacted a 3 room flat last month at marine parade ... for 380k !!!!! ...... and a plate of chicken rice is at least $3 now ....</p>
