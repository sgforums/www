I thot some couples have kids to save their marriage?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  They say having a kid will enhance their marriage woh... it's like the couple became so bland and got nothing to say so need a kid, so that they have something common to talk about, or prolong the marriage?

I'm a grad too and my ex-classmates were married anywhere from early 20's to never.<br><br>However, I do notice that there are many eligible ones around who are not married now.  My neighbours are perfect examples - some VERY attractive, well to do, good social etiquette, no BO....yet single.

Sometimes the habits and lifestyle that we build up in the couple of decades before our marriage can be clashing and... to accommodate someone else is a chore in itself.<br><br>As for kids <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I think any child would like fun loving parents!
