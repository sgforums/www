              <p>In general, a two-stroke engine is able to achieve higher RPM at the expense of torque. There are few moving parts in a two-stroke engine (i.e., no cams, lifters, valves, rocker arms, etc.), but since some of the exhaust gases are invariably mixed with the fresh fuel-air charge coming into the combustion chamber, it does not burn fuel as efficiently as a four-stroker.</p>
              <p>A four-stroke engine generally runs at a lower RPM due to all the additional moving parts, but burns fuel more efficiently (since almost all of the exhaust gases have been expended on the piston's exhaust upstroke) and generates more torque than a comparably-displaced two-stroke engine.</p>
              <p>All of the above is in the context of aircraft engines--there might be differences when applied to motorcycle engines, though.</p>

              <p>This has more to do with gear ratios and less with engine power/displacement.</p>
              <p>At a lower gear ratio (i.e., 1st or 2nd gear), you're trading speed for torque.</p>
              <p>At a higher gear ratio (i.e., 5th or 6th gear), it's the other way round.</p>

              <p>I don't understand, where do you all learn about these things. If you know of a good bike magazine, can recommend? I think as long as they are all engines using 2 stroke cycles, there should be few disparitie, air craft or bikes. </p>
              <p>Apparently there are 6 stroke engines as well. But don't explain it yet because it's getting too cheem for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The operating principles behind two- and four-stroke engines are actually very intuitive and easy to understand. You should be able to find all the information you need on the net. Wikipedia would be a good start, for example.</p>

              <p>there are many local motorcyclists who pass their 2B first before learning and picking up bicycling, so i think not a big issue bah, at most they'll just laugh at me in class.</p>
              <p>i just think the dynamics of bikes are very different from cars, and kindda cool!</p>
