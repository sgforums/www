Are you one of them?  Have you found a job?  What job is it?  And, what was your motivation for searching for a vacation job?<br><br>Each time I meet a teen manning a booth, or working at the cashier's, I feel happy.  I also end up being more patient.  Somehow, I got a soft spot for these teens because for a few of them, this might be their very first job and thus, their very first taste of working life.<br><br>I smile to them and feel like saying something nice to them.  I see this young guy at Guardian Pharmacies trying so earnestly to learn how to use the cashiering system... so cute!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  And then, there's this young girl behind the counter at Subway Sandwiches, learning how to make the right sandwich, peeping over her shoulder to look what has to go into the sandwich and trying very hard to be polite... awwwww!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   The transaction took a long time because the manager had to keep guiding her along the way but seeing her hard at work, I remembered how we all have to start somewhere and how we were all once very frightened and 'slow' in our jobs but later, with experience, we got better and better at it.<br><br>Generally, it's a great feeling to see these youths rolling up their sleeves to try their hand at working earnestly.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   If we meet them, let's be patient and keep encouraging them with smiles and even, words of encouragment.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>It's better to employ teens than adults if you ever own your own business I think. They're genuinely eager to learn, good service (in general better than adults) and don't mind when you pay than less them 1k. Adults like us cannot accept anything less than 1k. it's unimaginable. Some of the best service providers are teenagers.</div>
