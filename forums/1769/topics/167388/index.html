            <div class='col-md body'>Round about this time every year, we'll start seeing a lot of teens taking on all manner of vacation jobs in various establishments.  Are you one of them?  Have you found a job?  What job is it?  And, what was your motivation for searching for a vacation job?<br><br>Each time I meet a teen manning a booth, or working at the cashier's, I feel happy.  I also end up being more patient.  Somehow, I got a soft spot for these teens because for a few of them, this might be their very first job and thus, their very first taste of working life.<br><br>I smile to them and feel like saying something nice to them.  I see this young guy at Guardian Pharmacies trying so earnestly to learn how to use the cashiering system... so cute!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  And then, there's this young girl behind the counter at Subway Sandwiches, learning how to make the right sandwich, peeping over her shoulder to look what has to go into the sandwich and trying very hard to be polite... awwwww!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   The transaction took a long time because the manager had to keep guiding her along the way but seeing her hard at work, I remembered how we all have to start somewhere and how we were all once very frightened and 'slow' in our jobs but later, with experience, we got better and better at it.<br><br>Generally, it's a great feeling to see these youths rolling up their sleeves to try their hand at working earnestly.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   If we meet them, let's be patient and keep encouraging them with smiles and even, words of encouragment.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, Rhonda. It's always nice to hear such words.<br><br>Personally met before some customers who told me to take my time when I just started working as a counter staff. Serving these people make me feel more comfortable than those that just give you the face like saying your service is damn slow or those that simply speaks into their handphones while you are taking their orders halfway. But I transferred to kitchen now after I broke down once at counter.<br><br>To flatbroke, why don't try flipping through the newspaper to look for job? Saw an advertisement by Sakae Sushi about a week ago hiring full-time crews (students after O's or N's on vacation can also apply). Heard from one of my colleagues that their pay is about $5.50 (not very sure though because I never went to check personally), much better than what I'm getting now.</div>
