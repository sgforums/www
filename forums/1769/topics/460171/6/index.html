              I think none of the bus nutters replied specifically on the very fact the perm LTA built bus stop at Khatib for 811 &amp; 860 is not bendy friendly...
              
              I think they never expected LTA to decide to build a 12m bus stop shelter at former Tibs area...

              <p>It would be great to set up a track to develop local talent, but you know that the gov't pays that lip service. The main attractions for our GP are the atmosphere and that it's really easy to get to, although it's at the expense of businesses and people working in that area. The outlay has also been small compared to those places that have to build circuits from scratch.</p>
              <p>If you want it to fail, just move it to an ulu place where it'll look like any other Tilkedrome, and keep everyone stuck in traffic jams like Silverstone and Sepang. The problem won't go away as long as we have a race here.</p>

              some thoughts of my life. It's my pleasure to be invited by prof. 
              Hopefully, it can get you thinking about how... as you pursue this.. 
              embarking on your training to become dental surgeons, to think about 
              other things as well.<br> <br> Since young, I am a typical product of 
              today's society. Relatively successful product that society requires.. 
              From young, I came from a below average family. I was told by the 
              media... and people around me that happiness is about success. And that 
              success is about being wealthy. With this mind-set, I've always be 
              extremely competitive, since I was young.<br> <br> Not only do I need to
               go to the top school, I need to have success in all fields. Uniform 
              groups, track, everything. I needed to get trophies, needed to be 
              successful, I needed to have colours award, national colours award, 
              everything. So I was highly competitive since young. I went on to 
              medical school, graduated as a doctor. Some of you may know that within 
              the medical faculty, ophthalmology is one of the most highly sought 
              after specialities. So I went after that as well. I was given a 
              traineeship in ophthalmology, I was also given a research scholarship by
               NUS to develop lasers to treat the eye. <br> <br> So in the process, I 
              was given 2 patents, one for the medical devices, and another for the 
              lasers. And you know what, all this academic achievements did not bring 
              me any wealth. So once I completed my bond with MOH, I decided that this
               is taking too long, the training in eye surgery is just taking too 
              long. And there's lots of money to be made in the private sector. If 
              you're aware, in the last few years, there is this rise in aesthetic 
              medicine. Tons of money to be made there. So I decided, well, enough of 
              staying in institution, it's time to leave. So I quit my training 
              halfway and I went on to set up my aesthetic clinic... in town, together
               with a day  surgery centre.<br> <br> You know the irony is that people 
              do not make heroes out average GP (general practitioner), family 
              physicians. They don't. They make heroes out of people who are rich and 
              famous. People who are not happy to pay $20 to see a GP, the same person
               have no qualms paying ten thousand dollars for a liposuction, 15 
              thousand dollars for a breast augmentation, and so on and so forth. So 
              it's a no brainer isn't? Why do you want to be a gp? Become an aesthetic
               physician. So instead of healing the sick and ill, I decided that I'll 
              become a glorified beautician. So, business was good, very good. It 
              started off with waiting of one week, then became 3weeks, then one 
              month, then 2 months, then 3 months. I was overwhelmed; there were just 
              too many patients. Vanities are fantastic business. I employed one 
              doctor, the second doctor, the 3rd doctor, the 4th doctor. And within 
              the 1st year, we're already raking in millions. Just the 1st year. But 
              never is enough because I was so obsessed with it. I started to expand 
              into Indonesia to get all the rich Indonesian tai-tais who wouldn't 
              blink an eye to have a procedure done. So life was really good.<br> <br> So what do I do with the spare cash. How do I spend my weekends? 
              Typically, I'll have car club gatherings. I take out my track car, with 
              spare cash I got myself a track car. We have car club gatherings. We'll 
              go up to Sepang in Malaysia. We'll go for car racing. And it was my 
              life. With other spare cash, what do i do? I get myself a Ferrari. At 
              that time, the 458 wasn't out, it's just a spider convertible, 430. This
               is a friend of mine, a schoolmate who is a forex trader, a banker. So 
              he got a red one, he was wanting all along a red one, I was getting the 
              silver  one.<br> <br> So what do I do after getting a car? It's time to 
              buy a house, to build our own bungalows. So we go around looking for a 
              land to build our own bungalows, we went around hunting. So how do i 
              live my life? Well, we all think we have to mix around with the rich and
               famous. This is one of the Miss Universe. So we hang around with the 
              beautiful, rich and famous. This by the way is an internet founder. So 
              this is how we spend our lives, with dining and all the restaurants and 
              Michelin Chefs you know. <br> <br> So I reach a point in life that I got
               everything for my life. I was at the pinnacle of my career and all. 
              That's me one year ago in the gym and I thought I was like, having 
              everything under control and reaching the pinnacle.<br> <br> Well, I was
               wrong. I didn't have everything under control. About last year March, I
               started to develop backache in the middle of nowhere. I thought maybe 
              it was all the heavy squats I was doing. So I went to SGH, saw my 
              classmate to do an MRI, to make sure it's not a slipped disc or 
              anything. And that evening, he called me up and said that we found bone 
              marrow replacement in your spine. I said, sorry what does that mean? I 
              mean I know what it means, but I couldn't accept that. I was like “Are 
              you serious?” I was still running around going to the gym you know. But 
              we had more scans the next day, PET scans - positrons emission  scans,  
              they found that actually I have stage 4 terminal lung cancer. I was like
               "Whoa where did that come from?” It has already spread to the brain, 
              the spine, the liver and the adrenals. And you know one moment I was 
              there, totally thinking that I have everything under control, thinking 
              that I've reached the pinnacle of my life. But the next moment, I have 
              just lost it. <br> <br> This is a CT scan of the lungs itself. If you 
              look at it, every single dot there is a tumour. We call this miliaries 
              tumour. And in fact, I have tens of thousands of them in the lungs. So, I
               was told that even with chemotherapy, that I'll have about 3-4months at
               most. Did my life come crushing on, of course it did, who wouldn't? I 
              went into depression, of course, severe depression and I thought I had 
              everything. <br> <br> See the irony is that all these things that I 
              have, the success, the trophies, my cars, my house and all. I thought 
              that brought me happiness. But i was feeling really down, having severe 
              depression. Having all these thoughts of my possessions, they brought me
               no joy. The thought of... You know, I can hug my Ferrari to sleep, 
              no... No, it is not going to happen. It brought not a single comfort 
              during my last ten months. And I thought they were, but they were not 
              true happiness. But it wasn't. What really brought me joy in the last 
              ten months was interaction with people, my loved ones, friends, people 
              who genuinely care about me, they laugh and cry with me, and they are 
              able to identify the pain and suffering I was going through. That 
              brought joy to me, happiness. None of the things I have, all the 
              possessions, and I thought those were supposed to bring me happiness. 
              But it didn't, because if it did, I would have felt happy think about 
              it, when I was feeling most down..<br> <br> You know the classical 
              Chinese New Year that is coming up. In the past, what do I do? Well, I 
              will usually drive my flashy car to do my rounds, visit my relatives, to
               show it off to my friends. And I thought that was joy, you know. I 
              thought that was really joy. But do you really think that my relatives 
              and friends, whom some of them have difficulty trying to make ends meet,
               that will truly share the joy with me? Seeing me driving my flashy car 
              and showing off to them? No, no way. They won’t be sharing joy with me. 
              They were having problems trying to make ends meet, taking public 
              transport. In fact i think, what I have done is more like you know, 
              making them envious, jealous of all I have. In fact, sometimes even 
              hatred. <br> <br> Those are what we call objects of envy. I have them, I
               show them off to them and I feel it can fill my own pride and ego. That
               didn't bring any joy to these people, to my friends and relatives, and I
               thought they were real joy. <br> <br> Well, let me just share another 
              story with you. You know when I was about your age, I stayed in king 
              Edward VII hall. I had this friend whom I thought was strange. Her name 
              is Jennifer, we're still good friends. And as I walk along the path, she
               would, if she sees a snail, she would actually pick up the snail and 
              put it along the grass patch. I was like why do you need to do that? Why
               dirty your hands? It’s just a snail. The truth is she could feel for 
              the snail. The thought of being crushed to death is real to her, but to 
              me it's just a snail. If you can't get out of the pathway of humans then
               you deserve to be crushed, it’s part of evolution isn't it? What an 
              irony isn't it?<br> <br> There I was being trained as a doctor, to be 
              compassionate, to be able to empathise; but I couldn't. As a house 
              officer, I graduated from medical school, posted to the oncology 
              department at NUH. And, every day, every other day I witness death in 
              the cancer department. When I see how they suffered, I see all the pain 
              they went through. I see all the morphine they have to press every few 
              minutes just to relieve their pain. I see them struggling with their 
              oxygen breathing their last breath and all. But it was just a job. When I
               went to clinic every day, to the wards every day, take blood, give the 
              medication but was the patient real to me? They weren't real to me. It 
              was just a job, I do it, I get out of the ward, I can't wait to get 
              home, I do my own stuff. <br> <br> Was the pain, was the suffering the 
              patients went through real? No. Of course I know all the medical terms 
              to describe how they feel, all the suffering they went through. But in 
              truth, I did not know how they feel, not until I became a patient. It is
               until now; I truly understand how they feel. And, if you ask me, would I
               have been a very different doctor if I were to re-live my life now, I 
              can tell you yes I will. Because I truly understand how the patients 
              feel now. And sometimes, you have to learn it the hard way. <br> <br> Even as you start just your first year, and you embark this journey to 
              become dental surgeons, let me just challenge you on two fronts. <br> <br> Inevitably, all of you here will start to go into private practice. You
               will start to accumulate wealth. I can guarantee you. Just doing an 
              implant can bring you thousands of dollars, it's fantastic money. And 
              actually there is nothing wrong with being successful, with being rich 
              or wealthy, absolutely nothing wrong. The only trouble is that a lot of 
              us like myself couldn't handle it.<br> <br> Why do I say that? Because 
              when I start to accumulate, the more I have, the more I want. The more I
               wanted, the more obsessed I became. Like what I showed you earlier on, 
              all I can was basically to get more possessions, to reach the pinnacle 
              of what society did to us, of what society wants us to be. I became so 
              obsessed that nothing else really mattered to me. Patients were just a 
              source of income, and I tried to squeeze every single cent out of these 
              patients. <br> <br> A lot of times we forget, whom we are supposed to be
               serving. We become so lost that we serve nobody else but just 
              ourselves. That was what happened to me. Whether it is in the medical, 
              the dental fraternity, I can tell you, right now in the private 
              practice, sometimes we just advise patients on treatment that is not 
              indicated. Grey areas. And even though it is not necessary, we kind of 
              advocate it. Even at this point, I know who are my friends and who 
              genuinely cared for me and who are the ones who try to make money out of
               me by selling me "hope". We kind of lose our moral compass along the 
              way. Because we just want to make money. <br> <br> Worse, I can tell 
              you, over the last few years, we bad mouth our fellow colleagues, our 
              fellow competitors in the industry. We have no qualms about it. So if we
               can put them down to give ourselves an advantage, we do it. And that's 
              what happening right now, medical, dental everywhere. My challenge to 
              you is not to lose that moral compass. I learnt it the hard way, I hope 
              you don't ever have to do it.<br> <br> Secondly, a lot of us will start 
              to get numb to our patients as we start to practise. Whether is it 
              government hospitals, private practice, I can tell you when I was in the
               hospital, with stacks of patient folders, I can't wait to get rid of 
              those folders as soon as possible; I can't wait to get patients out of 
              my consultation room as soon as possible because there is just so many, 
              and that's a reality. Because it becomes a job, a very routine job. And 
              this is just part of it. Do I truly know how the patient feels back 
              then? No, I don't. The fears and anxiety and all, do I truly understand 
              what they are going through? I don't, not until when this happens to me 
              and I think that is one of the biggest flaws in our system. <br> <br> We’re being trained to be healthcare providers, professional, and all 
              and yet we don't know how exactly they feel. I'm not asking you to get 
              involved emotionally, I don't think that is professional but do we 
              actually make a real effort to understand their pain and all? Most of us
               won’t, alright, I can assure you. So don't lose it, my challenge to you
               is to always be able to put yourself in your patient's shoes. <br> <br> Because the pain, the anxiety, the fear are very real even though it's 
              not real to you, it's real to them. So don't lose it and you know, right
               now I'm in the midst of my 5th cycle of my chemotherapy. I can tell you
               it’s a terrible feeling. Chemotherapy is one of those things that you 
              don't wish even your enemies to go through because it's just suffering, 
              lousy feeling, throwing out, you don't even know if you can retain your 
              meals or not. Terrible feeling! And even with whatever little energy now
               I have, I try to reach out to other cancer patients because I truly 
              understand what pain and suffering is like. But it's kind of little too 
              late and too little.<br> <br> You guys have a bright future ahead of you
               with all the resource and energy, so I’m going to challenge you to go 
              beyond your immediate patients. To understand that there are people out 
              there who are truly in pain, truly in hardship. Don’t get the idea that 
              only poor people suffer. It is not true. A lot of these poor people do 
              not have much in the first place, they are easily contented. for all you
               know they are happier than you and me but there are out there, people 
              who are suffering mentally, physically, hardship, emotionally, 
              financially and so on and so forth, and they are real. We choose to 
              ignore them or we just don't want to know that they exist. <br> <br> So 
              do think about it alright, even as you go on to become professionals and
               dental surgeons and all. That you can reach out to these people who are
               in need. Whatever you do can make a large difference to them. I'm now 
              at the receiving end so I know how it feels, someone who genuinely care 
              for you, encourage and all. It makes a lot of difference to me. That’s 
              what happens after treatment. I had a treatment recently, but I’ll leave
               this for another day. A lot of things happened along the way, that's 
              why I am still able to talk to you today. <br> <br> I'll just end of 
              with this quote here, it's from this book called Tuesdays with Morris, 
              and some of you may have read it. Everyone knows that they are going to 
              die; every one of us knows that. The truth is, none of us believe it 
              because if we did, we will do things differently. When I faced death, 
              when I had to, I stripped myself off all stuff totally and I focused 
              only on what is essential. The irony is that a lot of times, only when 
              we learn how to die then we learn how to live. I know it sounds very 
              morbid for this morning but it's the truth, this is what I’m going 
              through. <br> <br> Don’t let society tell you how to live. Don’t let the
               media tell you what you're supposed to do. Those things happened to me.
               And I led this life thinking that these are going to bring me 
              happiness. I hope that you will think about it and decide for yourself 
              how you want to live your own life. Not according to what other people 
              tell you to do, and you have to decide whether you want to serve 
              yourself, whether you are going to make a difference in somebody else's 
              life. Because true happiness doesn't come from serving yourself. I 
              thought it was but it didn't turn out that way. With that I thank you, 
              if you have any questions you have for me, please feel free. Thank you.</span></span></h5>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, there's only so much that  fame, wealth, beauty, intellect, or power can do to make you happy.</p>
              <p>Instead, the most effective things that can make you happy are friendships, altruism, and religion.</p>
              <p>In other words, you can only really be happy if you take the focus off making yourself happy.</p>

              <p>I just watched the Brands Hatch GP finale of BTCC.</p>
              <p>Aron Smith wins in his rookie year!</p>
              <p>Frank Wrathall takes his first win after pundits touted him to be a future champion, in a Toyota. The first for Toyota since 1993!</p>
              <p>And finally Gordon Shedden wins! First scotsman since the 1990s to win.....that was really great to see.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't mind learning, if I can take a look at the instructor she plans to learn from. I have some spare moolah thanks to my ineligibility for driving.</p>
