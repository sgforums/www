              <p>Here's a test to help you determine if you're ready to have children:</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><blockquote>
              <p><strong>Test 1: Preparation</strong></p>
              <p>Women: To prepare for pregnancy</p>
              <p>1. Put on a dressing gown and stick a beanbag down the front.<br>2. Leave it there.<br>3. After 9 months remove 5% of the beans.</p>
              <p>Men: To prepare for children</p>
              <p>1. Go to a local chemist, tip the contents of your wallet onto the counter and tell the pharmacist to help himself<br>2. Go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office.<br>3. Go home. Pick up the newspaper and read it for the last time.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 2: Knowledge</strong></p>
              <p>Find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels and how they have allowed their children to run wild.</p>
              <p>Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behaviour.</p>
              <p>Enjoy it. It will be the last time in your life that you will have all the answers.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 3: Nights</strong></p>
              <p>To discover how the nights will feel:</p>
              <p>1. Walk around the living room from 5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 4 - 6kg, with a radio turned to static (or some other obnoxious sound) playing loudly.<br>2. At 10pm, put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight and go to sleep.<br>3. Get up at 11pm and walk the bag around the living room until 1am.<br>4. Set the alarm for 3am.<br>5. As you can't get back to sleep, get up at 2am and make a cup of tea.<br>6. Go to bed at 2.45am.<br>7. Get up again at 3am when the alarm goes off.<br>8. Sing songs in the dark until 4am.<br>9. Put the alarm on for 5am. Get up when it goes off.<br>10. Make breakfast.<br>Keep this up for 5 years. LOOK CHEERFUL.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 4: Dressing Small Children</strong></p>
              <p>1. Buy a live octopus and a string bag.<br>2. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that no arms hangout.<br>Time Allowed: 5 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 5: Cars</strong></p>
              <p>1. Forget the BMW. Buy a practical 5-door wagon.<br>2. Buy a chocolate ice cream cone and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there.<br>3. Get a coin. Insert it into the CD player.<br>4. Take a box of chocolate biscuits; mash them into the back seat.<br>5. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 6: Going for a walk</strong></p>
              <p>a. Wait.<br>b. Go out the front door.<br>c. Come back in again.<br>d. Go out.<br>e. Come back in again.<br>f. Go out again.<br>g. Walk down the front path.<br>h. Walk back up it.<br>i. Walk down it again.<br>j. Walk very slowly down the road for five minutes.<br>k. Stop, inspect minutely and ask at least 6 questions about every piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way.<br>l. Retrace your steps.<br>m. Scream that you have had as much as you can stand until the neighbours come out and stare at you.<br>n. Give up and go back into the house.<br>You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 7: Conversations with children</strong></p>
              <p>Repeat everything you say at least 5 times.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 8: Grocery Shopping</strong></p>
              <p>1. Go to the local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to a pre-school child - a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat.<br>2. Buy your weekly groceries without letting the goat(s) out of your sight.<br>3. Pay for everything the goat eats or destroys.<br>Until you can easily accomplish this, do not even contemplate having children.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 9: Feeding a 1 year-old</strong></p>
              <p>1. Hollow out a melon<br>2. Make a small hole in the side<br>3. Suspend the melon from the ceiling and swing it side to side<br>4. Now get a bowl of soggy cornflakes and attempt to spoon them into the swaying melon while pretending to be an aeroplane.<br>5. Continue until half the cornflakes are gone.<br>6. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 10:TV</strong></p>
              <p>1. Learn the names of every character from the Wiggles, Barney, Teletubbies and Disney.<br>2. Watch nothing else on television for at least 5 years.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 11: Mess</strong></p>
              <p>1. Smear peanut butter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains<br>2. Hide a fish behind the stereo and leave it there all summer.<br>3. Stick your fingers in the flowerbeds and then rub them on clean walls. Cover the stains with crayon. How does that look?<br>4. Empty every drawer/cupboard/storage box in your house onto the floor and proceed with step 5.<br>5. Drag randomly items from one room to another room and leave them there.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 12: Long Trips with Toddlers</strong></p>
              <p>1. Make a recording of someone shouting 'Mummy' repeatedly. Important Notes: No more than a 4 second delay between each Mummy. Include occasional crescendo to the level of a supersonic jet.<br>2. Play this tape in your car, everywhere you go for the next 4 years.<br>You are now ready to take a long trip with a toddler.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 13: Conversations</strong></p>
              <p>1. Start talking to an adult of your choice.<br>2. Have someone else continually tug on your shirt hem or shirt sleeve while playing the Mummy tape listed above.<br>You are now ready to have a conversation with an adult while there is a child in the room.</p>
              <p><strong>Test 14: Getting ready for work</strong></p>
              <p>1. Pick a day on which you have an important meeting.<br>2. Put on your finest work attire.<br>3. Take a cup of cream and put 1 cup of lemon juice in it<br>4. Stir<br>5. Dump half of it on your nice silk shirt<br>6. Saturate a towel with the other half of the mixture<br>7. Attempt to clean your shirt with the same saturated towel<br>8. Do not change (you have no time).<br>9. Go directly to work</p>

              <p>Luckily Her Majesty didn't have to deliver this letter:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">
              </span></p><div id="id_50a06a62a4c416d24482884" class="text_exposed_root text_exposed"><br><br>To the citizens of the United States of America from Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II<br><br>In light of your failure in recent years to nominate competent candidates for President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately. (You should look up 'revocation' in the Oxford English Dictionary.)<br><br>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except North Dakota, which she does not fancy).<br><br>Your new Prime Minister, David Cameron, will appoint a Governor for America without the need for further elections.<br><br>Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.<br><br>To aid in the transition to a British Crown dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>1. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'colour,' 'favour,' 'labour' and 'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix '-ize' will be replaced by the suffix '-ise.' Generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary').<br><br>------------------------<br><br>2. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ''like' and 'you know' is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. There is no such thing as U.S. English. We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take into account the reinstated letter 'u'' and the elimination of '-ize.'<br><br>-------------------<br><br>3. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>4. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not quite ready to be independent. Guns should only be used for shooting grouse. If you can't sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not ready to shoot grouse.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>5. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. Although a permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>6. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left side with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Both roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>7. The former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline) of roughly $10/US gallon. Get used to it.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>8. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>9. The cold, tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer, and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as Lager. South African beer is also acceptable, as they are pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. They are also part of the British Commonwealth - see what it did for them. American brands will be referred to as Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine, so that all can be sold without risk of further confusion.<br><br>---------------------<br><br>10. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play English characters. Watching Andie Macdowell attempt English dialect in Four Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater.<br><br>---------------------<br><br>11. You will cease playing American football. There is only one kind of proper football; you call it soccer. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies). <br><br>---------------------<br><br>12. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.1% of you are aware there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. You will learn cricket, and we will let you face the South Africans first to take the sting out of their deliveries.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>13.. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>14. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776).<br><br>---------------<br><br>15. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 p.m. with proper cups, with saucers, and never mugs, with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; plus strawberries (with cream) when in season.<br><br></div>
