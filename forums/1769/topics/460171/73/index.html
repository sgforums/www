              <p>This is why I like Yahoo News..... none of that propaganda crap in the print media, while having none of the stupidity and vile invective of TR Emeritus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/fury-over-6-9-million-population-target-for-singapore-103503070.html">Yahoo News: Fury over the 6.9 million population target for Singapore</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I have seen nothing that convinces me that we really need 6.9 million people. Sure, economic growth is good, but if there's one thing I've learnt about money, it is that you only really need it up to a point. All the rest is for showing off.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I have not seen any concrete plans for infrastructure upgrade either. The proposed new MRT lines are just squiggles on a map. I have not seen things like proposed stations, ground surveys, and a budget.</p>
              <p>The proposed new towns are also just that - some words in a proposal, nothing more. I have not seen things like proposed roads and layouts, central hubs for the new towns, and so on.</p>
              <p>In fact, unless we colonise Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong and build multiple bridge links to them, I find it very difficult to see how we're going to accomodate all those people.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I have seen nothing that convinces me that we really
              need 6.9 million people. Sure, economic growth is good, but if
              there's one thing I've learnt about money, it is that you only
              really need it up to a point. All the rest is for showing off.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I have not seen any concrete plans for infrastructure
              upgrade either. The proposed new MRT lines are just squiggles on a
              map. I have not seen things like proposed stations, ground surveys,
              and a budget.</p>
              <p>The proposed new towns are also just that - some words in a
              proposal, nothing more. I have not seen things like proposed roads
              and layouts, central hubs for the new towns, and so on.</p>
              <p>In fact, unless we colonise Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong and
              build multiple bridge links to them, I find it very difficult to
              see how we're going to accomodate all those people.</p>

              <p>lau lee's son is surrounded by a few layers of brownnosing bastards...</p>
              <p>when shit happens and the people KPKB about it, the first layer are the grassroots lea-duhs who have a vested interest in making sure their privileges are secure so they will filter the shit to make it less smelly to the next level, who are the Exec Committee of the constituency</p>
              <p>the Exec Committee also have vested interests as they have the ear of the "advisors" who are the MPs.. so the filter the less smelly shit even further to make it less toxic..</p>
              <p>the MPs who also have a vested interest promoting themselves and making sure everything is "nice and dandy" then have a look at the non-smelly, non-toxic shit and say "hey.. this is not a bad fertiliser" and then dress up and package the "fertiliser" telling the Perm Secs and the 2nd minsters/ministers of state to tell the ministers that it is good fertiliser and we should promote the use of the stuff...</p>
              <p>the 2nd ministers/ministers of state who want to be seen as good loyal yesmen to the ministers then put a nice box on the fertiliser and tell the ministers "this is great plant food and will promote growth"</p>
              <p>the minister hoping to get even bigger bonuses and "carry" the PM then report to the PM, promoting the stuff that "this is the most amazing new stuff which will result in growth.. and when it grows, we can give ourselves bigger bonuses"</p>
              <p>and this is how shit becomes policy</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, prior to this idiotic White Paper I thought that the MIW had simply lost the way, and like any wayward traveller, could be led back to the right path.</p>
              <p>But now I rank them on the same level as SDP. Seriously.</p>

              <p>Reminds me of the 'debate' over rising the GST to 7%.</p>
              <p>The only people in Parliament to raise concerns over the impact of that measure were the opposition MPs, the NCMPs, and the NMPs.</p>
              <p>All the others were part of a big cheerleading team. They just lacked the uniforms and the pom-poms.</p>
              <p>That was a classic case of groupthink if I ever saw one.</p>
