              <p>Okay. I still believe that we shouldn't have to go and buy a whole new computer or phone because one or a few parts are outdated or failing. We should be able to upgrade and customise much more.</p>

              <p><br>I 2nd ur opinion.</p>
              <p>However, unlike a desktop, netbook upgrade and parts replacement are rather limited. Gotta weigh in the age as well becoz U cant just "upgrade" it's screen and repairing of "old/obsolete" parts actually cost as much as the newer parts becoz old parts are getting harder to come by. An example would be PC RAMs between DDR2 and DDR3...</p>

              <p>I do not know what is your spec for ur current existing netbook
              (I'm not sure on netbook/lappy mobos). But adding in 8 gb and SSD
              would seem like adding a turbo charger on a beetle. Not that it
              cannot perform though but I think getting a proper laptop might be
              better.</p>
              <p>One that comes with reasonably 8 gb and SSD... SSD really plays
              a big part over improvement of performance... U'll be shocked at
              the hibernate/wake up speed...</p>

              <p>As a society this is where we've failed. We're so averse to confrontation that we try to cut out face-to-face meetings as far as possible and turn to social media or higher powers like the police or MPs to express our grievances. The issue gets blown out of proportion sometimes as it did with AC, and also with the dying man and his cats.</p>
              <p>As you say, a lot of trouble can be save with a short walk and a civilised conversation. We left our ability to empathise and our EQ behind somewhere along the road to prosperity.</p>

              <p>okay.. as for "bo lui", you guys have a think about this..</p>

              <p>to add to this, the amount of money they have to pay out for the CPF and the suspicion that they pilfered the CPF money to shore up Temasek is getting louder even though i hope they did not do it and there is no evidence despite the shroud of opaqueness about the CPF funds...</p>
