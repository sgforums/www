              <p> </p>
              <p>On my part, it's too early to tell whether the prank call led to the suicide. I mean, for all you know the nurse may have been having financial problems or something, and that was what that caused her to take her own life.</p>
              <p>That said, a prank at the expense of others is never truly harmless. Even without the suicide, the DJs had tied up the time and the efforts of the overworked nurses who had to take that hoax call. Sure, they didn't intend for the nurse to kill herself, but their original intentions were far from noble to begin with.</p>
              <p>Hell, I hope this acts as a lesson to our local DJs about taking requests for prank calls. They are the main reason why I hardly ever listen to the local radio these days.</p>

              <p>I also think that even if they're responsible, at most what the DJs did was to provide a little indirect extra push over the edge.</p>
              <p>Even so, I myself would be devasted if I knew that I helped to push someone over the edge, no matter how little or indirect that push may be.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, there is no such thing as a truly altruistic prank. Someone always gets the short end of the stick when it comes to pranks. The best thing for everyone to do is to simply refrain for engaging in such behaviour.</p>

              <p>In the end it all boils down to your intentions.</p>
              <p>Your intention was to ask a creditor for payments that were legally due. As long as that was all there was to your calls, then you bear no responsibility for what happened.</p>
              <p>However, had you been sending a pig's head to the guy's doorstep or something, then yes, you bear responsibility for being the trigger..... which I'm sure you didn't do.</p>
              <p>In the case of the DJs, their intention was to prank some nurses halfway across the world for some laughs over the airwaves. Certainly there was nothing good in that.</p>

              <p>In my job a long time ago, chasing for payments, it is rather unfortunate that I came across this case where I called, and it was the father who picked up.</p>
              <p>Me: I'm from xxx, can I speak to xxx?</p>
              <p>Father: You guys never read the news, he commited sucide at Bedok Reservoir! Its all your fault.</p>
              <p>That wasn't a prank call of course, but most unfortunately its a whole series of events that ended with me being the trigger.</p>

              <p>In the end it all boils down to your intentions.</p>
              <p>Your intention was to ask a creditor for payments that were legally due. As long as that was all there was to your calls, then you bear no responsibility for what happened.</p>
              <p>However, had you been sending a pig's head to the guy's doorstep or something, then yes, you bear responsibility for being the trigger..... which I'm sure you didn't do.</p>
              <p>In the case of the DJs, their intention was to prank some nurses halfway across the world for some laughs over the airwaves. Certainly there was nothing good in that.</p>

              <p>Maybe they're just curious about the Duchess's condition and were testing their luck. Certainly not as bo-liao as certain local DJs called The Muttons, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTa--GR95eU">who call people up to laugh at their poor diction</a>.</p>
