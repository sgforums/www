              <p>My best guess is that the PC wanted concealment at all costs, and so he ordered all those with smoke grenades to throw at the same time.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if the smokescreen of one grenade is thick, six is deadly. Anyone who runs through that kind of smokescreen is going to gasp and wheeze at the minimum. Hell, I'd expect some perfectly fit people to collapse from inhaling all that smoke.</p>
              <p>You hear that, <a href="http://limpehft.blogspot.sg/2012/04/zheng-huiting-and-death-of-soldier.html">Zheng Huiting</a>? Want to take up the challenge of running through six thick smokescreens? One cough or wheeze from you, and we'll all point and laugh at you.</p>

              <p>The headline is factual, I'll give them that.</p>
              <p>But putting a totally unrelated photograph of a bunch of guys in baju kurung to dress up the article? That's just provocative.</p>

              <p>Looking at many of the recent incidents, I have to conclude that a general safety culture is not there.</p>
              <p>1. That 3SG who died in the Land Rover accident ==&gt; why the hell was an unlicensed driver made to drive the vehicle?</p>
              <p>2. That PTE who died from smoke grenade fumes ==&gt; TSR clearly states no more than two smoke grenades in the same area at the same time. What's with six grenades?</p>
              <p>3. That LCP who drowned in Brunei ==&gt; why was he all alone in his boat? Where was the vehicle commander? And even if he had to be alone, then shouldn't he at least be in the middle of the pack so others can see him should he capsize?</p>

              <p>I think the Serve and F-off attitude plays a big role.</p>
              <p>The main reason why there's such a strong safety culture at my end is probably due to the fact that my unit was an all-regular one. Regulars are more experienced and tend to take their stuff more seriously and look out for one another, particularly if its all regulars as in my case.</p>
              <p>Having come from an army BMT, I think many army staff look upon NSFs like mere rags. Of course it might be because I was a recruit no doubt then.</p>

              <p>1.9k for Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM, and a 500GB HDD.</p>
              <p>That's steep, considering that I can easily get an Acer for 1.3k with Core i7, 8GB RAM, and a 120GB SSD.</p>
              <p>But I'm totally unimpressed by Acer's build quality. They use el cheapo plastic that flexes easily under light pressure. I want something that lasts.</p>
              <p>I found a local eBay seller that sells the ThinkPad for 1.3k, brand new and sealed in original packaging. But I have my doubts about that.</p>

              <p>hmmm.. they're still using HDDs?</p>
              <p>thought most lappies would move over to SSDs by now.. and yes it is very steep for a i5 when you can get an i7 of other builds at a similar price</p>
              <p>maybe other brands?</p>

              <p>Acer is tempting, because they have the best specs-to-cost ratio. But their build quality is terrible. Tested one display model myself - a couple of years of typing reports on that thing is going to ruin it.</p>
              <p>Toshiba? Had a torrid time with that during my undergrad years. I'm never going to touch that brand again, ever.</p>
              <p>Sony and Fujitsu are almost as expensive as Lenovo ThinkPads, and their build quality doesn't come close matching them.</p>
              <p>Still evaluating Asus, HP, and Samsung.</p>

              <p>I've had my Dell laptop, 4GB RAM, 500GB space, dual-core for 3+ years and it has never given me any problems, and its still terrifically fast.</p>
              <p>Granted I try to avoid playing games to strain it less, but considering it cost me 1.3K then, I think it was bang for bucks.</p>

              <p>SBS2601D in other news, failed terribly in maths. Wanted to input 1.5 hrs into the mental calculator to arrive at 12pm, inadvertantly added 2.5hrs instead.</p>

              <p><br>Take a serious look at Asus. I'm still happy with my laptop after 3 years, and it hasn't given any issues so far, big or small. They're all made by Foxconn anyway, but the quality, specs and design are good.</p>
