              <p>Its the price to pay for being small.</p>
              <p>The other question I had to tackle was if I thought South Korea's strategy in developing the likes of Samsung was something other countries could emulate.</p>
              <p>My assessment was a no.</p>
              <p>My answer was that Taiwan's model of complementing its industries with foreign MNCs (read SG's strategy) was more viable.</p>
              <p>In short, if you look at what happens today, you cant really blame MIW for the "hub this hub that" thinking. The reason is that we have little choice but to plug ourselves to the global economy if we want a less risky growth strategy.</p>
              <p>Indeed I pointed out that Samsung was lucky. Korea took a HUGE gamble on electronics and it paid off.</p>
              <p>If the USA hadn't arm-twisted Japan back in 1986, I can safely tell you Samsung would have bankrupted back then!</p>

              <p>And yes. I pointed out that pandering to the world market might very well cost us dearly as well.</p>
              <p>We would lack an identity.</p>
              <p>We would have to be cheaper, better, faster.</p>
              <p>It really is a high price to pay if we look from the perspective of the ordinary citizen.</p>
              <p>But I couldn't provide an alternative strategy that would generate jobs for everybody.</p>

              <p>The other question I had to tackle was if I thought South Korea's strategy in developing the likes of Samsung was something other countries could emulate.</p>
              <p>My assessment was a no.</p>
              <p>My answer was that Taiwan's model of complementing its industries with foreign MNCs (read SG's strategy) was more viable.</p>
              <p>In short, if you look at what happens today, you cant really blame MIW for the "hub this hub that" thinking. The reason is that we have little choice but to plug ourselves to the global economy if we want a less risky growth strategy.</p>
              <p>Indeed I pointed out that Samsung was lucky. Korea took a HUGE gamble on electronics and it paid off.</p>
              <p>If the USA hadn't arm-twisted Japan back in 1986, I can safely tell you Samsung would have bankrupted back then!</p>

              <p>By 'likes' did they mean electronics or homegrown companies? Hyundai and now Kia are doing well in the motor industry too, and have been for the past 5 years.</p>

              <p>Yes. The likes referred to the Chaebol system, but the particular interest and the specialty of the professor was in the electronics sector.</p>
              <p>Based on my past looking-up, actually KIA was another example of why SG couldnt afford to follow Korea's example.</p>
              <p>KIA went flat bankrupt in 1997 crisis and had to be bailed out by the govt.</p>
              <p>And that was because by refusing to use FDI to finance, Korea had to find dough in the form of external debt.</p>
              <p>When Asia went belly up, so did the majority of the Korean firms. Which was why Korea was particularly badly hit in 1997.</p>
              <p>Today's story is different but the past reflects inherent risks that developing countries can ill-afford.</p>

              <p>The latter still holds true. It seems that we're trying to attract foreign investment by bucking the worldwide trend of protecting people more than businesses. But our local businesses haven't developed much and are still dependent on migrant workers and grants, aren't they?</p>

              <p>Spot on.</p>
              <p>It calles into question the entire sustainability of the system.</p>
              <p>In our jargon, we call it "technology-less growth". And its something that has been found to afflict ASEAN countries.</p>
              <p>Consider Krugman's assessment of SG in 1994.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Singapore's growth has been based largely on onetime<br>changes in behavior that cannot be repeated.<br>Over the past generation the percentage of people<br>employed has almost doubled; it cannot double<br>again. A half-educated work force has been replaced<br>by one in which the bulk of workers has high school<br>diplomas; it is unlikely that a generation from now<br>most Singaporeans will have Ph.D's. And an<br>investment share of 40 percent is amazingly high by<br>any standard; a share of 70 percent would be<br>ridiculous. So one can immediately conclude that<br>Singapore is unlikely to achieve future growth rates<br>comparable to those of the past. ... all of Singapore's<br>growth can be explained by increases in measured<br>inputs. There is no sign at all of increased efficiency.”</span></p>
              <p>Of course we know now how wrong he is. But the logic stands.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, his assessment was also based on some terribly flawed methodology which has been heavily criticised (using his method revealed a technological progress of SG as negative??!!).</p>

              <p>If you are talking about the shitty growth rate now, its due to the shitty EU politics elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Its also a natural evolvement of our economy. We cant be growing forever!</p>
              <p>If you talking cheaper better faster and KPI, that thinking evolved from our FDI-led strategy. It really is a rat race.</p>
              <p>And it will get worse, no mistake about that.</p>
              <p>Because now the rest of the world has awoken to the terrific idea of selling their people to the global market and now the MNCs are spoilt for choice.</p>
              <p>Do we have a choice out of this?</p>
              <p>We often compare to Japan, that has remained stable despite its "lost decade", but Japan has a large domestic market to fall back on.</p>
              <p>We do not.</p>
              <p>So the global market is in fact paramount to our survival.</p>
              <p>A lot of people might say that growth is not everything, but its easy to say that when we have the dough now.</p>
              <p>Perhaps thats why they say often also that the older generation can tahan more nonsense because they underwent shit that people like me, never knew of.</p>
              <p>As individuals nonetheless, it isnt really all gloom as long as we can find ways to circumvent these issues. And if anything, the SG education and economy does provide for that.</p>
              <p>The problem comes when you fall through the non-existent safety net though!</p>
