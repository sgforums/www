              <p>Hmmm....my friend suddenly got the hibbie-jibbies about driving up to Ipoh and pulled out...with his car.</p>
              <p>Now I reckon I can either fly or take bus (NO KTM!). The former saves me 6-7 hrs of time but costs more than double the latter, which sets me back around 100 bucks more.</p>
              <p>If I save time, I can see more.</p>
              <p>But if I save money, I can pay for seeing caves and white water rafting!</p>

              <p>True that.</p>
              <p>But the Bangladeshi politics are centred around 2 hugely childish women, who unfortunately, hold their countrymen hostage in their struggles to out-do each other.</p>
              <p>Every bangla that I spoke to (those who do speak english), want nothing more than to shoot both with guns (exact words!), but nobody dares to do it.</p>
              <p>There was a slight reprieve though, when someone managed to use the constitution loophole to jail both of them simultaneously, which was cheered by the whole country.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for some reason, the charges against both were dropped and they were then freed when the window for jailing them expired.</p>
              <p>To give an idea just how childish it gets, their international airport has been named and renamed umpteen times, according to who ruled at that point.</p>
              <p>Foreign donors got fed up eventually and withdrew money to upgrade the airport.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Mildura Police are urging motorists to be careful when relying on the mapping system on the Apple i-phones operating on the iOS 6 system after a number of motorists were directed off the beaten track in recent weeks.<br><br>Local Police have been called to assist distressed motorists who have become stranded within the Murray-Sunset National Park after following directions on their Apple i-phone.<br><br>Tests on the mapping system by police confirm the mapping systems lists Mildura in the middle of the Murray Sunset National Park, approximately 70km away from the actual location of Mildura.<br><br>Police are extremely concerned as <em>there is no water supply within the Park and temperatures can reach as high as 46 degrees</em>, making this a potentially life threatening issue.<br><br><em>Some of the motorists located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours without food or water and have walked long distances through dangerous terrain to get phone reception.</em><br><br>Police have contacted Apple in relation to the issue and hope the matter is rectified promptly to ensure the safety of motorists travelling to Mildura.<br><br>Anyone travelling to Mildura or other locations within Victoria should rely on other forms of mapping until this matter is rectified.</p>

              <p>Partially the motorists have themselves to blame as well.</p>
              <p> Before buying any tech device, the onus is on the customers to do their homework first by reading reviews and sourcing for opinions. In this case, the problems with Apple Maps are well-documented, and any honest review of it will talk about it.</p>
              <p>But if these iSheep are hellbent on buying the latest Apple toy without bothering to read the reviews first, then we all get the right to point and laugh at them when they get lost in the desert.</p>
              <p>My only sympathy is with the police, who have to waste valuable time and resources going after motorists who get stranded as a result of their iCrap.... I mean, iPhone.</p>

              <p>Well, before you can get others' opinions, they need to get the phone first. There have to be first movers, and how many of them would test their phone on a place like that?</p>
              <p>Google Maps isn't perfect either. Week in, week out, we organise our gatherings on Dunlop Street and there'll always be one or 2 people who end up walking up and down Serangoon Road because that's where the pin is.</p>
              <p>Instead, I blame the inability of certain people to use proper maps and street directories. They've become so reliant on these devices that they've neglected basic orienteering skills.</p>
