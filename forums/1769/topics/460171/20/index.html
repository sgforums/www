              <p>They are good at making intuitive and ergonomic designs, but the quality of the materials is awful. For all of Jonny Ive's talk about 'craftsmanship' the recent Apple products are so flimsy that they need protective covers - which defies the purpose of making them thin and light.</p>

              <p>The only good thing I have to say about the MBP is the magnetic power plug. If you accidentally trip over the wire, the MBP is less likely to crash onto the floor.</p>
              <p>Anyway, there's no need to get defensive. A good industrial designer knows that form is useless without good materials. Maybe their design would have worked if they had used aircraft-grade titanium. But apparently they forgot about this little detail. </p>
              <p>Macs are sexy young things, but I can't handle their fragility. I need a workhorse.</p>

              <p>Apple is in decline, period.</p>
              <p>Maybe they won't crash and burn tomorrow, but their star is fading, and Samsung et al are glowing brighter and brighter.</p>
              <p>Right now Apple is relying solely on the goodwill of the iSheeps.... I mean, fans who will take no pay leave to queue up for a new product without even reading the reviews.</p>
              <p>But even that goodwill is drying up. Lots of iSheeps have been crying bloody murder at the iPhone 5.</p>

              <p>wtf!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Muller makes a blinding rolling start and takes lead from Huff.</p>
              <p>The front 6 cars made it through, but the remaining cars got stuck behind a pile-up.</p>
              <p>Huff showed him who's boss and an EXTREMELY late-braking move surprised Muller into giving him space at the hair-pin.</p>
              <p>3 corners later, Huff's car suddenly sported a broken front bumper and started crabbing and wobbling. DNF!</p>
              <p>A few laps later, Menu and Muller started rubbing and the brand-new Honda was harassing both of them. At one point, Muller got tapped into a spin, but fortunately everybody survived.</p>
              <p>And the new Honda gets a 3rd! Amazing race. I look forward to seeing the Honda in 2013.</p>
              <p>Crazy crazy race.</p>
              <p>Suddenly all 3 chevy drivers are now in title contention once again for race 2.</p>

              <p>Right now Apple is relying solely on the goodwill of the iSheeps.... I mean, fans who will take no pay leave to queue up for a new product without even reading the reviews.</p>
