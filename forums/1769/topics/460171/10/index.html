              <p>Just now while I was at the train station (Tanah Merah), a train came. I didn't board it because I knew from experience that the next one would be an empty train from the depot.</p>
              <p>One fella ran on the platform, pushed me from behind...... and didn't board the current train.</p>
              <p>KNN..... you want to rush for the train, you push people. Want to wait for the next train, you also push people? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p>I can identify with that.</p>
              <p>There are people who would not go the extra mile in doing their homework, but rather rely on their "networks" to get their shit cleaned.</p>

              <p>There are some who might argue on "being more efficient". It is faster by asking a pro (though whether the person being ask is a pro or not, is a different issue) and more likely to be correct.</p>

              <p>I value networks of information and expertise to get information, opinions, suggestions, ideas, resources, fast and accurate. One might call it "using" in a bad term, but we call it leveraging... After all, we do provide input shld the other parties requires...</p>
