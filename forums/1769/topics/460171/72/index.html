              <p>Sigh.... they still don't get it. It is not just about having perfect foresight. It is also about earnestly listening to the masses and not just dismissing everything they don't like to hear as noise.</p>
              <p>As Punggol East has shown, the MIW cannot just toss a few carrots our way every time an election comes round and expect to stay the course. They also cannot just say '<em>ok, ok, we did wrong, we're sorry</em>' every time they get a poor election result. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">For the sake of this nation, I seriously hope they learn to step down from their high pedestals and be more willing to lower themselves down to the level of the masses. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">While Punggol East was just one seat in Parliament, it says a lot that a medical specialist representing the dominant party could lose to an ah lian sales trainer in a four-corner fight by an 11% margin. </span>LTK was wrong to say that Punggol East would be a slap in the face for the MIW..... it was more like a knee to the groin. </p>
              <p>Unless the MIW does a complete overhaul and be genuinely repentant (and make amends) for past mistakes, they had better be prepared for a chokeslam, a clothesline, and an over-the-top-rope in GE 2016.</p>

              <p>They wont be willing to lower themselves. They ownself think they needed some form of dignity or watever bull crap. Just look at the pay issue, lower abit and one of them said need to very seriously consider becoz will affect standard of living, while telling us that we all can live with a much much lower wage but themselves cannot. Another said high pay is required so got dignity when compared to other country ppl, high pay = no corruption etc etc reason more than the water in the ocean...</p>
