            <div class='col-md body'>My dad told me this when I asked him about fate, and I think it makes a lot of sense and has a lot of meaning for me.<br><br>Basically he says when everyone is born, we are like a type of 'seed' - our fate is what type of tree we would grow into - rambutan tree, papaya tree, raintree.<br><br>However, nurture ensures that whatever tree we grow to, we can grow the best we can, to be strong and healthy, to bear fruit and lead a 'meaningful' existence regardless of whether we are common papaya trees or some fancy bonsai.<br><br>It's the same with relationships I guess. When we start one, we are never sure what sort of 'tree' it would turn out. Don't lose hope and keep trying. Unfortunately, different plants need different types of care. We might kill quite a few before we understand enough to keep one happy and flourishing.<br><br>Err most importantly, got to understand yourself too. If you are the type we really can't be bothered to read up, fertilise and water and sun ... something's gotta give if you choose to keep some exotic orchid that flowers once in 2 years or something.</div>
