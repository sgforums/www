            <div class='col-md body'>or keeping now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Just curious. I have no pets now except for my brother's ugly Luo Han which I'm pet-sitting for him while he is studying in Australia. I had some nice tropical fishes  but my dad decided that the Luo Han is lonely and dumped him into my much bigger tank. Needless to say, my pet fishes become pet food, and my brother's Luo Han is now the only occupant of my tank  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Anyway, I have kept the following pets before when I was younger:<br><br>2 Rabbits<br>4 Hamsters<br>2 3" tank full of fishes (1 filled with exotic fresh water fishes, 1 filled with goldfish)<br>2 firebelly salamaders<br>2 terrapins and 2 soft shell turtles<br>4 dogs<br>1 canary birdie<br>2 tree frogs<br>2 puddle frogs<br>2 chickens</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its gonna be a long list &gt;_&lt;'<br><br>1. Rabbits. Keep quite a few. Didn't really like them cos they smell, not very good to cuddle and prone to fright.<br><br>2. Hamsters. I used to have more than 40 at a time in my house when I was breeding them to be sold. That wasn't my original purpose cos I had only 4 at first but my male hamster was super busy at night.  &gt;_&lt;'<br><br>3. Fish. Only a few so far. Once I used to have these beautiful red fishes my Dad gave me when I was younger. One day when I came home, I discovered they were missing and cried terribly. I cried even worse when I noticed them on the dining table. Nope. You cant keep pets that looked like food.<br><br>4. Parakeets. Used to have this idea I could teach them to talk as I mistook them for mini parrots. Got even angrier when I realised they could but refused to learn. Basket cases.<br><br>5. Terrapins. Never like them much. Thought it's something my mum would approve. Which she did. And she took them from me.<br><br>6. One amazing chicken which really crossed the road to come into my house. The answer to that famous question ? It wants to be my pet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>7. Coloured chicks. I didn't know then it was cruel to inject them with coloured substances for them to be pink, blue or green. Damn those people.<br><br>8. Spiders. For fighting contests in primary school.<br><br>9. Lizards(geckos and chamelons). Cos I thought they were funky.<br><br>10. A bat I found in orchard road.<br><br>11. Dogs. Strays dogs which my mum gave me to keep me company when I was younger. She threw them out after they chewed not only the sofa, but shoes, beds, clothes, pillows, people...<br><br>12. Cats. I love cats. Wrote this as the last because I have kept hundreds. My house was a kind of cat shelter then. My mum thought I was simply impossible. But heck. I find cats company infinitely better than humans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And mom only allowed 'clean' pets that you can keep confined in a small space.  So, we had :<br><br>- A tank of goldfishes that gradually died and it became a tank of assorted fresh water fishes.  Dad took care of the aquarium until I took over in Secondary School.<br><br>- Four terrapins that dad and mom one day decided to release into the canal for 'religious reasons'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  My brother and I came home one day to find the terrapins missing and we cried for days afterwards.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I used to dump shredded cabbage / lettuce in a huge heap on top of them, then giggle as we heard the 'crunch! crunch!' sounds then gradually, was able to see them as they ate through their mountain of veges!  hahaha!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>- When I moved out to live on my own, I suddenly had space!  And, I could finally keep CATS!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I adopted two kittens from the SPCA - Suzie and Pearl.  They were so playful and agile, they both escaped through the slate windows one day when I was at work.  Came home to find only Suzie sitting between the gates and the door, looking forlorn.  That night was the first time since I brought them home that Suzie decided to snuggle and sleep with me because her sister was missing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  The next day, Suzie escaped again, but this time, she brought home another kitten, Kitty.  hehehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Cute, isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>A neighbour had a few kittens that they didn't seem to know what to do with.  One day, on my way to work, I saw that they had dumped one of their kittens by the staircase and it was mewing pitifully!  I told myself that if the li'l one was still around when I came  home from work, I'll take it in.  Whaddaya know, it was STILL around the staircase when I got back so it became Cat #4 in my life - Meiji.  (Because it was Mei Ji, in Mandarin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>Then in 1998, a gentleman snuck into my life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   This time, I heard mysterious whisperings outside my flat, then footsteps as the people ran off, then I heard, 'Meow!

It begged me to let it in, went straight to the food bowls of my other cats and ate like it hadn't eaten for days!  It looked poorly-kept and unkempt with matted fur, ear mites, fleas, diarrhoea... its previous owners obviously didn't know how to take care of it and they probably knew I took care of my cats well so they abandoned Marcus at my door!<br><br>After Marcus ate, I suddenly got spooked that his owners might come looking for him again or he might spread all those mites and fleas and what-not diseases he might have to my other healthy cats so out he went.  He was struggling as I was trying to push him out my door.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The whole night, I opened the door or windows to sneak peeks at him.  Oddly enough, he didn't wander off, like most cats would.  Instead, the entire night, no matter what time I checked, there he was, sitting there, looking at me, meowing or he'd be curled up, fast asleep.  I couldn't sleep well the entire night because I was debating if I should keep this cat.  Finally, at about 5am, I told myself, I shall open the bedroom slate windows a tad and if he tries to get in, he's mine!<br><br>He rushed over and meowed frantically when I opened the windows... and then the poor darling tried to jump through the windows but he was still a kitten so he couldn't quite reach the windows!  Pooooooor thing!!  I rushed to open the door and Marcus officially became the Prince in my life!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Here's Marcus, looking regal with his favourite mouse toy!<br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Marcuswtrophy.jpg"><br><br>Here's Marcus at play, with First Cat, Suzie, looking on...<br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Mousegame2.jpg"><br><br>Then, an extremely heartbreaking part of my life came ... and went... and with a new stage in my life came ... Cody!<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Look_Who_s_Typing.jpg"><br><br>He was too smart for his own good.  He learnt how to open the slate windows!  I ended up taping the handles but he'd somehow manage to open the windows anyways!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  One day, I came home after night duty to find the upper slate windows wide open, and Cody missing!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I scouted round the entire neighbourhood and went up and down all the floors and corridors in my block, shouting out his name, but no Cody.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And here I am, no cats, no pets.  I'm 'in transit' now so I probably would have to wait till I'm settled down again to keep cats.  I can't wait!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
