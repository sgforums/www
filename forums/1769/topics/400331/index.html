              <p>I borrow the tittle from the sitcom......and i decided to post this topics here to share ....feel free to share yours as there will be NO JUDGING....or silly remarks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After driving for X days, I finally arrived at the "white house" park my little nissan at the residents hall and get myself check in.  Got a few stares I supposed i was early. leaf had already turned yellow as the first sign of Fall......</p>
              <p>I met the Irish nun, she has this strange remarks "Grand" and her grin captivate my attention on her gold capped canine. The nun "insisted" that i meet up with another fellow from Singapore. I wasn't too sure why? cause i didn't come this far to meet up another singaporean..... </p>
              <p>Couple fo days later during orientation, we get to introduce ourselves and the last person had mimic word for word of what i said....I told myself now "isn't that annoying" after the orientation i stood up and tried to look for the annoyance as my eyes set on her.....she took this slow step down the lecture hall like a princess. Cupid strike.....i was mesmerize by the moment........and of course she is beautiful beyond words.</p>
              <p>Apparently when she arrived she too was insisted by the Nun to meet up with me.....not sure why.</p>
              <p>The irish nun introduced us and that was how i met my other half.  Match make by a Nun.</p>
              <p>Part II  -- .......................</p>
              <p>Many years into the relationship i had suddenly recalled an old dream of mine that i dreamed that i was living with a stranger .........At the time of my "dreamed" i was wondering why would l be living with a complete Stranger little did i know.......that  was my wife and I met her before I meet her years later......</p>
              <p>Guess this is what they said I dream of a Dreamed.</p>

              <p>It could be a possibility....that</p>
              <p>Skin under eyes have only 2 layers thin....Dark eye circles could means that your wife may have has more blood vessel under her eyes than others.</p>
              <p>The reason why the darkness seemed to manify when she is tired because the blood vessel constrict causing the blood vessel to show thru even more.</p>
