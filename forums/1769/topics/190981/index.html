            <div class='col-md body'>Going on a diet is bad for your foetus<br>By Tan Hui Leng, TODAY<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phphEiRzK.jpg"><br><br>SINGAPORE: Women who diet are doing a disservice to their foetuses when they get pregnant.<br><br>According to foetal development guru Professor Peter Gluckman, it's too late to stop dieting by the time you realise that you're pregnant because foetal development starts from Day 1.<br><br>"How the baby is looked after from the moment of conception, when it's just one egg, to birth in the neo-natal period can affect its destiny for the rest of its life," said the director of Liggins Institute at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.<br><br>The problem of dieting mums-to-be is especially worrying in Asia, said Prof Gluckman, who is in town to give a talk. A Japanese study has shown that newborn babies are now 150g to 200g lighter than those born 10 years ago, because their mothers are dieting.<br><br>During each pregnancy, expectant mothers should ideally gain about 10kg. "The foetus is preparing for its life after birth so everything that the mother does sends signals to the foetus, which tell the foetus about the world out there," said Prof Gluckman.<br><br>And women who are undernourished would have smaller babies who may suffer from health problems later on in life.<br><br>"Small babies are more likely to get obese because what they did is to prepare themselves inside the womb for a world without much food," he said.<br><br>Such nutritional signals, especially in early pregnancy, would turn some genetic switches on or off for the rest of the child's life. These would make the child more prone to storing fat so as to prepare himself for the "threatened" world out there, he added.<br><br>Those who only start taking care of their nutrition when they are pregnant may be too late in reversing the course of action, studies have found.<br><br>Compounded with a high-fat diet and sedentary lifestyle, these children are even more likely to get obese - a cause of diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life.<br><br>Smaller babies also have less brain cells, particularly those needed for memory and learning.<br><br>Similarly, women should not smoke during their pregnancy as this would alter the child's lung development among other things, which will change physically to adapt to a perceived world filled with carbon monoxide.<br><br>Prof Gluckman, who chairs the World Health Organization technical committee on optimising the outcomes of pregnancy, advises women to have a balanced diet and maintain a reasonable Body Mass Index.<br><br>Women also should not get pregnant four to five years after their first period as they still need nutrients for growing. Breastfeeding is recommended until the baby is six months old, he said.<br><br>Parental involvement and stimulation in the first year of the child is important, as is the intake of vitamin B12 and folate.<br><br>Stress would not affect the foetus, unless it is severe, such as those triggered during a natural catastrophe, he added.<br><br>While small babies that are born as a result of undernourished mothers may be at risk of obesity, it is also important not to overfeed infants, he cautioned.<br><br>Prof Gluckman will be giving a talk about improving birth outcomes and lifelong health this evening at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

            <div class='col-md body'>I've shared this before, but anyways...<br><br>Years ago, one of my lecturers in night school revealed to us that his brothers were gynaecologists and one day, they gathered together with their fellow gynaecologist friends to discuss the incidence of high miscarriages amongst the women here.<br><br>Apparently, most of the ladies who miscarried were on diets or were very skinny.  His brothers then informed him that they felt that if you don't even eat enough nutritious food to be at an optimum level of health, your body won't be able to support foetal growth well.<br><br>The minute you realise you want to try to conceive, you should eat well and stop smoking and drinking.  The article is right - by the time you realise you're pregnant, it would be at least four weeks from the time a missed period had been detected.  The first few weeks are crucial in the formation of the foetus and needless to say, it's not good for the foetus if mom had been drinking and smoking and dieting then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I think if a lady cannot feel responsible enough for the baby to start taking good care of herself and the baby when it's growing inside her womb, then maybe she ought to rethink if she's ready to embark on parenthood in the first place.<br><br>One celebrity who was in the news recently for being on silly extreme diets and doing other silly stuff like flying her plane when she was heavily pregnant in her last trimester is Angelina Jolie.  Her doctors have been encouraging her to put on weight because out of a fear of putting on post-baby fat, she went on some diet that continued to keep her thin.  She also refused to give up flying, which can be dangerous because the air pressure changes whilst on board can cause her to faint.  Because of her bad nutrition, she fainted on a few occasions whilst she was pregnant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
