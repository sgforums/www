              regularly play footy with mates? Get under the bonnet of your car?
              Own a shed?</strong></p>
              <p>If not, you could be one of the increasing number of Aussie men
              going soft.</p>
              <p>According to the results of a survey that polled 1000 Australian
              men on their blokeyness, "the nation's iconically hard Aussie
              blokes are a dying breed".</p>
              <p>Only 5 per cent of men regularly play football with their
              friends; almost 50 per cent admit it has been months since they
              tinkered with their car; and shed ownership has dropped 27 per cent
              over a generation.</p>
              <p>On the flipside, concern for skin care is growing and Australian
              men are not afraid to wear pink.</p>
              <p>More than three-quarters of men polled in the survey,
              commissioned by Kirks Brewed Ginger Beer, agreed that men were
              "softer" than the previous generation.</p>

              <p><br>never try how you learn? sure there might be cock ups, but in the end you'll learn how to do it. I also started out fixing my computer when I was in secondary. my first computer was a packaged one and everytime got problem the solution from the tech support would always be format everything. thus me losing all my data.</p>
              <p>since then, I have assembled my own pc.. I am my own tech support.</p>

              <p><br> never try how you learn? sure there might be cock ups, but in the

              computer when I was in secondary. my first computer was a packaged
              one and everytime got problem the solution from the tech support
              would always be format everything. thus me losing all my data.</p>

              <p>Well , depends on urgency then. Because u must have the time to trial and error. So sometimes its just now worth wasting the time. We try to gain as much knowledge as we can , but we only have so much time to learn so many stuffs. Must prioritise what u learn and what u can have others do for u.</p>

              <p>Of course. But depends what is essential or not. Too many factors involve in whether or not its needed or do u have the mental capacity to understand how one works. The lady's husband may not even know how to operate the computer or what a BIOS or CPU is. lol! Everyone anyone eventually through education will understand the mechanics or how something works.Unless u wanna classify the things whether its considered as trivial easy to fix stuffs or not lo.</p>
              <p>There will be those that dunno how. Thats why there will always be the need of customer/technical support. Cause there will never be a scarcity in stupid people and those that just.. dont know how. hahaha</p>
