              <p>I agree with you about the immigrants bit .... canada's letting in all and sundry nowadays .... but then that's a mistake Singapore's making on an even bigger scale ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>and I tell you why canadians are not entreprenuerial enough .... life is too good .... no one in school talked about striking out on your own ... why would you want to slog, when you can graduate and make 3-4k a month starting, pat your backside and leave by 6 every day and go off to the cottage by the lakes in the summer, and go down to mexico in the winter ? ... </p>
              <p>I don't think the asian immigrants are any more entreprenuerial than the native born ... just that previous deprivations force them to slog harder than others .... plenty of second and third generation migrant offsprings I see exhibit the same traits as the native born too ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>with regards to putting things in ways more 'simple' that it 'should' be, that's how most things are. which i feel is dangerous. to simplify anything, it would mean you have to take things out. and often-times, you take out things that might be contraversial, more difficult for certain groups of people to understand, blahblahblah. you don't get the whole picture. you see only one side. etcetc...i'd rather a person not understand than to think he/she/it understands when really, he/she/it doesn't really.</p>
              <p>as for the other one.......'everything is a social contruct'. that's the only 'stand' i can make. and even then........heh. but, this is just me.</p>

              <p>with regards to putting things in ways more 'simple' that it
              'should' be, that's how most things are. which i feel is dangerous.
              to simplify anything, it would mean you have to take things out.
              and often-times, you take out things that might be contraversial,
              more difficult for certain groups of people to understand,
              blahblahblah. you don't get the whole picture. you see only one
              side. etcetc...i'd rather a person not understand than to think
              he/she/it understands when really, he/she/it doesn't really.</p>
              <p>as for the other one.......'everything is a social contruct'.
              that's the only 'stand' i can make. and even then........heh. but,
              this is just me.</p>

              <p>distiling the world into a simpler picture doesn't mean taking things out, but it gives you a framework to to put things into clearer perspective for you ...</p>
              <p>people do it all the time in academia as well ....that's what academia is about, explaining the artificial and natural phenomenas of the world in only so many words, to simplify things, to wrap it around into a theory ....including your current major, no ? .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>of course there is a bias .... even in the natural sciences .... it all depends on whether you can give a convincing enough bullshit or not .... good bullshit becomes accepted theory, till it gets supplanted by even better bullshit, or at least, bullshit which disproves the older, accepted bullshit ... and the new bullshit becomes the accepted bullshit, also known as theory .... and so it goes on, but we've digressed far from the entreprenuership of canucks .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
