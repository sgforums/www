              <p>I think I can thank heavens that I dont watch tv because I got no tv.</p>
              <p>But recently watching those series on laptop is kinda scary.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it.....I've not switched on the tv in my room for a long time since I am here sponging off my sister.</p>
              <p>Back to watching star trek....william shatner is soooo totally different then and now.  His acting in was in Boston Legal was scary!</p>

              <p>we asked some people to write something about a course they went
              through.. the bloody department footed the bill to send a bunch of
              them to South Africa for some course...</p>
              <p>3 weeks ago, we asked them to write a short note about their
              experiences there to feature in the publication..</p>
              <p>is it that hard??</p>
              <p>these are fricken uni grads!!</p>
              <p>200 words.. 3 to 4 paragraphs...</p>
              <p>i called them for it and they said that someone told them i was
              writing it for them!!! as if i know what happened there?? WTF??</p>
              <p>i almost blew my top at them!!</p>
              <p>then the piece of crap can tell me that this is very "ad hoc"
              and we should have told them earlier...</p>
              <p>what?? they came back from South Africa and within 2 days, we
              requested that short write-up from them already!!</p>
              <p>earlier? how early? it's a 20-minute job!! sit and write.. i'll
              do the copywriting for them!!</p>
              <p>worse was before they went, they asked my section for support to
              find stuff for them which we went out of our way to get for them...
              now, this!!</p>
              <p>breathe breathe breathe breathe breathe breathe...</p>
              <p>hell! 2 weeks ago i even told them if they are too busy to just
              drop me points.. just POINTS!! and i'll flesh it out for them!!</p>
              <p>they could not even be bothered to do that!!</p>
              <p>breathe breathe breathe breathe breathe...</p>

              <p>they meant to tell them b4 they went for the course. cos they spent all the time there playing with wild life and slacking around.</p>
              <p>anyway don't those idiots have the sense toknow that they will have to do some sort of report??? and they expected you to write it for them. like you were there..............</p>
