              <p>Jan 14, 2009<br><br>M'sian to be caned for drinking<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - A RELIGIOUS court has sentenced a Muslim woman to six strokes of the cane for drinking alcohol, possibly for the first time in Malaysia. <br><br>The Syariah High Court in Pahang also handed the same sentence to a man on Monday, and is due to make a decision on another woman in May. <br><br>Mohamad Nasir Mohamad, 38, a father of four, and waitress Noorazah Baharuddin, 22, were found drinking beer separately in pubs in July last year in central Pahang state, said reports released yesterday. <br><br>Nasir admitted that he had drunk beer at a pub in Cherating on July 11, while Noorazah was caught drinking at the pub where she worked, in Jalan Gambut. <br><br>Both were also fined RM5,000 (S$2,100) each by the Pahang court on Monday. <br><br>The third accused was part-time model Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32. According to the New Straits Times, Kartika, a Singapore permanent resident, could not attend court as she is studying in Singapore. <br><br>Judge Abdul Rahman Yunus said that he had given the maximum fine and caning as a deterrent to other Muslims, but had spared them a jail sentence. <br><br>'The caning is to shame them and should be done at any of the prisons in the country,' he was quoted as saying by NST. <br><br>The case comes after two controversial fatwas, or edicts - one over tomboyish behaviour by women and the other concerning the practice of yoga - sparked intense public debate over decisions made by the country's top religious body. <br><br>Malaysia has a two-track legal system, with the civil courts operating alongside state-based syariah courts. Muslims are governed by syariah laws in family and personal matters, while ethnic Chinese, Indians and other races come under civil courts. <br><br>According to NST, this is the second time such a sentence has been handed down. In 2005, the same judge sentenced two Muslim brothers to six strokes of the cane after they were caught drinking. <br><br>However, the caning has yet to be carried out as the men are appealing against the decision. <br><br>Alcohol is widely available in Malaysia, and Muslims are rarely punished for consuming it. <br><br>'It's rare but it's within the law and Muslims are subject to such law in this country,' said lawyer Pawancheek Merican, a syariah law committee member of the Malaysian Bar Council. <br><br>MP Salahuddin Ayub, the youth chief of the opposition Islamic party PAS, said he 'agreed' with the court ruling. 'The ruling only concerns Muslims and it does not affect the non-Muslims. It is to remind the Muslims not to drink,' he said. <br>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</p>
