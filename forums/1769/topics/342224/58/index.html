              <p>Hey missy, you still haven't confirmed on FB if you are coming
              on 17/1.  I am going to make creme brulee for dessert for you
              guys that night so you'll get to try it!</p>
              <p>Missy, you can freeze some of the minced meat you know.  I
              do that all the time.  As long as you can keep it in airtight
              container or get the air off the bag before freezing it, it should
              last for months.  That way you don't have to eat the same
              thing every day.</p>
              <p>I do agree with you though it's not easy to cook for only
              one.  Even 2 is hard as we ended up having too much food.</p>
              <p>How about try making simple meal like boil, steam or grill
              chicken wings/maryland/drumsticks just enough for yourself? 
              Cook some vegies and go with some rice?  That way, there's no
              leftover and you get to enjoy fresh food every day. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I hate to freeze fresh stuff.  It's almost a sin to freeze fresh seafood and meat.  And it's definitely a no-no for me to freeze rice or to refrigerate it for more than a day.  I will eat the stuff, but I just feel sinful to waste fresh things and kill their flavour by freezing it. </p>
              <p>You forget I can cook.  I'm an aspiring cookbook writer, remember?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  My problem is not recipes and ideas on what to cook.  My problem is my appetite has shrunk and it's sometimes more expensive to cook small portions than large ones.  For instance, I want, but can't buy, just half a zucchini, two stems of celery, and one bok choy although that's what I will consume say, over two days.</p>

              <p>I'm actually thinking of starting some kinda food exchange with my other single neighbours.  There are five single ladies and one single guy in my block.  I know two or three of the ladies might warm up to the idea. </p>
              <p>For instance, I bloat terribly when I eat bread, but sometimes, you can't avoid eating bread as a cheap breakfast option.  However, I've often thrown out 1/2 to 3/4 loaves because I can't eat that much bread all by myself before they become stale!  And forget about freezing bread... I don't have that much space in my tiny fridge (plus I hate freezing bread!).  So maybe, I can share a loaf with someone and the next time they purchase bread, they can share their loaf with me.  Only thing is, I can't take Wholewheat because if I get bloated on bread, I get TERRIBLY bloated on wholemeal bread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I bought a bag of carrots from the Richmond Market recently and gave my neighbour half (seven), which isn't a shabby number.  And I got to eat fresh and not have to discard any stale leftover carrots, so I was really happy. </p>
              <p>Food for thought!</p>

              <p>Hubby and I have no problem eating leftovers so it's easier for
              us.  Think you just have to make your life easier by getting
              used to freezing or refridgerating your leftover or fresh
              food..... </p>

              <p>I used to freeze my food so I could cook just two or three days a week and have enough to bring to work for the whole week.  I didn't like that idea though and I don't think eating frozen foods and leftovers is very healthy. </p>
              <p>Think maybe I'm getting on in years... I bloat terribly when I eat the wrong foods.  I know I'm dairy and wheat intolerant but there could be other stuff I'm sensitive to.  Besides, mom and my aunts made me promise before I left SG that I wouldn't rely too much on frozen food because according to Chinese docs, there's too much 'wind' in frozen food.  Now, whilst there's no way I can prove that and I know that decades of people have lived on frozen food, I know I feel the effects when I actually succumb to that.  Refrigeration I agree with.  Freezing cooked food, I try not to although sometimes, you have no choice.</p>

              <p>You know what really works for me and makes me feel energetic and healthy?  250 - 300 mls serving sizes.  That's what I used to have when I first came here and cooked my meals.  I'd have no more than a 250 mls container of rice with a serving or two of dishes.  In the beginning, I didn't feel full but I wasn't hungry either.  I was just really happy to eat stuff that I love and I cook them exactly how I love it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>As I slowly ate more and worse, stopped cooking and ate out, I felt more and more unhealthy.  Now, I've limited myself to just one to two main meals a day and at least one serving of fruit daily, and I feel good again.  I think a lot of times, we overeat, especially in Singapore, where good food is abundant and easily-accessible and cheap.</p>

              <p>I did that too.  We got home late on Monday cos we went food shopping (cos only just got back from holiday the night before) so we ended up having takeaway BBQ chicken.  I used the leftover chicken to make sandwich for hubby, spread with avocado yesterday and today.  I had the remaining for lunch today.  still taste quite good.....</p>
