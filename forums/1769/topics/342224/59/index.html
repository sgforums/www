              <p>I think for New Year, I trooped down to Nando's and used a coupon to purchase one whole chicken with grilled corn and free large fries.</p>
              <p>For the next few meals, it was Nando's and more Nando's until I think I can't eat Nando's anymore until next Quarter!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  I ended up having Nando's neat, then Nando's as a salad tossed with a mixture of baby salad leaves, then Nando's with Pita bread, Nando's sandwich and the fries were eaten over three seatings.  Guys, if you ever have leftover fries, do not discard them!  Keep them refrigerated, then the next day, you can 'refresh' them by putting them under the grill or the overn for a short while so they no longer stay limp but become crisp again.  I use the grill / oven to make 'lao hong' lame crackers crispy and crunchy again.  Works everytime.  If you think about it, anything that has gone lame probably just needs the extra moisture dried up then they'll be crisp and almost like new again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>And anything you want to remain moist in the microwave oven, wet a kitchen paper towel or cotton muslin if you're quite the pro, wring it out semi-dry, lay it over the rice or dumpling or bak chang or bao and make sure you cover it entirely, then microwave as usual.  The water in the towel will become steam so you end up steaming your bao / rice and they bao will come out soft and nice without getting burnt-dry and your rice will remain fluffy and moist.  Sometimes, I sprinkle water all over the rice before microwaving them.  That works too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>I used to work, take the MRT home, and then on the day, drop by to pick up some fresh vegetables and fish or stuff at the wet market at Ghim Moh, then rush home to cook dinner and by 8pm latest, usually by 7:15pm, we'd both sit down and watch TV as we eat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  Five-day work week, not much OT and even if I had to go in on Saturdays to work, I pretty much liked my workplace then. </p>
