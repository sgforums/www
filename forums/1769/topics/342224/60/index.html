              <p>Seriously, I don't trust the people who handle the meat.  You don't know if they are clean.  I mean even in a developed country like the US, you get food violations resulting in severe food recalls and food poisoning.  And truthfully, a lot of these large organisations are pretty unethical.  It was featured in a Current Affairs program here that some supermarkets have been known to re-package their meat and pump in some kinda gas when vacuum-packing the meat to make them look fresh and stay saleable longer.  I've been alarmed at a Coles branch for their extremely poor and unsatisfactory chiller conditions.  I've boycotted Coles meat at Richmond Mall for a long long time and I can't bring myself to enter the poultry stall at Victoria St nearby because of the foul stench that assaults me as I enter.  I doubt the stuff is fresh.  I doubt their hygiene standards are up to par.  I doubt the chiller's cold enough sometimes. </p>

              <p><br>You wouldnt believe it. (Anyway, I did had a hard time trying to get those ultra big bottles of pamesan cheese thingy, those you see at pizza table for sprinkling onto the pizza, in Singapore)</p>
              <p>I ever wrapped some cheese minced meat into wontan skin and made wontans cooked in soup.</p>
              <p>1 time is stuffed the cheese meat onto a upturned shitake mushroom and steam it.</p>
              <p>1 time is make into balls and deep fried it.</p>
              <p>Finally, stuff into the tomato shells and steam it using the rice cooker with the steam layer attachments, along with rice.</p>

              <p>Actually, even when I worked a five-day week corporate job, because I didn't have so much OT then, most weeknights I'd cook. </p>
              <p>I'd just hop on the company bus after work to the NTUC at Boon Lay MRT Station (is it called Jurong Point or something?), then take the MRT back home to cook.  Or drop by at the Ghim Moh market at night where a few stalls are thankfully open, to get dinner ingredients. </p>
