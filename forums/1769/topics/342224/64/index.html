              <p>I use this something with Tea Tree Oil.  Think maybe my L'Occitane moisurizer is too rich for Summer.  I switch moisturizers almost ever other season so maybe it's time to put a hold on this one and use it in Winter instead. </p>

              <p>Think it's not the Singapore side but the Australian side.  Same thing the last time mom sent me something via EMS.  The Singapore side was super efficient but the Aussie side... sigh...  And you know what, the service staff here, they don't give a damn.  You can yell down the phone or talk sweetly or be firm and what not, they just do not give a damn.  They will just keep on repeating, "I'm sorry this is happening to you, ma'am, but I can't do anything about it." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  That's 'service' here for you.</p>

              <p>Wah, I'll be so happy, man!  Can cook something different everyday!!  I'd be so happy, man!  Last week, I was looking forward to cooking a different menu everyday, but ended up eating the same thing for almost an entire week!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>I want to cook Balti Curry Prawn and try out the Prima Laksa ... but these are put on hold cause I'm STILL consuming the minced pork.   Although it tastes a bit different everyday cause I jazz it up a little bit differently each time, I'm still really sick of it.  Yesterday, whilst eating it with egg noodles, I did think that no matter what, it's still tastier and healthier than the noodle shops here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  And I'm getting a huge dose of fresh vegetables each time too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Maybe someday, you'll be my neighbour.  Then I'll be happy cooking everyday, and you'll hopefully be happy eating it all up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  At least, you're not fussy.  I won't cook for Pinky or MPB because both will be fussy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  *scrambles out of the way!!</p>
