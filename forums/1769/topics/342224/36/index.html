              <p>I figured, what the hell... I lather on sunblock SPF30+ every
              morning religiously and I STILL get freckles so if I can't beat
              'em, I join 'em!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Plus, at my healthiest best in my teens, I was a tanned
              swimmer.  Time to stop hiding from the sun, perhaps?

              is at its strongest and continue to Slip, Slap, Slop according to
              the Aussie Cancer Council's recommendations, then I should be
              fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>That's good.  During my holiday in Philip Island, I tried to stay in the sun whenever I had the opportunity.  Of course it's not those sunbaking type... just sit there for a few minutes.  Didn't even bother to put on sunscreen when I go walking.  Think I have become very tanned after the break.</p>

              <p>Well, erm...crocs is now on sale at crocs online at USA now.</p>
              <p>Thats how I ended up with 7 pairs myself.  Decent enough
              for use in summer climate places.</p>

              <p>I don't really know what to think of Uggs... I know the gossip and fashion mags are huge on them ever since some supermodels and actresses were photographed wearing them, but I just don't know...</p>
              <p>Maybe, if I can get them on sale this year...</p>

              <p>He's like me... I get heat rash very easily.  But strangely, when I swam in the public pools back when I was a teen, I could swim up to five times a week and I had no problems with heat rash! </p>

              <p>Poor man... there was an article about that case in the latest issue of WHO magazine.  The man actually told his wife before that he loves the sea and respects that they are the ones invading the natural habitat of the sea creatures so if he were to ever die from a shark attack, at least he died doing what he loved best. </p>
