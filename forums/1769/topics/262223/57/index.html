In-out burgers dont have freezers at ther locations and they dont freeze their burger patties.<br><br>And if you take-aways those burgers, the sauces soaked into your buns liao, not as crispy when you eat them.<br><br>Best to always eat at their location, and choose a outlet not as crowded cos then they really take time and effort to grill your burgers nicely for you.<br><br>Carls Junior, Burger King and Macdonalds are no where near their standards siah.</div>
