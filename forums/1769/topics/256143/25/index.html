            <div class='col-md body'>i'll just say this about those who lament singapore being a rat race being full of rats...<br><br>there are so many lamenting... yet, they CHOOSE to be the very rats they say they hate...<br><br>so, what is so hard about not caring about the race anymore?  when is enough not enough anymore?<br><br>do you need that bigger car? do you need the bigger house? do you need that bigger... ?<br><br>all the time your soul and your humanity is getting smaller?<br><br>good trade off?<br><br>and by going to another country, will it become any different if you are so easily swayed by the rats in singapore?  what will you become there?  their version of the rat?<br><br>time to stop blaming society...<br><br>you want a change in the society, stand your ground and start the change from yourself, your family, your immediate sphere of influence.. you are not helping things by blaming society and the doing exactly what the rats are doing..<br><br>just like i was talking to someone recently.. he was lamenting that the school system is causing children to work like mad and not have a childhood.. when i asked him how his child is doing, he said that his child was stressed and working very late each day and all that.. his lower primary child!!<br><br>he didn't even have the guts to go tell the MOE and teachers to bugger off...<br><br>so.. what do you think?<br><br>inwardly, a lot of people would rather sacrifice their own children on the altar of the ratrace than to say something and stand up for their beliefs..<br><br>same thing.. a lot of people lament singapore being 'soulless' and all that... but they don't do a single thing to change it.. instead, becoming one of the hordes of 'souless people'<br><br>i'll make a stand even if it is insignificant..</div>
