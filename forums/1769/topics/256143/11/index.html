I never knew I'd live to say this but after living in Melbourne for a year, I must emphasise what I thought of before I left - that if I could somehow become much richer, life here can actually be good.<br><br>Oh well, you know that old saying, "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyways, this is a good place for families if you think about it in terms of public transport for the kiddos, safety, and a 'better' school environment.  I was totally stunned by the level of school bullying that goes on in AUstralia!!  It makes the bullying that goes on in the neighbourhood schools here lame in comparison.<br><br>I had a patient, a very dear and lovely Aussie lady, who was talking to me about her son.  I complimented him after he left because he was a very well-mannered and filial young adult.  Her eyes welled up with tears as she told me how she almost lost him because he tried to commit suicide by jumping off the school building because he had been cruelly bullied by his classmates for more than a year and he was at breaking point!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   THey taunted him endlessly, pushed and shoved him, made him do ridiculous things, and though he told his mom a few times that he was being bullied, he didn't really make a big deal out of it, so she thought that it'll just pass.  TO her horror, he quietly tried to end it all one day.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>He now lives with permanent injuries because of the nasty fractures to his legs and arm that he ended up with.  He's in Uni now, and nobody there knows his story so he's happily having a new lease on life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Wish they were my neighbours cause I feel so darn proud at how well he's turned out!  Bless their souls!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Bullying in schools is often reported in the Aussie newspapers and Current Affairs programs on TV and trust you me, it can be downright shocking!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
