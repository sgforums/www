            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..something to add on...maybe you can try not to have so many different types of files. have one type of filing system &amp; stick to it, eg. use only 2 ring files with file separators(those with tabs sticking out). u can use different colour files to differentiate between different types of files(but not too many colors). usually those 2-ring files have a plastic slot with a custom label at the side of the file which is very good for labelling purposes, unlike ring binders or pocket files. simplicity is best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>after all the filing &amp; labelling, group the files accordingly on your shelf or cupboard. label the shelves if necessary.<br><br>as for your stationery, designate a keeping place for them &amp; always keep back after use. tats how we can always find things we want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ShrodingersCat, your post was so funny!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Let's see... how to tame the paper jungle monster...<br><br>It used to be part of my job to set up filing systems or reorganise a current system to make it more user-friendly.  I kinda enjoyed making order where there was none.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I had a really handy hardcover A4 file with 30+ 'pages' you could flip like a book and each 'page' was indexed with a no. to represent dates of the month.  Documents that needed tending to on particular dates were placed in the relevant slots so every morning, all I had to do was flip my master diary and flip that file-book and I can get started liao.<br><br>I also had a lot of colour coded L-plastic folders.  Red is for 'Urgent' or 'Priority', Yellow for 'Pending' etc.  I'll scribble on post-it's and stick them onto the folders too so I'd know at a glance that the folder is for "Upcoming Directorial Conference" or "AD&amp;D", etc.<br><br>I also had a three-tier tray for "In", "Out" and "Pending" for my boss or colleagues and the mail distribution chap to use.<br><br>If I can't do the filing soon enough, I'd band them up together and slap a post-it on the stack so when it's time to do the filing, I'd roughly know where they're supposed to go into.<br><br>At the end of everyday, before I left the office, VERY IMPORTANT - clear your desk of clutter!  If you can't, at least make sure you have organised stacks so you'd know where to continue the next morning.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Another tip, make sure another colleague or two knows your filing system so that if you're on leave, they don't have to keep calling you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Or even if they had to call you, you're organised enough that you can give clear instructions over the phone - "It's in the Red Plastic folder on my top drawer on the right cabinet, keys are with da boss."<br><br>Even if your workstation is messy, let it be an 'organised mess'!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Appear in control of the situation, even if you are drowning in the sea of paperwork!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Your bosses won't nag at you so much if they think that you are on top of it all!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Erm... not quite sure if I've answered your questions cause sometimes, I tend to go off at a tangent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Well, hope the tips help!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How can we all have the same set of skills &amp; characteristics when we are born different...hehehh<br><br>I think the problem is not that you're disorganised  because you use lists &amp; you plan .  The problem may be that you keep losing things <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  Root cause could be that -- 1.  you have too many items (notebooks, lists) to keep track of   2.  Uhh you're careless :p<br><br>So maybe you should consolidate everything into one big mammoth notebook/organiser on which your life depends on... ( maybe one for personal, one for work)... and be careful about where you leave it.  Carry it everywhere, make it an essential daily item like your wallet or handphone.  Once it is something that you'd be totally lost without, you will automatically take  more care with it..<br><br>If you're a compulsive stationery shopper - "eee notebook so cute, can buy la may come in handy will need to use it sometime in future right" - STOP <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Diary shopping is done at year end for the perfect piece and that's it!<br><br>As for keeping track of dates... maybe getting a diary that's monthly calendar style , instead of daily/ weekly, would be more suitable... then just block out dates on the calendar... one glance tells everything.  It's more compact too, which should fit into above-mentioned mammoth organiser heheh<br><br>I believe filing and being organised are different things altogether.  Bah I hate filing.  I'm ok at it but I hate the activity, will gladly pass it over if possible.  It's a futile activity like housework -- clear today, paper piles up again tomorrow.. clear, paper piles up again , repeat cycle to infinity. My gawd there is no end in sight.<br><br>Lastly if paperwork is not your thang, delegate.  Let the SO do it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  You can be in charge of creating pretty file labels  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
