              <p>And there's no fun when you become breathless after 2 minutes of running around. So what do you do? Instead of playing tag or football outside with your kids, you confine them and make them play video games and watch TV - which perpetuates the cycle.</p>
              <p>Also, if there were fewer overweight people, we'd use less fuel transporting, cooling and feeding ourselves, and have fewer burdens on our healthcare systems.</p>
