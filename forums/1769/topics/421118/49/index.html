              <p>We quickly figured that the further away you were from the main roads and tourist areas, the cheaper and more authentic the food would be.</p>

              <p><br>i think he's being realistic about it. When they do really have kids, they will really find comfort and peace in mind that their kids are in really good hands, not some maids or baby sitter. However, their parents must be a willing party rather then being shoved into their hands.</p>

              <p>As Fatum has said, in an ideal world, the mom stays at home, while pop goes out to bring home the bacon.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the age of 'the woman's place is in the kitchen' is truly over, and now women go out to join the workforce and to bring home their own share of the family bacon.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, asking a relative whom you know and trust to help watch the kids is a far lesser evil than, say, leaving your kids to a daycare center. Of course the key point here is that the said relative must be willing and able to do so, and to never fully abdicate your own responsibilities as a parent.</p>
              <p>My uncle left my little cousin at my house for my mom to watch over from when she was six months old all the way till she was six years old. My mom was willing and able, and my uncle paid her for that. She grew up well and is becoming a fine young woman (18 this year) from what I can tell.</p>
              <p>Heck, I myself was left in the care of an aunt back when both my parents were still working.</p>
              <p>I believe I turned out just fine too, yeah?</p>

              <p>Hahahha that's what I tell my friends (and remind myself!) not to get too stressed up over the whole parenthood deal. Afterall despite whatever mistakes our parents made, most of us turned out reasonably NORMAL and FINE! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thing is... look at those kids who grew up in Kampongs, who had lots of friends, not much adult supervision, a lot of freedom (in a reasonably secure environment) - I think in their own ways they learn to grow up to be a lot more resilient and independent. Sometimes too much attention also not good la!</p>
