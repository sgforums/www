              <p>I think there are infant care that is not that expensive and often you can enquire for subsidised rates.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, many of my friends also use recommended nannies who live close by to provide support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thankfully my parents are happy to help look after Shrokitten when he/she comes! Though I have been considering the possibility of working part time in order to spend more time with the child during early childhood years :)</p>

              <p>I think you qualify for subsidised rates if your combined income is not over a certain level.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I don't think MPB and I qualify for any form of subsidy -_-" which is something I have not gone to check out.</p>
              <p>I do not have problems if I'm sure that my parents will not spoil the kid, but between having my kid pampered, coddled and spoilt by my parents, I rather leave him/her in the care of strangers.</p>

              <p>i agree that if you dont hv much you wont miss it! i guess tts why in terms of expenses generally we r very careful cos both of us enjoy the mobility of not getting bogged down by debts or lifestyle demands too much with or withou a cub... so i guess quality of life is quite subjective and can change too. having a cub may deprive you of certain things which u feel contributes to your quality of life you hv right now but it can also give you new set of criteria in which to measure what quality of life can mean to you. :)</p>
              <p>just like spending money to buy something u love and gives you pleasure in ownership, the loss of existing factors is an investment in something else you believe will bring you greater pleasure or joy later.</p>

              <p>many of them apply for various financial assistance schemes yearly and complain to their MPs and the customer service centres of various ministries on a regular basis. some also lose custody of their kids because they are fucked up and NCSS and MCYS have to step in.
