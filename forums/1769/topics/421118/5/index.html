              <p>Surprise... I can't get hold of the MSI model I want here.  Unlike in Singapore, we aren't spoilt for choice here.  I actually thought of making a quick short trip back home so I can purchase a decent netbook / lappie before my course commences but the SQ flights back to SG are all fully booked.  Haiz...</p>
