              <p>You should have thrown her out, because she could've been taking the exam for her friend. She should've run off to get her ID when you were reading out the instructions. Once the paper's turned over it's too late.</p>

              <p>My co-invigilator (who was in overall command) decided against it, since we had class lists with their faces by the side of each name. The girl looked very much like the face that was in the class lists. Her name and matric number tallied as well.</p>
              <p>That said, we threatened to eject <strong>anyone </strong>who didn't have any official ID the next time.</p>
