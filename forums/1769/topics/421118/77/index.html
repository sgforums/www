              <p>that's why I say, there's the third way out. </p>
              <p>if it's a hard choice between lunacy and sodomy, then don't make the choice. The law says you have to vote regardless, but the law can't make you vote for either side.</p>
              <p>does it always have to be a rock and a hard place ? .... if you think the MIW's been inept in handling housing prices and foreign talents then don't vote for them, if you think the opposition are lunatics to want to scrap NS and what not you don't have to vote for them either.</p>
              <p>cos like I said, a vote for the either side is really the equivalent of an affirmation for their ideas and policies. Would you exchange a sodomy by the MIW to the sodomy by the opposition ? It doesn't have to be either.</p>

              <p>I wear jeans until they show signs of considerable wear. Usually the ankle seams are the first parts to wear out. If a hole appears anywhere, it means that it's time to get a new pair soon. One good pair can last me up to two years.</p>
