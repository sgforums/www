              <p>TBC sunwell was tough, the fights really challenging, but TBC rotations all quite simple leh. But stuff like Mt Hyjal, Black temple quite simple what. Black temple only a few fights is tough.</p>
              <p>Wotlk, only ulduar and icecrown citadel can be considered difficult. the lich king fight was quite memorable. One thing about Wotlk is that healers all quite op towards the end, so its not so punishing.</p>

              <p>I remember in uni time, I was playing squash with a friend when this old lady (past 60s) came in totally trim and fit and shared with us how she had a stroke a few years ago.. and now she is thrashing her husband in squash!</p>

              <p><br>not exactly. there's a ton of data that shows skinny sedentary people always die faster than active people with decent eating habits who are slightly overweight.</p>

              <p>thing is, many people who are fat got that way via bad eating habits and lack of activity. I was active but found out the hard way that you can't out-exercise a shitty diet :P</p>

              <p>A friend of mine did Indochina on shoestring budget..... I met up with him during the bangkok part of his trip and visited his $4/night room :D</p>
              <p>(it was a luxury, for some privacy he decided to pay $4 for the whole room instead of $2 a bed) I think he did the whole Indochina.. slowly over 3 months.. spending total of less than S$2K. Which I thought was pretty good! :D</p>
