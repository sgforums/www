              <p>perhaps i'm the wrong person to preach about having kids, since I'm a terminal romantic and a chap who goes on my knees every night and pray that our coming marriage would be fruitful and that I'll be a good father .....</p>
              <p>and parenthood is a very esoteric quality, perhaps the best person to ask about this would be your parents ... ask them if they've ever measured the cost of having kids in economic terms, and whether you, as a whole, were worth the trade off for them, dispassionately. i think parenthood is best explained by someone who's actually a parent, no ? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/satisfied.png" alt="satisfied.png"></p>
              <p>And ask them too, if they'd do it, all over again .... ^^</p>

              <p>when my parents got married, south vietnam just fell, and people were waiting for the domino theory to happen, the spectre of a nuclear holocaust was hanging over everyone, red china was still in the throes of the cultural revolution, and everywhere was an economic basket case .......</p>
              <p>each generation has it's own problems ..... but hope comes with love. If a couple in love with each other can have the hopes of a good future together, why can't this couple harbour the same hopes of a good future for any offsprings they might have ?</p>
              <p>in my parent's time, they fell in love, and that's it ! Love can conquer everything ... my dad was still in tertiary education then. no honeymoon, no house, no car, no hotel wedding banquets. My mom moved into the kampung house my dad shared with his parents and 6 other siblings. It was 6 years before they got their first place.</p>
              <p>forward to now, some people can't seem to want to marry unless all the prerequisites were in place ...... whatever happened to old fashioned romance ? Our parents slogged their asses off so they could provide well for us ...... but our generation slogs our asses off so we could provide well for ...... us ?</p>
              <p>I'm kinda glad my parents never did the numbers crunching before they had me .... else I certainly wouldn't be here.</p>

              <p>I agree with you ..... it's almost criminal to have a large
              brood of children if the parents doesn't really have the means to
              provide for them.</p>
              <p>except that none of us here are in such a situation ....</p>
              <p>having to chose between feeding the kids or feeding yourself is
              one thing, a very different situation from having to chose between
              more branded goods, a flashier car, more distant holidays, etc and
              having a kid.</p>
              <p>I think the irony in the world, not just in singapore, is that
              the people who could least afford it are breeding like rabbits,
              while the ones who could well afford it are chosing not to.</p>
