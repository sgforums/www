              <p>This type hor.. I confirm will scold one. Cos I work just next to a JC, and some of the JC kids (and another nearby sec sch) just dunno how to move in one. So if I end up seeing lots of space behind and they don't move in, I just holler "EXCUSE ME, please be considerate, MOVE IN and let others take the bus too."</p>
              <p>Don't care - occupational hazard of being a teacher means you end up going around scolding young kids :P add the benefit of being an aunty to the entire thing, and I feel all empowered!</p>

              <p>That's easy.... all they need to do is to ask a friend who attended the class for the assignment.</p>
              <p>Still, there are those who just don't give a sh*t.... in all the semesters I've taught, there are students who have failed to hand in ALL their assignments.</p>
              <p>Which is sad, because they forfeited an easy 10% of their final grade.</p>
              <p>These students would attend their mid-term tests, but would inevitably fail them (and not bother to collect their marked answer scripts, either).</p>

              <p>of course it'll show up in the x-rays... and the police want to know about it...</p>

              <p>even when the cops came and gave the folks a warning not to buy these things again, the parents were arguing with the cops that "there are such things in singapore" even after the cops tell them that those things are registered and if not, they're illegal...</p>
              <p>the effing parents can tell the brat that "tomorrow we go and buy for you" in front of the police guys!!</p>
              <p>after the stupid parents left, the cops told me they wanted to slap the brat, and also the parents..</p>
              <p>i wanted to yell at them but i guess the parents will get their just desserts later in life when the brat grows up and becomes an uncontrollable monster to them</p>
