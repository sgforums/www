              <p>Yeah... it's been said that Chow Chow's, Huskies and Malamutes are not dogs suitable for 1st-time dog owners because they won't obey you everytime.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yeah, you're right.  People keep dogs and have kids without considering whether or not they will actually invest the time needed to teach and discipline them.  In the end, what you have are worse than the monkeys in the zoo, which are more well-behaved than what you can say for a lot of the Singaporean kids these days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, the dogs here are treated like family members BUT they are not spoilt rotten.  There's a huge difference.  The dogs all seem to be well-adjusted.  They run around the park without leashes, and they do not bite anyone nor other dogs.  They interact well with the other dogs, sometimes they play together by chasing each other, or they play fetch with their owners, and generally, they are very lovely and amusing to watch because they are so happy and they all keep to the 'doggy rules'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  My Singaporean friend was saying that back in SG, she wouldn't dare touch any dog that came up to her because they might be "siow gow"s who'll bite her!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I remember the irritating dogs barking a lot back in SG, especially those irritating toy breeds kept in HDB apartments.  And when an ex-colleague said she was going to keep a Husky and she lives in a 4-bedroom apartment, I told her outright that she was being very cruel to the dog.  The dog did end up with a lot of behavioural issues, chewing and destroying things in the house up to adulthood.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>Yesh.... it's abt training.</p>
              <p>Even if u send the dog for obdience classes, it's about teaching the owners how to interact wif the dog, when to correct the dog, when to praise.</p>
              <p>Picture this, we even have to TEACH ppl how to pick poop, and the owners replied "What for pick? My dog poop is fertilizer ok!"</p>
              <p>Sove a plastic bag at them and they went - "Make me." and a whole string of nasty sound words emerged from the seemingly educated lips.</p>
              <p>Space? I have 2 bigger dogs, and both are in apts, going for long walks daily, and if we can afford the time, dog runs or some doggy pool at least once a mth.</p>
              <p>And one of which is a sibe.... the run-away-dog - and they can be less destructive den those who have a garden to romp in.</p>
              <p>There are dog runs and beaches, and retractable leashes - so no excuses for lack of space and freedom ad exercise!</p>
