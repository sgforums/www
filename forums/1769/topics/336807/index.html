              <p>I've been observing this for a looooong time now .... it seems that I am just about the only person who actually walk his own pet around the neighbourhood ...... </p>
              <p>other dogs weren't walked by their owners ... their maids does it .... even patches' good friend a few houses down, yakult, gets walked by the family maid instead of the children or owner .....</p>
              <p>and I have seen some nasty behaviour from these maids walking their employer's dogs ... some of them were more inclined to talk with their friends out on the same pet stroll ... I've seen them hit and kick the dogs, or smear the dogs' own shit into their snouts when the doggies let go at an unconvenient spot ...</p>
              <p>if people are too busy to even walk their own pets, then don't get a dog ! ....</p>
              <p>and these dogs are the lucky ones ... I have never see quite a few other dogs around the neighbourhood get walks at all .... not in the morning, not in the evening ... they just bark at people all day long behind the gates .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>agree..many dog owners just leave the task to their maids..but not all maids are dog lovers.I have seen a maid tied the dog at the lamp post under the hot sun while she was chatting happily on her cell phone.</p>
              <p>Guess what! was walking my rascal at the roof garden when this aunty approached asking if we are interested to take her 9mths old maltese home.She complained her daughter bought the dog but never take care of it and end up she has to do the messy chore to clean up the dog.She said the maltese hardly go for any stroll..probably only once a month.No wonder whenever we walked past their unit, the maltese will bark  non-stop.She even said she'll dump the maltese if nobody want it.Poor dog!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is this how the petowners do this to their pet? what if their children do the same to them when they're old ?</p>

              <p>Fren asked: What good deal? big discount for a sports car?</p>
              <p>Guy replied: Errr...no.....the maid is going back and he is very busy, no time to take care of his dog.  he will even throw in some dog accessory to sweeten the deal for this friend.  Meaning he want the friend to take the dog.</p>

              <p>Over here, I noticed that the dogs seem much happier and they seem to have less behavioural issues, compared to their Singapore counterparts.  The dogs live in spacious houses and their owners tend to be very responsible, taking them out for walks at least once a day!  There are even parks where the dogs are allowed to run free unleased and interact with the other dogs there! </p>

              <p>I'm wondering, have any of you watched episodes of "The Dog Whisperer"?  Caesar Milan teaches a lot of very effective techniques for dealing with doggy behavioural issues and guess what... a lot of the issues arose because the humans didn't step up to the plate and perform well as pack leaders!  They didn't instil discipline when they should have, neither did they assert themselves as pack leaders when they had to, therefore, their pooches lose respect for them and 'take over' the leadership!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's a very interesting concept, but if you look at things from the doggies' perspective, it's ingrained into their DNA, almost!  They are pack creatures who traditionally need a strong pack leader to rule over them.  And it's rule and lead, not tyrannise and torment!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Fatum, I'd urge you to watch the series and learn from it.  Then you'd realise that going all soft and gooey on Patches is not doing him any good at all.  You'll just end up with a monster dog who'll tug at his leash when you walk him, and worse, who might decide to become aggressive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> </p>

              <p>Reminds me of my ex-housemate.  He kept hamsters but didn't really take good care of them and I was the one who had to give them their sandbaths, change the horrid ... what do you call it... bedding?... and even buy food for them cause he'd 'forget' to top up their food otherwise, and then just go and feed them whatever he can get his hands on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
