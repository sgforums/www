            <div class='col-md body'>from another forum which i copied and paste...<br><br>When it comes to making the decision about choosing a life partner,no one wants to make a mistake. Yet, with a high divorce rate , it appears that many are making serious mistakes in their approach to finding Mr/Ms Right!<br><br>If you ask most couples who are engaged why they're getting married, they'll say: "We're in love."<br><br>I believe this is the ...<br><br>#1 mistake people make when they date. Choosing a life partner should never be based on love (alone). Though this may sound not politically correct, there's a profound truth here. Love (alone) is not the basis for getting married. Rather, love is the result of a good marriage. When the other ingredients are right, then the love will come. Let me say it again: You can't build a lifetime relationship on love alone. You need a lot more.<br>Here are five questions you must ask yourself if you're serious about finding and keeping a life partner.<br><br>QUESTION #1: Do we share a common life purpose? Why is this so important? If you're married for 20 or 30 years, that's a long time to live with someone. What do you plan to do with each other all that time? Travel, eat and jog together? You need to share something deeper and more meaningful. You need a common life purpose. Two things can happen in a marriage. You can grow together, or you can grow apart. To make a marriage work, you need to know what you want out of life.<br><br>QUESTION #2: Do I feel safe expressing my feelings and thoughts with this person? This question goes to the core of the quality of your relationship. Feeling safe means you can communicate openly with this person. The basis of having good communication is trust! Make sure you feel emotionally safe with the person you plan to marry.<br><br>QUESTION #3: Is he/she a someone who is a refined and sensitive person. How can you test? Here are some suggestions. i) Do they work on personal growth on a regular basis? ii) Are they serious about improving themselve. So, ask about your significant other: What do they do with their time? Is this person materialistic?" Usually, a materialistic person is not someone whose top priority is character refinement. There are essentially two types of people in the world: People who are dedicated to personal growth and people who are dedicated to seeking comfort. Someone whose goal in life is to be comfortable will put personal comfort ahead of doing the right thing.<br><br>QUESTION #4: How does he/she treat other people? The one most important thing that makes any relationship work is the ability to give. By giving, we mean the ability to give another person pleasure. Ask: Is this someone who enjoys giving pleasure to others or are they wrapped up in themselves and self-absorbed? To measure this, think about the following: i) How do they treat people whom they do not have to be nice to, such as waiters, bus boys, taxi drivers, etc? ii) How do they treat parents and siblings? Do they have gratitude and appreciation? Do they show respect? If they don't have gratitude for the people who have given them everything, you cannot expect that they'll have gratitude for you - who can't do nearly as much for them! iii) Do they gossip and speak badly about others? Someone who gossips cannot be someone who loves others. You can be sure that someone who treats others poorly, will eventually treat you poorly as well.<br><br>QUESTION #5: Is there anything I'm hoping to change about this person after we're married? Too many people make the mistake of marrying someone with the intention of trying to "improve" them after they're married. You can probably expect someone to change after marriage for the worse!" If you cannot fully accept this person the way they are now, then you are not ready to marry them. In conclusion, dating doesn't have to be difficult and treacherous. The key is to try leading a little more with your head and less with your heart. It pays to be as objective as possible when you are dating, to be sure to ask questions that will help you get to the key issues. Falling in love is a great feeling, but when you wake up with a ring on your finger, you don't want to find yourself in trouble because you didn't do your homework.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love the article you shared soooo much that I can't help commenting on the bits that caught my attention!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Peppermint:<br><strong><br><br>Choosing a life partner should never be based on love (alone).

When the other ingredients are right, then the love will come. Let me say it again: You can't build a lifetime relationship on love alone. You need a lot more.  <span style="color: #9400D3;">I can't agree more!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span><br><br>QUESTION #1: Do we share a common life purpose? Why is this so important? If you're married for 20 or 30 years, that's a long time to live with someone. What do you plan to do with each other all that time? Travel, eat and jog together? You need to share something deeper and more meaningful. You need a common life purpose. Two things can happen in a marriage. You can grow together, or you can grow apart. To make a marriage work, you need to know what you want out of life.<br><br><span style="color: #2E8B57;">A lifetime IS a long time... and whilst you don't have to have similarities in EVERYTHING, I believe that intrinsically, when it comes to things like moral values, life goals, etc, you DO have to think on the same wavelength.</span><br><br>QUESTION #2: Do I feel safe expressing my feelings and thoughts with this person? This question goes to the core of the quality of your relationship. Feeling safe means you can communicate openly with this person. The basis of having good communication is trust! Make sure you feel emotionally safe with the person you plan to marry.<br><br><span style="color: #B03060;">I really think that this is a very very important point.  If you cannot speak freely and know that your partner will not immediately think the worst of you, you'll never be able to enjoy full trust with him/her.<br><br>Imagine if you're in a bad mood and you say something stupid like, 'My boss is the biggest idiot in the entire universe!' and instead of acknowledging that you had a bad day and just need to do some harmless venting, he/she starts to think, 'Wah... such a bad-tempered person!'<br><br>To be judged when you're just in one of your lousy moods (that'll pass) would be a real blow.  Imagine having to say 'politically correct' things all the time, even when you're supposed to be at home - the place in the world where you're supposed to feel safest and most secure!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   </span><br><br>QUESTION #3: Is he/she a someone who is a refined and sensitive person. How can you test? Here are some suggestions. i) Do they work on personal growth on a regular basis? ii) Are they serious about improving themselve. So, ask about your significant other: What do they do with their time? Is this person materialistic?" Usually, a materialistic person is not someone whose top priority is character refinement. There are essentially two types of people in the world: People who are dedicated to personal growth and people who are dedicated to seeking comfort. Someone whose goal in life is to be comfortable will put personal comfort ahead of doing the right thing.<br><br><span style="color: #008B8B;">Aaahhh... this is a point that is very very important to me!  To see someone working on personal growth.  I've always felt that the mark of a good man would be his ability to take constructive criticisms, and his willingness to seek the advice / opinions of others.  If a guy thinks too highly of his own views to the extent that he starts to take a hard stand and doesn't take others' viewpoint into account, I'd take that as a big danger sign.  This means that he doesn't take kindly to advice and when trials come your way, which it will, he will be very very obstinate and unyielding.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Also, sloth and a general lack of desire to improve onself and explore new fields of interest, just doesn't cut it with me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </span><br><br>QUESTION #4: How does he/she treat other people? The one most important thing that makes any relationship work is the ability to give. Ask: Is this someone who enjoys giving pleasure to others or are they wrapped up in themselves and self-absorbed? To measure this, think about the following: i) How do they treat people whom they do not have to be nice to, such as waiters, bus boys, taxi drivers, etc? ii) How do they treat parents and siblings? Do they have gratitude and appreciation? Do they show respect? If they don't have gratitude for the people who have given them everything, you cannot expect that they'll have gratitude for you - who can't do nearly as much for them! iii) Do they gossip and speak badly about others? Someone who gossips cannot be someone who loves others.

Falling in love is a great feeling, but when you wake up with a ring on your finger, you don't want to find yourself in trouble because you didn't do your homework.<br><br><span style="color: #8B3A3A;">And this is why it is soooo important to me, that my close friends approve of my guy.  They know me best, they want the best for me, and standing by the sidelines, they get to see things sharply whereas I might have blurred vision cause I might be seeing through rose-tinted glasses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  It matters to me what people I love and respect would say about this guy.  </span><br><br></strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>
