They're in their 30s.. mom's frenz.<br><br>support network's very important imo. if my mom's gg to talk like that someone i know, i'm definitely not gg to go anywhere near mom when i'm pregnant, or immediately after child birth...</div>

I know its easy to say... but the guilt you have its not easy to be get ride off....but still do not think too much about it anymore.....move on with your hubby......i am sure the baby understands you had done wat you had to do and has forgiven you....<br><br>maybe u can write the reason, your apologies and your heartache and your pain and ask for forgiveness in a piece of paper.....keep it in a box and seal it and store it away.....let this painful page of your life gone pass....<br><br>who knows maybe your baby has already reincarnated and now enjoy the love of another parents....so give your blessing....<br><br>Please take care!<br></div>
