Maybe he didn't consider that you might feel pressured or embarressed with so many onlookers but if he treats you like family, he might overlook factors like these.<br><br>As well, he is a guy. Most guys don't have a clue how much importance we girls put on the proposal. Have the both of you even talked about getting married and stuff like that? Have you hinted your expectations to him or is he the clueless kind who doesn't get any hints.<br><br>On a positive note, at least he attempted to surprise you although in your opinion it is a total fiasco. (Well in my opinion my proposal was a total fiasco too but we still have a good laugh over it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>I think you are a perfectionist and you expect everyone to be the same. This is my assumption so don't take it the wrong way. He sounds like a nice guy to us so far. He is afterall human and have his flaws. The perfect guy just don't exist! Also, if you are going to marry him, you will have to accept who he is and what he is. One cannot force our own expectations on another person because that would just turn them into someone else and it is likely they won't fit into the mould you expect and you will just end up feeling bitter about it.<br><br></div>

Awwwwww...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There's also this elderly couple in my block, they don't hold hands, but they're always going here and there together, talking, discussing things, sounds quite business-like but it's their brand of intimacy and routine, and suddenly, one day, I see the uncle sitting on a bench, staring at nothing, looking soooooo desolate!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">   I thought, 'Oh dear God, please don't let his wife be dead or something like that!'  Next few days, saw the uncle again twice... kept feeling worried and kept wanting to go up to him and check if he's alright.  Third time I saw him, I buay tahan, this whole thing haunting me already, so I walked up to him, gave him a huge smile, 'Good morning, uncle!' then we started talking.  I slowly brought up the subject of his wife... wah... like treading on glass cause not sure of the answer and his reaction... he said, 'oh, she's a Filipino-Chinese, she went back for her holidays, will be back a month later.  I miss her!'  PHEW!!!  Not dead, not sick!!  PHEW!!!  I was getting soooo worried that uncle will get into depression!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   Now, his wife's back and I don't see him sitting alone at the bench for hours anymore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ah well, each of us have different levels of intimacy needs, I guess.  We just need to find a partner who's likes the same stuff or is willing to meet us on middle ground, ie. compromise.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Like what elindra said, men are mostly clueless.  I've learnt that when I tolerate until super buay tahan, I'll just say, 'Can you like hug me or not?  A hug would be nice now!'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Usually, the blur guy will, 'Oh!' then big grin and a huge hug.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Then, both will be happy!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
