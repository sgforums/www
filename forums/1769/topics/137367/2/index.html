I never understood this societal pressure to get hitched and yada yada. I've had enough invitations to dodgeball marriages. The most recent one, she wanted a divorce within 3 weeks, they never consumated the marriage neither are they living together while waiting for their house to be built. Mind you i live in Melbourne so this is extremely funny situation that they do not live together. Anyway she spoke to us about it and she wanted to know if she owned half of his assets. After we laughed and said no babe you'll be laughed out of court if you do. She changed her tune and said no do i own half of his debts and liabilities (but we knew what the truth is). I said you need to serve him proper separation papers with witnesses and all. And then 355 days later file for divorce. She's now scheming to stay with him for at least 2 years to get her grubby hands on his property.<br><br>Rhonda, i think i have found THE guy. We've been together 3 years. He's nice, polite, so sweet and recently gave me Miss Chanel/Gucci/Fendi a credit card. That is trust. And when i asked him if he is worried if i'll rack the bills up cos i CAN DO LOTS OF DAMAGE. He said absolutely not.. there's a $10K limit and that's all you can go up to I do not care. OMG, i died. He is one of those straight as nerds, he doesnt' know how to lie and i have complete trust in him. However he ain't no hot stuff physically and i cannot help it but perv on other guys. I think fidelity is NOT in my DNA and some people should not fight it.<br><br>To be honest, i'm engaged.. but i resent it because he asked me infront of his family and i did not have the option to say no.</div>

I never understood this societal pressure to get hitched and yada yada. I've had enough invitations to dodgeball marriages. The most recent one, she wanted a divorce within 3 weeks, they never consumated the marriage neither are they living together while waiting for their house to be built. Mind you i live in Melbourne so this is extremely funny situation that they do not live together. Anyway she spoke to us about it and she wanted to know if she owned half of his assets. After we laughed and said no babe you'll be laughed out of court if you do. She changed her tune and said no do i own half of his debts and liabilities (but we knew what the truth is). I said you need to serve him proper separation papers with witnesses and all. And then 355 days later file for divorce. She's now scheming to stay with him for at least 2 years to get her grubby hands on his property.<br><br>Rhonda, i think i have found THE guy. We've been together 3 years. He's nice, polite, so sweet and recently gave me Miss Chanel/Gucci/Fendi a credit card. That is trust. And when i asked him if he is worried if i'll rack the bills up cos i CAN DO LOTS OF DAMAGE. He said absolutely not.. there's a $10K limit and that's all you can go up to I do not care. OMG, i died. He is one of those straight as nerds, he doesnt' know how to lie and i have complete trust in him. However he ain't no hot stuff physically and i cannot help it but perv on other guys. I think fidelity is NOT in my DNA and some people should not fight it.<br><br>To be honest, i'm engaged.. but i resent it because he asked[b] <span style="color: red;">me infront of his family and i did not have the option to say no</span>.</strong> [/b]</blockquote>sound like a scheme to me..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Perhaps, under different circumstances, you would have gladly become engaged to him anyways.  But it's just this little element of coercion, perhaps, that gives you this feeling of being cornered into succumbing.  There's probably anger in the way it was done, for sure... but look at the bigger picture - you've got this guy's love and trust!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sometimes, I feel like I'm a stray cat, waiting for some nice guy to come and place a cat-collar on me and call me his own!
