            <div class='col-md body'>I attended a wedding dinner last night w my hubby. the table was made up mostly of strangers who may know another friend, but not know anyone else at the table.<br><br>Most of the time when this happens, someone would take the initiative to start small talk so the entire table sharing would not be too awkward.<br><br>However, this time, there were just lots of whispering to the side, and even catching the eye to smile and say "let's tuck in, don't pai say" was difficult cos no one would meet the eyes of another! even the guy who finally did say "come let's eat" did not look at the other guests, but was busy looking at the food.<br><br>As I was in 'wifey' role(read: passive, just want to be fed and eat) and super tired, no mood to initiate the small talk. But later sharing with friends this, they were saying its REALLY difficult to initiate small talk generally.<br><br>I'm sure meeting up with internet friends for first time was somewhat similar (except database to initiate small talk was slightly bigger if forum cos previous contact).<br><br>So share your good small talk techniques!<br>What questions do you ask?<br>How do u usually start the ball rolling!</div>
