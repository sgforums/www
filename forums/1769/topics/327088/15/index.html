              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>If you've ever wondered who's in control, you or your cat, a new study points to the obvious. It's your cat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Household cats exercise this control with a certain type of urgent-sounding, high-pitched meow, according to the findings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This meow is actually a purr mixed with a high-pitched cry. While people usually think of cat purring as a sign of happiness, some <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/catsdocontrolhumansstudyfinds/32691139/SIG=117cg7t0v/*http://www.livescience.com/topic/cats"><span id="lw_1247515795_0" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #0058a6;">cats</span></span></a> make this purr-cry sound when they want to be fed. The study showed that humans find these mixed calls annoying and difficult to ignore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The embedding of a cry within a call that we normally associate with contentment is quite a subtle means of eliciting a response," said Karen McComb of the <span id="lw_1247515795_1" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">University of Sussex</span>. "<span id="lw_1247515795_2" class="yshortcuts">Solicitation</span> purring is probably more acceptable to humans than overt meowing, which is likely to get cats ejected from the bedroom."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They know us</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Previous research has shown similarities between cat cries and <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/catsdocontrolhumansstudyfinds/32691139/SIG=11996ej18/*http://www.livescience.com/topic/babies"><span id="lw_1247515795_3" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #0058a6;">human infant</span></span></a> cries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>McComb suggests that the purr-cry may subtly take advantage of humans' sensitivity to cries they associate with nurturing offspring. Also, including the cry within the purr could make the sound "less harmonic and thus more difficult to habituate to," she said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>McComb got the idea for the study from her experience with her own cat, who would consistently wake her up in the mornings with a very insistent purr. After speaking with other cat owners, she learned that some of their cats also made the same type of call. As a scientist who studies vocal communication in mammals, she decided to investigate the manipulative meow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tough to test</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Setting up the experiments wasn't easy. While the felines used purr-cries around their <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/catsdocontrolhumansstudyfinds/32691139/SIG=11ugde75q/*http://www.livescience.com/animals/071022-pet-obsession.html"><span id="lw_1247515795_4" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #0058a6;">familiar owners</span></span></a>, they were not eager to make the same cries in front of strangers. So McComb and her team trained cat owners to record their pets' cries - capturing the sounds made by cats when they were seeking food and when they were not. In all, the team collected recordings from 10 different cats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The researchers then played the cries back for 50 human participants, not all of whom owned cats. They found that humans, even if they had never had a cat themselves, judged the purrs recorded while cats were actively seeking food - the purrs with an embedded, high-pitched cry - as more urgent and less pleasant than those made in other contexts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the team re-synthesised the recorded purrs to remove the embedded cry, leaving all else unchanged, the <span id="lw_1247515795_5" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">human subjects</span>' urgency ratings for those calls decreased significantly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>McComb said she thinks this cry occurs at a low level in cats' normal purring, "but we think that cats learn to dramatically exaggerate it when it proves effective in generating a response from humans." In fact, not all cats use this form of purring at all, she said, noting that it seems to most often develop in cats that have a one-on-one relationship with their owners rather than those living in large households, where their purrs might be overlooked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The results were published in the July 14 issue of the journal Current Biology.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">PATNA, India (Reuters) - Farmers in an eastern Indian state have
              asked their unmarried daughters to plough parched fields naked in a bid
              to embarrass the weather gods to bring some badly needed monsoon rain,
              officials said on Thursday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Witnesses said the naked girls in Bihar state ploughed the fields
              and chanted ancient hymns after sunset to invoke the gods. They said
              elderly village women helped the girls drag the ploughs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"They (villagers) believe their acts would get the weather gods
              badly embarrassed, who in turn would ensure bumper crops by sending
              rains," Upendra Kumar, a village council official, said from Bihar's
              remote Banke Bazaar town.</span></p>

              <p>NEW DELHI - AIR India said on Sunday it was investigating
              allegations of a mid-air brawl in which pilots and cabin crew were
              reported to have exchanged blows in front of startled passengers.</p>
              <p>The Times of India reported that crew members threw punches and
              hurled abuse at each other on the flight from Sharjah in the United
              Arab Emirates to Delhi after a female attendant accused the pilots of
              sexually harassing her.</p>
              <p>The fight spilled out into the galley of the plane as about 100
              passengers looked on, the paper said under the headline 'Pilots, crew
              slug it out at 30,000 feet'.</p>
              <p>The cockpit of the Airbus A-320 was left unmanned at one point, and
              one of the pilots threatened to divert the plane to Pakistan, the Times
              alleged.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old female crew member and a co-pilot both suffered
              bruises in the incident on Saturday and police have registered a case
              against the pilots for 'outraging the modesty of a woman,' it said.</p>
              <p>'There are several eyewitnesses and we are recording their
              statements,' the Times quoted police commissioner Satyendra Garg as
              saying.</p>
              <p>State-run Air India said in a statement it had ordered an inquiry
              into what it described as a reported 'scuffle", adding that two pilots
              and two crew members had been suspended. -- AFP</p>

              <p>NO short pants on the streets!</p>
              <p>A sexagenarian has been heading to the streets and caning women who wear short pants.</p>
              <p>The woman has been seen loitering at the market and hawker centre near some flats in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore.</p>
              <p>Holding a rotan in her hands, the woman would cane any female in short pants that she came across.</p>
              <p>The republic’s Lianhe Wanbao reported that the sexagenarian would also scold the women as she caned them.</p>
              <p>“Why are you wearing shorts? You must be caned for wearing this,’’ she said in Hokkien.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, the woman has raised her rotan on a hawker.</p>
              <p>The hawker, who was annoyed by the old woman’s act, had attempted to stop her but was still whipped.</p>
              <p>Her mother saw this and went to her aid. The mother and daughter managed to stop the old woman and forced her onto the ground.</p>
              <p>They called the police later.</p>

              <p><strong>Idiotic Criminal Gets Caught Through Facebook Updates, Part I:</strong></p>
              <p>MARTINSBURG - The popular online social networking site Facebook
                  helped lead to an alleged burglar's arrest after he stopped check his
                  account on the victim's computer, but forgot to log out before leaving
                  the home with two diamond rings.</p>
              <p>Jonathan G. Parker, 19, of Fort Loudoun, Pa., was arraigned Tuesday one count of felony daytime burglary.</p>
              <p>According
                  to court records, Deputy P.D. Ware of the Berkeley County Sheriff's
                  Department responded on Aug. 28 to the victim's home after she reported
                  the burglary.</p>
              <p>She told police that someone had broken into her home through a bedroom window.</p>
              <p>There were open cabinets in her garage, and other signs of a burglar.</p>
              <p>The
                  victim later noticed that the intruder also used her computer to check
                  his Facebook status, and his account was still open when she checked
                  the computer.</p>
              <p>The victim later noticed that she was missing two diamond rings from her dresser in the same room as her computer.</p>
              <p>The two rings were worth more than $3,500, reports indicate.</p>
              <p>During
                  the investigation, a friend of the victim told her that he knew where
                  Parker was staying, in the same area as the victim's house.</p>
              <p>Police then went to the home and spoke with a friend of Parker's.</p>
              <p>The man said Parker had stopped by his home occasionally, but he said the man didn't live there.</p>
              <p>He
                  also said that the night before the burglary, Parker asked him if he
                  wanted to help break into the victim's home but he refused.</p>
              <p>As of Tuesday evening, Parker remained in custody at the Eastern Regional Jail on $10,000 bail.</p>
              <p>If convicted he faces one to 10 years in prison.</p>

              <p><strong>Idiotic Criminal Gets Caught Through Facebook Updates, Part
                                          II:</strong></p>
              <p>Max Sopo was living the dream of a fugitive abroad, kicking back on the
                  beaches of Cancun by day, partying in the clubs by night.</p>
              <p>Then he did two things that are never a good idea when
                  you're on the run from authorities: he started posting Facebook updates
                  about how much fun he was having – and added a former Justice
                  Department official to his list of friends.</p>
              <p>Because of that
                  indiscretion, the 26-year-old native of Cameroon is now in a Mexico
                  City jail awaiting extradition to the United States on bank fraud
                  charges. Federal prosecutors say he and an associate falsely obtained
                  more than US$200,000 (NZ$272,000) from Seattle-area banks and credit
                  unions.</p>
              <p>"He was making posts about how beautiful life is
                  and how he was having a good time with his buddies," said Assistant US
                  Attorney Michael Scoville, who helped find Sopo. "He was definitely not
                  living the way we wanted him to be living, given the charges he was
                  facing."</p>
              <p>Even in the hold-nothing-back world of social
                  networking, where police search Facebook photos for evidence of
                  underage drinking and watch YouTube videos to identify riot suspects,
                  it's rare that a fugitive helps authorities this much. In status
                  updates, Sopo said he was "loving it" and "living in paradise". "LIFE
                  IS VERY SIMPLE REALLY!!!!" he wrote on June 21. "BUT SOME OF US HUMANS
                  MAKE A MESS OF IT... REMEMBER AM JUST HERE TO HAVE FUN PARTEEEEEEE."</p>
              <p>Sopo,
                  who came to the US in about 2003, made a living selling roses in
                  Seattle nightclubs until, according to prosecutors, he moved on to bank
                  fraud. He apparently drove a rented car to Mexico in late February
                  after learning that federal agents were investigating the fraud scheme.</p>
              <p>Investigators
                  initially could find no trace of him on social networking sites such as
                  Facebook and MySpace, and they were unable to pin down his exact
                  location in Mexico.</p>
              <p>But several months later, Secret Service agent Seth Reeg checked Facebook again – and up popped Maxi Sopo.</p>
              <p>Although
                  Sopo's profile was set to private, his list of friends was not, and Mr
                  Scoville started combing through it. He was surprised to see that one
                  friend listed an affiliation with the Justice Department and sent him a
                  message requesting a phone call.</p>
              <p>"We figured this was a person we could probably trust to keep our inquiry discreet," Mr Scoville said.</p>
              <p>The
                  former official told Mr Scoville he had met Sopo in Cancun's nightclubs
                  a few times, but did not really know him and had no idea he was a
                  fugitive. The official learned where Sopo was living and passed that
                  information back to Mr Scoville, who provided it to Mexican
                  authorities. They arrested Sopo last month.<span id="feedback_STORYBODY" class="ad_leftcol_feedback"> </span></p>
              <p>Prosecutors say he masterminded the bank fraud scheme
                  with Edward Asatoorians, who was convicted by a federal jury in Seattle
                  last week. Testimony showed the pair persuaded young co-conspirators to
                  lie about their income to obtain loans for fabricated auto purchases,
                  and then used the money to prop up Asatoorians' business.</p>
              <p>Asatoorians is expected to face at least five years' jail when he's sentenced. If convicted, Sopo could face up to 30 years.   <strong>—   AP</strong></p>

              <p>There's an article on The Edge regarding AirAsia and its boss on the sidelines of the F1 Singapore race last month.</p>
              <p>The boss said he's looking to secure landing rights for USA and more rights in Europe. He's looking at merging AirAsia &amp; AirAsia X as well. He's expecting 30m passengers this year vs 19m last year. On my personal point of view, when the economy recovers it could be another picture for long haul budget routes.</p>
              <p>He said he's willing to wait for USA landing rights as he had done so for Singapore's.</p>
              <p>He also said he believes his company would edge out against SIA onto being the preferred partner for Resorts World @ Sentosa for carrying more passenger.</p>
              <p>Personally I find it being comparing oranges and apple. First thing he's a Malaysian carrier not hubbing in Singapore and the pool of passengers travels w/ AirAsia.</p>
              <p>Neither was it right over the landing issue. The bilateral air agreement had to be agreed by both countries and the accusation tat Singapore wants to protect SIA has no basis. We do not need a national carrier for the sake of it. To think of it, it's like everything is Singapore's fault, Malaysia my home country semua boleh.</p>

              <p>The Reds lost 1-0 to Sunderland on Saturday courtesy of a
              Darren Bent strike that deflected in off a large red ball that had been
              thrown into the penalty box by a Liverpool supporter.</p>
              <p>Opposition
              fans revelling in Rafa Benitez's side's misery have bought all
              remaining 'beach sets' from the online shop, which consist of a towel,
              a bag and the now-infamous beach ball.</p>
              <p>The sets had been
              reduced from £20 to £10 and have now sold out. They will be a must-have
              item for travelling supporters visiting Anfield in coming weeks.</p>
              <p>Several web users have also left spoof reviews on the site.</p>
              <p>'Natalie from Manchester' wrote: "I bought this set, but seem to have lost the ball in <a href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/sunderland/">Sunderland</a>.
              Is it possible to order a replacement?" while 'G from Johnon'
              commented: "This is one of the most flexible products I have ever
              purchased. Great for not only the beach, but can also play up front."</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              fans are unlikely to see the funny side; the defeat was their fourth of
              the season, and leaves them seven points off the top of the Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>Referee Mike Jones allowed the goal, although the laws
              state play should be stopped if any 'outside agent' interferes, and
              restarted with a drop ball.</p>
              <p>Bent's shot bounced into the ball
              and deviated into the bottom-right corner past goalkeeper Jose Reina,
              who was so badly distracted he moved to save the beach ball.</p>
              <p>Sky
              Sports News broadcast footage on Saturday of a young fan batting the
              ball into Reina's penalty box from the away end, but Match of the Day
              and the Sunday newspapers blocked out the fan's face fearing reprisals
              for his blunder.</p>
              <p>Sunderland manager Steve Bruce said he did
              know the goal should not have stood, saying: "If anybody knew that rule
              - that it is supposed to be a drop ball - then you are a saddo."</p>
              <p>However, former Premier League referee Jeff Winter said he was shocked Jones did not disallow the goal.</p>
              <p>Winter
              said: "I'm absolutely amazed. It is basic law in football. The goal
              should just not have stood. The laws of the game state that if there's
              an outside interference the game has to be stopped."</p>
