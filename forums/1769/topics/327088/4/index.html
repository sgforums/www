              <h1>Chef dies after eating 'super hot' chilli</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An aspiring chef died after eating a "super hot" chilli
                      sauce in a competition with his girlfriend's brother, an inquest in
                      England has heard.</p>
              <p><strong>- Man dies after eating chilli<br> - Suffered 'discomfort, itching'<br> - Heart attack possible, inquest told</strong></p>
              <p>Andrew
                      Lee, 33, challenged his girlfriend's brother to a contest on September
                      19 to see who could make and eat the hottest sauce, London's <em>The Times</em> reported.</p>
              <p>The
                      forklift driver from Edlington, West Yorkshire in England, made a
                      tomato sauce with red chillies grown by his father, but after eating it
                      suffered intense discomfort and itching.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee went to bed and asked his girlfriend, Samantha Bailey, to scratch his back until he fell asleep.</p>
              <p>When she woke in the morning he was dead, possibly after suffering a heart attack, <em>The Guardian</em> said.</p>
              <p>Paramedics were called to the home but were unable to revive Lee, who was lying on the floor, <em>The Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
              <p>Toxicology
                      tests will be conducted to establish if he suffered a reaction to the
                      food. Lee was in perfect health and just passed a medical examination
                      at work, the inquest heard.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee's sister, Claire
                      Chadbourne, 29, said he took a jar of the sauce to his girlfriend's
                      home and challenged her brother Michael, 29, to a competition to see
                      who could eat it.</p>
              <p>"Andrew just ate the chillies with a
                      plate of Dolmio sauce. It was not a proper meal because he had already
                      eaten lamb chops and potato mash after work," she said.</p>
              <p>"He
                      apparently got into bed at 2.30am and started scratching all over. His
                      girlfriend ... woke up and he had gone. It is incredible. Who would
                      have thought he could have died from eating chilli sauce?"</p>
              <p>She said a post-mortem showed no heart problems.</p>
              <p>"He loved cooking for his friends. He always said he wanted to be a chef but didn't want to start at the bottom."</p>
              <p>The inquest was adjourned.</p>

              at a home in Casper, Wyo. Then the officer arrived at the home of
              Beverly Hood. It was no ordinary domestic feline — but a male mountain
              lion weighing 80 to 90 pounds. Officer Mike Ableman says he ran for cover inside Hood's home when he saw the cougar.</p>
              <p>Hood says she was inside when she first saw the mountain lion lying
              on her porch Monday. Hood says the lion hissed at her, but she wasn't
              scared.</p>
              <p>She called 911, <span id="lw_1222890758_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">animal control</span> and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. Hood reported that she had a
              bothersome "big cat." A dispatcher told Ableman that it was a house cat.</p>

              <p>MEXICO CITY - Missing in <span id="lw_1222915596_0" class="yshortcuts">Mexico</span>:
              5,000 condoms, sound equipment and a motor used to inflate a giant
              prophylactic, all stolen from a "condom-mobile" used to promote
              HIV/AIDS awareness.</p>
              <p>The
              coordinator of an HIV/AIDS awareness tour, Polo Gomez, said the truck
              was taken Sunday from its parking spot in front of a friend's house in <span id="lw_1222915596_1" class="yshortcuts">Mexico City</span>.</p>
              <p>It was recovered Wednesday in a shopping mall parking lot in a northern suburb — minus the condoms and the equipment. <span id="lw_1222915596_2" class="yshortcuts">Gomez</span> said the thieves left some 800 HIV tests and a 23-foot inflatable prophylactic, which were also in the vehicle.</p>
              <p>The truck wasn't hard to locate. It features painted images of a
              peeled banana, the exposed part shaped like a condom, and a shirtless
              man saying: "I protect myself. Do you?"</p>
              <p>After the theft received widespread media coverage, residents phoned police with the vehicle's whereabouts, Gomez said.</p>
              <p>The Condomovil program has toured Mexico since 1998 promoting safe
              sex practices while distributing 1.2 million condoms to more than
              700,000 people, Gomez said. The inflatable condom was used to draw
              attention from passers-by.</p>
              <p>The group bought the truck with a grant from <span id="lw_1222915596_3" class="yshortcuts">Mexico's federal Health Department</span>. The department also donated the 5,000 condoms that were stolen.</p>
              <p>The <span id="lw_1222915596_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">United Nations AIDS program</span> says there are some 200,000 people living with <span id="lw_1222915596_5" class="yshortcuts">HIV</span> in Mexico.</p>

              <p><strong>Aussie boy breaks into zoo, feeds animals to croc</strong></p>
              <p>By KRISTEN GELINEAU,Associated Press Writer <cite class="auth">AP - <span><strong>2 hours 14 minutes ago</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">SYDNEY, Australia - A 7-year-old boy broke into a popular Outback zoo, fed a string of animals to the resident crocodile and bashed several lizards to death with a rock, the zoo's director said Friday.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">The 30-minute rampage, caught on the zoo's security camera, happened early Wednesday after the boy jumped a security fence at the Alice Springs Reptile Center in central Australia, said zoo director Rex Neindorf.</div>
              <p>The child then went on a killing spree, bashing three lizards to death with a rock, including the zoo's beloved, 20-year-old goanna, which he then fed to "Terry," an 11-foot, 440-pound saltwater crocodile, said Neindorf.</p>
              <p>The boy also fed several live animals to Terry by throwing them over the two fences surrounding the crocodile's enclosure, at one point climbing over the outer fence to get closer to the giant reptile.</p>
              <p>In the footage, the boy's face remains largely blank, Neindorf said, adding: "It was like he was playing a game."</p>
              <p>By the time he was done, 13 animals worth around $5,500 had been killed, including a turtle, bearded dragons and thorny devil lizards, Neindorf said. Although none were considered rare, some are difficult to replace, he said.</p>
              <p>"We're horrified that anyone can do this and saddened by the age of the child," Neindorf said.</p>
              <p>Alice Springs police said they are unable to press charges against the boy because of his age. Children under age 10 can't be charged with criminal offenses in the Northern Territory. His name was not released because of his age.</p>
              <p>Neindorf said he plans to sue the boy's parents.</p>
              <p>The boy's small size is probably the reason he didn't trip the zoo's security system, which relies on sensors to detect intruders, Neindorf said.</p>
              <p>"I just want people to learn that they can't let their children go and run amok," Neindorf said. "If we can't put the blame onto the child, then someone has to accept the responsibility."</p>

              <p><strong>Aussie boy breaks into zoo, feeds animals to
              croc</strong></p>
              <p>By KRISTEN GELINEAU,Associated Press Writer <cite>AP -
              <span><strong>2 hours 14 minutes ago</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p>SYDNEY, Australia - A 7-year-old boy broke into a
              popular Outback zoo, fed a string of animals to the resident
              crocodile and bashed several lizards to death with a rock, the
              zoo's director said Friday.</p>
              <div>The 30-minute rampage, caught on the zoo's security camera,
              happened early Wednesday after the boy jumped a security fence at
              the Alice Springs Reptile Center in central Australia, said zoo
              director Rex Neindorf.</div>
              <p>The child then went on a killing spree, bashing three lizards to
              death with a rock, including the zoo's beloved, 20-year-old goanna,
              which he then fed to "Terry," an 11-foot, 440-pound saltwater
              crocodile, said Neindorf.</p>
              <p>The boy also fed several live animals to Terry by throwing them
              over the two fences surrounding the crocodile's enclosure, at one
              point climbing over the outer fence to get closer to the giant
              reptile.</p>
              <p>In the footage, the boy's face remains largely blank, Neindorf
              said, adding: "It was like he was playing a game."</p>
              <p>By the time he was done, 13 animals worth around $5,500 had been
              killed, including a turtle, bearded dragons and thorny devil
              lizards, Neindorf said. Although none were considered rare, some
              are difficult to replace, he said.</p>
              <p>"We're horrified that anyone can do this and saddened by the age
              of the child," Neindorf said.</p>
              <p>Alice Springs police said they are unable to press charges
              against the boy because of his age. Children under age 10 can't be
              charged with criminal offenses in the Northern Territory. His name
              was not released because of his age.</p>
              <p>Neindorf said he plans to sue the boy's parents.</p>
              <p>The boy's small size is probably the reason he didn't trip the
              zoo's security system, which relies on sensors to detect intruders,
              Neindorf said.</p>
              <p>"I just want people to learn that they can't let their children
              go and run amok," Neindorf said. "If we can't put the blame onto
              the child, then someone has to accept the responsibility."</p>

              <p class="Tag Full">By <a href="http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/zeotherm">Matt Ford</a> | Published: October 03, 2008 - 09:35AM CT</p>
              <div class="Body">
              <p>Last night kicked the scientific award season into full swing; the <a href="http://improbable.com/ig/2008/">18th First Annual Ig Nobel Awards</a> were handed out in Harvard's Sanders Theater. Not quite as well-known
              as their more prestigious namesake, the awards recognize "research that
              first makes people laugh and then think."</p>
              <p>The ceremony saw the ever-popular 24/7 lecture series, where leading
              researchers from around the world discuss the technical details and
              ramifications of their work in 24 seconds, then explain it in layman's
              terms in 7 words. This year's 24/7 series included talks from <a href="http://www.isepp.org/Pages/02-03%20Pages/Mandelbrot.html">Benoit Mandelbrot</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/%7Eanna/">Anna Lysyanskaya</a>, <a href="http://www.forsyth.org/research/scientists/profiles/dadams.html">Dany Adams</a>, and the 1976 Nobel Laureate in chemistry, <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1976/lipscomb-autobio.html">William Lipscomb</a>.
              Other ongoing traditions include the Ig Nobels being handed out by
              Nobel laureates, and an eight-year-old girl being kept up past her
              bedtime whose role is to ensure that acceptance speeches are capped at
              60 seconds.</p>
              <p><img class="ImageRight Bordered" src="http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/2008IgNobelPrizeB.gif" alt=""> In a ceremony with a main theme of redundancy, the ceremony honored the
              research that "makes people laugh and then think" in a
              redundantly-themed ceremony. This year, eight fields of research were
              honored: archeology, biology, chemistry, economics, literature,
              medicine, nutrition, and peace. Without further suspense, here are the
              winners in no order of winning order:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Peace: plants are people too.</span> The peace award goes to none other than the Swiss. The <a href="http://www.ekah.admin.ch/en/index.html">Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology</a>, along with the citizens of that great nation, took the prize for passing a law that recognizes that <a href="http://www.ekah.admin.ch/en/documentation/publications/index.html">plants have dignity too</a>.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biology: dog-borne fleas are better jumpers than cat-borne fleas.</span> Turns out athletic ability, in fleas at least, depends on where you
              live. Researchers found that fleas that live on dogs are better high
              jumpers when compared to fleas that live on cats.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Literature: "You Bastard!"</span> The literature prize goes to David Sims for his study on organizational
              indignation: "You Bastard: A Narrative Exploration of the Experience of
              Indignation Within Organizations."</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nutrition: it tastes better if it sounds better.</span> This award goes to a pair of British researchers who confirmed the
              simple idea that food tastes better if it sounds better. For those who
              question the practicality of this research, it has already been put to
              use in the <a href="http://www.fatduck.co.uk/">Fat Duck Restaurant</a>, where seafood diners are given iPods loaded with ocean sounds to listen to while they dine.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medicine: placebos that cost more said to work better.</span> While the true effect of placebos continues to be studied, Dan Ariely
              has demonstrated that expensive fake medicine works better than the
              cheap crap you get on the corner. (I predict a future Ig Nobel in
              economics for the exploiter of this one.)</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Economics: strippers earn more when they are at peak fertility.</span> Ever sign up for psychology experiments while in college? I bet you
              didn't get picked for this one: a trio of psychology researchers from
              the University of New Mexico found that exotic dancers make up to 60
              percent more when they are at peak fertility.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Archeology: armadillos can wreak havoc on digs.</span> It turns out that while armadillos are cool-looking, they can be very
              problematic at archaeological dig sites. A Brazilian duo observed that
              armadillos are capable of moving artifacts at dig sites up to several
              meters from their original "final" resting place.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chemistry: Coca-Cola is an effective spermicide.</span> A 23-year-old study that appeared in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> finally got the recognition it deserves. An Ob/Gyn team from BU's
              School of Medicine found that Coca-Cola was indeed a spermicide and,
              oddly enough, that Diet Coke worked best of the then-available
              variants. The award is shared with a team of Taiwanese researchers who
              found that Coke and related sodas were <em>not</em> good contraceptives...</li>
              </ul>
              Each was handed a handcrafted plaque that stated (simply?): 
              <blockquote> This Ig Nobel Prize is awarded in the year 2008 to an Ig
              Nobel Prize winner, in recognition of the Ig Nobel Prize winner's Ig
              Nobel Prize-winning achievement </blockquote> So, those are the winners of this years prestigious Ig Nobel awards.
              The researchers will join the ranks of past winners such as Don
              Featherstone (inventor of the plastic lawn flamingo), Kees Moeliker
              (observer of homosexual necrophiliac ducks), and Dr. Francis Fesmire
              (discoverer of how to terminate intractable hiccups using digital
              rectal massage) to go down as people who make us laugh, and then think.</div>
