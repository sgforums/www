              <h1>Baahmy cops</h1>
              <p>Police escorted a flock of 700 sheep over train tracks after a local 
              shepherd requested help in Blankensee, northern Germany.
              Because police are responsible for all road and rail safety in Germany 
              the shepherds argued that they were obliged to help out, and senior 
              police officers agreed.
              Two other shepherds and three dogs also chipped in and a police 
              spokesman added: "The sheep dogs were amazing - even police dogs could 
              learn a thing or two."</p>

              <h1>Romanian feared traffic check was attempted robbery</h1>
              <p>A Romanian motorist trying to shake off a police car told astonished 
              officers he feared being robbed.<br><br>The 36-year-old driver of a 
              minivan stepped on the gas after police ordered him to stop during a 
              random traffic check on the A2 southern motorway near Graz, Styria, 
              yesterday (Thurs), the Austrian Times reports.<br><br>He was eventually 
              stopped after a wild 30-kilometre chase in which he tried to force the 
              patrol car off the road, according to officers.<br><br>"He told us that 
              traffic checks were ‘uncommon’ in his homeland," one officer said today,
               adding that the driver revealed he was worried that it was all an 
              attempted robbery.<br><br>Two women aged 36 and 44 as well as a boy, 17,
               and a girl, 12, were also in the van.<br><br>The group was allowed to 
              continue their journey after police checked their IDs – and slapped the 
              driver with an undisclosed fine for speeding and endangering police 
              officers.</p>

              <h1>Romanian President praises benefit claimants in the west</h1>
              <p>Romanian
               president Traian Basescu has publicly thanked the tens of thousands of 
              his countrymen who claim benefits in the west instead of their own 
              country.<br><br>In an extraordinary TV broadcast the leader has paid 
              tribute to the two million Romanians who live and work abroad instead of
               signing up for benefits at home.<br><br>"Imagine if the two million 
              Romanians working in Britain, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, came to ask
               for unemployment benefits in Romania, when we already have deficits at 
              the unemployment funds," he said during the interview on the state-run 
              channel TVR.<br><br>"So to these people we have to thank them for what 
              they are doing for Romania," he added.<br><br>And he blamed the boom in 
              immigrant Romanian workers on lazy, pampered Westerners who prefer not 
              to work.<br><br>"In
               those countries, the social protection is at a level that makes it more
               comfortable to be unemployed  than it is to do hard, manual jobs.<br><br>"Romanians
               do that hard labour for them and to earn better and make more money 
              than they could at home," claimed President Basescu.<br><br>Romanians 
              workers flooded into Britain with other eastern European citizens after 
              joining the EU following the collapse of Communism.<br><br>When they 
              they arrive the immigrants are immediately entitled to child benefit, 
              Tax Credits and housing support.<br><br>After 12 months in Britain they 
              can receive generous income-related benefits like unemployment benefit.<br><br>At
               home in Romania, they would receive just 20 GBP a week for 12 months.</p>

              // --&gt;
              <p>After travelling from his training base in Patiala, 56kg 
                  class boxer Akhil Kumar entered to find his room in a filthy state - as 
                  so many have.</p>
              <p>Exasperated at a four hour wait to get to a room in such 
                  disrepair, Akhil sought solace in sleep, but was in for the rudest of 
                  shocks.</p>
              <p>"We reached (the Village) late in the afternoon to 
                  collect our accreditation cards. But when I sat down on my bed to take 
                  rest, it collapsed," Akhil told the Times of India newspaper.</p>
              <p>"I checked the bed and part of it had no plywood on it. 
                  It was disappointing after enduring a long journey.</p>
              <p>"The athletes are at least entitled to a decent place to 
                  rest. Even the toilets are not very clean. I have told our coach about 
                  this."</p>
              <p>Kumar's complaint was far from isolated.</p>
              <p>His teammate, the 81kg class boxer Dinesh Kumar, reported
                   on the state of his room in detail, confirming the unsightly state many
                   rooms were in even as Games president Mike Fennell made an inspection 
                  of the precinct.</p>
              <p>"There were stains in some corners of the room. The 
                  bathroom was filthy. Some of the fittings weren't working. The bed was 
                  dirty," said Dinesh.</p>
              <p>"After looking at the condition of the room, we went down
                   to the auditorium to complain to officials.</p>
              <p>"They then sent workers up with buckets and broomsticks 
                  to clean the rooms.</p>
              <p>"This is so annoying I can't describe it.</p>
              <p>"We were dying to stretch our backs and hit the bed but 
                  it was too dirty. So we were made to stand again for a few more hours 
                  before the clean-up."</p>

              <p>The 22 year-old graduate produced the unofficial “senior honours thesis” on

              <p>In the extraordinary sexual dossier, Miss Owen, from Connecticut, graphically 
                describes her lovers, how they met in bars and what they did after their 
                binge drinking sessions.</p>
              <p>Each of her 13 lovers are named and pictured – sometimes partially naked – 
                while intimate details are also revealed. She details their “pros” and 
                “cons” and ranks their sexual prowess out of 10 in coloured charts and an 
                “official f---” list.</p>
              <p>The brutally frank “kiss and tell” – submitted to the “Department of 
                Late-Night Entertainment in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a 
                Degree in Tempestuous Frolicking” – was originally meant as a joke when 
                emailed to three friends after she graduated in May.</p>
              <p>But it was subsequently leaked to the university’s 14,000 student population 
                before becoming a global viral hit.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It was the hot topic at <a href="http://www.duke.edu/"><strong>Duke,

                private academy with a predominantly white student population located in the 
                North Carolina town of Durham. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.chronicle.duke.edu/article/karen-owen-shatters-glass-ceiling"><strong>The 
                student newspaper ran an editorial </strong></a>earlier this week simply 
                headlined: "Karen Owen shatters the glass ceiling", in which they 
                condemn her stating: "She actually managed to demean the opposite sex 
                to the point where one must ask if the term 'weaker sex' shouldn’t be 
                replaced with 'freakier sex'." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://deadspin.com/5652280/the-full-duke-university-fuck-list-thesis-from-a-former-female-student/gallery/?skyline=true&amp;s=i"><strong>The 
                electronic “thesis”</strong></a>, compiled from her three years at 
                Duke, was then <a href="http://jezebel.com/5652114/college-girls-power-point-fuck-list-goes-viral-gallery"><strong>published 
                by several websites</strong></a> before going viral and becoming one of the most 
                searched terms on the internet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> It has <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39552862/ns/today-today_people/"><strong>made 
                national news</strong></a> in the United States and reopened the debate about 
                privacy on the internet. One publishing company is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/us/08duke.html?_r=1"><strong>reported 
                to be considering </strong></a>offering a book deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> Miss Owen is said to have been left devastated by the sex scandal and 
                expressed her “regret with all my heart”. She went to ground on Friday after 
                deleting all of her profiles on social networking sites. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> “Senior year and college in general often bring about certain situations that 
                result in the seeking of so-called ‘sex’,” she writes in the introduction. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> “Until now, no studies have succeeded in developing a methodology for 
                quantifying and ranking these so-called horizontal academics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> “'In this study, we used data from four years at Duke University to create 
                evaluation criteria for such encounters and applied these criteria to 
                evaluated subjects.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> She added: "The people that are named in it are the kinds of people that 
                everyone wants to be or be with. The top dogs, or whatever." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> She tells how she watched pornography with her lovers, exchanged explicit text 
                messages and had sex in dorms, SUV and BMW cars and even in the university 
                library during her final weeks of examination. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> Miss Owen ranks her lovers’ “raw score” by their “physical attractiveness, 
                (anatomy) size, talent, creativity, aggressiveness, entertainment, athletic 
                ability” while “bonus” points are given for other factors such as accents. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> “Points were deducted for rudeness or being Canadian”, she adds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> While she is full of praise for some she is vicious in her criticism of 
                others, including one unfortunate student of whom their encounter “was over 
                too quickly”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> She added: “(I have) got some fantastic stories for the grandkids.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> But on Thursday, after the presentation made international headlines, she 
                expressed her sorrow for the incident. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> "I regret it with all my heart," she told <a href="http://thenewsoftoday.com/the-karen-owen-list-of-duke-athletes-she-slept-with-goes-viral/3360/"><strong>The 
                News of Today website</strong></a>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> "I would never intentionally hurt the people that are mentioned on that." 
                Her family later declined to comment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> None of the men featured in the "thesis" would comment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> A University spokesman said officials were “reaching out to those who’ve been 
                affected by this incident” and said the wellbeing of their students was 
                their primary concern. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> He said students were being educated about the dangers of the internet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> "Our foremost concern is to provide for the well-being of our students, 
                and to respect their privacy," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> "We've been reaching out to those who've been affected by this incident 
                and will continue to support them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> "This is an unfortunate and highly visible reminder that anything you create 
                or send in digital form can find its way to the web, where the media have an 
                insatiable appetite for the outrageous and your privacy and reputation can 
                be shredded with a few clicks." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> The incident comes after the Duke lacrosse team was embroiled in a sex scandal 
                in 2006. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> Members were accused by a young black woman who falsely claimed she was 
                beaten, raped and subjected to racial abuse by three white men from Duke's 
                highly rated Blue Devils lacrosse team after being hired as a stripper for a 
                sports club party. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"> The athletes denied the allegations and a year later the charges were dropped 
                and the prosecutor disbarred. </span></p>
