              <h1>Cambodian 'jungle woman' flees back to wild</h1>
              <h2>Cambodia's "jungle woman", who spent 18 years living in a dense forest, has fled back to the wild after struggling to adapt to society.</h2>
              <p>Rochom P'ngieng, now 29 years old, first disappeared into thick hilly jungle in 1989 when she was a little girl. She was "discovered" in early 2007 and reunited with her family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So this individual lost in the jungle and lived all by herself when since 8/11 yrs old and she never met any other human beings for 18 yrs.....?</p>
              <p>Pictures attached.... </p>

              <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">The unfortunate sheep was spotted bleating for help more than 15 feet above the ground next to an telegraph pole.</p>

The schoolgirl said she couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the sheep sliding down the live wire.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">Her dad Geir Landsnes, 45, also watched the dramatic events unfold. He said Marita would never to go out without a camera again.</p>

He had got his horn stuck on the zip wire and as he got more agitated, was pulled down the hill on the wire he was attached to and ended more than up five metres above the ground.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; padding: 0px;">The German tourists were in the area because the Landsnes family, alongside the sheep farm, run a small vacation place on the Norwegian island.</p>

              <p>LARNACA, Cyprus - A five-year-old Cyprus boy was found dead in the family car, forgotten there for nearly eight hours by his doctor father while he carried out emergency surgery, police said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Police said they found the boy dead at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT) on Tuesday afternoon in the car parked outside a private clinic in the southern coastal town of Larnaca.</p>
              <p>According to the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) the police found the car locked, the boy was in the back seat and there was an empty water bottle next to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The father had planned to take the boy to nursery but on the way he received a call asking him to rush to the clinic hospital to conduct emergency surgery and headed there immediately.</p>
              <p>The alarm was only raised when the mother went to pick the boy up from the nursery and was told he never arrived.</p>
              <p>It was only then the father realised that he had not taken his son out of the car.</p>
              <p>Although media reported that the boy died of sunstroke due to temperatures soaring above 30 degrees Celsius (117 Fahrenheit), a post mortem as to the cause of death will be carried out Wednesday.</p>

              <p>Biologists Rony Garcia and Jose Moreira from the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) Jaguar Conservation Program say they use hidden cameras as a primary source for observing and tracking jaguars in Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve.</p>
              <p>But they also rely on Obsession for Men, a cologne known for its complex scent, to help lure then research and hopefully ultimately preserve jaguars in the Central American country.</p>
              <p>"The method we are using to study the jaguars here in Guatemala is a non-invasive method which is based on photographing the individuals by using camera traps," Moreira told Reuters Television.</p>
              <p>"It has been very useful using Obsession (for Men) to get the jaguars in front of these camera traps ... and that allows us to estimate with greater confidence the genders and the numbers that live in each studied site."</p>
              <p>The discovery that Obsession for Men acted as a magnet for jaguars was the result of an experiment by the WCS's Bronx Zoo in New York.</p>
              <p>The WCS was looking for ways to get cheetahs in front of camera traps, and, after several years of testing with different fragrances, found spraying the musky Obsession For Men near the heat-and-motion-sensitive cameras drew the cats for longer than other scents.</p>
              <p>They also tried out about 23 other fragrances but Obsession for Men kept the cats' attention for longest with Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps coming second.</p>
              <p>The practice made its way down to Guatemala, where Garcia and Moreira said they have been recording similar success in the wild since 2007, allowing them to track jaguars and even record their mating rituals.</p>
              <p>Garcia said the results will be invaluable to conservation efforts.</p>
              <p>"These camera traps help us to identify how many jaguars are living in this area ... (and) helps us to have control over the population and lets us say to the government, to the public, that Laguna del Tigre still deserves conservation," he said.</p>
              <p>The WCS said it tentatively plans to expand the use of the cologne in programs in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador in coming years.</p>

              <p><strong>While Brazil and Argentina seem to grab all the attention, the 
              field is as interesting as it is deep. Onion Sports points out the keys 
              for each national side.</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Ghana:</strong> Though not expected to make it to the 
              quarterfinals, they should win the Eukaryotic Protist trophy, given to 
              the team with malaria that advances the farthest</li>
              <li><strong>England:</strong> Known for inventing new ways to underperform; look 
              for England's players to lose their first World Cup match by forgetting 
              what time it starts and everyone going skydiving instead</li>
              <li><strong>North Korea:</strong> DPRK players could be tough to defend, as they 
              have nuclear devices strapped to their chests</li>
              <li><strong>Spain:</strong> If this talented team of handsome young playboys is 
              able to keep from sleeping with beautiful women long enough to play full
               90-minute matches, it should be considered a favorite</li>
              <li><strong>Portugal:</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo has a knack for always having his
               hair in just the right place at the right time.</li>
              <li><strong>United States:</strong> Full disclosure—the government mandates we 
              include an entry for the United States in a list like this</li>
              <li><strong>France:</strong> Proof that basing an offense around being standoffish
               and unappealing can work if you really put your heart into it</li>
              <li><strong>South Africa:</strong> Team has the potential to go very far, as they 
              know which parts of the field to avoid if you don't want to get stabbed 
              to death</li>
