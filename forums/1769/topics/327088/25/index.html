              <p><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110207-262299.html">Chilli sauce sparks off 17-man brawl</a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - A woman in her 20s has been accused of starting a 17-man brawl after flinging chilli at a stall-owner.</p>
              <p>The incident took place at a food outlet beside Boon Lay MRT station 
              on Feb 6, the fourth day of Chinese New Year, at approximately 10.30pm.</p>
              <p>Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported that the woman had taken 
              some chilli from a food stall after ordering a dish from another nearby 
              stall.</p>
              <p>The stall-owner, who was having dinner nearby, then asked her why she did not ask for permission to take the chilli.</p>
              <p>This enraged the woman, who flung the chilli at the stall-owner while shouting that the stall-owner could have the chilli back.</p>
              <p>A quarrel ensued between the woman and the stall-owner, which quickly
               spread as the stall-owner's companions entered the quarrel, together 
              with the woman's boyfriend.</p>
              <p><strong>Flung chairs</strong></p>
              <p>The quarrel degenerated into a fight after the stall-owner allegedly pushed the woman's head with her hands.</p>
              <p>The woman's boyfriend then retaliated, causing four other men to beat
               him. One man used a chair as a weapon. The boyfriend's nose was injured
               and bled profusely.</p>
              <p>Seeing that her boyfriend was being beaten, the woman then poured a bowl of hot soup over the stall-owner's head.</p>
              <p><strong>11 men shouting</strong></p>
              <p>At this point of time, 11 men appeared and started shouting 
              aggressively. Witnesses alleged that they were summoned by the woman for
               a gang-fight.</p>
              <p>The woman's boyfriend was sent to the hospital for treatment. </p>
              <p><strong>Impolite to take other stall's chilli</strong></p>
              <p>When interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao, the 
              38-year-old stall-owner complained that the woman had taken chilli from 
              his stall while ordering food from another stall.</p>
              <p>He also said that all he wanted to do was remind the woman that it 
              was only polite to ask for permission and did not expect it to 
              degenerate into a fight.</p>
              <p>He requested that the woman and her boyfriend apologise to him.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE - A woman in her 20s has been accused of starting a 17-man brawl after flinging chilli at a stall-owner.</p>
              <p>The incident took place at a food outlet beside Boon Lay MRT station on Feb 6, the fourth day of Chinese New Year, at approximately 10.30pm.</p>
              <p>Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported that the woman had taken some chilli from a food stall after ordering a dish from another nearby stall.</p>
              <p>The stall-owner, who was having dinner nearby, then asked her why she did not ask for permission to take the chilli.</p>
              <p>This enraged the woman, who flung the chilli at the stall-owner while shouting that the stall-owner could have the chilli back.</p>
              <p>A quarrel ensued between the woman and the stall-owner, which quickly spread as the stall-owner's companions entered the quarrel, together with the woman's boyfriend.</p>
              <p><strong>Flung chairs</strong></p>
              <p>The quarrel degenerated into a fight after the stall-owner allegedly pushed the woman's head with her hands.</p>
              <p>The woman's boyfriend then retaliated, causing four other men to beat him. One man used a chair as a weapon. The boyfriend's nose was injured and bled profusely.</p>
              <p>Seeing that her boyfriend was being beaten, the woman then poured a bowl of hot soup over the stall-owner's head.</p>
              <p><strong>11 men shouting</strong></p>
              <p>At this point of time, 11 men appeared and started shouting aggressively. Witnesses alleged that they were summoned by the woman for a gang-fight.</p>
              <p>The woman's boyfriend was sent to the hospital for treatment. </p>
              <p><strong>Impolite to take other stall's chilli</strong></p>
              <p>When interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao, the 38-year-old stall-owner complained that the woman had taken chilli from his stall while ordering food from another stall.</p>
              <p>He also said that all he wanted to do was remind the woman that it was only polite to ask for permission and did not expect it to degenerate into a fight.</p>
              <p>He requested that the woman and her boyfriend apologise to him.</p>
