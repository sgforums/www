              <h1>Geisha facial, the 'latest beauty secret' of Victoria Beckham, brought to the masses</h1>
              <p><br><span class="storyby">By Melissa Whitworth</span></p>
              <div style="float: left;"><span class="filed">Last Updated: <span style="color: #000;">8:01pm BST</span> 16/10/2008</span></div>
              <p class="story2"> </p>
              <p class="story2">New York's women take their beauty seriously. Their efforts to stop the hands of time and make the most of their looks are awe-inspiring, with electrolysis, teeth whitening, lymphatic massage, blow dries, manicures, pedicures, brow shaping, facials, and body scrubs all featuring regularly in their regimes. They've even made Botox and laser peels seem like the norm.</p>
              <p class="story2">So it comes as no surprise that they have been quick to embrace the latest magic, beauty enhancing ingredient: nightingale droppings.</p>
              <p class="story2">Japanese geishas, who are renowned for their clear, porcelain-like complexions, have used the bird excrement for centuries as a cleanser - but now a spa in New York has brought it to the masses.</p>
              <p class="story2">And the news that Victoria Beckham - who is said to have struggled with acne since her teens - reportedly uses the secret ingredient has done the popularity of the bizarre practice no harm.</p>
              <p>According to Closer magazine, when Posh, 34, was in Japan recently, she admired the clarity of the women's skin and learnt that it was thanks to the droppings, which contain an enzyme called guanine that leaves the skin clean, smooth and supple.</p>
              <p class="story2">So she tried it for herself, and a friend told the magazine that "for the first time in years, she doesn't have to wear foundation to hide blemishes."</p>
              <p class="story2">In New York, Shizuka Bernstein has been offering the "geisha facial", which costs about £100, at her spa since January. She counts television news reporters, Broadway stars and supermodel Karolina Kurkova as converts.</p>
              <p class="story2">Throwing scepticism - and squeamishness - to the wind, I booked an appointment with Shizuka to see for myself. After a detailed explanation of the benefits of Japanese beauty ingredients, Shizuka cleaned my face with two cleansers - one clay and the other containing green tea, ground pearls, sake and Mount Fuji water, bottled at the source.</p>
              <p class="story2">Following that, she mixed the nightingale droppings - which are powdered and sterilised using UV light - with rice bran and water to make a paste.</p>
              <p class="story2">The concoction smelt pungent, but medicinal rather than unpleasant. She applied the droppings, and then massaged them into my face for five minutes. It was then wached off and a collagen mask was applied before she massaged me again with camellia (another Japanese ingredient, known for its non-clogging hydrating properties) and lavender oils.</p>
              <p class="story2">Shizuka, who is 50 but looks at least 15 years younger, tells me that the nightingales are farmed in Japan and fed only organic seeds. Their droppings are then scraped from the cages and sterilised.</p>
              <p class="story2">"My mother used to tell me stories when I was a little about the geishas and Kabuki actors in the 18th century who wore lead-based face paint," Tokyo-born Shizuka says.</p>
              <p class="story2">"The make-up was so heavy and difficult to remove that a lot of them became very sick or even died from lead poisoning. Somehow, I don't know how, they discovered that nightingale droppings had an enormous cleansing effect. They must have tried everything."</p>
              <p class="story2">In Japan the nightingale has always been a symbol of great beauty. "It's a really pretty little bird," she says. "They are very easy to keep and they are songbirds which makes them popular pets in Japan and across Asia."</p>
              <p class="story2">The excrement produces the same results as a light acid peel, but it causes none of the redness or the need for recovery time. There's no burning sensation and no man-made chemicals. Because of this, the facial can be done on the day of a red-carpet appearance or an important party, she explains. It's also safe for pregnant women to use.</p>
              <p class="story2">Following my experience, I have to admit that my skin looks extraordinarily healthy and bright. My squeamishness was banished after smelling the inoffensive powder and realising that it had been finely milled, cleaned and sterilised. There's really nothing to feel queasy about, and - as one of my friends was wondering - absolutely no chance of catching avian flu.</p>

              <h1>CPR study suggests 'Stayin Alive' lives up to name</h1>
              <p class="hn-byline">By  LINDSEY TANNER  –  <span class="hn-date">3 days ago</span></p>
              <p>CHICAGO (AP) — "Stayin' Alive" might be more true to its name than
              the Bee Gees ever could have guessed: At 103 beats per minute, the old
              disco song has almost the perfect rhythm to help jump-start a stopped
              heart.</p>
              <p>And in a small but intriguing study from the University of
              Illinois medical school, doctors and students maintained close to the
              ideal number of chest compressions doing CPR while listening to the
              catchy, sung-in-falsetto tune from the 1977 movie "Saturday Night
              Fever."</p>
              <p>The American Heart Association recommends 100 chest
              compressions per minute, far more than most people realize, study
              author Dr. David Matlock of the school's Peoria, Ill., campus said
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>And while CPR can triple cardiac arrest survival rates
              when properly performed, many people hesitate to do it because they're
              not sure about keeping the proper rhythm, Matlock said.</p>
              <p>He found that "Stayin' Alive," which has a way of getting stuck in your head anyway, can help with that.</p>
              <p>His
              study involved 15 students and doctors and had two parts. First they
              did CPR on mannequins while listening to the song on iPods. They were
              asked to time chest compressions with the song's beat.</p>
              <p>Five weeks later, they did the same drill without the music but were told to think of the song while doing compressions.</p>
              <p>The
              average number of compressions the first time was 109 per minute; the
              second time it was 113. That's more than recommended, but Matlock said
              that when it comes to trying to revive a stopped heart, a few extra
              compressions per minute is better than too few.</p>
              <p>"It drove them and motivated them to keep up the rate, which is the most important thing," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              study showed the song helped people who already know how to do CPR, and
              the results were promising enough to warrant larger, more definitive
              studies with real patients or untrained people, Matlock said.</p>
              <p>He plans to present his findings at an American College of Emergency Physicians meeting in Chicago this month.</p>
              <p>It
              turns out the American Heart Association has been using the song as a
              training tip for CPR instructors for about two years. They learned of
              it from a physician "who sort of hit upon this as a training tool,"
              said association spokesman Dr. Vinay Nadkarni of the University of
              Pennsylvania.</p>
              <p>He said he was not aware of any previous studies that tested the song.</p>
              <p>But
              Nadkarni said he has seen "Stayin' Alive" work wonders in classes where
              students were having trouble keeping the right beat while practicing on
              mannequins. When he turned on the song, "all of a sudden, within just a
              few seconds, they get it right on the dot."</p>
              <p>"I don't know how the
              Bee Gees knew this," Nadkarni said. "They probably didn't. But they
              just hit upon this natural rhythm that was very catchy, very popular,
              that helps us do the right thing."</p>
              <p>Dr. Matthew Gilbert, a
              28-year-old medical resident, was among participants in the University
              of Illinois study this past spring. Since then, he said, he has revived
              real patients by keeping the song in his head while doing CPR.</p>
              <p>Gilbert said he was surprised the song worked as well as it did.</p>
              <p>"I
              was a little worried because I've been told that I have a complete lack
              of rhythm," he said. Also, Gilbert said he's not really a disco fan.</p>
              <p>He does happen to like a certain Queen song with a similar beat.</p>
              <p>"I heard a rumor that 'Another One Bites the Dust' works also, but it didn't seem quite as appropriate," Gilbert said.</p>

              <p>A villager who found out about the incident alerted the victim's mother to the rapes.</p>
              <p>
              
              The victim was confirmed to have been raped after an examination at the Sibu Hospital.</p>
              <p>She was alone at the longhouse when the alleged rapes took place.</p>
              <p>Her mother was farming nearby while a younger brother was at school.</p>
              <p>Her father and another brother are working in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

              <p>Teenager Sam Holt's behaviour would leave most parents in despair - drinking, smoking, taking drugs and having sex.</p>
              <p>But the 13-year-old's mother thinks it is 'sweet' rather than shocking.</p>
              <p>Tracy Holt even rewards her daughter with cigarettes on the rare occasions when she does behave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Miss Holt, 43, knows Sam drinks but is just relieved that it's not more than a couple of cans of lager a night.</p>
              <p>And she decided not to get angry about her daughter losing her virginity at 12, instead insisting that Sam uses contraception.</p>
              <p>Miss
                      Holt, a jobless single mother with two other adult children, told
                      Closer magazine: 'I don't see the point in punishing her.</p>
              <p>'If I
                      ground her, I'm just punishing myself because I have to put up with her
                      in the house. Instead, I reward her good behaviour by giving her
                      cigarettes. If she's bad, she goes without.</p>
              <p>'She's a little comedian. I let her get away with a lot of cheek. It's sweet.'</p>
              <p>Giving out cigarettes as a reward 'works', she insisted.</p>
              <p>Miss Holt said: 'There are a lot worse things she could be doing.</p>
              <p>'We've all got to die sometime. I haven't got cancer from smoking so she'll probably be all right anyway.'</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Sam 'only drinks a couple of cans a night'</p>
              </div>
              <p>Miss
                      Holt explained away her daughter's under-age sex. 'I didn't punish
                      her,' she said. 'It wasn't a one-night stand. She had been dating the
                      guy for a couple of weeks.</p>
              <p>'I took her to the doctor's the next day to get her on the Pill. I've told her to use condoms as <span id="__firefox-findbar-search-id" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: #ffffff; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;">well</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span>'</p>
              <p>Sam
                      admits having had four sexual partners in less than a year but said: 'I
                      only sleep with boyfriends. I worry about getting pregnant because I
                      don't want kids until I'm married so I always use condoms.'</p>
              <p>The teenager claims being given cigarettes for her 15-a-day habit has helped her behaviour.</p>
              <p>Sam said: 'If Mum tells me to tidy my room, I ignore her but if she offers me a fag, I do it.'</p>
              <p>Miss
                      Holt, who smokes 20 a day, also appears relaxed about her daughter's
                      other pastimes. She said: 'Sam often hangs out with her mates on the
                      streets and they'll drink lager and smoke pot.</p>
              <p>'I think she only drinks a couple of cans a night, so I'm lucky she isn't a proper drunk.</p>
              <p>'She smokes a joint every now and then. I don't think she's tried anything harder.'</p>
              <p>Sam's record at school would also concern most parents. She has been excluded for bad behaviour more than 40 times.</p>
              <p>Miss
                      Holt believes her daughter began to go off the rails after her partner
                      left the family home in Gosport, Hampshire, three years ago.</p>
              <p>'Sam got suspended for the first time after she climbed on to the school roof,' she said.</p>
              <p>'I shouted at her and then explained she shouldn't climb on roofs because she could fall off. I didn't know what else to do.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recalling the moment Sam blurted out that she had lost her
                      virginity when she was just 12, Miss Holt said: 'I thought it was a
                      joke, so I laughed. I was disappointed. No mother wants to know her
                      12-year-old is having sex but I'm glad she told me. I didn't show I was
                      angry and just kept it to myself.'</p>
              <p>Miss Holt blames teachers at
                      Sam's former school for being 'too soft'. She said: 'Now she is at a
                      special school where there are fewer kids in each class.</p>
              <p>'Hopefully these teachers will be stricter and she will finally get the discipline that's needed.'</p>

              <p><strong>Woman jailed after 'killing' virtual husband</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By MARI YAMAGUCHI,Associated Press Writer <cite class="auth">AP - <span><strong>Friday, October 24</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">TOKYO - A 43-year-old player in a virtual game world became so angry about her sudden divorce from her online husband that she logged on with his password and killed his digital persona, police said.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">The woman, who has been jailed on suspicion of illegally accessing a computer and manipulating electronic data, used his ID and password to log onto the popular interactive game "Maple Story" to carry out the virtual murder in May, a police official in the northern city of Sapporo said Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of department policy.</div>
              <p>"I was suddenly divorced, without a word of warning. That made me so angry," the official quoted her as telling investigators and admitting the allegations.</p>
              <p>The woman, a piano teacher, had not plotted any revenge in the real world, the official said.</p>
              <p>She has not yet been formally charged. If convicted, she could face up to five years in prison or a fine up to US$5,000.</p>
              <p>Players in "Maple Story" create and manipulate digital images called "avatars" that represent themselves, while engaging in relationships, social activities and fighting monsters and other obstacles.</p>
              <p>In virtual worlds, players often abandon their inhibitions, engaging in activity online that they would never do in the real world. For instance, sex with strangers is a common activity.</p>
              <p>The woman used login information she got from the 33-year-old office worker when their characters were happily married to kill the character. The man complained to police when he discovered that his online avatar was dead.</p>
              <p>The woman was arrested Wednesday and taken 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) from her home in southern Miyazaki to be detained in Sapporo, where the man lives, the official said.</p>
              <p>The police official said he did not know if she was married in the real world.</p>
              <p>Bad online behavior is usually handled within the rules set up by online worlds, which can ban miscreants or take away their virtual possessions.</p>
              <p>In recent years, misbehavior in the virtual world has in some cases had consequences in reality.</p>
              <p>In August, a woman was charged in the U.S. state of Delaware with plotting the real-life abduction of a boyfriend she met through the virtual reality Web site "Second Life."</p>
              <p>In Tokyo, a 16-year-old boy was charged with stealing the ID and password from a fellow player of an online game in order to swindle virtual currency worth US$360,000.</p>
