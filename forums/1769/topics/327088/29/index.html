              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mystery cat takes regular bus to the shops<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/04_01/TravelingCatNTI_468x376.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="376"></p>
              <p>Bus drivers have nicknamed a white cat Macavity after it has started using the No 331 several mornings a week.</p>
              <p>The feline, which has a purple collar, gets onto the busy Walsall to Wolverhampton bus at the same stop most mornings - he then jumps off at the next stop 400m down the road, near a fish and chip shop.</p>
              <div id="ArtContentImgBodyC" style="width: 470px;">
              <p>The cat, nicknamed Macavity, has one blue eye and one green eye</p>
              </div>
              <p>The cat was nicknamed Macavity after the mystery cat in T.S Elliot's poem. He gets on the bus in front of a row of 1950s semi-detached houses and jumps off at a row of shops down the road which include a fish and chip shop.</p>
              <p>Driver Bill Khunkhun, 49, who first saw the cat jumping from the bus in January, said: "It is really odd, the first time I saw the cat jumping off the bus with a group of passengers. I hadn't seen it get on which was a bit confusing.</p>
              <p>"The next day I pulled up on Churchill Road to let a couple of passengers on. As soon as I opened the doors the cat ran towards the bus, jumped on and ran under one of the seats, I don't think any of the passengers noticed.</p>
              <p>"Because I had seen it jump off the day before I carried on driving and sure enough when I stopped just down the road he jumped off - I don't know why he would catch the bus but he seems to like it. I told some of the other drivers on this route and they have seen him too."</p>
              <p>Since January, when the cat first caught the bus he has done it two or three times a week and always gets on and off at the same stops.</p>
              <p>Passenger, Paul Brennan, 19, who catches the 331 to work, said: "I first noticed the cat a few weeks ago. At first I thought it had been accompanied by its owner but after the first stop it became quite clear he was on his own.</p>
              <p>"He sat at the front of the bus, waited patiently for the next stop and then got off. It was was quite strange at first but now it just seems normal. I suppose he is the perfect passenger really - he sits quietly, minds his own business and then gets off."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Great Scott! China ban films and TV shows featuring time travel (just in case anyone wants to rewrite history)<br></span></strong></p>
              <p>Shows that feature time travel have been effectively banned by the Chinese government after it issued new rules for TV and film directors.</p>
              <p>In the latest crackdown on dissent, authorities want its citizens to uphold the country's values and not promote anything that would re-write history.</p>
              <p>Chinese censors issued guidance to the film and television industry, which producers would be unwise to ignore if they want to stay on air.</p>
              <p>Time travel is on the list of activities that have been banned for scriptwriters and directors since March 31 that includes reincarnation and feudal superstitions.</p>
              <p>The guidance is for makers of TV programmes from the State Administration of Radio Film and Television (SARFT) that would make films like Back to the Future and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure contraband material.</p>
              <p>Outlining the reason for it's decision to ban time travel, the Chinese government said: 'Producers and writers are treating serious history in a frivolous way, which should by no means be encouraged anymore.'</p>
              <div class="art-insert news">

              <p>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure<br>Back to the Future<br>The Time Traveller’s Wife<br>12 monkeys<br>All the Star Trek films<br>All the Terminator films<br>Planet of the Apes<br>The Butterfly Effect<br>Austin Powers<br>A Christmas Carol</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>It added that the ban applies to films that contain 'fantasy, time-travel, random compilations of mythical stories, bizarre plots, absurd techniques, even propagating feudal superstitions, fatalism and reincarnation, ambiguous moral lessons, and even a lack of positive thinking.'</p>
              <p>'The government says TV dramas shouldn't have characters that travel back in time and rewrite history,' said CNN's Eunice Yoon.</p>
              <p>'They also say that myth, superstitions and reincarnation are all questionable.'</p>
              <p>It also means that TV series like Dr Who, Star Trek and the X-Files are now banned along with the film Terminator.</p>
              <p>The new ruling comes as the Communist party (CPC) prepares for its 90th anniversary in power, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
              <p>SARFT issued the guidance telling film makers they must  'Follow the central spirit of the CPC to celebrate its 90th anniversary on television.</p>
              <p>'All levels should actively prepare to launch vivid reproductions of the Chinese revolution, the nation’s construction and its reform and opening up.'</p>
              <p>The film and television arm of the government reports directly to China's cabinet, the State Council.</p>
              <p>It has the power to pull the plug on any Chinese film or television series whenever and wherever it wishes.</p>
