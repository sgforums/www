This picture is taken by a witness. Picture: NEW STRAITS TIMES<br>The woman, a mother of five, alleged that in the incident that took place two days ago, her husband beat and kicked her when they bumped into each other in Bukit Chedang.<br><br>She claimed that a passing police car stopped but the two policemen simply watched as her husband assaulted her, reported the New Straits Times.<br><br>She said: 'None of them dared to intervene. I pleaded with them to arrest him, but they just stood there.<br><br>'They handcuffed him only after I snapped their pictures with my handphone and threatened to take the matter to their superiors.'<br><br>The woman claimed the abuse has been going on for years. She alleged she was constantly beaten and tortured with hot metal rods by her husband.<br><br>Finally, she plucked up courage and obtained an interim protection order from a magistrate's court against him this month. But even that allegedly did not stop him.<br><br>Within days of getting the protection order, she was assaulted in front of the two policemen.<br><br>The woman, from Taman Permai, claimed that her repeated complaints to the police have fallen on deaf ears because her husband was a former policeman.<br><br>She told Berita Harian Malaysia that he said that all the policemen in the area were his good friends and no one would arrest him<br><br>'TOSSED ASIDE'<br><br>She alleged: 'The police reports I made were just tossed aside and no action was taken. From the reports I made, complete with proof of facial and body injuries, he was remanded only twice. And he was then released on police bail.'<br><br>She alleged that he even tried to harm her by cutting the brake lines of a car.<br><br>She said her 48-year-old husband was arrested recently after she threatened to take the matter to the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman.<br><br>Despite having burn marks and bruises on her body, medical reports and witnesses willing to testify on her behalf, she claimed her husband was never charged.<br><br>He is now under remand but she is afraid that he might be released again.<br><br>'He even beat up my daughters when they tried to protect me when he assaulted me,' she claimed.<br><br>'The only ones who seem to be paying attention are the doctors at the hospital who treat me every time I get beaten up.<br><br>'In fact, they (the doctors) are the ones who told me to get help from the media. They have seen this happening to me too many times.'<br><br>She said there were times when she came close to losing the will to carry on, but hung on for the sake of her children.<br><br>Currently living in a wooden hut with her daughters, she is also finding it tough to make ends meet.<br><br>She runs an eatery and business had suffered after the only access road was cut off by a development project.<br><br>'We try to get by with whatever little I can make. It gets even harder now with Hari Raya coming. I feel so sorry for my children. They do not deserve this kind of life.'<br><br>She claimed she had approached leaders and elected representatives before, but none of them helped her.<br><br>She added that she had also sought help from the Welfare Department but claimed that she was only given some rice two months ago.<br><br>She hopes that officials from the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry will look into her problems and protect her family.<br></div>
