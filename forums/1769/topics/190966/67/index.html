Most of these so-called creativity classes just teach "creativity" using fixed tools or forumlae. Its like the "entreprenuership" programmes where everyone ends up setting up a store to sell off the shelf products. Might as well call it "pasar malam"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
