            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by choco B:</div><div class="quote_body">I think there are very few good reasons to have children .  A couple of valid ones to me are -  because you love children and you are ready for them.  When you've got the capacity to love them and the capacity to bring them up right, that's when you're ready.  Any other reason doesn't really hold water IMO.<br><br>Personally I've never liked kids and they've never been a To Do item in my life.  On a deeper level I'm deathly scared of having kids and its implications -  having to take on massive responsibility for yourself and dependents, a massive change in lifestyle, etc ..... it's just mind boggling.  I don't wanna give up the right to be selfish and a child yet.<br><br>But I have reconciled that I'll have children, but strictly, in my own time.  I guess I'll do ok as a mom.  I view it as a long-term project , like work <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I need to sit back and put some impersonal distance between me and motherhood, so that I won't be crippled by fear and doubt.</div></blockquote>choco, that's a really steady-pom-pi-pi way of viewing eventual motherhood.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I've never heard it expressed in a better way.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>"When you've got the capacity to love them and the capacity to bring them up right, that's when you're ready."  This is so true and so is your later phrase about giving up the right to be selfish when one wants to be a parent.<br><br>I think a lot of couples take parenthood as a 'natural progression' without considering if they're really ready for it or not.  Best to have a child when you're really ready instead of because your husband or parents or parents-in-law or grandparents are expecting a baby from you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Ego centric people cant handle not being number 1 lol and  sometimes you forget that the other person needs love just as much as the child u are pouring love into.<br><br>My only advice is that think just as hard about how you feel when you are old and can not have children (lol men have a bit longer time), as you are coming up with reasons not to have a child, as u might find yourself later in life you regret not having a family of your own... because everything is just too hard now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If you are worried about who will look after the child... you should be able to talk to your partner and split the responsibility... lol or who ever wants the child more   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  (guys dont fall in this trap, lesson learnt <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>

Humms.<br><br>I have a friend with a daughter abt 7. She leads a very full life still pursuing her hobby of mountaineering, going alpine climbing and all. When she treks, she will bring her daughter with her whenever she can and the little girl is hardy and tough when she goes on treks with us. Her duaghter is close to her.. and u know why she loves her mummy? Cos unlike other kids mummy... (in her words)... her mummy "brings her camping and dirty nevermind. " Heehee.<br><br>Quality of life compromised? I think it is really a choice of lifestyle that you pursue... and if you think your child cannot share that lifestyle that you love so much.</div>
