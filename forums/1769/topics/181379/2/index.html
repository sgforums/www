            <div class='col-md body'>Very hard to reply when you reply under what I say leh.<br><br><strong>ppl don't just stay put in Singapore, i think the future gen will be flying all over the place, so don't hv to be too wory..where there is a grass there is way (translate from hokkien) . </strong><br><br>Don't need to wait for the future gen. Our current gen is already flying out of the country. If my SO is not bonded, I would think we would have left as well. Anyway, I don't really like the environment here for kids.<br><br><strong>umm sacrifice...err i think really depend on how u see kids, if hv kids is cos its not wat u want then its a sacrifice...err i will say its just some adjustment to suit changes in life...its like someone who found out he/she has high cholesterol, need to change eating style for the good of himself...bad example??<br><br>recently i came across one article, saying if only if don't hv kids i can do this and that...can't rem the content liao...maybe if someone has that, can put it here....<br><br>u must hv the kids then u can really feel for yourself the joy and gladness for the decision to hv them....the joy of bringing them up is really worth the adj in lifestyle...actually only the first few yrs u are more tied down...when they are really...there are also many things like going for sports etc with them...but of course not pubbing life lah.... </strong><br><br>That's the thing. You answered it for me. I don't want to have kids if possible. I don't like kids. I don't even like playing with them. Looking at how my nieces and nephews behave is enough to put anyone off having kids! (They scared my SO as well)<br><br>Maybe when I have a kid then I may see it from a different point of view that they are a blessing and joy because right now I see them as a pain in the neck. Plus there is always the issue of who is going to look after them. Maid? No Way! Parents or Parents-in-laws. No too especially since they will be spoilt rotten which basically boils down to having to leave my job to look after the kid which is a huge opportunity lost especially in income, which translate into sacrifices on your standard of living etc.<br><br><strong>take it a challenge bah....actually if parents maintain close bonding and teaching values from young, there are still many good/well behave kids around..maybe these we don't see cos they don't frequent eg shopping etc all the time.....i m not saying they are studying all the time hor....just that they could be not loud hence we don't notice... </strong><br><br>I would say that my cousins are strict with their kids and they still turn out like monkeys so I think it's more than close bonding and teaching values.<br><br><strong><br>actually rats race also partially contributed by parents....if u get to know some u will know....so its like they say its us, we say its them (MOE) contributing...well....well....<br><br>then again, parents if willing to put in some efforts, kids can be relief of some rat race stress...studying is the key but not everything.... </strong><br><br>The thing is that parents are putting in the effort which results in more stress and it's really a no win situation. You don't push them they lag far behind everyone. Of course there will be play and all but it's something we will continue to see</div>
