Its like a special something made by and shared between you and your SO. it also represents another commitment, perhaps a higher level of love between you and your SO </div></blockquote>If you know enough married people, you might realise that :<br><br>- some couples have kids as a desperate measure because their relationship is failing and they have this delusion that having kids would solve their marital problems and 'bring them closer';<br><br>- other couples get along fine but start arguing AFTER the kids come along because they cannot agree on parental issues and they have totally different ideas on how to bring up the children; and<br><br>- couples without kids can actually end up much much closer to each other than those who have children, simply because their focus is always on each other, no other distractions, and so the relationship that develops may become very intense.  Perfect example - the deep relationship between the recently-deceased minister (alamak!!  suddenly forgot his name!  Starts with a 'B'...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) and his wife.<br><br>Therefore, it is a highly romanticised notion that having children represents "a higher level of love between you and your SO".  Don't forget, there are still other couples for whom having children just meant one of those, "Oops!  Honey, I forgot the condoms!"  situation!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Mind you, I don't particularly like BABIES, so I don't like kids simply because they get to be babies.<br><br>I like kids when they are about 3-5 (abt the mental age of my kids now), filled with wonder at the world.

Discovering and building their own value systems as they go through a lot of pressure, and cynicism.<br><br>Dunno leh. I like kids. Being with kids make me feel hope. Having kids of my own will give me hope.

Yes it's true, life before and after kids is very different. There have been times when I think about the "what if I didn't have kids..." but when I look at my kids, this huge wave of love just washes over me.<br><br>As newly weds, hubby and I had such a wonderful time assuming our new roles. We had such a blast and life was wonderful. The day I found out I was pregnant, I was so sad. Sad that life as I knew it was going to change. But you know what? I'm glad it did. Even though being a parent is tough, I love my kids.<br><br>I guess it's only normal to see things as cut and dry about having kids, bringing them up, etc but when you actually see your child's face for the first time, touch/hold/love him/her, I guarantee you'll experience the entire gamut of emotions.

They lie in bed, pining for their children and sometimes, the children do turn up on the rare occasion, sometimes, never and it seems as if they have all disowned their parents and no longer want to have anything more to do with them.<br><br>Of course, there are those who are filial and take care of their elderly parents well.  Those are the filial ones.<br><br>My point is, don't assume that having children is an automatic 'insurance' for a good life in your old age.  It is no longer so.  The cost of healthcare, and the basic cost of living, coupled with the steadily decreasing disposable income and definitely, the smaller buying power of our dollar, would mean that it WILL be a burden to take care of your own family, your house loans, car loans, etc etc AND your elderly parents' healthcare costs, bills, etc.<br><br>I think when we have children, have the foresight to plan for your own retirement as well and not plan to just lean on them to provide for everything because it shall be a tremendous burden for them to bear and not very fair on them as well.  This is no longer the era where one sole breadwinner can support his elderly parents and his own household - I think up to the '80's, that was still possible but now, it'll just turn people into human beasts of burden.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>I noticed all your discussions about family and marriage are always so negative and pestimistic.
