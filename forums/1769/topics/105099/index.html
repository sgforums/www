            <div class='col-md body'>The Board of Directors of China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd (the Â“CompanyÂ”)<br>wishes to announce that the Company has suffered significant losses from speculative oil<br>derivative trading. As at 29 November 2004, the Company estimates that the total cumulative<br>losses (both realised and unrealised) incurred by the Company is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: red;">approximately US$550 million. </span></strong></span><br><br>To address the debt that has arisen from the CompanyÂ’s trading losses, the Company will be<br>proposing a scheme of arrangement with its creditors for the settlement of all existing debts and<br>liabilities.<br><br>Accordingly, the Company has, on 29 November 2004, applied for and and obtained, an order<br>from the High Court of Singapore (the Â“CourtÂ”) pursuant to Section 210 of the Companies Act of<br>Singapore for the Court to fix a date for the hearing of an application by the Company to convene<br>a meeting of its creditors for the purpose of considering and if thought fit, approving with or<br>without modification a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between the Company and<br>its creditors.<br><br>Background to Losses From Derivative Trading<br><br>The Company commenced trading in oil derivatives on its own account from 2003. Whilst part of<br>the derivative trading was for hedging purposes, the Company also engaged in speculative<br>derivative trading.<br><br>In October 2004, international oil prices rose steeply leading to the Company having to face<br>significant margin calls on its open derivative positions. The Company was unable to meet some<br>of the margin calls arising from its speculative derivative trades, resulting in the Company being<br>forced to close the positions with some of the counter-parties. From 26 October 2004 to date, the<br>accumulated losses from these closed positions amounts to approximately US$390 million. The<br>Company is in the process of closing the remaining outstanding positions and estimates the losses<br>from the closure of these positions to be approximately US$160 million.<br><br>Action Taken by The Company<br><br>Since the advent of the above liquidity issues by the Company, the Company has taken the<br>following steps:<br><br>1. ShareholderÂ’s Loan from China Aviation Oil Holdings Company (Â“CAOHCÂ”)<br>The Company has requested, and CAOHC granted to the Company, a shareholderÂ’s loan<br>of approximately US$100 million for the Company to meet its liquidity requirements.<br>The loan has been fully disbursed and applied to meet the margin calls and to satisfy part<br>of the realised losses suffered by the Company.<br><br>2. Immediate termination of the CompanyÂ’s speculative oil derivative trading activities<br>To check the mounting losses suffered by the Company from the increasing oil prices, the<br>Company has halted all its speculative oil derivative trading activities with the exception<br>of the closing at the remaining open positions.<br><br>3. Suspension of duties of Mr Chen Jiulin<br>The Board of Directors further wishes to announce the suspension of duties of Mr Chen<br>Jiulin, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, with immediate effect pending the<br>release of the report of the Special Investigation refered to below.<br><br>4. Special Investigation<br>The Exchange, pursuant to Rule 704(12) of the Listing Manual, has required the<br>Company to instruct PricewaterhouseCoopers as special investigative accountant to<br>review and investigate the CompanyÂ’s affairs relating to the incurrence of the loss and its<br>surrounding circumstance and report its findings to the Exchange (Â“Special<br>InvestigationÂ”).<br>Pending the release of the Special Investigation report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the<br>Company believes it is inappropriate to make any further comments on the circumstances<br>relating to the incurrence of the derivative trading losses by the Company.<br><br>5. Appointment of a Special Task Force<br>The Board of Directors, with the support of CAOHC, has appointed a special task force<br>(Â“Special Task ForceÂ”) led by Ms Gu Yanfei, General Manager, Investment Department<br>of CAOHC and director of the Company, with the authority of the Board to lead the<br>restructuring, investigation and rehabilitation process as well as to supervise the day-today<br>operations of the Company on its behalf. The Special Task Force shall continue to<br>manage the critical affairs of the Company until further announcement.<br><strong>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.</strong><br>Suspension of trading in the CompanyÂ’s shares<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the meantime, the Directors deem it necessary to request for suspension of trading in the<br>Company's shares until a satisfactory arrangement has been agreed with the creditors of the<br>Company or a scheme of arrangement of the CompanyÂ’s debts has been sanctioned by the Court. </span><br>Subject to the confirmation of the Exchange, the trading of the shares of the Company will<br>remain suspended until further notice.<br></div>
