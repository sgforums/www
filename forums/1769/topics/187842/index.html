            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously think I may finally be convinced that I have too much competitiveness in me for my own good.<br><br>I have never been over-ambitious, and I'm definitely not a career minded individual. I will not bend over backwards just to get that much coveted promotion or position... in fact, I can safely say that I may be a creature of habit. I take comfort in the tried and tested; but when I choose to take risks, it would have been a very well calculated one.<br><br>However, that does not change the fact that whatever it is that I choose to undertake, I have to push myself to the best of my ability, and I rarely am satisfied until I am honestly pleased with my efforts. Unfortunately, my best usually means the resultant product will surpass all others.<br><br>Is it so wrong for a person to strive for the best in everything that he does simply because it is what his own self demands? If nobody gets hurt in the process... and no undue sacrifices are made in that journey, would you think to yourself: "What is it with him that he has to push himself beyond his limits?" Or... could it be that there exists a certain spirit of competitiveness in all of us that we unconsciously view another's achievements with disdain?<br><br>Perhaps it's just that if I were to be entrusted a task, or choose to undertake a challenge... I set my personal standards and work on it on my own terms, and not just because I'm told or expected to. I do not seek to outshine / outdo anyone else... and it's definitely not to maintain a certain 'status quo'. Whatever I choose to do has to meet my personal standards and expectations - and that often leaves me in a quandary when I'm accused of always having to 'win' and receive accolades constantly.<br><br>What do you think sets the gauge for 'competitiveness'... and at what stage can one be truly labelled as 'being competitive' by nature? Is there even a set standard to begin with? Or is it that everyone has to be bigger, better and bolder than everyone else - and when they choose to view another as competitive, are they only creating a convenient excuse for their personal envy?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I choose my scenarios to be competitive in.  Most of the time, it'll be my favourite subjects in school or when I'm in some course.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I'm highly selective though, and my competitive spirit does not apply across the board simply because I prefer to choose which race I wanna run in, and drop all other races because I do not strive to be some lunatic perfectionist and I don't wanna go bonkers or burnout from sheer exhaustion whilst running the race!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I guess you can say I'm a lazy competitor!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>However, I can be very anal once I've chosen to compete in an academic arena.  I not only end up being super-organised with my lecture notes and tutorial sheets, I go beyond what's required by reading and researching intensively and as you all know, it's the digging for info bit that is really tiresome and energy-consuming.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>After gathering a huge pile of notes, I'll start to devour them slowly.  I feel that in order to know a subject well enough, you have to go above and beyond the confines of the syllabus and attack the subject matter from all sides!  Launch an all-round 'attack'!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>If I top a class in that subject, the joy is short-lived because my competitiveness will then plunge me into a spiralling exhaustion and moodiness as I fight to maintain my position.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I can get really uptight about it at times because for some strange reason, it means (or, I hope, meanT, past tense!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) a lot to me to keep my position.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I don't suffer 'defeats' well that way and I hate to admit this but I will sulk for a long time over 'failures', as defined by me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>However, for subjects that do not capture my fancy and ignite my competitiveness, I can be very laid-back and easy-going about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I can even have a 'heck-care, mai fail can liao' attitude!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Which accounts for why I can score Distinctions or 'A's for my favourite subjects, and sometimes even top the class / faculty, and then for other subjects, I rank Top 10... bottoms-up!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I guess in the working world, I didn't compete directly with anyone in particular.  I'm not fond of office politics and I just worked hard to make sure I won't be displaced and my performance graded so bad that I won't have any performance bonus (Yeah... I'm a 'minimalist' at work!  Hahaha!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )  but other than ensuring my survival, I'm not competitive in the workplace.  Well, not that I can remember anyways!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I definitely wasn't competitive in my nursing job because I couldn't be part of the working culture there anyways.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Oh well, I tell myself that after getting my PR and enrolling for further studies in Aussieland, I'd better remember that as long as I get that piece of paper I'm after, can liao - Distinctions and what-not aren't that important because I'm no longer a young filly liao, and I'd much rather have time to go around smelling the roses and exploring the place, having fun!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Yes, I've grown older, and more mellow liao!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

But I reckon that sometimes, the snobbish party is so caught up with trying to stay at the top that he/she becomes blinded by how character-ugly he/she has become.  It happens, especially to the super ambitious.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   It's then up to close friends and loved ones who perceive this, to give the person a nudge or a kokz, depending on which is more befitting!  <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Smileys%20and%20Emoticons/bottom.gif"><br><br>I'm not proud of it but looking back at my past, times when I was over-ambitious, I lose my senses and become like a horse with blinders on both eyes - see only the goal, which becomes all-consuming, and forget everything else.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Some people maintain a good grip on themselves even when if they're highly competitive and ambitious.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a difference between being perfectionist and being competitive.<br><br>I also belong to the passive, non competitive type. I don't mind working with perfectionists - as long as they dont inconvenient me too unduly to achieve their own aims. I do respect them though and as far as it isn't too tiring, will assist them if necessary.<br><br>However, if I feel that a person is trying to do a good job merely to be competitive and has an agenda, then I lose interest. It becomes highly irritating to the competitive person who can't seem to make me move. Plus usually I am too lazy to be emotionally affected anyway. -yawns-<br><br>It doesn't mean I don't enjoy my work and get by with sloppy work though. It just means (to me) that I have my priorities and that when I feel I have spent enough time to do what I can do for my work - well that's it. I need to spend time on other things.
