              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kuali Baba:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The article has been updated to say that they don't need a
              permit.</p>
              <p>The truth is that women get raped and molested whether or not
              they were scantily-clad. There was little difference. The
              perpetrators are often people they know and they don't get
              'switched on' by the sight of skin, it's premeditated.</p>
              <p>We shouldn't perpetrate the myth that covering up can prevent
              sexual assault (this much I concede to the organisers), BUT women
              cannot dress to attract attention but try to discriminate those who
              look and assume what they're thinking.</p>
              <p>The organisers and their supporters clamour for the right "to
              express our sexuality freely". But does it have to be through
              garments, which people use to identity us and which we use to
              create identities for ourselves? If you claim you're not a porn
              star or streetwalker, don't want people to think you are but dress
              like one, what does that make you - an actor, or a hypocrite
              ("Don't judge me but you're a prude/pervert")?</p>
              <p>You're trying to make people negate the showing of skin as a
              sign of sexual availability. How can you hope to do that when it's
              still used in less-than-savoury industries, when flaunting one's
              assets elicits a very primal response? You can fight for whatever
              rights you want but you have to exercise them responsibly and bear
              out the consequences.</p>
              <p>The organisers and feminists should stop at dispelling myths
              about crimes against women and the victim-blaming mentality. By
              muddling that with the issue of clothing and values, they're only
              giving undue credit to that unfounded link.</p>
              <p>(I'll post this elsewhere if you think it's more productive to
              do so)</p>

              <p>They waived the permit? Wow.</p>
              <p>It's just a guess, but I'm thinking that the authorities felt that since those idiots are hellbent on humiliating themselves, then they might as well go all the way.</p>
              <p>No need to give them a permit or slap restrictions or read them the Riot Act. </p>
              <p>Just being a SlutWalk participant - that's punishment enough.</p>

              <p>true true.. but my thoughts was : why "bright" RI student walked himself into a trap for settlement, ie giving the gang time to get ready to attack him (later : there is a time lapse for the gang to gather pple and eqpt)...... TNP stated "<em style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 14px;">reluctantly agreed to follow their accusers"..</em></p>

              <p>cos RI students are often too smart for their own good .... they operate very well in environments with clearly defined rules ....</p>
              <p>but those rules go out of the window when you run into people who don't follow these rules .... that's why you never pat an angry, snarling dog ...... rabid dogs don't have the foresight to anticipate the consequences, kids who go around stabbing people don't either.</p>
              <p>this kids probably thought he could smart his way out of this, since to rational, thinking people like him, no one would want to stab him ...... he forgot there are indeed idiots in this world.</p>
