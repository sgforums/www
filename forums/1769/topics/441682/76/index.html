              <p>there were a bunch of people who came back yesterday wearing the bloody HK marathon t-shirt and hoping that people will recognise it and say something to them.. after lining up to be cleared and when none of the people around them did, they looked pretty dejected</p>

              <p>cyncism comes from somewhere.. it has to be cultivated...</p>
              <p>and throughout the past couple of decades, they did their best to cultivate it because it served a political end..</p>
              <p>really.. you should look at politicians as nothing but the scumbags that they are and all fall into place...</p>
              <p>notice everyone is laughing their heads off at the latest limp rag "punishment" to the casino operators... this is the cost of their cultivation of cynicism in order to achieve their own self-serving ends...</p>
              <p>and mostly, those who try to change it, smash their heads against a brick wall until they become cynics themselves too... while the others who keep at it, are derided by those who sew their own eyes and ears shut... and keep getting derided in the defense of the indefensible...</p>
              <p>how much was a nation's cynicism worth? maybe about $3,870,000 (plus bonuses)</p>

              <p>cyncism comes from somewhere.. it has to be cultivated...</p>
              <p>and throughout the past couple of decades, they did their best
              to cultivate it because it served a political end..</p>
              <p>really.. you should look at politicians as nothing but the
              scumbags that they are and all fall into place...</p>
              <p>notice everyone is laughing their heads off at the latest limp
              rag "punishment" to the casino operators... this is the cost of
              their cultivation of cynicism in order to achieve their own
              self-serving ends...</p>
              <p>and mostly, those who try to change it, smash their heads
              against a brick wall until they become cynics themselves too...
              while the others who keep at it, are derided by those who sew their
              own eyes and ears shut... and keep getting derided in the defense
              of the indefensible...</p>
              <p>how much was a nation's cynicism worth? maybe about $3,870,000
              (plus bonuses)</p>

              <p><br>reality check... just go around the forums, kopitiam... u'll see that most ppl does treat civil servants is some very evil underlings, and different companies and bodies as some blood sucking vampires...</p>
              <p>not all are born from cynicalism... There is another school of thinking (rather old and usually for the uneducated seniors but surprisingly a huge group of gen Y in it) that have the simplest idea of "you dun give me benefit, u are evil"...</p>

              <p>there is an ah mei cafe and a noodle shop there, both overprice, both 24 hours, both very very crowded on sunday mornings, cos of other hikers, and also the tuition centers at the other end. </p>
              <p>there are restaurants and overpriced kopi joints at the place too .....</p>
              <p>if you're going to walk out from there, may as well walk a bit more to bukit panjang to eat ....</p>
