              <p>Frankly speaking, I sometimes think the old way (sky-high COE,
              low ERP) is the way to go.</p>
              <p>The problem is that consumers tend to think in immediate sunk
              costs instead of long-term marginal costs. That is to say that a
              $20000 COE with a $2/entry ERP is much worse to them than $15000
              COE with a $4/entry ERP.</p>
              <p>Never mind if the ERP charges add up to a lot more in the long
              term - people consider a short-term haemorrhage to be worse than a
              long-term laceration.</p>

              <p>To me, the only real long-term solution is a really good public transport system.</p>
              <p>Sure, we aren't as bad as, say, KL, but then again, we're also nowhere close to Hong Kong or Seoul in terms of public transport. In those places, you could walk for ten minutes in any direction and you'll bump into a subway station entrance.</p>
              <p>The higher-ups here certainly didn't plan too far ahead, and they're only now belatedly catching up. Even then, I still have yet to hear anything about planned lines such as the Thomson line and the Eastern Regional Line.</p>
              <p>I was an NSF when they first started building the Circle Line, and I only managed to get to use it as a PhD. At this rate, only my grandkids will get to use the Eastern Regional Line.</p>

              <p>1 example for which actually I'm not supposed to say it..</p>
              <p>It was the at the CIQs...</p>
              <p>I was figuring wat's wrong why 170 buses could be so erratic in freq... To realise the CIQ has no 'govt', buses aren't moving at all.</p>
              <p>Everyone is just waiting for buses to be filled before moving off... But it didn't make sense, as a good 1/4 would just 'walk out' to Woodlands Centre aft clearing CIQ.</p>
              <p>I realised can't blame 170 buses for such delays.. Then zheng hu couldn't be bothered at first, saying up to them to settle the ground ops.</p>

              <p>it doesn't have to be, just make it a statutory board. the most important thing i believe, is to take away the profit orientation of public transport providers. you yourself said it before, the goverment invests and pays for the infrastructure, then a private entity comes along and runs it.</p>

              <p>Tat's the MRT only.</p>
              <p>Buses is still SBS gotta spend $$ for depot lease, buses and so on. Worst is sometimes I dun get it, they dun get perm lease for depots... Still the typical 30 yr.</p>
              <p>Ya la... But, you gotta realise, even you ask me, I dun want to see lots of buses during off peak hrs, ends up your travelling time is little diff compared to peak hrs. Why leh? Cos along the way w/ more buses, you just gotta wait for the front buses to move off.</p>
              <p>But till now, there's no proper SOP for off peak svs though I've figured some ideas to it.</p>
              <p>But I'll admit, actually if ppl want to solve it, it's gotta brainwash ppl... Something like Hong Kong, the long dist bus routes wun be stopping everywhere, only at major bus stops... While the neighbourhood buses plies you to nearby major bus stops or Int or MRT Stn.</p>
