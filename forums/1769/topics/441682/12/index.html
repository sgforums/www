              <p>My embarassing moment....</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>Yesterday, I went for a regular medical review at SGH polyclinic
              because I have completed the dose of high blood pressure
              medication. The doctor was supposed to review and to re-issue new
              lots of medicine. As I have plans to visit Mt Kialash again next
              July, Mrs SevenEleven requested me to do a heart check as well.</p>
              <p>The doctor send me to the lab for ECG and I took the result back
              to the doc. What follows was the drama....The doc says the result
              have a little eractic result and called in an ambulance to send me
              to A&amp;E (2 blocks away).</p>
              <p>I was put on a 17 hours confinment with 3 more ECG, and 4
              syringes of blood taken for test. I was also put on 24 hours
              monitoring like a live rat.</p>
              <p>Finally all test are OK, so if you are wishing me well, thanks
              as I may not be able to reply to all. Thanks</p>

              <p>I seriously, seriously don't understand the whole point of the event.</p>
              <p>In the first place, it goes to show that the organizers don't understand the meaning of 'slut'. Its pejorative meaning can be traced all the way back to the 18th century. To 'reclaim' the original term (a domestic maid, etc) would be rolling back 200-300 years of history.</p>
              <p>Also, no one is saying that one who dresses up scantily deserves to be raped. However, what everyone is saying is that a woman should take reasonable precautions to protect herself against would-be rapists (and that includes dressing up appropriately).</p>
              <p>To use an analogy, one who flashes his gold jewellery in public does not deserve to be robbed. But one should always take reasonable precautions in public, and that includes NOT flaunting your wealth.</p>
              <p>If there are any Singaporean women stupid enough to join this event, then they truly deserve to be called sluts. Because no self-respecting woman would even think about attending it.</p>

              <p>The article has been updated to say that they don't need a permit.</p>
              <p>The truth is that women get raped and molested whether or not they were scantily-clad. There was little difference. The perpetrators are often people they know and they don't get 'switched on' by the sight of skin, it's premeditated.</p>
              <p>We shouldn't perpetrate the myth that covering up can prevent sexual assault (this much I concede to the organisers), BUT women cannot dress to attract attention but try to discriminate those who look and assume what they're thinking.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>The organisers and their supporters clamour for the right "to express our sexuality freely". But does it have to be through garments, which people use to identity us and which we use to create identities for ourselves? If you claim you're not a porn star or streetwalker, don't want people to think you are but dress like one, what does that make you - an actor, or a hypocrite ("Don't judge me but you're a prude/pervert")?</p>
              <p>You're trying to make people negate the showing of skin as a sign of sexual availability. How can you hope to do that when it's still used in less-than-savoury industries, when flaunting one's assets elicits a very primal response? You can fight for whatever rights you want but you have to exercise them responsibly and bear out the consequences.</p>
              <p>The organisers and feminists should stop at dispelling myths about crimes against women and the victim-blaming mentality. By muddling that with the issue of clothing and values, they're only giving undue credit to that unfounded link.</p>
              <p>(I'll post this elsewhere if you think it's more productive to do so)</p>
