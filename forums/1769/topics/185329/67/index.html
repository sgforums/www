The onus then lies on trained personnel to sieve the real McCoy's from those who just want to shirk responsibilities.

The afflicted person will be 'normal', like you and me, and not like how typical 'mad' people are portrayed on TV.<br><br>In fact, Singapore has a large number of Schizophrenics, some of them roaming free in the streets as long as they continue taking their medicine.  Sometimes, it's hard to even tell that they are schizophrenic unless they stop taking their medicine or some event happens to trigger off an episode.<br><br>It's easy to dismiss mental and psychological disorders but it isn't 'all in the mind' and as our lives become more and more stressful, there'll be more and more who 'snap' but don't appear as your typical 'nut cases' so they'll be quite hard to detect.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with you on this.  There are genuine cases that require help *and want to be helped.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">  The onus then lies on trained personnel to sieve the real McCoy's from those who just want to shirk responsibilities.

I've worked with entire wards of patients in the IMH and it is very sad to watch at times.<br><br>You should know me well enough to know that I am not a bleeding heart and I'm definitely not the mollycoddling sort, and I'm sure those who read my posts know that I definitely am not that sort either!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   However, my opinions changed somewhat after having been exposed to people who are diagnosed with these conditions.<br><br>Put two people under the same stressful conditions and they'll cope differently.  One might snap and plunge into depression, the other just continues fighting to survive.  The tendency is to think that if one can make it, why not the other?  Sometimes, yes, it's character and emotional weakness in the other person but putting the other person in a stressful condition might actually aggravate a condition that's lurking beneath the veneer anyways.<br><br>I think it doesn't do the person any good to accuse them of shirking responsibilities by hiding behind the label of mental disorder because, criminals aside, who really wants to be labelled as 'mentally unstable' and be made to stay in IMH for a while?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Everybody wants to make a good living, but if some can't because of some affliction(s), then if we can't help, we certainly shouldn't impose harsh judgement.<br><br>Whenever someone gets diagnosed with a mental disorder, it's not just the victim who gets affected (if he/she still has awareness, that is), the entire family is also dragged down.  It's definitely not fun when it happens but if and when it does happen, social support is very important.<br><br>Bear, maybe, you might understand more if you were to volunteer at the IMH!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
