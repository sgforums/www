He stopped his vehicle, went over to check on the driver but driver was kinda stuck behind the wheel and he was in bad shape with a few ribs poking out and bleeding profusely.  He immediately called for an ambulance but waited at the scene in case he could be of any help somehow.  He said it took the ambulance about 15 -20 minutes to reach the scene and in the meantime, they kept asking for directions so there were unnecessary delays there.  My friend was quite pissed at the seemingly slow response time cause he said it was in the dead of the night, no traffic was around to cause delays.<br><br>I can't really comment, cause I wasn't there, but he was still cussing away at their 'inefficiency' when he related the incident to me.<br><br>That was about seven years ago though... hopefully, the service has improved since then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh!  Eh, sorry, Fatum!  YOu were asking about the delay witnesses of accidents took in calling for an ambulance, right?  I gave you a 'wrong' answer, sorry!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I don't think it's that.  When I witnessed accidents, I'd whip out my phone and call immediately, but the operator would always tell me that others have called ahead of me already.  Just like what elindra's mom experienced when she reported the accident too.<br><br>The most dramatic accident I've witnessed was an explosion over at this block of rental one-room apartments in Marsiling!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It was a warm afternoon and I was taking a nap when I heard a loud "BOOM!" and felt the floor shake a little!  I woke up in shock, thinking maybe one of my cupboards had crashed to the floor or something.  But nothing was amiss at home but whoa... I peeked out the kitchen window and there was lots of grey smoke coming out of a corner of the block opposite and people scattered around talking loudly.  Residents of that block ended up being evacuated when the police arrived to put up a cordone.<br><br>Apparently, it was an accident with a gas stove.  The entire flat was blown apart!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Came out in the news and papers too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Scared the hell out of me and my neighbours... we thought it was a bomb!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
