            <div class='col-md body'>A love letter should be one that expresses your feelings towards the one you love. Not a tool to help you get a girl.<br><br>If everything in the love letter is what you truly feel for a girl, not just any girl, but that special one, Then it is a good love letter.<br><br>So those who are in love and are inspired to write a love letter. Write what she makes you feel and how you feel for her. And that the feelings you have for her is exclusive. I am sure it will make a good Love Letter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Good Luck!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Eric,<br>yup.. could have been a she. I was in that situation before.. naive enough to think that one day he will fall for me, as i used to think that love should blossom since we had similar values.
