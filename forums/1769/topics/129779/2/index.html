            <div class='col-md body'>Nice sweet letter. When the longing for someone gets too unbearable and excruciatingly painful n yet the fear to reveal is at the same time overpowering, the dilemma at times can drive a person to the brink of a breakdown. In my life, i've only written one love letter. After liking her for over a year, the thought of rejection n most importantly past haunting heartaches had made me kept it to myself. One day, out of the blue, driven by impulse, i penned a 3 1/2-page letter to the girl. It was juz after midnight. I finished it at around 5+am n posted it at 6. My emotions fueled n motivated throughout the wee hours. It wasnt much about me wanting to know her n getting attached to her. But rather a simple letter declaring my feelings towards her n the tormenting time i went through liking her without her even being aware of my attention.<br><br>6 months later, she became my gf. Today she's still by my side.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have this bunk mate who has nv really had a gal fren ever since being attached to his current n only gf. His gf's rationale is tt there is no such thing as platonic r/s. So my section had a debate abt this issue.<br><br>Personally, it's wrong for his gf to restrict his freedom to get to know more pple. Totally opp of my style. I give my gf alot of freedom to hang out with guys. My gf, like all possessive pple, tries to restrict. But juz too bad.. i dun take no for an ans too easily. lol..<br><br>Anyway, gf is not entirely wrong coz i do agree to <span style="font-style: italic;">a certain extent</span> on the fact tt there is no such thing as 100% platonic r/s between a man n a woman. At certain point of time, a guy might have fallen for his best gal pal n vice versa. However, fate being cruel as such, poor timing n lost opportunities nv gotten these pple one step closer n hence, remained as best of frens. All my close gal pals at certain point of time had attracted me. But tt doesnt me a man n a woman cant be frens can it..</div>
