            <div class='col-md body'>What is it that makes most men so afraid to let their emotions show? Does it mean that if they were to shed a tear or two it'll make them less of a man than their counterparts?<br><br>Is it all about ego? And if so... why is there a need to stroke that constantly?<br><br>Since the beginning of time, the male species have always been deemed as the provider and the protector. He is the one who maintains the family, protects them and brings home the bacon. Does it all mean, then... that he has no right to show his emotions? To be afraid when he feels afraid, to reach out when he needs help, and to cry when he feels sad. I'm not sure... maybe most think that by showing a smidgen of weakness it makes them vulnerable.<br><br>I've always admired a man who is confident enough of his 'manliness' to show that he is also human. Nothing garners more respect from me than a man who puts his Ego on the line and shows his true emotions. I believe that every Man, no matter how 'New Age' they are; have a certain degree of egotistical tendencies in them. It is this aspect of their emotions that a woman should always keep in check.<br><br>Fine... your husband or boyfriend treats you as an equal, for e.g: he has no qualms whatsoever about you being the higher wage earner in the relationship. Yet at the same time... I'm pretty sure that he would appreciate you still treating him as the Head of the Family, as someone whose word ultimately goes.<br><br>On the flip side of the coin...as egotistical a Man can be, Women too, can be quite a handful. Two such separate and distinctive entities - never the twain shall meet?<br><br>Perhaps that is the reason we all realise that Falling in Love is Easy ~ Maintaining the Love is what takes a lot of Work.<br><br>Me? I've always believed that a Woman should always be a chameleon for the one she loves. To him she should be a Wife, a Lover, a Hooker, a Sister, a Mother and most of all a Friend. (...All the World's a Stage! to quote from Shakespeare) Quite a daunting task, I realise.<br><br>Then again, nobody said Loving and Being in Love was easy.... I just wish the men would help us out here a little by being slightly more 'sensitive' to our often ridiculous needs. We don't need someone to hide behind and protect us from the big bad world... sometimes all we need is a someone who genuinely gives us a little support and understanding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that men are not really sensitive to the needs of women. Men themselves often neglect their own needs as well. Men have to often have to look beyound the sensitivity of issues and focus on the big picture. Man is like the captain. U cant have both the crew and the captain panic together in time of emergency. Often there will be a need scenarios a few to safe the rest. Therefore a man has to often put aside their emotional feelings and focus on the bigger task at hand.</div>

But what I was actually addressing are the 'masks' that we wear on a non personal level. Is it the norm or the accepted way a man should behave in public? More than that - are most men succumbing to the societal pressure?<br><br>With age, I believe that as cliched as it may be, we do get wiser. We know what we want, we are aware of our own feelings, and most importantly - we would have come to a point whereby we are comfortable being ourselves, faults and all - to project our real selves to people whom we care about. Most of us, however, without any distinction to either sex; do maintain a form of 'facade' to people whom we may not be familiar with - or in places where adaptability is the name of the game. Facade, as I use it in this context, does not mean that we are superficial or hypocritical... rather, it is more of an image that we choose to project - either to protect ourselves, or to garner more 'trust' and 'affinity' with people whom we deal with on a less personal level.<br><br>Picture this scenario.<br><br>Steven, a middle aged man - loves his family, has a great job... and is the epitome of a perfect husband and father. He discusses issues with his wife, and would not dream of making any major decisions without her support. And then we next see Steven in a club, where he is entertaining his clients in the hope that it'd grease the way to the million dollar deal just waiting to be signed. He becomes the total opposite of himself - boorish, loud, and acting as though he is 'all male'. Or the idea of what a man (as how the majority of society dictates) should be like , at least.<br><br>Why the need to do so? Will it make him half of a man in the other men's eyes if he were to be his usual self?<br><br>Of course, not all men are like that -  I do know and have encountered some who are truly open and comfortable with who they really are... but they are very few, and far in between. What I do notice, however, is that most of these individuals have very high self esteems. Which is all good!<br><br>The downside to this, however, is that they can be quite full of themselves and impossibly obstinate. Again - I'm making a generalisation here... but nonetheless, I believe this to be a trait that most self confident people have a hard time detaching themselves from. It is too much of an 'Action-Reaction' behaviour. One's ego is fed by one's abilities and accoplishments. Not everyone can be as humble as they'd like to be.<br><br>---- about the 'hooker' thing - that was just a graphic exaggeration on my part. Of course I do not mean it as the word is often used - rather, I am of the belief that sexual fulfillment not only comes from love between two people, but also in the constant quest to understand each other's preferences as well as the effort made to keep the physical part of the relationship alive. It is a joint effort - and sad to say, most people (both men and women) tend to just take it as simply part and parcel of the relationship once the honeymoon period subsides and they enter into that comfort zone. They aren't too comfortable abouyt vocalising their needs, likes... or dislikes.<br><br>Now - the women. As a woman, even *I* cannot escape the fact that it is tough to really know a woman inside out. I would have to readily admit that more often than not, the fairer sex does bewilder more than is necessary, if at all. I've never understood the whining bits - I take my hat off to men who can live with it and still have a smile on their faces whilst placating their partners who are getting more pouty by the minute fuelled by the extra attention. Patience? Or Over indulgence? Or simply a shuttup tactic? Another grouse of mine would be when the curt answer to a "What's Wrong / What's troubling you?" is a nonchalant "Nothing." Yet if their expressions are anything to go by, there is more than just something!<br><br>As much as men can be 'insensitive'... perhaps with a little bit of guidance and hints (if you must) - they would actually become more aware of their partner's likes and dislikes. It works both ways, though. Am not talking about a compromise here - I think compromises just involves both parties having to forgo and 'settle with' a situation that would most likely keep the peace. Don't be calculative in a relationship... there is never 'I love you more' or 'You love me more'. Even if it means having to adapt yourself so that you can meet halfway, it is worth the effort if the relationship means a lot to you. There will be other times when your partner makes the effort for you.<br><br>In my ideal world - it's pretty simple. Make the effort to understand each other. It's a lot tougher than it seems.<br><br>Guys - it's OK to fall apart sometimes... we don't expect you to always bear the weight of the world on your shoulders. And for us women, trust is the fundamental basic ingredient in the relationship. Never give a man a reason to lie to you because you can be unreasonably demanding. Respect his views - and never put him down in front of others.<br><br>And take the time to show each other that you care.</div>
