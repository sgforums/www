              <p>I see how my current MIL sap/control on her son to the extend of creating a rift in my marriage. I do not want to be ever like her to create such a situation for my children.  I think children should lead their own life and the parents might rely on them but never drag them down and expect them to live in the service of their parents and in their shadow. This is to allow them to grow. My husband never grew. He's spoilt and his only love his mommy and lives in order to make his mommy happy.</p>

              <p>Having children to support themselves is a poor person's mentality. In the past, older folks have many children, so that when they grow up children will earn money and give to them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Everyone should take care of their parents, unless your parents torture you or something hahaa....</p>

              <p>i suggest that TS should stop looking at children like they owe the parents</p>
              <p>respect and love is earned, not demanded or expected</p>
              <p>TS is already asking for it by hoping to "make sure" the kids will take care of him/her.</p>
              <p>now i'm hoping the kids don't, because TS certainly doesn't deserve any help</p>

              <p>Haha I asked my MPB again yesterday the real reason why he wants children</p>
              <p>He said,"So that I have someone to inherit all I have earned and built up. I don't want to give it to the Government nor do I want to donate it to strangers"</p>
              <p>Anyway life these days is already real tough. It would be a miracle if our future generation don't need us to support them</p>
