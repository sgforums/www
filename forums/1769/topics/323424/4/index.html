              <p>to Misty,</p>
              <p>sorry to hear your story..I heard some unreasonable and horrible mils story myself.. in fact, one of my best friend's sister was forced to divorce due to her mil.. And her hubby(a very filial son) listened to the mum.. I myself did not expect to live under one roof with children in old age.. Only hope children cud at least show their care and concerns when we are too old to look after ourselves..</p>

              <p>I also realised that he's quite good at covering up things he didn't want people to know. He will say 1 thing and deny ever saying it later. Roti prata. Just like his mommy. She accused me of so many things that never happened and in the next breath, claim she never said anything and flip it around and made it seem that I wronged her. One incident that happened was that when my husband kicked me out of the house, my MIL called my mom and told her she has no right to take me in and my mom should let me wonder outside. Then she told my mom that she's now 70 and should have better send to die than to continue living and waste everyone's time. Immediately i confronted her about the last statement, my MIL immediately denied saying such vicious thing. I told her that I am on speaker phone. everyone heard it. So out of spike, she curse my mother again just to make sure everyone hear it clearly.</p>

              <p>When the mother is gone, i have the answer for you. For my husband, he has a niece whom he love like a 2nd lover. So there's a continuation. There's no fear. he will always have these people around him. Besides, he already said he have a house and car, he had promised to f**k as many women and use them like dirt once he is divorced.</p>
