              <p>Heard divorce from him 4 times. I think its about enough times to hear it over 2 years.</p>
              <p>my husband will never move out. The parents do not have their own house because they gambled it away. Now my husband made a promise to forever take care of his parents till they die - He only want to be the best Son. They are only in their late 50s. That's a long wait. And moving out, will never happen. The last time he spoke about moving out is to kick me out of the house. Later he propose I continue to fund the current house to let his parents stay in while I purchase a private unit and stay there on my own and pay for it out of my own pocket but he so kindly agree that the private unit should be in my name and not his and he will come visit.</p>
              <p>Can anyone accept such things? I cannot.</p>

              <p>so TS, this is the kind of result if you wish to ensre the kids take care of you in future. They get trapped in between and the parents just drive the couple apart. I am not saying that there are no good in-laws or parents but chances are that the mindset of the older people and younger people will need a lot of time to adjust. And even when the young give way, the old can accept it that the young can only give in to a certain point or will they demand absolute giving way by the young which is my case -its never ending giving way. When the kids are siding the parents all the time, the spouse suffers in silence.</p>
              <p>Its not that kids want to leave the parents. Its that they need to grow up. They need to find their own space. They need to start a new family on their own and fulfil their destiny. Not be held back to fulfil the parent's wish. We all wish to have the kids to our own but to hold them back is to do them injustice. Its hard to let go but its only then when they can truly appreciate life and what you gave them.What is piety? Its not an out-dated concept. I think its just that the form has changed while the substance remained the same. We have move on and lived in the 21st century. And it really does not mean kids staying with parents are being pieous. And it does not mean the parents forcing the kids to be pieous will get whatever they want. Nothing forced is worth any value. Staying together is nothing. True piety is beyond all that. My husband stays with his parents but he remains distant to them. So to me, what's the point. Even though he feels that he's providing for them. I feel that he did some wrongs and he's just trying to reduce his guilt. For me, I visit my parents weekly and ask about them and talk to them. I know my parents have their own world and they should. But I think its a healthier relationship than if I stayed with them. And I am not a pieous person but between my sister and myself, we discussed this topic and know that we try our best within our means but we also want to grow up and find our own selves.</p>

              <p>And he claims that whatever he's suggesting is good for us and made it sound as if I owe it to him and only he's right. he either use brute force and balme to get me to do what he wants or he use utter stupid logic to suggest solutions that only benefit his family and still force me to do it.</p>
              <p>Obviously I am not loaded and obviously I never intended to be in debt. Then this will be another round of "I  told you so, you should have thrown away your ego, pride, dignity and bow to my parents then you can obey everyone like an animal so that you can be allowed to live with us"</p>

              <p>Its his character. he does not see it as pushing blame, he will tell everyone that he is seeing it clearly as who is at fault and who should be the one to change. Such a nice way of putting things - like mother, like son.  His mom also constantly blame me for all the nonsense things she can image our of thin air and then complains to him. So they both gang together and balme me for no doing this, not obeying that, not doing what they both imagine I should and etc</p>
