Â“It really backfired on the cockle industry. Hum began to be the butt of jokes Â– it became really uncool to eat it. For years we had been planning to expand the use of hum with other dishes beyond laksa and char kway teow Â– yes, even mee siam Â– but the Prime Minister has set these efforts back by decades. Why lai dat, PM Lee? What harm has the humble hum ever done to you?Â”<br><br>Members of SUCKERS called an emergency meeting to decide how to respond to the crisis. Â“The vote was unanimous,Â” said Mr. Loh. Â“To rehabilitate the industry and also the PMÂ’s image, we needed to get him to eat mee siam WITH hum. But clearly, he has expressed a distaste for it. So how? Who could we get to do it?Â”<br><br>The answer was also unanimous Â– Zoe Tay.<br><br>Â“She swallows and looks good because of it,Â” said Mr. Loh. Â“So I think she has a thing or two to teach the PM.Â”<br><br>Ms Tay agreed immediately.<br><br>Â“Pill lah, hum lah, anything also I not scared to swallow,Â” said the Queen of Caldecock, Â“Anything is better than the dialogue MediaCorp puts in my mouth.Â”<br><br>While SUCKERS remains hopeful that PM Lee will accept Ms. TayÂ’s tutorial, the Prime MinisterÂ’s Orifice has denied all rumours that the event will proceed, saying, Â“We wish to state categorically that the rumour about the Prime Minister learning how to swallow from Zoe Tay is completely fallacious.Â”<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.

The plan Â– to contaminate all local Mee Siam with Hum during the 10-day conference in Singapore!<br><br>Police Spokesman Kahnit Chilly revealed that Al Eetya, a Southeast Asian breakaway sect from Al Qaeda, had elaborate plans to use local distributors and gangs to add hum to all mee siam served during the conference. A centerpiece of the plan focuses on the banquet hosted by PM Lee on the opening day of the conference, where delegates were to be served a sampling of local food, such as laksa and mee siam.<br><br>The intention of this terrorist act is to destroy confidence in PM Lee, who had ordered during the National Day Rally speech that from now on, no mee siam should be served with hum Â– Â“Mee Siam Mai HumÂ”, he said. A recovered email written by one of the terrorists said - Â“This will totally destroy any respect in our enemyÂ’s ability to lead Singapore. No investor or foreign talent will ever enter Singapore again.Â”<br><br>Revealing the sophistication of the operations, the terrorists had apparently infiltrated, succeeding in planting moles in the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Protocol Department is responsible for the food served to the world leaders at PM LeeÂ’s banquet. That even the MFA had been infiltrated must send a clammy feeling down the spines of our counter-espionage authorities.<br><br>The Singapore Police said that their discovery of the shocking plot had been due to a tip-off by a shrimp importer. The shrimp importer had been scared that if mee siam with hum were ever served, people might prefer mee siam with hum, instead of mee siam with shrimp. His business supplying shrimp to local mee siam hawkers might be undermined.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003. All rights reserved.<br></div>
