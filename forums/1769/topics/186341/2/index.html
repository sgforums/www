I guess on hindsight they were right in dumping us in a school that teaches both English and Mandarin as a first language, and I had the luck of getting a good Mandarin teacher in Primary 3 &amp; 4.<br><br>The languages I speak at home are English and Teochew...but we stopped speaking Teochew when my grandfather died. My great-grandmother was Peranakan but my family is interesting in the way that, cooking wise, it is a medley of Teochew and Peranakan dishes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Only thing is that we are different from KB's family in the sense that we speak Teochew and English more than Malay so only the older folks know Malay and not my generation.<br><br>Those were the days when I was forced to go to school half an hour earlier and forced to memorise pages and pages of 'Tang Shi'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I hated those days but now I think it did me good (If I have a kid, that's how I'm going to teach him/her Mandarin  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) Oh, and my teacher then, had this really sick method of removing words from the poems and making me go through the dictionary to see which is the correct word to fit into the sentance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Getting it wrong means more homework.<br><br>Then in Secondary School, people think that I'm from some 'Banana' producing all-girls school as I had the same accent as them due to speech lessons when I was much younger (wahaha I don't have it now. I can switch around if I wanted) In terms of upbringing, I admit that I cannot identify with the grassroots and with the heartlanders initially. I used to live, looking through rose-tinted glasses.<br><br>Anyway, as I was telling Rhonda the other day, the problem I have now is that my command of English is eroding  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I think if I were to retake my 'O' level English right now I might get a B grade  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> Reason? Due to my nature of work, I speak a smattering of Mandarin and Hokkien/Teochew to my customers that I hardly have to speak English  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> My Mandarin's improving though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Primary Schoo in Convent School (complete with nuns and angmos) so didn't realise I spoke with an accent until I went to govt sec sch made some mandarin speaking friends and they told me initially they thought I was a big snob. Peer pressure prevailed and I even picked up the Walaos and various ahem.. terms... - which I use with great ease even now - until another friend (from convent era) told me she is a little upset that I keep speaking Hokkien too. Rest of sch from JC onwards, I was mostly English speaking. But u know how it happens, we collect friends - some English speaking/some not - but all equally amusing wonderful beings.<br><br>Currently MOST of my friends speak mandarin but they laugh at me cos I get my chinese terms all mixed up all the time. My more 'westernised' friends also laugh at me cos I keep getting my English mixed up too, my grammar sucks and my pronunciation is kooky. My completely bilingual friends laugh at me all the time (cos they can laugh both when I speak Mandarin ANd when i speak English)<br><br>And my grandma laughs at me, cos my Hokkien singing is a major joke.<br><br>Now in my class, there is a kid who came to school speaking only Malay. It was initially really difficult cos he threw major tantrums (and chairs occasionally) but I could not communicate with him. Finally learnt a few choice Malay words 'EH! JANGAN JAHAT!!!' but when I say something to him in broken Malay, he will giggle and give me smirky face. Currently he loves showing off to me that his English is progressing far better than my Malay. Oh well!<br><br></div>

It's not too bad in the office itself where I'm usually at - the rest of the graphic designers converse in English, especially as a form of respect(?) whenever I'm in the vicinity.<br><br>However, at the production side - from the colour seperators to the cutters to the packers - they communicate almost 100% in Hokkien. It was tough during the first few months... when I used to get bewildered looks and blank stares everytime I had to pass on some work that have certain specific requirements. My colleagues will help me without having needed to be asked whenever these situations arise - but there have been times when it's a madhouse and I suppose I don't want to impose on them more than I needed to.<br><br>Funnily enough, we work around it. When I think about the 'special' language we use - it always makes me smile. It's not Singlish, it's not Hokglish, Chinglish or anything that can even be categorised into a fixed group. It's a hodge-podge mish mash of every Chinese / English language variation... with a fair amount of Malay thrown in. Whatever works, and however we convey it - as long as it's understood by both parties. Diagrams, hand signals, the total desecration of the language(s) that we choose to use... somehow contribute to this peculiar 'special' bond that the workers and I share. They're always glad to see me; perhaps I offer them an entertaining brief respite from their usual rut.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I suppose we humans are more adaptable and resilient that we would deem to believe.

I was from a convent sch also. The moment I entered poly and when my friends found out where I graduated from, immediately they said..Oh you must be jiat kan tang. Worst they deemed me to be a snob whom only will hang out with the "speak English only" kind of people. They thought that the reason why I am always with the Muslim people is because they spoke English most of the time and that I look down on people from Chinese speaking schools. Little do they know that reason why I was always with the Muslim people was because I spoke Malay too and also because my spoken Chinese is not that fantastic, I would feel like an outcast when they said something I do not understand in Chinese. Somehow , I got closer to these friends of mine in my final year and they finally found out that, Hey! she is not what we thought she would be. Till now after graduation, we remained in close contact. Frankly speaking even till today, when any new friend of mine hears that I studied in a convent sch before and speaks poor Chinese will deem me as proud and snobbish. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

As much as we stereotype and think that a group of people are 'such and such' or have particular traits - not every person that you encounter which can be categorised to that group is that way.<br><br>Perhaps it could be 'over-sensitivity' in some cases... I do know that when people start speaking in chinese the moment I walk away, I used to think that they were speaking ill of me. Like wise, probably - for those whose grasp of another language is not as profound as another's. What I neglected to think duting my younger years is that they may be more comfortable speaking amongst themselves in Chinese, and they were giving me due respect when I was involved in the conversation.<br><br>I don't deny that there are some people who refuse to speak in Chinese / Malay / Tamil because they feel that they are more "worldy" and to do so would compromise their 'glamour factor'. However, these are very few and far in between. If we already have a fixed set of views of how a person is like just based on superficial observation... chances are, regardless of how the person may be, they will always appear as such to you.<br><br>"The worst ones can laugh at you by listening to the chinese news" - I'm sorry, but I don't get what you mean here... have you encountered people who laugh at you because you tune in to the news in chinese? If that's what you mean - I don't blame you for being angry. I would be too,  if I were expected to only watch the news in chinese because I am one. It is unfortunate that you encounter such people. Personally, I'm a chinese drama addict. As long as they have subtitles - you can be sure I'll know the storyline off the top of my head.
