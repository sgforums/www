If your tongue is used to a certain style, rolling it and making "don't" sound like "downt" just makes them look and sound like typical wannabes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> And then suddenly in the middle of the sentence they forget - and it comes out as "donch". What then?<br><br>I hate it... in fact I absolutely abhor it (any stronger words?) Seriously, I'd rather you speak normally - so what if you have an Indian / Chinese / Malay accent? I'm sure people would know just by looking at an Asian that English is not their native language. What is there to be embarrassed about? Imagine this SYT that's been giving you looks from across the bar. You move in...only to wonder if she's really overseas born, educated or just had a wisdom tooth op. A fake accent is distinguishable from a million soundwaves away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I just wish that more Singaporeans would be proud to be an individual by their own right - have the confidence to show others that every part of their personality makes them who they are... accent and all.</div>
