            <div class='col-md body'>The steady hum of the machines beckon.<br><br>My footsteps echo as I walk into the cavernous roomÂ… itÂ’s freezing cold here. Looking around, the old man waves an almost happy hello to me, and flashes me a toothless grin. I return his greeting Â– I am always happy to see him. He has worked for the company for a long time, with a wealth of experience that no amount of textbooks could ever teach anyone. Fingers discoloured from the inkwells, his shirts always look as if they were artistically tie-dyed. His grasp of the English language is minimalÂ… enough to at least hold a barely decipherable conversation with me; it is almost comical.<br><br>Blame me for being a Chinese, looking like a ChineseÂ… and not being able to read, write or understand the language. You may even have been guilty of calling those like me a 'banana'. Yellow on the outside, white on the inside. Lots of people deem me to be 'arrogant' - too caught up in Â‘Western IdeasÂ’; so much so that I would denounce my heritage. If they actually bother (or even have the opportunity to) enquire with me, they would realise that I actually am more compliant to Eastern values than perhaps the overseas educated Chinese who is still 'reluctantly' able to understand Chinese. None of my ex-boyfriends were Caucasians - in fact, honestly, my close friends and family are worried I may end up with one due to the fact that I totally write the 'ang mo' off any option I'm open to, as a partner. I'm not racist in any way... I am more inclined to the Asian man.<br><br>ItÂ’s human nature, isn't it? To immediately point and accuse without even bothering to investigate the real reason why. If some of then had even bothered to ask, I would gladly tell them why. My ancestors, coming from China and settling in Indonesia, came to the country during a time when the Chinese language was Â‘verbotenÂ’. The Chinese had to change their names to Indonesian ones, speak the languageÂ… basically short of denouncing their heritage. Post WWII Â– my grandfather married a Dutch girl Â– my Granny (whom I love to bits and still miss to this very day)Â… and the entire clan thus evolved speaking Indonesian, with a smattering of Dutch.<br><br>When my family migrated to Singapore in 1982, we still had the option to choose what we preferred as a 2nd Language, regardless of our race. Since Indonesian is very much similar to Malay, and my parents thought that it would make the transition so much easier, I studied Malay in school - which on hindsight was actually a mistake; since I already am proficient in the language. It wouldÂ’ve served me well to have taken Chinese insteadÂ… being Tri-lingual is definitely a much better option. Furthermore, it would save me the dirty looks I always get now!<br><br>Perhaps a befitting description for me thenÂ… the banana is. At least when it comes to the: think in English, Speak EnglishÂ… and write in English part. I have ceased to get affected by the next person who tells me off in disbelief: "Ha?? You Chinese, cannot speak Chinese, ah? Sure or not? Or you too proud to speak Chinese issit?" *said with a look of disdain and scorn*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>All other factors remaining constant, of course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, sue this baba here...we and our relatives speak English (and a little Malay) at home. It's my comfort zone and I'm not making any excuses for not signing up for extra classes, watching Channel 8/U or reading the Chinese newspapers.<br><br>I choose the values I wish to follow based on their merit, and not on the colour of my skin. I try to keep myself informed about my Peranakan culture as much as I can. I have no qualms about taking a white girl to be my partner.<br><br>If the situation calls for it, I do use Mandarin. My grasp of it has been weakened due to my lack of usage and exposure, but my situation doesn't call for me to brush up on it yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I can certainly empathise with you.<br><br>Same scenario, except that my roots are a mix of Sabah/Brunei and we do not speak Mandarin, but rather, a Malaysianised form of Hokkien with smatters of Malay in our speech.Only my mother in our extended family could speak Mandarin, through extra classes as in high school over there.<br><br>Well, that's my maternal roots.My paternal ones are what you would call King's Chinese in the olden days, my grandfather being one of the first few batches to study at ACS back in Amoy Street. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He took Malay, my folks there took Malay as both it and English were the backbone of administration under the colonial government.<br><br>So here I am now,proficient in English and Hokkien, perfectly at home in this area of the world, loving Borneo with a comfort and ease many Singaporeans would not find it easy.I laugh deep inside when I try to ease my way by using Hokkien at the market, hawker centers or taxi rides, and I get mistaken for Indo-Chinese.In fact, if my suspicions are correct, most of such people who are monolingual, do have the experience of chapel service and the colours of blue and gold as a student when young <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Call me a banana, it's my heritage after all.I'm proud to be who I am, and I proudly proclaim I am not a pure Chinese in all sense of the word.

I'm not so much bothered by what people think or say about me per se; rather it's just the general attitude of the society.

I have realised that even if we argue with the opinion of the majority that we should find it in ourselves to make an effort to learn the language till the cows come home - we should not bow down to the requirement and expectations of society just to 'fit in'. Believe me, I've tried taking lessons, intensive, comprehensive and explored all avenues in the process, but my teachers have all but given up on me. The pronounciation, the intonation - and the actual ability to grasp the language does not even come close to the barest minimal!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So...

Some weed?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I was brought up by grandma, who was conservative.  However, from a young age, I was the product of a dual-income household and was constantly torn between staying with my grandma or going home with my parents because after they had finished dinner at grandma's, they would usually head home.  I was always torn... wanting to follow them home, then when we reached the ground floor, I'd cry and want my grandma instead, etc etc.<br><br>Coming from a rather conservative upbringing, who would have expected that at Primary 3, I became a latchkey kid!  And what's more, I was tasked with taking care of my younger brother as well, and had to cook for the both of us.  That was liberating and my first taste of how independant I could be!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>My group of friends were those who always adhered to 'the good ol' values' and none of us grew up doing anything too outrageous and wild.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Even if we had the opportunities to do so, somehow, our internal moral compass would pull us away from reckless abandon.  Oddly enough, in my time, that was considered 'gwai'.  In this day and age, we'd probably be mocked at.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Being in ACJC broadened my horizon.  Suddenly, I met people from other social classes, ie. the Upper Middle and Upper classes, when all the while, my classmates were of the Lower or Lower Middle or Middle class.  We were the SBS lot and now, amongst my classmates were the personal chauffeur-driven lot with their Beemers, Merz and etc.<br><br>Suddenly, our tutors encouraged us to voice our opinions, even if we disagreed with them!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">   It was an eye-opener to me, but I got over that shock quickly and very soon, from a meek voice when I raised my hand to express an opinion that was different from everyone else's, I graduated to speaking out with more confidence.  It was a new 'playground' for me and I enjoyed my two years in ACJC very very much!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And then, when I entered the working world, I joined an American MNC that had a large percentage of expatriates from the US, Europe, UK, Australia, and all parts of S.E. Asia.  We were like a mini UN!  I had a culture shock at first, cause the working style was very Americanised.  Slowly, I acclimatised to this new environment, got assimilated in it and even started to thrive in it.<br><br>So, I'm not quite your typical banana, and I won't profess to be so.  I don't even know what I am!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>However, I won't bother with classifications because nobody ever falls neatly into just ONE category.  We're all products of the experiences we've gone through, exposure we had, chances we were given, opportunities we have taken, and we're each and everyone of us, a unique amalgamation of all that.<br><br>Sometimes, my stand can be so liberal, I shock myself.  At other times, I'm so conservative and narrow-minded, I embarrass myself.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   But whatever it is, I'm just being me, the extremely confused and non-pedigreed banana!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
