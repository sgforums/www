External conditions aren't going to help much.  In my previous ward, the morale was extremely low - high turnover rates were rampant, amongst those of us who stayed, we were grouchy and grumpy and jaded, and we were all constantly picked-upon by the nit-picking nursing officers, who didn't  help us much but rather, added on to our burdens and stress.  There was an atmosphere of distrust and, dare I say it, dictatorship.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   And whilst we derived satisfaction from helping our patients recover, or helping the relatives cope with impending death, we weren't happy with the working conditions at all.<br><br>Things are better in my new ward.  We have a better system of management, and our Snr Nurse Mgr is a patient, caring and flexible lady who really cares for her staff, so the atmosphere is much breezier, everyone's happy at work, and even when we're busy, we all roll up our sleeves, help each other out, and there's generally a good working comaraderie.  Of course, there's still the politics and occasional back-biting and all that, but it's much much better, compared to my previous ward.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So, when it comes to our job satisfaction, I'll say it's really dependant on the nursing management in the ward you're assigned to, and your colleagues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Like you, the second question you asked continue to faze me.  I've even brought it up to a Nursing Director, "Isn't the Dept of Nursing Admin alarmed by the increasingly high turnover rate every year?" and you know what?  She arrogantly dismissed me by boasting, "If the nurses want to leave, go ahead!  We can always get more nurses!"  I was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .  The stupidity of it all!  How much time, money, and resources are spent every year training nurses?!  And then, after their bond period, they leave, and nobody's interested in doing anything to stem the outflow?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   Man, that defies wisdom!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It's a violation of every single common-sense HR guideline and what-not I know of!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But year after year, the same thing happens.  The situation's actually getting worse, but the public's none the wiser.  The statistics look 'ok', but we're on the ground level, we know.<br><br>Why do you think the nursing school needs to recruit up to 1,000 nurses for each year's intake?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Guess it depends on one's luck in the kind of ward assigned and mgt style. At least there is a chance for lateral transfers.<br><br>Maybe I shd post the 2nd question to someone in MOH (I've been talking to some senior officer there as part of my research.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  ). Perhaps it's due to the ease and reliance on foreign nurses, and it seems like those sr nurses in charge may need to undergo more macro training in managing HR.<br><br>It's rather ironic...i mean, if the sr nurses in charge can be nice and kind to patients (that's why they can be promoted, right?), why can't they be nice and kind to their fellow nurses on whom they rely for the success of the team?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Wanda, due to the nature of our job, a lot of time, the seniors are on  hard to the juniors and newbies because they are held responsible for their mistakes.  This means that they have sudden, extra workload and new staff are pretty hard to train because everyone's stretched to the max and this is just an extra burden few would relish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It doesn't help that a lot of newly-graduated nurses seem to be really blur about stuff that they should know by then.  Maybe, as student nurses on hospital attachments back then, they should've taken their attachments a tad more seriously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I used to rebuke the students when they fail to know what they ought to know by their level because they should take their learning and training seriously.<br><br>You'll find that when you're up to the expectations and up to standard in your work, the seniors will start to leave you alone.  I ended up 'softening' most of the seniors who came down hard on me and my colleagues - they can be charmed over one!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
