            <div class='col-md body'>Have a look at the websites and hope that help.  I went there in June this year.... food is really nice.  We went to a few temples (snake temple is not really worth seeing nowadays), the botanical garden, the Penang Bridge, etc.<br><br>Public transport is not very convenient there so may be a good idea to live close to town. If you are going to catch a cab, make sure you find out how much first before you board to prevent being overcharged.<br><br>It will be easier if you have friends there who can take you around and show you the nice place to eat.  When I was there in June, we ate on the stalls on the street most of the times and if I didn't have friend there to reccommend me the place, I wouldn't have gone in myself.  They look rather unhygenic but the food turned out really nice.  Thank God I didn't get sick either.<br><br>Also, try to avoid wearing any expensive jewelleries and carrying a handbag as there are many robbers around.<br><br>Have a great trip!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Attraction and what to do: http://www.visitpenang.com/sights.html<br><br>Accommodation: http://www.penang-hotels.com/</div>
