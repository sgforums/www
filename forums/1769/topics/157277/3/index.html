The Bed Supper Club is one of the happening club in BKK. 26 Sukhumvit Soi 11<br><br>Another will be Santika  -  Ekkamai Road<br>Heard it's very big and nice.<br><br>Bargaining will not be very necessary.

I was caught off guard that my gf would throw stunt bomb at me.<br><br>I thought for a while and said ok 700 is ok.<br>She was so furious...because she felt that i didn't meet with her agenda.<br><br>So i explained to her.<br>Difference of 20 baht is less a SG dollar. I don't wish that they label us 'cheapstake' and not buy the clothings because of a SG dollar. It's silly!<br><br>It's a good gauge to bargain from 30%. No more 50% slash lo....those were hardcore shoppers who spoil market.<br>Usually if you buy more than 3 item in a shop, they'll automatically give the discount.<br><br>It's good to do your price list in SG first and go there and compare.<br>If it's possible to bargain then good la. If it's not, nothing to lose, cos it's already very cheap(50% cheaper?)<br><br>Actually i don't really consider it short.
