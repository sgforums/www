            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, have returned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Yeah it was Free &amp; Easy.  Erm wrote abit of the trip elsewhere, but will repost here heheh.  As you can see, we stayed at P Princess at about S$130 a night.  Not cheap but very accessible to the shops.  Amari is probably more expensive than that.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><br>BKK was fun!   Spent more than I should have .... ate more than I should have <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  ah but I'll postpone looking at the bank balance till month-end.  I think my biggest shopping splurge was silk table runners and shawls hahaha.  I'm a shawl freak.<br><br>It was hot, but I much prefered the sun to rain<br><br>Holidays are great, but the pile-up at work is terrible!!  &gt;__&lt;<br>[/quote]<br><blockquote>Well we did most damage at MBK, because it was just downstairs, and it was air-conditioned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Can't help it , my SO's an grouch when it comes to heat.<br><br>Personally, my favourite was Chatuchak, for the variety and whole bazaar feel of it.  Suam Lom's good too, it's more quiet.  But at Chatuchak and Suan Lom, we were overwhelmed by the crowd, the sprawl and the heat, and thus were not in prime shopping condition <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  We didn't stay long, see above reasons re: SO &amp; heat.  Can't find a worse partner to go to bazaars with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  For both places, I'm sure the shopping will be better in future trips (hypothetical! :p ) when one knows what to expect.<br><br>Ah the food... I tried, I really tried to eat as much variety as I could in such a short time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  But there's only so much food one can stomach in a day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I love the local pork noodles with spicy broth, I wish we had it here.  Other notables were coconut ice cream, coconut crispy pancake thingy, desserts....  generous portions at low price.  Good stuff.<br><br>Next trip?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Till I see the bank balance and do my sums, I don't know, but I'm not hopeful .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></blockquote>[quote]Originally posted by JLennon:</div><div class="quote_body">choco, ya going there free and easy?</div></blockquote></div>
