            <div class='col-md body'>OK... 30 secs self-imposed embargo over!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ferret, something you said, "Sigh. A shell is akin to a comfort zone. As long as I dont stay out, nothing can get to me. Yes, I do have a "shell" now. I've actually worked hard to have one. And its because I think I took way too much risks when I was younger and dumber."<br><br>Sometimes, quite obvious that you're running scared.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Remember though, you took risks that resulted in endings you probably regretted when you were 'younger and dumber'.  I trust you have learnt from your lessons since, right?  You're now 'older and wiser' so it's time to go out and put the lessons you've learnt into practice.<br><br>I look at my parents sometimes and wonder how they can stand each other for so long.  They are quite different but intrinsically, their values are the same and most importantly, their commitment to each other is strong.  To put it this way, divorce is not an option for them.  There were times when one made the other very angry and there'll be some kind of silent war for a while, but in the end, one will eat humble pie and make amends to the other.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think they keep an open mind as well.  When dad first got an interest in singing, he'll belt out Hokkien songs that made me, my brother, and my mom all cringe and go "EEEEeeeeww!" and we'll hole ourselves up in the farthest bedroom, complaining and wishing he'd stop!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now, a few years later, mom slowly warmed up to his karaoke'ing habit and has even joined in!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   They now hold regular karaoke sessions at some karaoke place with their friends and they'll practice now and then at home.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Mom would say dad sings well and dad would say mom is the karaoke 'Queen', I should go and watch her peform!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Thing is, you never know how things will turn out.  Life is always a dynamic continuum.  Sometimes, we'll continue being the person we are now, then suddenly, we experience something life-changing that makes us reconsider and change paths.  When such things happen, hopefully, the partner by our side keeps an open mind about it and accepts the changed us and still decides to travel along the journey of life with us.  Marriage is indeed a journey together and there'll be many many intersections where the two will stand at crossroads and one might want to turn left, the other right, and whether each other goes their separate way or if one compromises and decides to take the unknown new direction because they love and trust their spouse is what determines if a marriage will work or not.<br><br>The thing is, not to be afraid.  Fear paralyses you.  It prevents you from even trying things out in the first place.  The best thing you can do for yourself, Ferret, is to understand yourself, know yourself well.  Get to the point where you know that even if you are alone, you will survive and you can still find some kinda dark humour in the face of utter desolation and despair.  If you can reach this stage, then you are ready for a marriage because it will mean that you are self-sufficient, you are not needy and dependant, but yet, you choose to accept another into your life because you want to, not because you need to.  Having that someone in your life, not as a crutch or safety net, but because you love him and want him to be part of your life.  Then, come what-may, brimestone or hellfire, you'd both WANT to stay together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

It's always good to have 'seniors' you can turn to for advice, should things take a rocky turn.  A lot of divorce happens because the marriage hit some rocks, and both don't know what to do except harbour ill-feelings, contempt, etc.  Sometimes, the couple wants to work things out, but they don't know how to.  Times like these, it's good if the couple has some other couple to turn to for help.  For all you know, the problem is not unique to you but something that's a 'normal' milestone for any married couple.<br><br>Sometimes, if a couple could have just waited things out, somewhere down the road, things just might have been ironed out.  Sometimes, you just need to ride out the storms and you'll find calm and sunshine again.  It doesn't storm all the time.  The trick is to hang on tight when the storms hit and not decide to let go.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if this is an encouragement or discouragement, my parents have been separated (not officially divorce yet) since I was 10 yo and I had a pretty tough childhood because of my parents' failed marriage.  However, I am still willing to take a leap of faith by getting married.  And instead of constantly fearing it'll end up like my parents', I try to learn from the mistakes my parents made.<br><br>Love &amp; Happiness is a choice.  Everything requires effort.  Where there's a will, there's way.<br><br>By hiding yourself in your "shell" or "comfort zone" does not necessarily make you happy either.  Because you can never experience a true relationship (including friendship) as no one gets to know the "real" you and there's no trust.<br><br>So Ferret, if you want to be happy in life (even before thinking about marriage), you need to step out of your "shell" first and learn to establish friendship or relationship with people and have faith in people.<br><br>We might get hurt sometimes but that's life.  If we don't get hurt, we don't grow up and become strong.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferret, I was thinking about what you shared about your guy friend.<br><br>I think sometimes, we might have too romantic a notion about love.  We seldom think of love in terms of a serious commitment towards each other but rather, we always think in terms of the nice stuff that are being done for each other.<br><br>I think some men are not so good at professing their love?  But these men might be those who will quietly go about their commitment with utter devotion and dedication.  You might not receive much fanfare and declaration of love, they won't be the 'showy', expressive type, but they will love you and won't think of leaving you ever.<br><br>Sadly, sometimes, these 'quiet' men are ignored for their more 'flambouyant' and suave brothers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I guess I'm a tad off-topic but I was just thinking of the different aspects of love and how your friend, in his own way, is showing his love.</div>

A shell is akin to a comfort zone. As long as I dont stay out, nothing can get to me. Yes, I do have a "shell" now. I've actually worked hard to have one.

I trust you have learnt from your lessons since, right?  You're now 'older and wiser' so it's time to go out and put the lessons you've learnt into practice.<br></div><div class="quote_body"> Actually all I've learnt is to avoid getting burnt. Which means going all the way out to avoid situations where I could be burnt.<br><br>I once told myself...Never to be bitter and cynical...<br><br>But it seems that as time passes, I have grown even more bitter and cynical. Time and time again, I have been disappointed and wounded. But I hope to be able to arrest it and if possible, correct myself. Because for one very simple reason, I believe life should only be spent in fun and happiness, anything else is an excuse for existence. <br><br>I look at my parents sometimes and wonder how they can stand each other for so long.  They are quite different but intrinsically, their values are the same and most importantly, their commitment to each other is strong.  To put it this way, divorce is not an option for them.  There were times when one made the other very angry and there'll be some kind of silent war for a while, but in the end, one will eat humble pie and make amends to the other.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think they keep an open mind as well.  When dad first got an interest in singing, he'll belt out Hokkien songs that made me, my brother, and my mom all cringe and go "EEEEeeeeww!" and we'll hole ourselves up in the farthest bedroom, complaining and wishing he'd stop!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now, a few years later, mom slowly warmed up to his karaoke'ing habit and has even joined in!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   They now hold regular karaoke sessions at some karaoke place with their friends and they'll practice now and then at home.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Mom would say dad sings well and dad would say mom is the karaoke 'Queen', I should go and watch her peform!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong> Some couples stay together for their children. During my discussion with my friend, he pointed out that life after marriage is no longer about you and him/her. You have got to think about your mutual friends, your extended family and of course, your children. He pointed out that even after love had fizzled out after marriage, people will stay together for the sake of their kids.<br><br>Yes it sounds all...so noble and self sacrificing. But...at the same time, oh so cruel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </strong><br><br>Thing is, you never know how things will turn out.  Life is always a dynamic continuum.  Sometimes, we'll continue being the person we are now, then suddenly, we experience something life-changing that makes us reconsider and change paths.  When such things happen, hopefully, the partner by our side keeps an open mind about it and accepts the changed us and still decides to travel along the journey of life with us.  Marriage is indeed a journey together and there'll be many many intersections where the two will stand at crossroads and one might want to turn left, the other right, and whether each other goes their separate way or if one compromises and decides to take the unknown new direction because they love and trust their spouse is what determines if a marriage will work or not.<br><br><strong>so maybe finding such an "open minded" person could be the key ? I am so confused &gt;.&lt;"</strong><br><br>The thing is, not to be afraid.  Fear paralyses you.  It prevents you from even trying things out in the first place.  The best thing you can do for yourself, Ferret, is to understand yourself, know yourself well.  Get to the point where you know that even if you are alone, you will survive and you can still find some kinda dark humour in the face of utter desolation and despair.  If you can reach this stage, then you are ready for a marriage because it will mean that you are self-sufficient, you are not needy and dependant, but yet, you choose to accept another into your life because you want to, not because you need to.  Having that someone in your life, not as a crutch or safety net, but because you love him and want him to be part of your life.  Then, come what-may, brimestone or hellfire, you'd both WANT to stay together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong> I am alone. I had survived. I have twisted sense of humour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sigh. I like the "part of your life".

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferret, sometimes looking back at the relationships in my life, I see all the love found... love lost, and I wondered how I could've survived all that, but somehow, with the help of a few loving friends, I did.  There were certainly points in my life where I was so full of sorrow and despair, I felt that life was hopeless and the thought did occur to me to snuff it all out.<br><br>I can't say that I'm totally not cynical.  I'd be lying if I said that I came out of all those broken relationships unscathed.  A few of my close friends who know me well know how cynical I can get.  Rose-tinted glasses?  Smashed to smithereens donkey years ago!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I'm not proud of my cynicism, but it helps me not be so naive anymore.  In a sense, it's sorta my own thwarted version of being 'worldly-wise'.  I am definitely a more cautious person, and it will definitely take much more to convince me of the true intentions of a person who approaches me, and sometimes, I do wonder if anyone will hang around long enough to melt my heart.<br><br>I'm an introvert, I get uncomfortable in big groups, I'm cold and aloof until I am comfortable with someone, I make judgements too quickly sometimes, and I can be very extreme in my views.  I'm also working on a few fear issues and breaking away from my comfort pod in Singapore has given me a chance to breathe and be free and try to stop fearing so many things.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  To make it worse, I have a sense of humour that can be quite dark and cryptic and like what one of my close friends said, not everyone might appreciate that.  Makes me wonder if I can actually meet that someone who can see through all that muck and appreciate what little good I have in me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Despite it all though, I somehow still harbour hope.  I look around at the true friends that I am blessed with, and I realise that maybe, I'm not such a bad person afterall cause these people did stick with me!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   PHEW!   In the meantime though, instead of sitting around waiting for someone to choose to be with me, I'm going about making plans as a single who wants to lead a fulfilling and fruitful life.  I can't say it's easy, because you do have to handle the demons of loneliness and despair sometimes, but you have to keep going, keep chugging along, just keep up the momentum.<br><br>I've learnt tons from my failed relationships.  I'm not sure though, that in the next relationship that comes along, I won't commit the same errors.  Hell, I daren't even think that the next relationship might be THE relationship because I'm scared of dealing with the possibility that it might not be THE relationship AGAIN.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   I'm not even sure that I will ever end up being married even if I met the right one, because I am, to a large extent, commitmentphobic and not to forget, cynical!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I guess when it comes to life and relationships, we just do what we can.  We might not end up living life the 'conventional' way.  Hell, we might not even end up in a relationship / marriage in the 'conventional' sense, but we do what works for us, and for that significant other in our lives.<br><br>I may be cynical, etc, but I'm sure that amongst the tens of millions who are treading on Planet Earth, there'll be someone with a complementary sense of humour cryptic enough to see the humour in my grouchiness and cynicism and not be bogged down by it but instead see through my cynicism to realise that hey, I'm just like any other female, desiring love, but just a tad afraid at the same time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sometimes we trudge, sometimes we run, no matter what, we always move forward...<br></div>
