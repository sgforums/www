My hubby and I had been going out for 5 years plus 12 mths engagement before we got married.  We will be celebrating our 2nd anniversary in Sept this year.  However, if you ask me whether I know everything about my hubby after being together for so long, I would still say no.<br><br>While I know him very well generally, there are always new things to learn about each other, especially during certain circumstances.  So, it's important in a relationship not to make too many assumptions thinking that you know your partner so well that you stop making any effort in knowing him better.<br><br>I think it will help when you look at your partner not just as your partner (to have sex with you, to provide for you etc) but also your best friend and soul mate.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Do you imagine being with him for the next 50 years ?<br><br>Can you ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferret, I think that in marriage, there's no guarantee that it will definitely work out.  Like several others have mentioned in here, it is a great leap of faith that a couple takes, because they love each other and want to commit to each other.  They do not know if the union will work for sure, but they love each other enough to want to put in their best effort and hope that the marriage endures for the rest of their lives.<br><br>Sometimes, you just need to stick your head out, despite all the uncertainties.  You can keep your head safely tucked in your shell, like a tortoise, but all you'll see will be darkness within the confines of your own tiny shell.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>If you stick out your head tentatively, you might see blinding light, or you might see beautiful colours, then depending on whether you choose to dwell and face the blinding light or the beautiful colours, you'll end up sticking your head with your eyes shut tight to keep out the glare, or with your eyes wide open, to enjoy the brilliant colours for what they are worth.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sure you'll risk getting your head chopped off or eaten up but would you rather die in darkness, forever wondering about the what-could-have-been's or would you rather have cherished that precious moment where you saw the brilliant colours?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The dynamics between a couple cannot be scientifically analysed and guaranteed.  There's no tried and tested formula that guarantees that a marriage will work.  But I do feel that you have to know yourself well first so that you know what you are looking for, what would work best with you, what you can tolerate, and what you can't.<br><br>Even then, armed with a list of what you want, you might just meet someone who doesn't fulfill what's on  your list anyways, but somehow, you just 'click' with him, and you both somehow make up for each other's shortcomings and complement each other perfectly.<br><br>I do think, though, that some sort of pre-marital counselling like those offered in churches, is important because it sets the groundwork and forces the couple to get away from the lovey-dovey mode to tackle real-life issues like finances, taking care of the in-laws, parenting, etc head-on.<br><br>Ferret, there seems to be a lot of fear in you.  But we're all resilient - even if a relationship / marriage fails, we will somehow manage to pick ourselves up after grieving over it, shake off the dust, and move on.  Do not be afraid of failures because if you fear failure too much, you won't even begin to tread the path of life and experience the good and bad that life has in store for you!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
