            <div class='col-md body'>Like I mentioned in my response, even after I have said yes, I am not going to walk down the aisle the next day.  The engagement period will be at most 12 months (to prepare for the wedding) and that's the time to get to know him at the next level.  I still get a chance to break the engagement if I have to.<br><br>Do you know many people break up during their engagement period, after being together for more than 5 years?  Engagement period can be the most stressful and trying time for the couple so if one can survive that, one will make more effort later in overcoming crisis in the marriage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If that someone is someone you can love, and that he/she love you in return, then 50 years is too short! By love, I mean one puts the other first, and have mutual respect and trust for each other.<br><br>It takes a lifetime to know another person. No matter how much time we have, there is always something we do not know. I think it's more important to ask ourself if we are ready to love another person and to be responsible for another person's trust he/she has placed in you. Perhaps if we can constantly remember the vows we take, to love another for better and for worse, then we are ready.</div>

Marriage is more of an art, not a science.  The best answer is:  you'll know when the time comes.<br><br>You know, we are often fearful.  Often, its because we look at the empty half of the glass.  Sometimes, we should look at the filled half of the glass and realise that lots of marriages do work too.<br><br></div>
