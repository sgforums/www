              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and they'll either be busy injuring each other and themselves. + they'll detroy your fishing and camping gear. + they'll be whining their heads off for being made to leave their precious xbox</span></p>
              <p>I want to tickle them and play with them ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you can find time between their turns of creating havoc and crying for attention</span></p>
              <p>I want to video tape their first steps ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">normally they will tkae their first steps out of sight of their father?</span></p>
              <p>I want to sit them on my shoulders and bring them go gai gai
              ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">hope there will be no warm flow of lliquid or semi liquid.... Or that they don't pull out your remaining hair</span></p>
              <p>I want to bring them camping, fishing, hiking ...</p>
              <p>I want to give them prep talks during their teenage years
              ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and then spend the time worrying and trying to pull them out of the messes they get involved in, hopefully nothing major</span></p>
              <p>I don't want to down down a beach at sunset holding hands with
              dearling when we are both grey-haired .... I want a swarm of
              children and grand children in front of us too .....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given the trend of birth rates, and the increasing late marraige + procreation ages, might be rather hard.....</span></p>
