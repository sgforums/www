              <p>the PM don't encourage ppl to have private health insurance?
              what sort of crap is that?</p>
              <p>Met my friend who was back from melbourne for a hol .. and he
              told me a sad news, that his dad passed away earlier in the year..
              due to a human error in melbourne public hospital .. died of OD ..
              (his dad got a stroke and had a blood clot in his blood, so needed
              to take med to thin blood)</p>
              <p>the hospital admitted that it was their fault, they can issue my
              friend with a letter of apology, but if they want monetary
              compensation, they have to sue.</p>
              <p>You know what's best? The hospital told my friend that its
              useless, because the dad is worthless, as he can't move freely, he
              can't support his dependents, he is not independent..!!!!</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Can't actually say don't encourage but the PM is not giving enough incentive for people to take up health insurance.  Under the previous PM, everyone who earns more than $50K and doesn't have private health insurance would have to pay higher Medicare levy.</p>
              <p>After the Rudd government took over, he increased the limit to $75k.  So more people under the pay bracket can get away from having private health insurance.  This is not a smart move as the public hospitals are already under a lot of pressure, close to "bursting".</p>
              <p>I am sorry to hear about your friend's dad.  Yes, I have read a few of these deadly errors in hospital on the news.  It's all because the hospitals are so understaffed.  Doctors and nurses are overworked.  There are few cases of young doctors (still on training) committed suicide because of the stress.  This is how bad it is.</p>
              <p>So yes, it's not a very pretty situation with our health system here.  That's why it's very important to take up private health insurance.  At least when you are sick, you can go to private hospital without going broke.</p>

              <p>There are not enough chicken sexors in Oz... that's why my FIL is still working even though he's 71 and he's supposed to be semi-retired....</p>
              <p>I have seen him do it once many years ago before hubby and I were married.  Some local farmers brought some ducklings over for him to sex.</p>
              <p>Hubby was telling me that when he was young they constantly got prank calls from kids asking if he wanted to have sex with their chickens.  It was hilarious for me but I don't think hubby appreciated it.</p>
              <p>My FIL had to go back to South Australia this week to do another batch of chicks because the last batch was killed in the truck during delivery as there wasn't enough ventilation.</p>

              <p>orchard road was so bad yesterday, when I was crossing over to shaw centre, the human traffic actually paused for a while because there were so many people both coming and going it was impossible to move. and then people started moving sidesways amongst the cars and the main junction. dangerous but that was the only way to move forward!</p>
