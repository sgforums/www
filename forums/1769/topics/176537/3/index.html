            <div class='col-md body'>the best soln is to avoid both.<br><br>most of the nutritional studies fall generally into 2 categories:<br>1) population-based. they recruit randomised volunteer and monitor their physiology over time while recording their food intake patterns.<br><br>2) in animal models like mice or using cells culture in the lab to test the effect of a compound.<br><br>both methods have pros and cons. method 1 can identify major trends in a population over time but it cannot tell us why this food is good or bad for us. method 2 <strong>might be</strong> able to tell us why but the problem is the dosage of the food is hard to extrapolate from mice to humans. furthermore, if cells are used instead, normal the scientists will over-dosage the food which makes interpretation of the data doubtful. this explains why there are often conflicting benefits/harm over the same kind of food.<br><br>in short, there are many genes that are responsible for the metabolizing and production of cholestrol in our body. 0.1% of our DNA are different from each other (which causes us to look different) and this small difference is by no means small. this difference can have a big difference in each individual in digesting and absorbing fats from food which explains why some ppl have normal cardio measurements even with bad eating habits and vice versa. right now, it is technically possible to screen everyone on earth for his/her genes but the cost and time is unbelievably high, so we will never know are we the lucky ones having "better" genes or not. furthermore, we also do not understand completely all the genes involved in digestion and metabolism too. while this day is not here yet, the best advice is reduce saturated fat and trans fat intake.<br><br>on the other hand, i acknowledge the fact that fat containing food tastes better becos our tongue and brain is evolved to prefer such foods. it is becos for the sake of survival, our body will tend to prefer food that contain high calories to store energy in case we can't hunt for food regularly. however, the development of agriculture has made food production efficient and the industrial evolution has reduced brawny work but our body does not evolve fast enough to the change in our environment. so we are going against nature by rejecting fatty food  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , what an irony!!!</div>

Sherling22, that's a very interesting take on this issue!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It's true that each individual exhibits different abilities to metabolise cholesterol.  There was an article in the Life section of our local paper a few years ago that discussed this very issue.  They highlighted that each person's liver has varying capabilities of fat metabolisation so you can have two individuals tucking into high-cholesterol food daily, but whilst one may suffer from high cholesterol levels, the other may not suffer from any effects whatsoever.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Kept telling me his body have like less than 6% fat. (But when we went to US together, he was freeezing his butt off)<br><br>I'm very in touch with my sins when it comes to food. Hedonism is the way to go - die, I mean. Afterall, we're all going to die one day, and there's a huge myriad of probabilities what we are going to die of. My friends and I say, let's just all suffer from food-related illnesses, and eventually we can all be warded together and chit chat till we drop off dead.<br><br>Then again, I do have some masochistic friends who will gulp down that alfafa or watever smiling happily and declaring their love affair with HEALTHFOODS only.</div>
