Don't Worry, Be Happy (Bobby McFerrin)</strong><br>McFerrin creates his music using his vocal range of four octaves and by tapping on his chest to make the bass sounds; he also sang the theme song to the "Cosby Show."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In every life we have some trouble. When you worry you make it double </span><br><br><strong>5. Everybody Wang Chung Tonight (Wang Chung)</strong><br>Originally called Huang Chung (Chinese for "perfect pitch" ); the band also claims "Wang Chung" is a sound make by strumming a guitar; named 3rd worst song ever by Blender magazine and VH1.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Across the nation, around the world. Everybody have fun tonight</span><br><br><strong>4. Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Wham!)</strong><br>Song is based on a note left in George Michael's hotel room one night from band mate Andrew Ridgeley; popularity soared with the MTV showing the band wearing "Choose Life" t-shirts.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jitterbug into my brain. Goes a bang bang bang till my feet do the same</span><br><br><strong>3. Greatest Love of All (Whitney Houston)</strong><br>Originally recorded by George Benson in 1977; one of several hit singles off her 1985 debut album; considering Houston's current state of life, the song's themes of self-preservation and dignity might seem ironic; mocked in "Coming to America" and "Say Anything."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity</span><br><br><strong>2. Hip To Be Square (Huey Lewis and the News)</strong><br>Band was composed of backup musicians for Elvis Costello and Van Morrison; several other band tunes -- "Heart of Rock and Roll" and "I Want A New Drug" -- barely missed inclusion on this list.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't tell me that I'm crazy. Don't tell me I'm nowhere. Take it from me. It's hip to be square.</span><br><br><strong>1. We Are The World (USA For Africa)</strong><br>It was the best of the 80s ... it was the worst of the 80s. Originally intended by Harry Belafonte to feature only black musicians; recorded same night as American Music Awards in 1985 to assure artists were available; eighth consecutive year that a Lionel Richie song reached No. 1. Sure, the song was for a good cause. But it wasn't even as good as "Feed The World" by the British artists, from which the idea was stolen. As one reader said, "We had to sing that at a school concert and it haunts me to this day."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">It's true we'll make a better day. Just you and me</span><br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.sptimesphotos.com/blogs/80s/2006/06/80-worst-songs-of-80s-top-10.html" rel="nofollow">Tampa Bay Times</a>)</div>
