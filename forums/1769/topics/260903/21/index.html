            <div class='col-md body'>we're on values?<br><br>*&amp;^$# lah.. to the asswipes up high, the only thing they know about values is the dollar sign..<br><br>let me illustrate:<br><br>BT Â– 15 Jun 2007, p20<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of babies and currencies </span></strong><br><br>THERE has been, to be sure, much hand-wringing about falling birth rates and, at the same time, growing numbers of older people, and their effects on the economy and society, not just in Singapore but across much of the developed world. But establishing a numerical link between fertility and the exchange rate still manages to score for novelty in the heady, rarefied world of academic explorations.<br><br>Economists could, in the same vein, conceivably test statistical relationships between, say, the number of divorces in a country and its interest rates; or between average heights of male adults and the national savings rate. There's probably some study out there linking the amount of annual rainfall to the country's investment level. Clearly, such academic adventures are limited only by the researchers' imagination.<br><br>In any case, as the authors of the paper Fertility &amp; The Real Exchange Rate see it, the link between the two 'seems intuitive' enough. Child-rearing means greater spending and reduced savings, and children in themselves are consumers rather than producers, so having fewer babies means higher national savings.<br><br>If savings rise and investment also falls - due to a smaller population - the current account improves, and the exchange rate typically weakens in response.<br><br>This much seems straightforward - and the links between fertility and savings, investment and the exchange rate, have been well explored in economic literature, the authors (a Berkeley professor and a MAS economist) note. What's different about their paper is - their findings, based on data from 87 countries between 1975 and 2005 - stem from empirical evidence, rather than theory.<br><br>And, even after taking into account the usual reasons why exchange rates move - such as the effects of government policy, trade reforms - they still find that a one-point decline in the fertility rate spells a 0.15 per cent fall in the real exchange rate. The result is plausible and also robust, the authors assert. Clearly, the study is meant to add to the understanding and debate about the profound social and economic impact of what appears to be inevitable, and perhaps irreversible, demographic change in many economies.<br><br>The greying of populations cannot quite be undone, and sensibly, many countries have come around to embrace and harness the potential of the Silver Dollar.<br><br>Meanwhile, governments are trying their darndest to coax the stork, from generous fiscal incentives to pro-family policies, and educated women everywhere are aware enough of the macroeconomic effects of their decisions to have, or not have, a baby. But talk of a weak currency is unlikely to move even the most patriotic to procreate.<br><br>Not that the authors of the fertility paper have any such aims. Any interest in the paper lies solely in its estimates. It's a 'good place to pass the torch to others', they said. Perhaps they might stir interest beyond fellow economists.<br>---------------<br><br>they equate babies with the bloody economy... and all that.. even to currency rates...<br><br>the economy doesn't serve humanity anymore.. humans are just statistics to pad further numbers to be sacrificed to the false god called "economy"<br><br>we make our choices.. ultimately we have to..<br></div>
