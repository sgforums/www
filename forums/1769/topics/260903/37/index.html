It reminds me of Singapore - crowded tiny townhouses with vertical spaces, no gardens nor backyards, blardy 72 townhouses crammed into a small area but will have luxurious finishes and a kitchen equipped with Miele products!  I think, very good investment opportunity but not cheap at A$430K - over 600K a townhouse!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><a href="http://www.rize3121.com.au" rel="nofollow">www.rize3121.com.au</a><br><br>I soooo love the name of that development though!

Also, we are looking for a property  with potential to give a big return and preferably a house with backyard.<br><br>Richmond is close to the city so it will always be expensive and the return will not be as significant as compared to Ringwood since they are now extending the Eastern Freeday which makes the area more attractive.<br><br>BTW, we now have Krispy Kreme in Eastland.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So is it your day off today?</div>
