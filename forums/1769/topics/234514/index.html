He liked a particular hanging lamp. We get that for the living room. The bed was a king size with no footboard cos he has too long legs.  The sofa was changed to another design that means he can lie on it and watch TV comfortably.  Utility room was fitted with a open hanging wardrobe so can hang his uniforms after i luandered &amp; ironed them.  All he has to do. Is to shower, come out of the shower, pick out his clothes and changed &amp; he can be out of the door to work in less then 5 minutes.<br><br>6) Was trying to get my taxi licence, so that.....when times comes when I have to be at home most times to look after the kids at odd hours as a part time housewife.

And get her a maid to clean her house or cook while she minds the kids.  And they are going to be so nearby to her.<br><br>4) 3 room HDB flat, we covered the payments with our CPF in one payment, instead of having to get loan and worry about our jobs to pay for a place to stay.<br><br>5) furnishings are all purchased to his taste. He liked a particular hanging lamp. We get that for the living room. The bed was a king size with no footboard cos he has too long legs.  The sofa was changed to another design that means he can lie on it and watch TV comfortably.  Utility room was fitted with a open hanging wardrobe so can hang his uniforms after i luandered &amp; ironed them.  All he has to do. Is to shower, come out of the shower, pick out his clothes and changed &amp; he can be out of the door to work in less then 5 minutes.<br><br>6) Was trying to get my taxi licence, so that.....when times comes when I have to be at home most times to look after the kids at odd hours as a part time housewife.  I can still drive a taxi to fetch him to and from work, drive the children to and from school, be home to cook for the kids &amp; himself &amp; still earns some pocket money to maintain the taxi and its petrol.</div></blockquote>Wow you must have really loved him.<br><br>For me I think he loves me more than I love him...if there is a way to quantify love.</div>
