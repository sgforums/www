They're known for their devotion to comics and computer games and can easily be identified by their standard outfit of track suit, knapsack and spectacles.<br><br>In the cafes, girls dressed in frilly frocks inspired by comic-book heroines wait hand and foot on customers, mostly male, who might have once been obsessed with naughty schoolgirls and nurses.<br><br>At one cafe, maids get down on their knees to stir the cream and sugar into the customer's coffee.<br><br>At Royal Milk, diners can follow up a meal with a range of grooming services, including ear cleanings.<br><br>Maids at some of the more attentive shops even offer to spoon-feed customers at their table.<br><br>Maid cafes have mushroomed since they first emerged about four years ago, evolving from cafes where waiting staff emulated characters from a popular series of role-playing video games, often dressed in schoolgirl-inspired uniforms.<br><br>Shops where computer-generated characters came to life to serve coffee to gamers have since morphed into establishments serving customers ranging from teens to septuagenarians.<br><br>Akihabara now boasts around 30 maid cafes that cater not just to male geeks but also to couples, tourists and the merely curious.<br><br>FANTASY ESCAPE<br><br>Patronage is also on the rise among young women, some hoping to snag a geek and turn him into Prince Charming in a real-life imitation of last year's hit movie "Train Boy," a love story set in Akihabara that also became a popular TV series.<br><br>"These cafes offer a chance for men oppressed in their daily life to escape into a fantasy world," said social commentator Tomoko Inukai, adding that the phenomenon hardly helped to promote gender equality in a largely male-dominated society.<br><br>For some of the "maids," who are often as keen on comics and games as their customers, the job is a kind of virtual world.<br><br>"Being a maid is all-consuming," said Hinaka, a maid at Royal Milk Cafe who goes only by her first name.<br><br>"I'm not acting like a maid here, I am one."<br><br>Besides serving diners from a menu of inexpensive cafe fare, Hinaka also offers fully clothed massages, and for 9,000 yen ($75) customers can chat with her in a private room cluttered with comic books, character figurines and animation DVDs.<br><br>The average age of the maids at Royal Milk is 20, and an appearance of innocence is a priority.<br><br>"The concept of these cafes, where women who are physically and emotionally immature serve male customers, is not surprising given the fetish for young women among Japanese men," Inukai said.<br><br>Hinaka at Royal Milk gets plenty of stares as she moves around in a black dirndl-inspired pinafore worn over a white shirt, which is tied at the collar with a big ribbon that matches her billowing, short pink skirt.<br><br>"Sitting here and admiring how pretty the girls are is like admiring a flower," said Kinuko Nagahama, a 29-year-old woman sitting alone at the cafe. "If I were a few dress sizes smaller, I'd love to work at a place like this."<br><br>Hair salons in Akihabara are also cashing in on the trend.<br><br>At one such establishment called "Moesham," stylists dressed as maids give shampoos and cuts to a mainly male clientele not intimidated by the salon's decor, which resembles the bedroom of a young girl besotted by hearts and lace.<br><br>A few customers even come three or four times a week for a shampoo, said Yuki Todo, stylist-manager at the shop.<br><br>Yasunori Tomita, a 32-year-old salesman and first-time customer, said, "I don't have a girlfriend at the moment so getting pampered by maids will have to suffice for now."<br><br>...............................................................................................<br><br>I wonder what will they come up with next  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
