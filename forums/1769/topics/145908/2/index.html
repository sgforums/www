Btw, how much do u know abt NCC Education? NCC Education is a worldwide organisation that provides education which can be recognised by lots of university as a professional certificate in diploma of a certain subject. Taking the B.A course offered in Informatics for example... After you complete your Standard Diploma, you'll be given 1 year of exemption to the University of Wales which is one of the very prestigious university in UK and to study from the 2nd year onwards. And the fact that an 'A' level student with straight AAA can only study at the year 1 of university of Wales when he/she enter the university, what does it tells?<br>(Before i continue, I must 1st declare that i am not a student from Informatics. It's just that i was an Educational Consultant [also not from informatics] who knows much abt Qualifications)<br><br>I am not saying that 'A' level are lower or whatsoever, but the fact is that Diplomas are slightly better than 'A' levels as they are professional and specialised subject despite that 'A' level student may have more stress over the years because of SG school system.<br><br><strong>My personal view:</strong><br><br>I am a Diploma holder and i HAVE taken before the Cambridge International Examinations A level in Singapore before. It is really nothing compared to the Diploma i went thru really. I also must admit that GP(A level English, CAE in International form) is really tough and it is one of the most useful thing that ppl in JC went thru.<br><br>Apart from all these, switching back to what the topic starter is asking..."So, imagine that you have both, and you had to fill out a form asking for your 'highest qualification' - which one would you include?"<br><br>I will fill in my highest Qualification as my Diploma even if i holds both the certificate becoz it is a specialised subject, but nvertheless, i will fill in my A level in my 2nd highest education to proof my ability to finish my As.<br><br>My point of view is that companies are looking for professionals regardless of whether did u really took up a course in that sector of the acquiring job... what the employor want to know, is the speciality you had. So.. no doubt its the diploma u've gotten!</div>
