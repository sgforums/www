            <div class='col-md body'>All my life, I have always been thankful that I have very good staff under me, assisting me in every job that I go into.  In my past few jobs, my ex staff and I were like a group of very good teammates, good friends and we help one another like a happy family.  We were very united etc.<br><br>Recently, I went into this job and soon my boss made me in charge of a few staff.  Gosh!  These few staff are trouble makers.  They can definitely work... I mean... in the first place, they went thru interviews and selection before they landed onto this job.  I'm sure they have some good quality.  But somehow, they have damn bad attitude.  My predecessor already complaint like hell about these staff, threatening to sack them and stuff.  When I took over, I face with the same problem.  They damn chao geng!  MC lah... mother sick, father sick, cat sick, pet sick... all kinds of stories and excuses not to come to work or claim a few hours off.  They like to do this mostly on weekends, when they are fully aware (from the time they interview for this job) that they are required to work on Sat and Sun.<br><br>Every weekend, at least one of them will call me to give me some crap story.<br><br>I really dun wish to mention their race, cuz I really really dun want to sound racist.  And I also dun want this thread to become a racist discussion topic.  But one colleague of mine belonging to that same race also suggested that I change this whole team and hire chinese staff only.<br><br>I really dunno why they are like that.  Is it the race?  I don't think so, cuz in my previous job, I also have non chinese staff and they were so hardworking.  Is it their pay too low?  But at least one of them told me that she needs the job &amp; is very afraid to lose the job (but then, she is also one of them who chao geng).  Or is it they are lowly educated?<br><br>I know I have to sack at least 1 person from the team to make things move.  Or maybe I dun need to do that.  I also dunno.  I am just too angry to think clearly right now.  I just hope, by the time I return to office, I am calm enough to talk to them and not shoot off angry words from my mouth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I empathizes you. I face kind of the same problem too.<br><br>I am in a dept where the ones in power wants to be the nice person. Whenever anyone steps out of line with their action, eg. sleeping on the job, talk to gf on the phone, the ones in power would not voice out and reins the person in. In the end, everyone steps over him/her head la.<br><br>This is especially difficult for me as i am sandwiched in the middle as i need to get the employees to produce sufficiently good work on weekly deadlines. Imagine dealing with people who sleeps right in front of you. When you talk to them, they always say 'har' after that. That really pisses me off.<br><br>Does all companies have protocol to follow when dealing with staffs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me give you example of their "patterns" or "actions" in the last few weeks...<br><br>Week1<br>Staff A (<span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">on Fri sms me.  He was on off on Fri but fell sick &amp; was given MC</span></span>) - "I need to shift my off day from Fri to Sunday because I need to go for a blood test."  (since when blood test laboratory works on Sunday one? and since when or which company allows staff to cancel off day/leave to take MC one?)  After that, he insisted on not working on the Sunday by taking another MC.<br><br>Staff B <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">(on a Sat sms me)</span></span> - "Tomorrow (Sunday) I need to take two hours off (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">in advance as she has no more extra hours or Off in lieu to claim</span></span>) to attend to some urgent matters"  When I asked what is the matter, she only said it's family matters.<br><br>Staff C also asked for time off on the same Sunday for some family matters.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I said no to both Staff B and C very sternly.</span></span><br><br>Week2<br>Staff A went on annual leave which I relunctantly approve (cuz my director said ok).<br>Staff B and C no action (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Thank God!</span></span>).<br><br>Week 3 (this weekend)<br>Staff A - This Sunday (ie tomorrow) is his off day.  Today no action<br>Staff B - On annual leave today<br>Staff C (<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">sms me today</span></span>) - "I need to take one or two hours off in advance and will pay back next week (by working extra hours.  Where got such policy one???) My clothes are drenched and I need to go home and change"  I said no.  Then she still defy and sms me saying that she will come in two hours late (full stop).<br><br>I sat down with one of the HODs one day for dinner and she suggested that I sack all three of them.  She's been with the company and saw the problems brought by my present staff.  As I just newly took over, I just told her that I would monitor them for a while before doing anything.</div>

I already told them that urgent leave and no pay leave need doc.  Annual leave subject to approval.<br><br>The Staff C (in my eg above) was on no pay leave on Thurs &amp; Fri even though we were short handed.  She (she's a single parent) said that her mother who is the only person taking care of her child was going to Malaysia, so she really needed to take leave.  She said she could even show documentation to prove that if required.  I felt sorry for her, so I ok her leave.  Then on Thurs, she sms and said her mother suddenly decided not to travel but she will still stick to Thurs &amp; Fri leave.  I was like .... WTF?  But didn't say anything.  Gave her the benefit of the doubt.  But today, she showed pattern again.  I didn't approve and she still went ahead and take off (when she doesn't have any off day to claim and she wanted to claim in advance... WTF!).  This, I have already decided to deduct her pay already.  Told her already, no such thing as Off in advance.  Cuz if everyone in the dept show me this kind of pattern, nobody needs to come to work already.</div>

But if your work requires lots of team work and your staff are ok, then maybe you want to relax a bit with them.  If your staff are like my staff, then I suggest you continue to be stern.  I regret being understanding and now they blatantly taking advantage.  Your job has got deadlines and stuff... so you cannot afford to have your staff take advantage or chao geng.</div>

In my past few jobs, my ex staff and I were like a group of very good teammates, good friends and we help one another like a happy family.  We were very united etc.<br><br>Recently, I went into this job and soon my boss made me in charge of a few staff.  Gosh!  These few staff are trouble makers.  They can definitely work... I mean... in the first place, they went thru interviews and selection before they landed onto this job.  I'm sure they have some good quality.  But somehow, they have damn bad attitude.  My predecessor already complaint like hell about these staff, threatening to sack them and stuff.  When I took over, I face with the same problem.  They damn chao geng!  MC lah... mother sick, father sick, cat sick, pet sick... all kinds of stories and excuses not to come to work or claim a few hours off.  They like to do this mostly on weekends, when they are fully aware (from the time they interview for this job) that they are required to work on Sat and Sun.<br><br>Every weekend, at least one of them will call me to give me some crap story.<br><br>I really dun wish to mention their race, cuz I really really dun want to sound racist.  And I also dun want this thread to become a racist discussion topic.  But one colleague of mine belonging to that same race also suggested that I change this whole team and hire chinese staff only.<br><br>I really dunno why they are like that.  Is it the race?  I don't think so, cuz in my previous job, I also have non chinese staff and they were so hardworking.  Is it their pay too low?  But at least one of them told me that she needs the job &amp; is very afraid to lose the job (but then, she is also one of them who chao geng).  Or is it they are lowly educated?<br><br>I know I have to sack at least 1 person from the team to make things move.  Or maybe I dun need to do that.  I also dunno.  I am just too angry to think clearly right now.  I just hope, by the time I return to office, I am calm enough to talk to them and not shoot off angry words from my mouth.  </div></blockquote>Nah, don't think it's the race.

Eg.  They will work extra hard from Mon to Fri, but Sat and Sun will start showing some problem.  When comes to accuracy in their work -- it really depends on their mood (as far as two of them are concerned).  Sometimes, quarrel with boyfriend, all the work produced will go haywire.</div>
