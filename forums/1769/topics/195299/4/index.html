If you are talking about economy class, I would prefer SIA to emirates anytime. In flight entertainment is better, SIA even got TOP Gear magazine in economy class, more leg room, better selection of beverages and cleaner toilets. If you take emirate to europe you will have to fly via dubai, and transit in dubai is a real hassle, especially going through the security, where you have to take off your shoe, belt etc..<br><br>Their duty free is nothing compared to singapore. both left and right side are bascially selling the same stuff in the reverse order. and most things there are more expensive than what you will get in singapore airport. And there is also lack of space in the airport for you to rest and watch TV. The only plus thing is they always have some exotic cars on display. And they dont have free internet access terminal like in Singapore.  I usually end up at the airline lounge reading papers and drinking beer.<br><br></div>

If you easily get airsick, please avoid this area.<br><br>d) Other problem about this place is are you the first to board and last to leave. Also end up at the back for the queue when you are clearing the custom at the destination airport.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my more amusing flights took place at the height of a spate of gangland killings in Melbourne - mobsters were getting knocked off at a rate of about one per month.  The fellow I was seated next to agreed with me that every dead gangster was a public service, and it was only half an hour later that he revealed that he was a priest who spent his time teaching postgrad theology and philosophy when he wasn't performing more religious duties.  We spent the rest of the flight discussing Kant, Schpenhauer and Nietzsche.</div>

In flight entertainment is better, SIA even got TOP Gear magazine in economy class, more leg room, better selection of beverages and cleaner toilets.

And they dont have free internet access terminal like in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I almost did. On SIA flight. London to Singapore, during take off, one of the left engine of the 747 catch fire. pilot made an emergency brake from take off speed and plane has to stop in the middle of the runway. Fire engine surronded the plane for an hour before we were evacuated.<br><br>if the fire has broke out 30 sec later, our plane could have been airbound and we could have crash and burst into flame...<br><br></div></blockquote>That's a bit of an exaggeration.<br><br>A fully laden 747 is perfectly capable of taking off and climbing out (albeit at reduced performance) with an engine out. This is an FAA requirement--all multii-engined commercial aircraft have to demonstrate adequate take-off performance with an engine inoperative, to be certified for operation in US airspace.<br><br>If the engine failure occurs after "decision speed" (known as V1 in aviation parlance), the pilot continues with the take-off and retrims the aircraft for a three-engine climbout. At this point, most airline operational procedures call for fuel to be dumped overboard to bring the aircraft's weight down below the maximum landing weight, and an expedited (not emergency) landing to be performed.<br><br>If the engine failure occurs before V1 (as it most likely did in your scenario), standard procedure is to abort the take-off. When the flight crew calculate the performance numbers prior to the flight, runway length requirements are determined <span style="font-style: italic;">based on an aborted takeoff at V1,</span> so there's no question as to having adequate runway length to safely stop the aircraft.<br><br>Fire containment and suppression systems on modern turbofan powerplants have advanced to the point where uncontained and sustained engine fires are almost unheard of. I'm willing to bet that what you experienced was a relatively rare phenomenon called compressor stall, wherein airflow into the engine is disturbed or interrupted, causing the turbine to essentialy backfire and throw some flame out the jetpipe. A compressor stall prior to V1 would have resulted in an engine shutdown and aborted take-off.<br><br>So, to sum it up, in your scenario, if the "fire" had occurred 30 seconds after take-off, it's hightly doubtful you would have "crashed and burst into flame." Also, if the passengers didn't deplane for a full hour after the 747 rolled to a stop, the "emergency" couldn't have been that serious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
