              <p>ok. went there today. easy to find. since along ubi ave 2 only one pair of bus stops have coffee shops at both bus stops. near paya lebar, not eunos link. the bus stop where the buses are going towards tampines, as per acid info.</p>
              <p> old lady still doing the hard work of blanching the noodles. but got helper (maybe her son, dunno) doing the rest of the stuff and collecting money.</p>
              <p>for SGD 2.50, it's fine.<img alt=""> good value for money, but not fantastic. they have a short queue and i waited only 5-10 min, but there are longer queues at various coffeeshops along the ubi ave 2. in fact. there was a pretty long queue for some fish soup shop at a coffeeshop i walked past, and also a long queue for SGD 2.50 char siew rice at a small coffeeshop at the ubi ave 1 area.</p>

              <p>for lunch, i went to Lavendar FC. ate the famous wanton mee. but not very tasty.$3.50 only 2 wanton which were insipid, some slices of the pink coloured pork, the usual miserly greens and average amount of mee which had a bit of a instant noodle taste and feel to it. not worth the money.</p>
              <p>oso tried the beef noodle stall, but only beef balls cos dont like beef spare parts (and i always get wrong whenever i order beef so i now stick to beef balls only. hawker cannot mess that one up). the beef balls were very normal, so i guess the stall is only famous for the beef and parts not for beef balls. for beef balls, i think i will stick with the FengShan FC stall. the hand-made beef balls are way larger and crunchier.</p>
              <p>btw, razor tv was out filming the FC. very funny thing happen, when they try to video the boss of the beef noodle stall, he take cover.</p>
              <p>so overall, nothing for me at Lavendar FC. i dont need to ever go there again.</p>
              <p> queue wise, both stalls about 10 min wait.</p>
