            <div class='col-md body'>For a very long time I have held the belief that nothing in this life happens by chance. We make our own choices... but somehow fate would lead us to that certain path or crossroad that maybe was predetermined. It's easy to say that the experiences in ones' life is brought about by past activities... but the Universal Law of Cause and Effect is greater than we would first believe, or even begin to understand.<br><br>According to this Law, every action, every thought and every fragment of an imagination would bring about a reaction. We are thus governed perpetually by our Consciousness... that is, once something invades our mind, nothing can ever slip us by or simply disappear. Caught up as we are in our own little private 'bubble', we may find this hard to comprehend. When denial sets in, there is a missing 'link' or a void that we experience; due to the seperation of the consciousness and our selves. In reality and in the higher echelons of consciousness... there is no void, and time ceases to exist.<br><br>Reactions to past thoughts and actions become our fate, destiny and karma. Our fates are simply the reactive effects of choices remembered by our soul. The personality often doesn't see beyond its own life for sources of current conditions, especially if the resulting effect is negative.<br><br>Perhaps this is why I feel that the people we encounter in our everyday lives influence the choices that we make to a very great extent. They can be our neighbours, our friends, our lovers, our parents... an acquaintance, or even the person who sat beside you on the bus earlier. For this reason alone - I would never view people whom I know online as "strangers secure in the anonymity of the cyber-world". Whilst its true that we may not be able to readily believe or bring close to heart what we cannot see in person... I do believe that behind every word posted, every hug and emotion encompassed in a tiny icon - there is a living, breathing being, and he / she would somehow feature (if they haven't already) in our lives; even for a while.<br><br>I do believe that our thoughts make things happen.<br><br>What you believe, is what you achieve...<br>What you imagine - is what you become.</div>

You can choose to make the best out of a bad situation and to share your joys with others.

Because one day, you might just get it.<br><br>Without hope, one is just someone who is caught along the drift of life. Who waits to be swallowed up one day in this great river. And then what ?<br><br>Death may or may not be the final end. What comes then ?<br><br>So many people are contented to just quietly pass their days. Day in, day out, work, work, work.
