            <div class='col-md body'>On June 3rd, 1998, in Eschede, Germany, a high-speed train had wheels that came off the track.  The cars got coupled just as they were passing under a bridge.  The cars slammed into the pillars of the bridge, and then, when the bridge gave way, more than 200 tons of concrete poured onto the carriages.<br><br>Heavy cranes had to be called in to remove the debris and all...<br><br>Shockingly, the driver in the locomotive wasn't even aware of the train crash and he continued driving till the next stop, when he suddenly realised that he had lost ALL the carriages!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Biangz... talk about blur bloke!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
