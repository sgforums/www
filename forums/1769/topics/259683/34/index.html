Most can still be salvage.<br><br>Dont worry too much about the return of some gifts from your mother's side,  you can still do that returning stuffs on your actual tea ceremony day.<br><br>I think most traditions requires that when the guy goes over to the gals house to bring the bride home to her mother's place, he still has to bring some gifts, like maybe a roast pig, some oranges and some more angbaos.<br><br>What you can do, is after the tea ceremony at your mothers, you return to your husband's home, to bring some of the items that was not originally returned on the 'guo da li' ceremony back to your husband's home as 'dowry'.  That is traditionally okay.  So dont fuss too much.<br><br>I am sorry you werent happy on your ROM.  It reads like you got too many people at the ROM and they were inconsequential people being 'indian chiefs' at your big day?<br><br>Well, I hope you are happier at the honeymoon.  Why dont you consider going to the ROM at your honeymoon location and any other locations you visit with your hub and do your vows again?<br><br>I remember long time ago, SBC actors Chen Zhi Chai &amp; Xiang Yun, after they ROM in Singapore, honeymoon in Vegas USA and did their vows again at Vegas.  They were saying they are going to do it at every country they visit.  So...if they ever think about divorce, the hassle of divorcing in every country of the world is most likely make they dont want to divorce liao.<br></div>

They had to be sent to the hospital to make sure that their injuries weren't all that bad.<br><br>Anyway, the Chinook was for heli-insertion.... the entire battalion was inserted at an LZ a few kliks away from the objective. We then had to walk the rest of the way through extremely dense foliage in the darkness through undulating terrain... it was pure torture for us NSmen who haven't been doing this sort of thing in years.<br><br>Not sure if I can say exactly where the LZs are, though.
