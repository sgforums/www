Then when LDs were becoming obsolete due to the advent of DVDs, stores were closing them out at steep discounts--LDs that used to go for the standard price of $30 were being liquidated at well under $10, and you could even find them for under $5 at some chains. That's when I really stocked up on them!<br><br>I'm currently sitting on over 400 LDs, most of which are in boxes in the garage. The player is still operational, though, as I use it to play music CDs and the occasional LD.</div>

That is traditionally okay.  So dont fuss too much.<br><br>I am sorry you werent happy on your ROM.  It reads like you got too many people at the ROM and they were inconsequential people being 'indian chiefs' at your big day?<br><br>Well, I hope you are happier at the honeymoon.  Why dont you consider going to the ROM at your honeymoon location and any other locations you visit with your hub and do your vows again?<br><br>I remember long time ago, SBC actors Chen Zhi Chai &amp; Xiang Yun, after they ROM in Singapore, honeymoon in Vegas USA and did their vows again at Vegas.  They were saying they are going to do it at every country they visit.

            <div class='col-md body'>i can't relate to any one of them..<br><br>but i do look to Logan from the X-Men as someone who everyone should emulate...<br><br>a dark past he is trying to make good on, a darkness in his soul he tries to control.. and a nobility even when he isn't the slickest of people...<br><br>there was an Annual where the X-Men were put to the test.. which they didn't know about.. as each succumbed to the trap which gave them their hearts' desires, he alone kept going.. until the ultimate prize was given to him...<br><br>he would become like a god... able to change everything and anything to his wishes..<br><br>he thought hard about it.. was tempted.. and rejected it... "I could be like God... but... I ain't God... I hate people messing with me, and I cannot mess with anyone"<br><br>that prize was also a trap.. which the other races in the universe could not resist and from there, their evolution stopped... he was the saviour of Mankind but no one knows it..<br><br>it was said later by the students of Xavier's.. "He looks over humanity like he does over us.."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, on my part Peter Parker's life kinda mirrors my own a lot.<br><br>Always getting picked on by the jackasses in school, constantly bullied, ostracised, academically sound but often lost in the background, constantly doubts himself and his own abilities.... I see a lot of me in him.<br><br>And in spite of all the crap that's been thrown his way... he chooses to just grin and bear with it. Regardless of the amount of pressure he's under, he would choose to cope with it with a strong, brave front coupled with a wisecrack or two. That's something I can really learn from him.<br><br>One of his quotes particularly resonates with me: 'When life hands you a lemon, squirt it in someone else's eye and run like heck.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Note that I said that I identify with <span style="font-style: italic;">Peter Parker</span> and not <span style="font-style: italic;">Spider-Man</span>.... simply put, I find it hard to relate with some dude in tights who can crawl up walls and shoot webs.</div>
