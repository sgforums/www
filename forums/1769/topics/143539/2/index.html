'UAT'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>'UAT' stands for 'User Acceptance Testing'.<br><br>"UAT is typically the final phase in a software development process in which the software is given to the intended audience to be tested for functionality. UAT is either done by making the software available for a free trial, typically over the Internet, or by using an in-house testing panel comprised of users who would be using the product in real-world applications. UAT is done in order to get feedback from users to make any final adjustments to the programming before releasing the product to the general public.<br><br>"UAT also is called beta testing, end-user testing or application testing.<br></span><br><br>Taken from <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/U/UAT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/U/UAT.html</a>.</div>

In fact I was one of those lucky few that received $50 for using online filing last year. You might not see the benefit, but IRAS has already managed to save lots of money by not employing part-timers to sort out those hundreds of thousands IRAS forms.<br><br>Actually you could just tell IRAS that you have already send the IRAS form by mail and that the mail must has got lost during posting. that was the excused I i used the last time, and like you said, those girls  OTC didnt make it difficult for me.<br><br>The moral of the story here is, do your IRAS online filing early and save everybody the inconvience.<br><br></div>
