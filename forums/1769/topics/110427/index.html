            <div class='col-md body'>This morning i went to IMM with my bf. It was raining since early morning and was quite cold in IMM. However, when we entered one of the mattress store, we felt that it was warm there. So my bf juz jokingly said," Is it something wrong with the air-con here? It is pretty warm." There were 2 men in the store, one young and the other middle aged. The young man raised his head and said," it must be something wrong with ur body temperature!" and the middle aged," maybe u got fever!"<br><br>Both of us were very shocked with their reaction. I was "qin cai" and kept quiet. My bf was very upset with the way they replied and asked," what is the problem? We are just asking a simple question. Shouldn't u guys be a bit polite to ur customers?" The middle aged kept quiet and the young one said,"what is ur problem." And then he walked over to us and came very close to us, with that kind of look" want to fight, is it?!" His body language definitely made my bf even pissed off. my bf is a small size guy, but he is not afraid of this kind of situation. He did not step back and he asked the guy on the face instead," hey, we are the customers, and i dun think we've done anything wrong so far. Why must u be so unfriendly?" The young guy did not say anything much but still appreared aggressive.  I dragged my bf out of the store. i could sense he was super angry already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> . and i dun want him to get into any trouble.  Even after we walked out of the store, the young guy still appeared aggressive and for a few times, my bf nearly turned back to the store again... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>We both left the place. my bf felt that was something about man's pride and i should not stop him. He said he never take this kind of shit at all...I told him that i juz find that it is not worth fighting with this kind of "ah beng" and spoil our day like that. He listened to me and cooled down...15 mins later, he felt better and agreeded that i was right to stop him. However, i became quite moody ever after that...i was wondering, should i support him or stop him at that moment when someone is challenging him like that?<br><br>It is new year's day today, but i dun enjoy at all...i myself also very upset with the guys in the store...it is located in IMM Jurong, #02-104, mattress store...i will never ever buy things from them and with the attitude like that, i dun think they will earn money... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We should start a new trend of thought.  The complaints 'system' is already very much established here but how about paying more attention to rewarding and praising service staff who are really polite, very helpful and actually make our day?<br><br>The way the situation stands now, there is a huge 'punishment' for bad, lousy service but not much of a reward for staff who go out of their way to provide good service to customers.  It's like always having a cane in the house for deterrance and punishment but not having any sweets nor treats for rewards.  Both good and bad ought to be duly addressed.  (Remember our Sociology lectures?)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Fennymouse, don't let this ruin your day.  Remember how my mom tried to ruin my b'day but I took a deep breath, stopped crying after about 5 mins and told myself aloud that this is my special day and I shall not let anyone ruin it regardless?  Well, it's not worth letting folks like them spoil your New Year.  So, chin up and celebrate!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
