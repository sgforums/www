              <p>People here in Phuket, especially the kids were staring at my shaved head at the supermarket.</p>
              <p>Went to Tesco Lotus Phuket Thailand last night to buy groceries.</p>
              <p>Adults at first got a shock, but they can pretend to look away at something.</p>
              <p>But kids...their reactions is 'play play at the supermarket trolley, looks up, stunned!'  Got a few babies or kids their eyes really follow me whenever I move the trolley.</p>
              <p>its pretty common for schools boys in thailand to have their head shaved, but a middle age female with shaved head is rare.</p>

Something that<br><span> </span>the Singapore government or media will try to hide from the rest of the<br><span> </span>world. And this is the lives of 80 percent of 'true' Singaporeans who live<br><span> </span>in the republic's Housing Development Board (low cost) flats.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>I, like many young youths, went looking for a better future in this Lion<br><span> </span>City of opportunity, After four years of working experience in <span id="lw_1247022579_8" style="cursor: hand;"><span class="yshortcuts">Kuala Lumpur</span></span>.<br><span> </span>It was my first experience outside Malaysia and I was very happy to be<br><span> </span>offered a job in Singapore with a basic salary of S$3,500.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>Then, with huge hopes, I started looking for a master bedroom to rent being<br><span> </span>single. I finally got a master bedroom in Clementi for S$700 a month but<br><span> </span>only after being rejected by many other landlords for being Indian. The<br><span> </span>ensuing eight- month ordeal that I spent in this HDB flat really opened my<br><span> </span>mind to what Singapore is for those who can't earn.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>It made me ask if this is the type of development that I ever wanted in my<br><span> </span>country Malaysia. This is the first time that I felt gifted to be born in<br><span> </span>Malaysia. Anyway, I lived with a family of three (husband, wife with one<br><span> </span>daughter) who rented out their master bedroom to me while they slept in the<br><span> </span>common room.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>It was a three-room flat (but unlike in Malaysia, a three-room flat has only<br><span> </span>two bedrooms). I did not believe it was the master bedroom that I was<br><span> </span>staying in until I went into the other room and saw that there is no<br><span> </span>attached bathroom there. I was given a bed and a mattress and also two fans.<br><span> </span>Then I noticed that the couple with their daughter sleeping on the floor<br><span> </span>with a thin mattress in the other room. Not even a fan in that room.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>Both husband and wife are born Singaporeans and were employed. It was after<br><span> </span>one month that I realised that the daughter was not going to school<br><span> </span>regularly and most of the time there would be a quarrel in the early morning<br><span> </span>between the father and daughter as there was not enough money to pay for the<br><span> </span>bus to go to school.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>There were times when the daughter was very sick and father had no money to<br><span> </span>take her to see a doctor. It was a real pain in the heart to hear a small<br><span> </span>girl suffering through the thin walls of this HDB flat. It was unbelievable<br><span> </span>for me to see this happening in this ultra-modern city. It took me another<br><span> </span>two months to realise that what was happening in this flat was not an<br><span> </span>isolated case of urban poverty in Singapore.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>It was every where in those HDB flats. There was a Chinese neighbour (an<br><span> </span>elderly man) and his son had no money to get a taxi to send his father to<br><span> </span>the clinic for daily diabetic wound-dressing. I soon understood that poverty<br><span> </span>in Singapore transcends racial boundaries. The whole family of my landlord<br><span> </span>got a shock that I own a car in Malaysia.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>My landlord would keep pestering me every time I come back to Malaysia to<br><span> </span>bring my car over so that his whole family could go sightseeing in<br><span> </span>Singapore. In all my life, I never believed people in a developed country<br><span> </span>like Singapore would ever consider car ownership a privelege.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>Three months later, one fine day, I came back home and realised that there<br><span> </span>was no electricity in the house. This time, my landlord did not have the<br><span> </span>money to pay for the utility bills. I was back in the Stone Age, using<br><span> </span>candles. This lasted for days until finally he borrowed money from somewhere<br><span> </span>and settled the bills.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>My landlord as a person I have known during that period never come back<br><span> </span>drunk or looked like a gambler. He had to pay for his mother's medical<br><span> </span>expenses, that much I know. This was the time in my life when I learned what<br><span> </span>is was like to live in that poor quality HDB flat, drying clothes in the<br><span> </span>rooms and listening to what the couple talked about in the next room via the<br><span> </span>thin walls.<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>It was this time in life that made me to think, 'Is this what I want<br><span> </span>Malaysia to be? For those who talk great or look up to Singapore's success,<br><span> </span>have they ever come and lived in Singapore like I how I did? Have you seen a<br><span> </span>HDB flat and how it looks like?<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>Bring your whole family for a dinner using public transport and then rush to<br><span> </span>catch the last bus. Is this what a 10% growth rate a year is about that we<br><span> </span>want boast? Does this growth figures mean anything in the first place? Do we<br><span> </span>want to open our country to expats so that they can progress at the expense<br><span> </span>of our own Malaysians?<br><span> </span><br><span> </span>Do we want to 'progress' to a level that even our children can't buy a house<br><span> </span>in our own land? Last, I ask myself. Do we Malaysians look at GDP growth as<br><span> </span>the only measure to choose our government or are we much more matured than<br><span> </span>that? Achievement at whose expense?</span></p>

              <p>Actually, 2nd generation PRs have to do NS. So even if the fella were to maintain the status quo, his sons would have to serve NS if they were to take up PR status.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I kinda agree with the gist of the story - there are plenty of incentives for foreigners to come here, but there is no clear and distinct incentive for being Singaporean.</p>
              <p>On my part, I still get all riled up when I see foreign students getting heavy subsidies in uni when half of them are seriously a bunch of screwballs.....</p>
